Another Armslister passed on this info for me!  Thank you for the information! 

this gun is a copy of a Tingle single shot pistol, the original tingles , made in the 60's and 70's were super quality Blackpowder pistols., ASM is Armi San Marco, who made fair quality copies of them in 45 cal and 28 gauge smoothbore, they had a fair amount of sales, through different importers through the 90's, original tingles can bring several hundred dollars!

Included is a custom hand made quiver with large Rattlesnake inlays on storage pocketand main body of quiver, with genuine rattler attached, as well as a silver arrowhead medallion.

Description: 
CVA Buckhorn Black powder, 3x9 scope, bullets, powderand 209 primers.Like new. Great Christmas present. fired 10 times. Pics on request. Photo doesn't show the scope. It's mounted and sighted in.
The Buckhorn™ 209 Magnum is an ultra-modern conventional in-line, and the heart of this high-tech smokepole is the precision rifled 24"" barrel with a 1:28"" twist. It's powered by an extremely hot 209 ignition system and will handle 150 grain magnum charges with ease. And in states where 209 primers are not allowed, the Buckhorn can be easily converted to a #11 or musket cap ignition by simply changing the breech plug and adding the correct nipple. Plus, the Buckhorn comes standard with a thumb-actuated safety, Durasight® All Metal fiber optic sights, dual-barrel retention points and a Bullet Guiding Muzzle. Another feature that really sets this gun apart from the competition is its radical new stock design. The Buckhorn's unique stock features dotgrip panels to ensure a comfortable, non-slip grip. Not bad for a rifle that retails for less than two Ben Franklins!"

P95 series pistols easily field strip for cleaning, without the use of special tools, into five major subassemblies. Ruger offers several ambidextrous variations on the proven P95 series double-action design. Operating features on all centerfire models include a firing pin block that prevents firing unless the trigger is completely pulled and held fully back. Manual safety models incorporate a manual ambidextrous lever that, when engaged, prevents firing unless the lever is in the ""fire"" position. Decock allows safe return to their ""at rest"" mode when either ambidextrous decocking lever is depressed."

I bought this Polish Tantal a few months ago from a guy here and it was everything as advertised. It is not Century Arms trash. Everything I have read about these has been positive. They are great guns to own and fun to shoot. I LOVED how much more accurate this is than my AKs. 2 inch groupings at 100 yards! I bought it to use as a build gun because ITM receivers are harder to find, but don't have time to do it. I just wanna get my money back out of it. It's cleaned up, comes with a mag and around 200 rounds of ammo, as well as a military one point sling. Good as an extra gun when hunting. If you email me I can send you more pictures to your email or phone. I am selling for $600 OBO, or I AM ACCEPTING TRADES- Only an AR 15, must be in good shape. I am willing to trade plus cash if your AR is high end. Thanks for looking!"

It has only been test fired, so it is essentially new cosmetically and mechanically.  It has both a flip up front (built into gas block) and rear sight so if you plan on running a optic, you will have nothing in your field of view.  Also, another very important feature of this AR is that the front gas block/sight tower is a two piece design.  If you know your AR's which I am sure you most likely do if your looking into a quality one, this feature will allow you to strip the gun down, unlike those with a pinned one piece FSB.  Also, the Mid-Length gas system is a improvement over the carbine length, as it reduces operating pressures.  Here are the specs:

-Palmetto State Lower Receiver
-Palmetto State Upper Receiver
-Palmetto State 16"" 1:7 twist HAMMER FORGED Chrome Lined barrel Mid-Length gas system
-Palmetto State Premium Bolt Carrier Group (MP and HPI tested)
-Yankee Hill Diamond Mid-Length Free Float Hand Guard
-Yankee Hill 5M1 Aggressive Muzzle Brake (Pinned to NY Spec)
-Yankee Hill Gas Block with Flip Up Sight Tower
-MaTech Rear Flip up sight with Windage and Elevation Controls 50-600m
-Magpul MOE Grip
-Magpul Enhanced Trigger Guard
-Magpul MOE Stock (pinned to NY spec)

This Gun is 100% NY compliant which you wont find on the majority of ARs you find on the internet.  Fortunately, with the 2 piece gas block, the compliance does not limit this like some rifles.

Please do not low ball me, I wont even respond, so do not waste your or my time.    If you have any questions, please let me know, Ill be quick to respond.  I have built a great reputation with everyone I have previously dealt with, and I am sure you will not be disappointed."

Outside measurements are 36""x 10""x 4 3/4"", inside measurements are 35""x 9"".
 It has 4 heavy duty hinge locks with a steel rod that slides through all 4 and the end of the rod is bent to go in a special slot for a pad lock so rod cant be removed and cannot open hinges. It has a piano hinge that runs length way down the back of case. Foam inside is one solid piece on top and 2 layers on the bottom so that it may be cut out for special fitting. The bottom foam was cut out for a O/U shotgun but i did not use it for that so i put the cut out section on bottom and the solid piece on top. This is Airline Approved and you would be hard pressed to find a more secure case to trust your valuables with then this one. Feel free to make a cash offer but i really would like to trade this for a small caliber handgun. These are not cheap cases."

It has only been test fired, so it is essentially new cosmetically and mechanically.  It has both a flip up front (built into gas block) and rear sight so if you plan on running a optic, you will have nothing in your field of view.  Also, another very important feature of this AR is that the front gas block/sight tower is a two piece design.  If you know your AR's which I am sure you most likely do if your looking into a quality one, this feature will allow you to strip the gun down, unlike those with a pinned one piece FSB.  Also, the Mid-Length gas system is a improvement over the carbine length, as it reduces operating pressures.  Here are the specs:

-Palmetto State Lower Receiver
-Palmetto State Upper Receiver
-Palmetto State 16"" 1:7 twist HAMMER FORGED Chrome Lined barrel Mid-Length gas system
-Palmetto State Premium Bolt Carrier Group (MP and HPI tested)

Price: $1250 cash or $1400 trade value
This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price. 
Price: $950 cash or $1050 trade value
This rifle is the most accurate AR that I have ever shot. This is a DPMS AR-15 with an A2 stock and a 20 inch long, 1 inch diameter stainless bull barrel. This rifle has a free floating barrel and a free floating DPMS handguard, forward assist, and dust covers. The rifle also has a 6-24x44 scope that has not been sighted in. The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope. 


If someone buys both guns, I will take $2,000 or $2,050 with the drum for the saiga."

This is a very well built gun. The tolerances are tight, so much so that breaking it down the first few times is  gonna be a pain in the ass. I only shot the thing twice. Ammo count is still under 500 rounds so the pistol is more or less new. You will be getting the gun, two magazines, the hard case, the manual, and the little tools (in other words what came with the gun).

Buyer must present drivers license and FOID card upon transaction. A bill of sale will also be signed stating both parties names, the firearm and price. I will also be selling my mossberg 702 .22 rifle if youre looking for a rifle as well.

Ive owned this thing for maybe a little under 2 years now. Like I stated in my other post I bought this thing for cheap shooting however due to living where I live and finances shooting regularly is difficult, so my time at the range is better spent shooting my full power guns and not rim fire.

Like I said ive owned the gun for about 2 years. Cosmetically it is in great condition. It has ran at most 1000-1200 rounds through it, zero malfunctions. This is a great little accurate gun, also very light. Perfect for kids because of its smaller size and weight as well as recoil. The only issue, which isnt an issue, is the first time I cleaned this gun when I reassembled it I accidentally put a slight kink the spring trying to reassemble it. Apparently this is a frequent problem which you will understand once you actually break this thing down. Like I said this gun has never malfunctioned and its not a problem as the spring slides over a pin, but I am making mention of it for the sake of being honest and unfront.

Included is the gun, one magazine, the manual, and ill throw in what looks to be maybe 200 rounds of a federal .22 brick that I will not need as I am selling both of my .22's. In case you are interested I am selling a ruger 22/45 in the pistol section as well.

The buyer will need to present a drivers license and FOID card upon transaction of the goods as well as sign a bill of sale stating both parties names, the price, and the gun.

DESCRIPTION:

Gerber Covert Automatic Serrated Tactical Knife - Black. Known as the international best-in-class folding technical knives, the Covert family takes another leap forward this year with the addition of the Covert Auto. Our popular Applegate-Fairbairn folder gets quicker with new spring-loaded auto release that rapidly deploys the tactical blade with the push of a button. The addition of this knife is a perfect way to complete a collection, while also having a perfectly balanced auto-opening knife. This is a solid knife! Good heft in the hand, and clearly designed as a worker or heavy use blade. The knife opens with plenty of force, and the centrally mounted safety is easy to activate / deactivate. Overall Length: 8.7"". Blade Length: 3.78"". Blade Material: S30V. Handle Material: Type III Anodized 6061 Aluminum. Weight: 5 oz. Pocket Clip"
