I'm looking for a decent quality AR-15 with a 5.56 barrel to use on the job.  Windham, Rock River Arms, Colt, DPMS, etc level of quality.  I have 3 guns up for trade and a little cash on hand to work with.  If you're interested in making some kind of deal, please contact me at REDACTED.  

At this time, I'm not wanting to sell any of them individually.  I might sell them all as a whole if the price is right, but right now I really need an AR and want to try and trade towards one.

Guns up for trade:

I've got a Glock 26 GEN4 that I bought new earlier this year.  Still have all the original paperwork, case, lock, 3 magazines with +1 Pearce extensions, and a canvas IWB holster.  I've taken great care of this gun, cleaning it ever time it's shot or once a week, which ever comes first.  This is a perfect gun for concealed carry.  Easy to use and holds 11+1 rounds.

The Remington 870 was purchased used a few months ago.  It's a 12 gauge Special Purpose.  I still have the factory stock and fore end.  It shows normal signs of wear from the pump action and a few scuffs on the factory stock.  I've added a +2 ammo tube, Hogue rubberized fore end and pistol grip, and a 6 shell side saddle.  The fore end has a 3"" picatenny rail attached for a light or laser.  Since I've owned it, I have cleaned it after every time it's been shot.  Gun shoots great and functions flawlessly.  Great for home defense!

Ruger 10-22 was purchase new ~7 months ago and has fired MAYBE 40 rounds.  I fired it just enough to get the cheap Walmart scope on it sighted in, then stuck it in my case.  Rifle comes with the factory 10 round magazine and an after market 25 round banana clip.  Needs to have the dust knocked off, but would make a great first rifle or a basic pinker!

I also have a 2007 or 2008 KHS Flite 220, red and black, size large and a KHS XC-104, black, size large that I'd be willing to barter with if anyone is into biking.  The bikes I'd be willing to sell individually or together.  $200 for the 220 and $450 for the XC-104.  $500 for the set and I'll throw in a helmet."

Looks like it’s going to happen...these will be illegal to produce and purchase very soon, based on NO-bama committing to making this his #1 priority in 2013 on “Meet The Press” last week. Existing owners will be grandfathered if a law banning these passes.

The rifle is as clean as it looks in the pics. Shoots 223 and 5.56. Very low round count down the pipe – under 200. Comes with everything you need, including 400+ rounds of Federal green tip 5.56 ammo in ammo can, and 200 + rounds of miscellaneous brands, all good non-steel ammo. TEN 30-round magazines, seven of which are new, Tapco adjustable stock, Barska scope, tactical red laser light, plus a new Blackhawk Sportster soft case that will carry the AR and all 10 mags. You will not be disappointed in this package. Only selling because I have too many interests and other projects I want to pursue right now. 

The ONLY trades I will consider are for a Kel-Tec Sub 2000 (9mm only) or a Glock 26 (9mm) in excellent condition, PLUS $1200 cash (FIRM). My AR-15 and accessories are in excellent condition...not interested in anyone’s junk. Otherwise, $1700 firm outright with no trade. This is one of the best deals around and your chance to snag an AR-15 with extras for a great deal. FTF for KS residents only (ID proof required), will not travel beyond 10 miles from the Olathe KS area to meet.  Send me an email with your questions, pics of your trade if applicable, and your phone number. I will reply quickly to all reasonable, responsible, and sane sounding individuals.  I can send you more pics of the package too. Thanks for looking."

Big medicine for those born 100 years too late. The sporting tradition, American history and good ol’ fashioned quality craftsmanship come together in this big-bore rifle built to celebrate a legacy that began in 1871. Modeled after the Frank Wesson tip-up rifles that were first made in Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1850s. Chambered for the 45-70 Gov't. cartridge, this rifle reflects true 19th century styling with antique color case hardening on the frame and a crescent butt plate. Its handsome American walnut stocks and fore-ends are accentuated by cut checkering.
Buffalo Classic Rifle

Traditional styling and aiming stability were foremost in its design. Offered in 45-70 Gov’t., its 32"" midweight barrel helps this big-bore cartridge develop full velocity and accuracy potential. It also provides the necessary sighting radius for long-range matches. The Williams receiver sight is complemented by a traditional globe-style target front sight.

White Oak Armament bolt and BCG
Troy TRX Extreme handguard
AR Stoner Compensator

Residents of Denver will receive one 10 round PRI magazine with the rifle. Folks outside of Denver will receive an additional three 25 round AR Stoner magazines. Two have been refinished in flat black, one is the original dark grey (not much difference between them).

Will also throw in some RCBS 6.8 dies (decapping/resizing and seating). I also have 50 or so cases of unused brass lying around and several once fired cases. I don't polish my brass so I generally don't offer it up (I use a sonic cleaner for cleaning, looks kind of nasty but works fine). Will also include an unopened pound of H335 powder.

I also have 75 rounds of 6.8 that I loaded. These loads contain 28 grains of H335, Remington brass, Winchester large rifle primers, topped off with Hornady 100 gr soft point bullets.  I also have a new box of Sierra matchking 100 gr .270 (if you're not in the know, 6.8 uses a .270 projectile), and some 115 gr bullets I bought at a gun show a while back.

Would like to keep this a package deal. I presume most 6.8 shooters reload. This is my only 6.8 rifle so the reloading equipment doesn't really do me much good without it. I love this rifle but something else has caught my eye. In this day and age I can't afford to buy new toys without letting one go first.

Heck, I'll throw in the EOTech. Can't go any lower on the price though. 


FTF Sale in the metro area. Will not ship. Prefer to meet somewhere firearms friendly. Will ask to see your Colorado ID or CCW permit. Not looking for any trades at the moment. If it doesn't sell I'll gladly hang onto it."

 L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

SUGGESTED TEXT TO THE SPEAKER

Dear Speaker Boehner,

I am writing you regarding the numerous gun control measures currently being circulated in congress, and the Diana Degette - D CO, magazine ban in particular. This measure would place severe restrictions on magazines over 10 rounds in capacity. These magazines are used by 10's of millions of law abiding Americans.  I STRONGLY oppose these gun control measures and this measure specifically. They do not make us safer and do nothing but disarm and hamstring those who obey laws, while criminals simply ignore the laws in their entirety. A magazine ban will do NOTHING to prevent crime or mass shootings which are a statistically rare event, and have essentially 0 effect on our overall violent crime rate. After studying the effects of the 1994 ban on ""assault"" weapons and high capacity magazines the USDOJ concluded in parrt: “At best, the assault weapons ban can have only a limited effect on total gun murders, because the banned weapons and magazines were never involved in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders."" The time required to change a magazine is trivial. I can do it in about a second and I'm slow. 

The 10's of millions of law abiding gun owners in this country are NOT the problem and we are frankly becoming very tired of being treated as though we are. The real problem is that these horrific shootings occur in so called ""gun free"" zones where the victims, or in the case of children, those responsible for protecting them, are disarmed and unable to mount any effective defense. When this is the case, the weapon used, and how many rounds of ammunition it holds, is frankly trivial. Any reasonably effective weapon can be used to kill large numbers of unarmed and helpless people. 

The short term, direct solution to these senseless and horrific acts is ARMED security in our schools NOW. Law enforcement officers are already in many schools and they should be in all of them. If the individuals who commit these acts knew that they would be confronted by an immediate armed response the number of attempts at these sort of mass killings would decrease dramatically. Compare the Sandy Hook tragedy, where nobody but the killer was armed, to the 1997 Pearl Mississippi school shooting where Vice Principal Joel Myrick was able to retrieve his handgun from his truck (it was illegal for him to possess or carry it in the school) and apprehend the shooter, Luke Woodham without Myrick firing a single shot. Luke Woodham's admitted plan after attacking his high school, was to go to the local Jr. High and continue his rampage there. Myrick stopped that plan cold. Unfortunately, there was no ARMED Joel Myrick at Sandy Hook. In another incident, in 2001, senior Jason Hoffman opened fire at Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, California. Hoffman wounded five people before being shot and incapacitated by, ARMED school resource officer (a police officer) Richard Agundez. An ARMED response to these incidents works, when it is in place. These individuals may not be afraid to die but they are afraid of arrest and prison. This is why they typically commit suicide rather than be taken into custody. The arguments against having the same armed police officers who enforce the laws and provide protection in the rest of society in schools are absurd. That includes the arguments against the cost. We could pay for an armed police officer in every school simply by cutting the foreign aid to countries where most of the population hates us. We have paid billions in aid to Pakistan, apparently, to hide Osama Bin Laden next to a military base. The money would be better spent protecting our own people right here in America.

The long term solution is to improve our mental health systems and address the real problem: The tendency toward violence in our society.

With regard to the Degette legislation I do not believe that this legislation should be allowed to come to a vote at this time. This is an obvious ploy to play on people's emotions immediately following a national tragedy. I am asking that you, as speaker, block this measure from coming to the house floor. The Senate routinely blocks legislation from being voted upon, in fact Harry Reid does so with monotonous regularity, and there is no reason the house should not do the same with regard to bills like this one. If the measure does come to a vote, please know this: American gun owners are a large part of the GOP constituency. You cannot win elections without us and as one of these gun owners I want this legislation defeated by any and all means at your disposal.

Sincerely,

Finn guns are never matching guns I'm told unless you find a SKY newer Finn made rifle. This retains the Czar's cartouche's on the bore and receiver. Lans and grooves look deep and smooth to me, but I'm no expert. The barrel and receiver appear to have no pitting. The rear sight needs a spring, $12 bucks and available through Liberty tree parts. I had no clue when I bought this, it still is the only dragoon I've ever met in person or held, so it's rare enough to me."

Brand New! Zero Tolerance 0350ST

NO credit card fees!!


The 0350ST is 10% smaller and weighs almost three ounces less than our flagship 0300, yet it packs a lot of features into a smaller size that some users prefer, especially for every day carry. This model also features partial serration, which enables it to zip through cord or other fibrous material with ease.

The 0350ST features the patented SpeedSafe® assisted opening system enabling a user to deploy the blade quickly and easily, even in gloves, thanks to the ambidextrous thumbstud or flipper blade protrusion. The blade is S30V stainless steel with non-reflective, black Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating. S30V is extremely durable, corrosion resistant, and wear resistant. In addition to providing a non-reflective surface, the black Tungsten DLC coating offers additional blade hardness and reduces friction. This high-performance S30V blade is paired with textured black G-10 scales for a secure grip and excellent mechanical strength even under the roughest conditions.

The scales are flat rather than 3D machined like those of the 0300. A locking liner secures the blade during use. The 0350 also includes ZT’s Quad-mount system for complete versatility. Mount the pocketclip in any of four ways: tip-up, tip-down, on the left side, or the right. There’s a pre-drilled lanyard hole for users who prefer to attach a lanyard.

Brand New! Zero Tolerance 0350TS

NO credit card fees!!


Same beast-like build. Same tank-like quality. But the Zero Tolerance 0350TS has something the others don't—a bold, tiger-stripe blade.

While it may look a little wilder, the 0350TS has all the same features as our 0350. It opens with the patented SpeedSafe assisted opening system. The blade deploys quickly and easily, even in gloves, using the ambidextrous thumbstud or flipper. The ZT 0350TS’s blade is S30V stainless steel with tiger-stripe Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating. The S30V steel is extremely durable, corrosion resistant, and wear resistant. In addition to providing a camouflaged surface, the DLC coating offers additional blade hardness and reduces friction. 

This high-performance S30V blade is paired with textured black G-10 scales for a secure grip and excellent mechanical strength even under the roughest conditions. The scales are flat rather than 3D machined and contoured like those of the 0300. A locking liner secures the blade during use. The 0350TS also includes ZT’s quad-mount system for complete versatility.

Mount the pocketclip in any of four ways: tip-up, tip-down, on the left side, or the right. There’s a pre-drilled lanyard hole for users who prefer to attach a lanyard.

Zero Tolerance Hinderer 0560

NO credit card fees!!


Based on Rick's crave-worthy XM-18, the new Zero Tolerance 0560 is one completely amazing knife. First, the blade. It's pure ELMAX® powdered steel for the extreme edge retention, high strength, and toughness a hard-use knife demands. High wear resistance in a steel usually means low corrosion resistance. Not with ELMAX. With this advanced steel, you get both properties—which makes it an excellent blade steel. The ELMAX blade rolls out of the handle on the KVT ball-bearing system. With KVT, a series of ball bearings surround the pivot point so blade deployment is rapid, incredibly smooth, and your blade is ready when you need it.

The handle is 3-D machined G-10 on the front, and lightweight, strong 3-D machined titanium on the back. The titanium frame lock, with lockbar stabilizer, ensures a rock-solid lockup every time. To ensure this big bear of a knife carries at a comfortable weight, ZT has skeletonized the liner and machined pockets in the titanium handle and frame lock, too. And to top it all off, the 0560 is equipped with ZT's new deep-carry pocketclip and Quad-mount system for tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed carry. The 0560 features a black front handle scale.
And to top it all off, the 0561 is equipped with ZT's new deep-carry pocketclip and Quad-mount system for tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed carry. The 0561 features a flat dark earth G-10 front handle scale.

Brand New! Zero Tolerance Hinderer 0561

NO credit card fees!!


Based on Rick's crave-worthy XM-18, the new Zero Tolerance 0561 is one completely amazing knife.

First, the blade. It's pure ELMAX® powdered steel for the extreme edge retention, high strength, and toughness a hard-use knife demands. High wear resistance in a steel usually means low corrosion resistance. Not with ELMAX. With this advanced steel, you get both properties—which makes it an excellent blade steel. The ELMAX blade rolls out of the handle on the KVT ball-bearing system. With KVT, a series of ball bearings surround the pivot point so blade deployment is rapid, incredibly smooth, and your blade is ready when you need it.

The handle is 3-D machined G-10 on the front, and lightweight, strong 3-D machined titanium on the back. The titanium frame lock, with lockbar stabilizer, ensures a rock-solid lockup every time. To ensure this big bear of a knife carries at a comfortable weight, ZT has skeletonized the liner and machined pockets in the titanium handle and frame lock, too.

And to top it all off, the 0561 is equipped with ZT's new deep-carry pocketclip and Quad-mount system for tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed carry. The 0561 features a flat dark earth G-10 front handle scale.

Location: Portage Indiana. If you see this listing handgun it's available.
For sale used Raven Arms MP-25 small handgun in .25 auto. Holds 6+1 rounds. All black.
Weight only 15 oz. overall length 4.5"", 3"" tall, 7/8"" wide. The slimmest gun you can buy.
Double safety, voted as the best compact and inexpensive handgun ever produced.
Made in the USA from quality steel, full metal frame and slider. Not like today's small cheap alloy or plastic guns that can explode in your hand on the first shot. 
Fixed barrel (length 2 3/8""), good for mounting silencer, not that you need one.
This is very good quality personal defense, or backup, easy to carry and conceal handgun. Perfect for ankle holster, any pocket, purse or just any place. It fits in small size hand perfect. Ideal for women, or young people with tight clothing.
Very easy to disassemble and clean, very simple construction with only few moving parts.
Handgun is in good condition with some wear signs, its very accurate and had less than 300 rounds trough it. Its been functioning flawlessly, without any problems. I have several of this guns and I enjoy shooting them because of literally no recoil and excellent accuracy on 25 yards.
Caliber .25 with hallow point personal defense rounds, its the way to go if your are concern about the size, weight and easy concealing. I own several full size handguns and they all weight around or over 2.5 lbs with the full 15 rounds magazine. After a wile becomes big burden and very unpleasant to carry such a bulky, heavy, and very hard to conceal gun. One that I always enjoy to carry is this one, you don't even feel it.

Online research: 
""In CT, there have been six self-defense shootings employing the MP-25 over the last 20 years. All six have been fatal for the attacker. At 100% fatality rate, this weapon exceeds both the .45ACP and .357 magnum for lethality. Obviously the sample is too small to draw any real conclusions, but it is important to note that 6 rounds of .25 at close range means a lot of blood lost for the bad guy.""
With today's technology boom in ammunition evolution, one modern self defense .25 bullet can make a lot of damage.
 Gun Review: Raven MP-25 Semi-automatic pistol
""Raven MP-25 has a tumultuous history and remains a controversial piece of the American firearms scene. It was designed by the famous George Jennings, and is the original, quintessential, “Saturday night special.” Reviled by journalists and anti-crime activists for its extreme popularity with criminals, this weapon suffered a smear campaign unrivaled until the concept of the “scary black rifle” reared its ugly head in the nineties. While it is true that criminals employed this weapon heavily through the seventies (count how many you see in the movies “Dolemite” or “Black Caesar”), it was the same things that attracted the weapon to criminals that attracted it to everyone else. For twenty years, this pocket stinger ruled the streets of Miami, Memphis, and Harlem. It was designed to be small, light and disposable. In the end, like any weapon, it has good points and bad, and the end user must ultimately make the decision for their own reasons...
This weapon only had one competitor in its class when it came out: the Colt .38 Detective special. In the sixties, the snub-nosed .38 ruled the concealed weapon scene. Small, comparatively powerful, and reliable, every cop had one on the ankle and every detective had one on the hip. When the MP-25 hit, you now had access to a weapon that could shoot seven rounds and then reload in the blink of an eye. Like all detachable magazine automatics, reloading is as simple as dropping the mag, and sliding in another. It was way faster than wrestling a speed-loader into a revolver, or worse, feeding individual rounds into the cylinder...""

From the manufacturer:
ECONOMIC RELIABILITY. Blazer® Brass brings shooters the reliability and quality of ammunition built to SAAMI standards, and is backed by stringent ISO certified quality systems. Blazer Brass is loaded in reloadable brass cases for added value. Standard Boxer-type primers and primer pockets mean you can reload Blazer Brass cases just like any other case. Blazer Brass is loaded with a protected-base FMJ bullet. CCI® primers insure reliable ignition, and we load clean-burning propellants. Blazer Brass loads are very similar to Speer Lawman ammunition. It is produced in CCI's production facility in Lewiston, Idaho along the banks of the Snake river. The CCI plant which produces several brands (CCI, Blazer, Blazer Brass, and Speer) is owned by ATK (the same company that owns Federal)."

You can tell where I got these and the price I paid by the product code visible in the attached photo, it starts off ""WM"" for Wal-Mart. It says so right on the Federal website at http://www.federalpremium.com/products/details/handgun.aspx?id=9521 ""made for Wal-Mart exclusively""

You can also check the prices at your local Wal-Mart, (the one on Ramsey St has some in stock right now!) and the price is still $11.98...

Now, I'd like to more than double my investment on these, and sell these for $25 a box or $0.50/round.

Bushmaster .223 30 Rd. Magazine
Bushmaster has reworked their magazines to offer significant improvements in function, durability and value. The aluminum box is stamped with a full ""progressive"" die to produce tightest tolerances. The welding process along the box seams has been automated to insure optimum weld ingot, strength and compliance with MIL-STD. The surface finish has been improved to meet or exceed MIL-PRF-46010 (required for U.S.G.I. magazines). Magazine boxes are treated with Molybdenum Disulphide (""Moly"") for its exceptional adherence properties which ensure long lasting protection and lubricity - far superior to the PTFE (Teflon) used on other magazines. Finally, these magazines now have a new ""anti-tilt"" follower that ensures the round is fed into the chamber properly - preventing failure to feed problems. Drop tests have proven the advantages of the anti-tilt follower over the traditional green follower. As an additional aid, the followers are caliber marked - 5.56 in this case. Highest quality tempered steel springs, and Bushmaster logo stamped baseplates (removable for cleaning) round out the improvements on these superior magazines - which have been endorsed by the National Tactical Officers Association."

Its getting harder by the day to find any quantities of ammo in stock and its possible that it will become either regulated or taxed very heavily very soon - or both. Get it while you can.
No taxes no shipping no waiting and no wondering if or when your order might ever get filled or even cancelled.

From the manufacturer:
ECONOMIC RELIABILITY. Blazer® Brass brings shooters the reliability and quality of ammunition built to SAAMI standards, and is backed by stringent ISO certified quality systems. Blazer Brass is loaded in reloadable brass cases for added value. Standard Boxer-type primers and primer pockets mean you can reload Blazer Brass cases just like any other case. Blazer Brass is loaded with a protected-base FMJ bullet. CCI® primers insure reliable ignition, and we load clean-burning propellants. Blazer Brass loads are very similar to Speer Lawman ammunition. It is produced in CCI's production facility in Lewiston, Idaho along the banks of the Snake river. The CCI plant which produces several brands (CCI, Blazer, Blazer Brass, and Speer) is owned by ATK (the same company that owns Federal)."

Gas-operated semi-auto .308 Win. tactical rifle based on Browning’s BAR ShortTrac. 
The FNAR is a gas-operated semi-automatic .308 Win. tactical rifle based on Browning’s BAR ShortTrac semi-automatic rifle. Designed to be a short- to medium-range rifle, the FNAR is available in both light- and heavy-barrel variants, the latter being about a pound heavier than the former. All models accept proprietary FN 10- and 20-round magazines. THIS NEW GUN IS PRE-BAN WITH 1 FACTORY 20 RD MAG! 

A simple philosophy guided the development of the FNAR: to provide autoloading speed along with bolt-action accuracy. The FNAR is guaranteed to group into 1 m.o.a. or less with the proper ammunition. Contributing to this is the rifle’s 18-inch chrome-molybdenum steel barrel, with cold-hammer-forged rifling in a 1:12-inch four-groove, right-hand twist. Both bore and chamber are hard-chromed for durability. The chamber is cut to SAAMI specifications for the commercial .308 Win., but is also optimized for the use of 7.62x51 mm NATO ammunition as well. The muzzle has a recessed, target-style crown. The chamber end of the barrel terminates in an integral extension that is clamped firmly in the receiver ring and contains recesses for the bolt head’s locking lugs. Both the light- and heavy profile barrels have six flutes and a matte black finish. The split-ring clamping system that retains the barrel in the receiver allows for a solid barrel/receiver joint and facilitates barrel changes by armorers. 

The FNAR’s gas system is essentially the same as that of the BAR. Propellant gas is bled from a port in the barrel about 9¼-inches forward of the receiver ring, and enters the gas cylinder affixed to the underside of the barrel inside the fore-end. The gas impels the gas piston assembly 3/8-inch to the rear, which, in turn, pushes on the inertia block and action bars, which run into the receiver to connect to the bolt carrier. As the carrier moves rearward, the bolt head is cammed counterclockwise until its lugs unlock from the barrel extension, the empty case is extracted and ejected, the action spring beneath the barrel is compressed, and the hammer is cocked. Returning forward, the bolt and carrier strip the top round from the magazine and feed it into the chamber, and the bolt head enters the barrel extension and rotates clockwise to lock the action. 

A novel feature of the FNAR is the bolt-forward indicator, a red dot on the bottom edge of the ejection port that is visible only when the bolt is fully forward and locked into the barrel extension. 

The trigger group is retained in the receiver by two crosspins. The two-stage trigger is factory-set from 3.25 pounds to 5.5 pounds, and is not user-adjustable. Just rearward of the trigger guard is a crossbolt safety that, when engaged, locks the trigger. The safety can be reversed for left-handed shooters. 

Forward of the trigger group is the generous beveled magazine well, a separate piece attached to the underside of the receiver. Release of the FNAR’s magazine is by way of ambidextrous checkered buttons at the rear of the well. 

In order to meet the minimum factory standard of 10,000 rounds with no breakages, every major component and system of the FNAR was designed to be stronger and more durable than its counterpart on the BAR. 

Law enforcement input in the development of the FNAR is evident in the 9¾-inch-long Picatinny rail atop the receiver, as well as in the gun’s non-reflective black synthetic stock. The fore-end features three 4 3/8-inch-long Picatinny rail sections, with the bottom rail having a stud for sling or bipod attachment. 
THE RIFLE SHOWN IN THE PHOTOS IS A FNAR 18"" CARBINE  with a steel 20-round magazine. We opted to keep the factory-mounted cheekpiece and buttpad units, and installed a Leupold VX-II 4x12x50 mm scope on the gun using Leupold QD rings. AND A HARRIS 45 DEGREE BIPOD DOES NOT COME WITH GUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
