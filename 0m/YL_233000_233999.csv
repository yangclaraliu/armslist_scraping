I have spent years compiling this collection. I have collected since I was a young boy. Now, I must sell my collection. My wife and I have found a piece of property that we would really like to purchase. We need to raise some more money for a larger down payment so this collection must go. I would like to sell the entire collection all at once, but I may consider parting out the items as well. All of the autographs in my collection have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. The total value of my collection is just over $20,000. I am only asking $5,500 for the entire collection. However, we must sell this collection as soon as possible so I will take the best offer that I receive. No reasonable offers will be refused. This would make a great investment opportunity for anyone that had the time to sell the items individually. I simply do not have the time. We are in a time crunch so they must go all at once. Please do not lowball me too much. I know what this collection is valued at and I know what similar collections sell for. Below you will see a list of what each item is approximately valued at. These are not my asking prices. These are simply what each item is worth. I am only looking for a fraction of the actual value. This would be great for any ebayer that has the time and know-how to sell on ebay. As I said, we just don't have the time to do this. If you are interested, please contact me by email. I have photos of all of the items and can send them to you by email if you are interested.  Thanks for looking. 


Autograph Collection
Price: $5500 or best offer

This collection is valued at over $20,000. I have much much more than my asking price invested in this collection. I am simply trying to move this collection quickly in order to put a down payment on a piece of property. I may consider trades on a few items but I really prefer cash on these autographs. I would like to sell the entire collection all at once because time is limited on my end. This would be perfect for someone to resale on ebay or for an avid collector. I simply don't have the time to sell these items individually so the first person with a reasonable cash offer will take the entire collection. I am only asking $5500 for the entire collection. You won't find a collection like this everyday, especially at this price. Below is a list of every item in my collection. I have also listed prices for what each item typically sells for. Keep in mind, I am only asking a fraction of these prices. $5500 is an absolute steal for a collection like this. I may consider shipping this collection at the buyer's expense. All of my autographs have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. Thanks for looking.

The blade, marked on the nakago (tang) with the Toyokawa Naval Arsenal Anchor in Circle stamp, has a graceful sori (curve) that is reminiscent of the Koto period. The blade is a partially hand forged, oil tempered from stainless steel (as are most blades used in Japanese naval swords) that is robust, solid, strong and clean. It has a very sharp 26"" length nagasa (cutting edge) with a chu-suguha (medium width, straight) hamon and chu-kissaki point. The blade's polish is nearly flawless without any forging flaws, bends, chips or nicks. It does have a few, very minor, light, tiny surface scuffs, scratches and rubbings from honest use, but otherwise nothing major. This would rate as a very superb, near mint conditioned blade. The Kai-Gunto mounts are also near mint showing some minor wear from age and WW2 use with a nice aged patina. The tsuba and seppa (and the higher quality sunburst style) are original to the blade and like numbered as E320, the same as the blade nakago. The tsuka has polished, blackened shark skin over its wooden core and then covered with nearly flawless brown silk Ito tape. The saya is covered in polished shark skin (shagreen) that has been lacquered and is in excellent, near mint condition. The blade retention in the saya is via push fit and does not have a retention clip/button. This overall condition of this sword is near mint and would be a great addition to any collection of WW2 Japanese naval swords as most are at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

Both of the firearms are in great shape and function flawlessly. I will only consider a FTF trade in the state of Indiana. Must present DL upon sale or trade for the shotgun and a CWP if purchasing/trading the pistol. I know you don't need a CWP to purchase a pistol from a firearms store but this is for my comfort. I will also request that you sign a bill of sale which will include the serial numbers.

I will consider trades of equal value. In case you are wondering, I will also consider trades of a greater value too. :)

I am looking for a long gun in trade. I would prefer a .270 or .243 but will consider a .223 as well. I would also consider a decent bolt action .22 in partial trade + cash. 

Please email me for more pictures or to shoot me an offer. 

The items up for grab are the shotgun at the top of the picture and the pistol at the bottom.

The shotgun in the middle is a Remington SxS 20ga coach gun. I am extremely partial to that one but would consider parting with it for the right offer. I will not put a price on it. If you are interested, shoot me an offer on it as well but I can tell you that it would take more than what the gun is worth."

High Standard CRUSADER COMPACT 45 Has features that usually are found only on pistols that carry a much higher price tag. This is no stripped-down basic pistol. The Crusader Compact has an excellent set of steel Novak-style combat sights that are very easy to see, and offer a good sight picture for target work. They are dovetailed into the slide, and the rear sight has a set screw to loosen to make windage adjustments. Another feature usually found only on more expensive pistols is the beavertail grip safety and skeletonized Commander-style hammer. The feed ramp is polished, and the barrel is throated to feed hollowpoint ammunition. The trigger is a good-looking partially skeletonized unit, with a crisp trigger pull that feels lighter than its measured five and one-half pounds. The short magazine still holds seven rounds, for a loaded capacity of eight, and has a base pad for positive insertion into the slightly beveled magazine well.

In order to get these gone fast, i will sell the standalone for $1200 and the trailer rig for $2300. The trailer rig is designed to shoot horizontal or vertical. Each shot only takes 1.5 35mm film canisters of powder to put it into the heavens. Powder chambers are milled and surrounded by 2.5"" of solid steel. All barrels are precision machined, andno patching is neccesary. These are very efficient and attract a huge crowd every time I shoot them.

NOTE: text For pics or i will post some within the next few days. gun is in my safety deposit box. I bought this gun thinking i would have time to shoot it. but honestly its 

been out of the box a couple times to show friends, but never been shot. it 

holds 45 longs and 410s. it  has the 6.5 inch barrel. i bought the longer barrel 

to help w the recoil bc I've have shot both lengths and the longer barell 

does help. gun is still in the original box has all the warranty papers, and 

the keys to lock and unlock the hammer. i paid a little over 550 for the gun 

so id like to get at least 475 or I'd trade for a nice couch and loveseat or couch and chair

 with an ottoman or Chase lounge. Or 50"" tv flat screen lcd or plasma only!!

feel free to email me at REDACTED or text REDACTED or call 

and leave a voice mail,  Also, i will deal on the price a bit but id rather 

keep it than give  it away for practically free, Thanks ,God Bless AND JOIN The

From CZ:
It has been 20 years since the fall of communism in Eastern Block. During the Cold War Era CZ pistols could only be sold to the ""friendly"" communist countries. The Soviet Army left their post in Eastern Europe in 1990-1991. To celebrate the 20 years of freedom CZ-USA offers 999 pcs of the Cold War Replica CZ75B. This is a 9mm Luger, Cold War Commemorative Edition, black polycoat, original spur hammer and round trigger guard. It also features a Soviet Era Hammer & Sickles symbols as well as Soviet Red Star, and Russian lettering.

This is lightly used and is an awesome shooter (as are the whole CZ lineup and CZ 75's in particular).

I bought this gun on a whim when deciding that it would be a good conceal carry piece and it is. That said, I never conceal carry it and find myself carrying my revolver instead.

Looking to sell this gun because I'd rather have the cash and know someone is actually using it than see it collect dust.

Never been fired, in mint condition, lots of goodies, well below dealer price. This is a good deal.

The revolver comes packaged in a very useful ballistic nylon carrying case emblazoned with the embroidered Thunder Ranch logo.  Inside are 13 full moon clips.  The Model 22 is done up in a really nice polished blue finish, accented by beautifully figured African Cocobolo grips, with a laser-cut Thunder Ranch logo and checkered panels.  These grips are what S&W used to call the “Magna” style and basically followed the lines of the grip frame with the wood coming up over the frame at the rear to form “ears” that helped spread out the surface area a bit to help reduce recoil discomfort.

This revolver is not an exact replica of the Model 1917 or of the commercial .45 Hand Ejector, as it has a shrouded ejector rod, which these guns did not.  It is more like a hybrid of the .45 Hand Ejector Model of 1950 Target, but with fixed rather than adjustable sights.  In fact the left side of the barrel is stamped .45 Cal. Model 1950.  It is a mixture of the old and the new as it had an original-looking cylinder release latch, but also has the latest S&W improvements like the integral cylinder stop, frame-mounted firing pin and internal safety lock.  The front sight is circular-shaped and pinned to a sloping ramp integral to the barrel.  Unlike the older sights, it is a full 1/8” in width and is matte finished to reduce glare.  The fixed rear sight has a wide square-shaped notch which sits inside a trough on the top strap.  Another “oldie” feature is the side-plate on the right side of the frame that is held in place with 4 screws, just like in the good ol’ days.

A couple of other items that make this gun useful as a combat handgun are the medium width trigger with the smooth face; something I definitely prefer over narrow triggers with serrated faces or even wide serrated triggers.  The hammer spur is also wider than what you will find on the service-grade Smiths of years past and it is a compromise as it is midway between a service type and a target-style hammer.  The single-action trigger pull, by the way, on this gun is pure S&W; it has a weight of about 4 pounds and breaks as crisply as snapping a glass rod.  In contrast the double-action pull is smooth and crisp.

This gun is in new unfired condition.  Call if you have any Questions.

I am the second owner of this Stag Arms lower receiver.  I am close friends with the first owner, and I know that the unit was well taken care of.  There is extremely minimal cosmetic wear, because it has only moved from box to box with a little handling in between.  The unit has never been fired.

I am the first owner of the Del-Ton upper receiver.  The upper features a flat-top system, allowing for the installation of a scope, holographic sight, or iron sight (carry handle or flip-up).  Also, the flat-top Picatinny Rail features designators, allowing the user to keep track of sight or scope positioning.   The hand guard is standard, as is the front sight and gas block.  The barrel is a Mil-Spec government type barrel, which is 16"".  The upper receiver is completely new, as I just removed it from the packaging 48 hours ago. 

Del-Ton Inc. is a brand that is often preferred by AR armorers and gunsmiths, because of its quality, precise machining.  Del-Ton Inc.

Winchester Model 37A's were reintroduced in 1973, and discontinued in 1981.  This shotgun is nearly a collector's item being about 30 to 38 years old.  They don't make them anymore, so don't miss your chance to own one.

Gun prices keep getting higher and higher, especially on the one they don't make any more.  Next year they are liable to be $100 to $200 higher than this year.

Since I am a private seller, there is no sales tax, relocating fees to a licensed dealer, nor do you have to fill out the Federal paperwork on it.  3 big plus'.

I am selling it since I lost my job.

$350.00 cash please.  Yes, I know it's priced $25 higher than average market, but it is in such good condition it is well worth it, since it is above average.

Thanks for looking!  You will be very pleased when you see it.
I want you to be as pleased with it as I am, otherwise I will keep it.

It would make an excellent Christmas gift that will increase in value.  A great investment that is useable too."

It has an 8-shot tube, 20"" barrel, and adjustable Knoxx recoil-reducing stock. It has a 3"" chamber, and with the stock, 3"" shells feel like slugs, and slugs feel like birdshot.
The receiver is drilled and tapped for an optics mount, but it comes with the normal bead sight.
Rather than the normal black, this is in matte silver Marinecote, a highly resilient finish designed for use on boats.
It's had a few hundred rounds through it, so it's broken in, but still in excellent shape. There's some finish wear on the magazine, but no damage anywhere.
I also have the original synthetic stock and stock bolt. 
These go for $450 new, and the Knoxx stock is not cheap.
There's not a whole lot I'm looking for in trade, but the worst I can say is no -- cast bullets in 9mm/.38/.45, Geissele AR-15 trigger kits (depends on what you've got), or maybe a decent spotting scope. Money talks, especially if you're quick."

-  One WASR 10. For all AK connoisseur fags, it does have mag wobble so it can fit drums and hi caps (my 40 round steel mags fit great) and canted front sights. Even then, it doesn't have that much wobble. The front sights can be fixed but I have a QD rail and electric sights so it never meant shit to me. Upgrades on the gun include 5 position stock with recoil pad, SAW grip, Galil handguard, and A2 muzzle brake to flatten recoil.

- four 40 round steel mags, one 30 round steel mag, five 30 round hard plastic mags that are tough as shit (feed lips don't warp when loaded into the piece, outside is very dense). All have been tested and work no problem. Steel mags were disassembled and cleaned on purchase.

Also have the original oil can, tools, bayonet (sharpened), and mag pouch.

The gun was very well taken care of. The weapon was cleaned after every time it went out, firing pin and extractor were cleaned at 230 and 550 rounds. The receiver cover and muzzle brake were touched up with bluing to keep the finishes nice.

This AK is fun as hell to shoot but I'm in the market for a CCW.

This truly BEAUTIFUL revolver has to be seen (and held) to be appreciated.  These pics do NOT do it justice. 
   It has high definition case hardening on the frame, accented by its solid brass backstrap.  Barrel and cylinder are richly blued.
   Fully adjustable target sights allows you to dial in any load.  Shoots .44 Magnum, along with cheaper and less recoiling, .44 Special ammo.  The .44 Special is similar in power to the .45 Long Colt.  Many consider the .44 to be much more accurate.  The .44 Mag is MUCH more powerful than factory .45 Colt, and has taken all North American big game, including Moose and Alaskan Brown Bear.  Ammo available everywhere, including Walmart.
,   This fine revolver loads and functions just like the original Colt Single Action.  It has the famous four click hammer cocking sound, like the Colt.  The grip feels like the Colt, but is slightly longer, allowing for all fingers on grip.  This makes for a much better, and more solid grip, yet still looks right. Balance is excellent!
   I don't know if this revolver has ever been fired.  Can't tell by looking at it.  To my knowledge, they no longer make the case hardened version, only a less attractive, all blued target model, that lists for over $600."

More specifically,this is a Mauser 98 action that is fitted with a modern barrell and stock.
The stock is a black synthetic Butler Creek stock,with sling mounts,and a nice recoil pad.
 The barrell is 22inches long,and it is drilled and tapped for a scope.The gun currently has a Swift 3x9x50 scope on it,which is crisp and clear,and accurate.This is a $300 dollar scope new.
 The gun is nicely done,and it is in nice condition.It shoots well,and is comfortable.The only reason I am getting rid of it is because I want a semi-auto.
 I am taking offers,or I may consider trades for another rifle in a semi-auto.I am open to various calibers from 243 and up.I have 2 full boxes(minus 1 round) of Hornady Superformance 150 grain bullets to throw in if I trade for a different caliber.
 Thank you for taking the time to look at my ad."
