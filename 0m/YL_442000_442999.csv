This is a great little gun. It is the Walther PK380 and is the model with nickel slide. You can buy smaller 380s to be sure but what I have read on this model is that the ergonomics and reliability are fantastic. While it may be a bit more challenging to carry it concealed, it makes up for it in shootability. Has two magazines, original box, warranty card and factory fired case. It hasn't been shot much and I've not shot it at all--just decided I don't need it. However, I'm firm on the price at this time. This is quite a savings as priced when compared to how they are selling then adding taxes, transfer fees and such."

This product is new and performs above and beyond any other products that we have used.  Team LiveFire wants to share their new discovery with you.  Below is a full description on the product and how it came about.  It’s been on Magpul Dynamics, American Handgunner, Midway USA, and also will be coming to the new Shot Show.  Trust us you won’t be disapointed...  We sell all items on our web site as well and out of our store.

 FrogLube is a revolutionary bio-based gun cleaner, lubricant and preservative (CLP) product made from food-grade ingredients all obtained exclusively from US suppliers. It is a new “green” product developed for government use by San Diego-based Audemous, Inc, a company that evaluates products in the emerging environmental, safety and health sector.

    FrogLube was founded by CAPT Larry Lasky, US Navy SEAL (ret), who spent the past 32 years in service to the United States Special Operations Command, Naval Special Warfare and to the U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose gallant performance he attributes to every success on any mission and on any battlefield he has served. After a career of uncounted operations in every environment from jungle, to arctic, to maritime and desert, he’s seen the impact of these extremes on weapons and equipment. He felt the best equipment, products and weapons always came from combining the most arduous conditions and the solutions created by the world’s best field “operators”. He’s taken this ethos into product development with FrogLube, a new technology lubricant designed to replace inferior and toxic petroleum-based products that foul actions, attract carbon and stick to dirt and grime.

 FrogLube is a revolutionary bio-based gun cleaner, lubricant and preservative (CLP) product made from food-grade ingredients all obtained exclusively from US suppliers. It is a new “green” product developed for government use by San Diego-based Audemous, Inc, a company that evaluates products in the emerging environmental, safety and health sector.

    FrogLube was founded by CAPT Larry Lasky, US Navy SEAL (ret), who spent the past 32 years in service to the United States Special Operations Command, Naval Special Warfare and to the U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose gallant performance he attributes to every success on any mission and on any battlefield he has served. After a career of uncounted operations in every environment from jungle, to arctic, to maritime and desert, he’s seen the impact of these extremes on weapons and equipment. He felt the best equipment, products and weapons always came from combining the most arduous conditions and the solutions created by the world’s best field “operators”. He’s taken this ethos into product development with FrogLube, a new technology lubricant designed to replace inferior and toxic petroleum-based products that foul actions, attract carbon and stick to dirt and grime.

I've put roughly 150 rounds of .357 magnum & 250 rounds of .38 special through it.  I bought it new, so it hasn't had any other mileage beyond that.  It fired everything without a hiccup.

It comes with the Ruger plastic case, the manual, brass from the test round fired by Ruger, a Ruger lock, and the other assorted papers that came in the case.

I'll also throw in 20 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense ammo in .357 magnum, 125 grain.  It is good home defense ammo, and I keep it loaded with this ammo for that exact purpose.

If you reload, I have a bunch of spent .38 special and .357 magnum brass, once fired, that can be thrown in with it as well.  I'm guessing there is somewhere between 400-500 accumulated from shooting with my buddy who has a .38 special.

I'm looking to trade for a Glock 21 as my number one preference, but I'd consider other full sized glocks and full sized 1911's.  I'm looking for a straight trade for a gun in the same price bracket (400-500 bucks) but I'd be willing to trade and throw down 100 bucks or so if you have something closer to the 550-600 dollar bracket (like a gen 4 glock 21) 

I'd prefer to trade as opposed to outright selling it."

I'd say the condition is a 9+. I'm the original owner and everything that came with the pistol is included, except the test shell casing. The two original mags have the floor plates replaced with Pearce +2 extensions, giving them a capacity of 12 rounds instead of 10. The extensions also make the short grip much more comfortable and give more stability and control without loosing concealability of the pistol. I also have 9 extra mags, all with the extensions, for $25 each. The numbers on them shown in the pics are easily removed, so you can buy as many or as few as you'ld like. I was going to shoot in competitions and wanted the extra mags to keep from reloading between stages. However, due to various circumstances, I have been able to attend the competitions. I will sell only FTF for cash to a CCW holder and/or a Colorado resident who is legally able to buy and own guns."

However, it doesn't appear to be a cheap spray paint but more of an oven cure type gun finish.  It shoots 22 Long or Long Rifle and the bore looks excellent.  If you're interested and want to take a look at it here in Lakeland shoot me an email and we'll work something out.

The story is Marlin rolled these out for just a couple years 2009-2011, then Remington took over their operations and moved the factory from North Haven, CN to New York.

Since that move, no more stainless .357s have been manufactured, and if they ever are again, they will not have the ""JM"" stamp on the barrel that the original Marlins from the Connecticut plant had. 

I just watched one of these sell on gunbroker for $1,000 without the box. There's another on there now, it looks like a 6-day auction. Watch that one you'll see the demand.

The one here that I am selling has the box. The box is in good-to-fair condition. Included in the box is the factory offset hammer spur, a manual, and unopened trigger lock. 

I've taken the gun to the range twice, and fired 120 rounds--all factory .357 ammo. It will shoot .38 specials as well. It holds 9 .357s or 10 .38s in the tube. It is a very accurate point and shoot rifle. Performed perfectly. 

There are three slight nicks on one side of the stock. I've taken a photo with the light hitting them directly to show them completely. I had no idea these were going to become scarce, or I wouldn't have ever taken her out of the safe. 

The day I bought this gun at Sportsworld, what I really wanted was a Marlin Guide gun, but I didn't have enough money. Now it seems these css .357s are worth more to the right person than the Guides, so I'm looking to cash this one in and go get that 45/70. 

Have a box of Leverevolution .357s to throw in with the deal. If you want to trade a Marlin Guide, and you have enough extra ammo, we may be close to an even swap."

Comes with the 4 blocks shown each holding 30 rounds of 9mm (=120 rounds or 4 magazines worth) and I'll throw in 60 rounds of ball ammo as seen on 2 of the C-3 loading blocks in case of zombie attack on your way home after purchasing! 
I purchased during the ""Obama's elected buy all you can now-Scare"" and have taken her out to the range twice & of course as it's and Uzi...Functioned flawlessly! Uzi meticulously cleaned after both uses.
The fore-end accessory rail as seen in the pictures is included if you want to add a laser or flashlight and if you go AOW, a fore-grip. I have a collapsible stock to go with it at no extra charge if you decide to go SBR or in case you add the 16 inch barrel some day.   
Selling for $825 Cash for everything to Oregon residents 21 or over willing to share ID's and sign a Bill of Sale. $800 sell price if you don't want loader or ammo.
Break-down for costs in project to date: Uzi-$800, 5 extra mags & pouch-$60, Accessory rail/fore-grip-$60, C-3 Plunge loader $46, ammo-$15, folding metal stock-$20 = $1001....Yours for the $850 and think what it will be worth if the unthinkable happens and we have 4 more years of Obama scare!

NO TRADES, THANK YOU...
Please respond to add for questions, to plan a meet/view/buy and thanks for looking!

Happy safe plinking and as the 4th. of July approaches, ""Thank you to all our current active duty Soldiers and our Veterans who are and have served our great nation!"

It has a 4"" barrel, and is a model 19-5, SN 150KXXX (since I know somebody's gonna' ask!)

This pistol is no safe queen -- it's been carried and fired and has some finish wear to show for it, but you'll see when it's in your hand, it's tight and ready to fight -- very clean with strong rifling in the barrel, and little wear in the breach end. All the chambers are clean and shiny, the crane is tight and the trigger is just how you want it, a little light and very crisp. Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation.

The finish has wear at the high points, as well as the inevitable ring around the cylinder, a good bit off the muzzle on both sides and a spot under the right thumb – see the pictures, and notice the nice case-colored hammer and trigger.  It has extended Pachmayr grips with finger grooves that will fill your hand nicely without adding much weight or thickness.

$450 cash and it's yours! I prefer a face-to-face sale somewhere in the greater San Antonio area, and I'd likely travel a little way to meet you if you're serious. For another $5 I'll add in a nice soft case, or $10 for a lockable soft case. I also have a variety of .357 Magnum ammo which I'd be happy to work into a deal.Feel free to make me an offer, but make it a good one 'cause if I don't get full price I will sell it for the best offer I get.

NOW ALSO OFFERED ON GUNBROKER (Auction #296505100) ending tomorrow morning, and it had a $350 bid on it, so if you want it, now's the time!"

(From $400 - It's priced to move.  New rifle I've been waiting on came in early + an impulse buy means I don't have room in my safe.  It's got to go.  Also throwing in available for trade - handgun that will fit in my safe or 410 or 20 ga  shotgun my friend wants.)


For sale is a Universal 30 Caliber M1 Carbine.
Rifle has all parts including 2@ 15 round magazines, the sling and oiler.
Also included is one 30 round USGI magazine.

Rifle shows age in bluing and on the stock, and is 100% functional.
It has only been 18 months since I did a full strip down, rebuilt the bolt (if you have ever worked on an M1 bolt you know what that entails!) and replaced most springs.

I'll also throw in a new box of Remington 110 gr SP ammo.
I am an avid reloader of over 30 calibers so I prefer to use low power ammo when plinking to reduce wear on guns and save the full load ammo for hunting.
I'll probably never hunt with a 30 carbine, so the kicker for me is that being a southpaw the brass from my reduced power loads ding me in the forehead if I don't pull my cap low.
Factory ammo and standard power reloads do as expected and fly over my shoulder no matter which hand I shoot with.
My safe is too full, so it is time for this one to move on to a new home.

Quite a bit of stuff in one place.  I have personally hit 18x18"" steel with all 3 of these rifles at 300m standing - repeatedly. 

price: $2100 CASH.
all three rifles are in great shape and all chambered in 6.5x55swede - the greatest cartridge on Earth in my honest opinion. great bores and great shooters.  AG-42b with lighter stock - not shot much at all.  What are you getting with this sale:
1941 husky (husqvarna) M38 - serial: 602571. non threaded barrel. appears all matching (including bolt). Little chip on the stock (see pictures)
1943 (dark stock) Ljungman AG-42b - serial: 20593 - great shape and great shooter. buttplate matches - uncommon!
1943 (light stock) Ljungman AG-42b - serial: 21008 - great shape and great shooter.
if you do not know about Ljungman AG-42b - about 33000 ever made, equipment sold to Egypt and Hakim was born (looks a lot alike). 
3 bayonets with frogs.
2 Ljungman tool rolls - complete
2 swedish leather slings
10 swedish stripper clips (these work GREAT)
90 pieces of once fired winchester brass (6.5x55swede, obviously) in two new plano 50-slot boxes.
one rifle cleaning bottle with a brush.
1 magazine - long story, but I can only include one magazine pictured.  Hakim magazines or MG-13 25rd conversions work just fine with these (currently JB sells some hakim converted mags for under $100 ea), so you will have to either share a mag between two rifles or get some on your own. 

there are plenty of pictures, please ask for any other specific images if needed.
all of these are over 50yrs old = thus C&R eligible.
also listed elsewhere
price: $2100 CASH.
reason for selling:  well, I collect swedish mausers and Ljungman rifles + anything in 6.5x55 for that matter....  with that said, I need to raise $2100 fairly quickly.  If this sells first, well it is sold...however, if my SVD Dragunov sells first, I will take this lot off the chopping block.  So, I do not want to sell, I need to raise cash and these 3 rifles are duplicates anyhow of what I already own...  I do not own junk nor junk you will recieve :).

Few things out of the way:
a) $2100.00 is a firm price.  CASH! - no exceptions
b) not looking for trades
c) I do not do layovers, I am a private party
d) do NOT spam me
e) if you hit 'Contact Seller' button for more pictures/information - please include your telephone number where I can call you to discuss.  I am NOT going to pass it on, I just do not want my time wasted.
    Thank you for understanding.
f) I will ask for a copy of your WI DL and to sign a bill of sale - if you can't do that...well, no deal

You can get a different belt for it if you need to as the holster comes off the belt. I don't think it was used much as the gun and holster both are very close to mint condition. Must be a fairly newer model as it does have the transfer bar. I'm including about 3/4 of a box of 100 of 36 grain CCI .22lr hp, almost 2 boxes of 50 of .22 short remington golden bullet & a box of 20 .22 lr shotshells (snake shot). I bought the ammo recently intending to keep the gun, but it's not really something i can use. Shoots just fine either single action or double action. I fired some lr and short through it to make sure it works right. Pretty darn accurate at close range! Guaranteed to shoot and be in condition stated. Holster and ammo worth at least $75 alone."

Great German quality Pellet rifle with scope.

RWS Diana 34 Meisterschutze Pro Compact delivers a whopping 1000 fps in .177 caliber. Because it's a more compact size, Diana has added an oversized muzzlebrake to give you additional leverage to make cocking easier. The 3-9x40AO scope is ideal for hunting small game, making this the perfect hunting combo.
If you're a lefty, you'll appreciate that this is a totally ambidextrous rifle and stock. The TO6 adjustable two-stage trigger lets you customize it for your shooting preferences. It's obvious that Diana put a lot of thought into this rifle, which will give you decades of shooting and hunting pleasure!

I bought this new and it comes with box,and all papers I received.
My purpose for purchasing this was to thin out the chipmunks in my yard and garden
I rate the condition as 99%, since I fired it only 5 times before the neighborhood association made me stop.

My loss your gain.

I must add a disclaimer on the 20 rd mags though. When Original owner bought them in the beginning of 2009 from armalite when they offered a 5 pack special. I have only been able to get 2 of the 5 to function properly and he broke the follower on one trying to adjust it (round sits with the bullet canted to far down, hits the front of the magazine upon feeding). I have not counted as of late but I will also throw in 112 plus or minus some Malay and Austrian head stamped 7.62 rounds. I know that some of them are tracers but cannot guarantee they all are.  And also 20 rounds of winchester 308

The gun is used but in very good shape, the only major defect I can find is it looks like the charging handle has rubbed up against some blue plastic or something, I have never diligently tried to clean it off.

I found a very rare 1911 it is a custom build, the frame is made of BERYLLIUM COPPER its a metal used for making tools with a high corrosion ressistance. The connections that make up the deep sea fiber optic cables are made of beryllium coppee. The frame was made by safari arms in the mid eightys, they made less than 50! This pistol was built well and uses a colt combar elite mk4 slide that has clearly been hand fitted. The trigger is very light. I polished the barrel and guide rod to a mirror finish. you will never find a gun like this again. REDACTED
