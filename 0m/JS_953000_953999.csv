4 Brand New Tapco 30 Round Magazines!

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower. We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market.

I have lots of Magazines, if you would like more of the same magazine, or perhaps something different, feel free to ask. email or call me at REDACTED with any questions

The shotgun has 2 barrels; They are easily removed and swapped with a thumbscrew. It's called a 500A combo, it has all wood furniture that is in good shape, comes with a 28"" Field barrel and a 24"" Fully-Rifled Slugster® Barrel with Adjustable Rifle Sights.

So one barrel is for shot and the other barrel is rifled inside and designed for accurate shooting of slugs. Both barrels are chambered for 2and3/4"" and 3"" shells.
The gun looks pretty good, but as you get closer you see the fading of the bluing. I was planning on re-bluing the metal. It can be done at home, it's called cold bluing and it's done with liquid that reacts with the metal.
Anyway, it functions flawlessly. If you need a shotgun for near 200.00, I can give you this one for 225.00 with the 2 barrels. It needs nothing and works perfect. It's heavy, it's all metal with no plastic and is ready to hunt...  Will trade for a good .22 rifle ...or a larger caliber rifle

The shotgun has 2 barrels; They are easily removed and swapped with a thumbscrew. It's called a 500A combo, it has all wood furniture that is in good shape, comes with a 28"" Field barrel and a 24"" Fully-Rifled Slugster® Barrel ...with Adjustable Rifle Sights.
One barrel is for shot and the other barrel is rifled inside and designed for accurate shooting of slugs.
The gun looks pretty good, but as you get closer you see the fading of the bluing. I was planning on re-bluing the metal. It can be done at home, it's called cold bluing and it's done with liquid that reacts with the metal.
Anyway, it functions flawlessly. If you need a shotgun for near 200.00, I can give you this one for 225.00 with the 2 barrels. It needs nothing and works perfect. It's heavy, it's all metal with no plastic and is ready to hunt.  Will trade for a good .22 or a larger caliber rifle
Thanks."

The SRM Arms Model 1216 semi-automatic shotgun is a new concept in shotgun design, one that features a detachable high-capacity magazine that holds 16 rounds of either 2 3/4 or 3-inch shells in four separate feed tubes. After firing four rounds, a shooter must rotate the magazine to the next feed tube to fire the next four rounds, until all four chambers are empty.

Roller delayed action provides fast cycling and reduced felt recoil, while an integrated picatinny rail combined with a 3-face handguard rail offers the shooter a broad range of options for mounting optics, sights and tactical accessories. Pushpin disassembly and break open design allows for easy field stripping and maintenance, while the ambidextrous receiver and controls make SRM Arms’ 1216 one of the most innovative new products on the market.
Design Features of the SRM 1216 include:

        Ergonomic compact design along with the flexibility of a detachable magazine provides unsurpassed firepower, force multiplication, and tactical advantages.



        Rotary, Detachable high capacity magazine holding 8, 12, or 16 rounds of either 2 3/4 or 3 inch shotshells.



        Semi-automatic action that self feeds following the rotation of the quad-tube, revolving magazine.

The recoil spring is over the op-rod so there is no “twang” in your ear as your head rests on the rifle’s stock while the bolt cycles between shots. 

Having the recoil system up front over the barrel puts it where it naturally pushes the rifle back down on target instead of up and into your shoulder. 

The TTR’s gas system not only improves target acquisition but it also keeps the chamber area cleaner. The gases that flow through the tube inside the op-rod are expelled through the Manifold Injector System™ (MIS™) in the bolt carrier making it the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world.

Then if THEY get registration thru all guns and ammo will have tight control.  I guess they will let us have a box of ammo to go to the range w/ and turn in the empties so we don't have any 'stanched' away.

Interarms of Virginia handled the sale of these HSc's.  Here's a little history on this pistol.  The Mauser factory was shut down by 1947 (after the end of W.W.II).  The plant in Germany was reopened in 1967 and from October of 1968 to December of 1977 only 63,118 HSc Pistols  were manufactured with about 2/3 of them being the .380acp (9mm Kurz) and 1/3 being the .32 (7.65mm).  The end of this 11 year run was capped by a Special Production group of 5000 of these HSc pistols in both calibers.  This one is #3308 of the 5000 in the 9mm Kurz (.380acp).  It has the American Eagle Seal on the right side of the slide. Blueing is 100%. 

This pistol IS unfired and appears to have never even had a bullet loaded in a magazine. Comes with all of the original paperwork and cleaning brush.  The outer box shoes come wear but the inner plastic case/box is as new, 100%.  There is a very thin piece of protective foam inside the plastic case that is showing its age as well.  This is a true collectors piece.  The price is $750.  I will consider a partial trade (fire arms only).  This pistol will make a fine addition to anyone's collection.  

you may email with you contact information and your name.  Emails that are rude or do not come with a name will not be responded to.  I will ship this pistol through an FFL but all expenses related to shipping and FFL are the responsibility of the buyer.

I decided to take a break from staring at my glass and do some accessorizing to my AR.  (start sarcasm) In a moment of pure genius I bought the wrong colored Magpul grip. (end sarcasm) At the time I could have sworn it was black, however, I will now blame it on the copious amounts of 80 proof spirits sloshing around in my belly.  

This magpul grip arrived at my house 3 days later and to my surprise it was OD green.  I instantly cursed the Scotch and myself for making a drunken purchase online.  Since I do not want 1 part of my gun to be doing its own thing, I have decided I must either return or sell this grip.  

Returning it would force me to take a trip to the post office and interact with a person I do not like very much.  Unfortunately I do hold a grudge and 5 years ago the postal lady rejected me from mailing a package because I had forgot to sign the back of my newly issued check card.  When I offered to sign it on the spot, she told me I could not use it there that day because now they knew it was unsigned and it was NOT LEGAL for them to accept it.  Power trip much?  With a 1 finger salute I left the post office and ever since then, interaction with this United States Government employee has been awkward at best.

If you would like to buy this grip from me for $20 it is yours.  If you offer me $15 I would rather face the evil post office lady and ship it back for a $22 refund"

The complete upper receiver assembly can be purchased direct from Armalite or a 3rd party to complete the rifle, which does not require going through an FFL.

I bought these items a couple years ago because they were the components most vulnerable to future bans, and I wanted to be “grandfathered in”. 

I am in NY State, but can't sell it here now due to the new laws. So I would like to do a face-to-face deal near the NY/PA border. I will need to see government ID to prove you are 21 or older. I can also ship to an FFL of your choice for the cost of shipping and insurance.

*Brand new Smith & Wesson Shield 40*
Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite® coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

It has a scope, with scope rings attached. A laser bore sight for .223. (3) .223 five round magazines, and (2) .222 five round magazines.
Also comes with 140 rounds of .222 Remington.
Has a 1:14 twist, which prefers the 55gr loads, and fires milsurp 5.56 well.
Valued around $775.
Only reason I'm wanting to trade is because of the craziness for .223 at this time, and I just picked up another bolt action, so the rifle fills a role I have filled in other ways.
Very little interest in cash, just trades. 


I also have an Mtech crossbow rated at 80 lbs, if I recall. It's all set up, and hardly used. Shoulder injury doesn't allow me to use it anymore. The bolts for it have been lost in a move, so the $100 dollar value is closer to $75.
Not expecting to get much for it, just hoping it can sweeten a trade.

I value my privacy, so if I don't get back to you anytime after 4PM, I'm not interested in your trade. I just don't want to send my email out to people I don't want to do business with.
But offers, and pictures are always welcomed, and if your offer is interesting, I have quite a few well set up pictures."

It is a brand new, never assembled Armalite complete lower receiver assembly with collapsible stock with six 20-round Armalite mags. The mags are brand new pre-ban mags I purchased direct from Armalite. They are the Armalite original M-14 based mags.

This lower is 100% Armalite, quality forged 7075-T73 aluminum, complete, fully assembled by Armalite, and ready for your choice of Armalite platform compatible upper assemblies.

The complete upper receiver assembly can be purchased direct from Armalite or a 3rd party to complete the rifle, which does not require going through an FFL.

I bought these items a couple years ago because they were the components most vulnerable to future bans, and I wanted to be “grandfathered in”. 

I am in NY State, but can't sell it here now due to the new laws. So I would like to do a face-to-face deal near the NY/PA border. I will need to see government ID to prove you are 21 or older. I can also ship to an FFL of your choice for the cost of shipping and insurance."

Have raised the amount I will pay to attain a like said rifle. I will be going to the gunshow this weekend to buy one if I dont get an offer. Have had several interested sellers…but had missing pieces. So in order to make things easier I have lowered my expectations.

I will now also consider just a standard bolt action that is tube fed or magazine fed with iron sights, but would prefer it to be a older wood stock style. Condition of the stock is not super important.

What I am really looking for is very unique and so far all I have had is zero luck thus why the broadend scope. I am in the market for a .22 long or .22 WMR rifle bolt action that has a peep sight or was used as a training rifle. I went down to gallensons and saw a few, but all were missing pieces. I would prefer one that is all together and in shooting condition. I would love this to be my target shooter and something I could use for many many decades to come. 

The last one I saw was an old mossberg and sons and it was 75$ and I am still kicking myself on not buying it. I feel my price range is fair, and there are alot of them on arms list.com…I just cant drive to washington to get them. Lets keep this local, and easy for a old guy. I really prefer either tube fed or magazine, but single shots can be looked at. 

Please if you have something that fits this bill help me out and shoot me a call or text. I only have so much cash, but would love to get a ton of rabbit hunting done this summer. 

Russian guns, american guns, romanion guns, all models considered. Again magazine or tube fed prefered.

[edit] HistoryThe Golden Model 39A started life as the Marlin Model 1891, the first lever action rifle ever chambered in .22LR and the magazine was loaded through a conventional side gate in the receiver. The tubular magazine was changed to front-loading with the Model 1892, due to the difficulties of receiver feeding the small rimfire round.[2] The 1892 gave way to the takedown Model 1897,[3] which became the Model 39 in 1921 and Model 39-A in 1937.[4] The Golden Mountie Model 39A was introduced in 1954.[5] The 39 was produced until 1983 when the current Golden 39A was introduced. Changes between models were so minimal the rifle is considered to have been continually produced to the same basic specifications for over 100 years. The Model 39-A did not have a cross hammer safety, whereas the current Golden Model 39A has had one since introduction in 1983. The Golden 39A is still considered one of the finest examples of a lever .22 rifle, and one of the most accurate .22 rifles ever produced. It is also the best-selling lever rimfire in U.S. history.[6] Additionally ""mountie"" versions have been produced at various points in the rifle's life which featured a shorter 20"" barrel and a straight stock. These rifles have been alternately called Model 39M or 1897 Mountie. The Mountie has a magazine capacity of 20 Short, 16 Long or 15 Long Rifle .22 cartridges.

Since the early 1950s Marlin has used their proprietary Micro-Groove rifling in the Model 39A. This rifling uses many small lands and grooves rather than 2, 4, or 6 deeper grooves used by the majority of rifle makers. The rifling is also made to a 1 in 16"" right hand twist. The combination of these two factors arguably adds to the accuracy of the rifle and indeed the 39A's reputation would seem to bear this out.

The Model Golden 39A is built of forged steel parts and American grown black walnut. It is one of the very few remaining .22 rifles with easy takedown ability (it can be taken apart using a coin). The screw that allows the easy takedown, however, is frequently criticized as it disrupts the otherwise clean lines of the rifle. Further, in the event of a malfunction which prevents the breech from closing, takedown becomes impossible until the action can be cleared as the breech must be closed before takedown. The Model Golden 39A has a solid-top receiver and side ejection, which makes mounting a scope easy. One source claims that the signature gold trigger was discontinued in favor of a blued trigger between 1982 and 1985, but at least one ""Original Golden 39A"" from 1982 (SN 18260086) was made with the gold trigger, perhaps as a special order.

The Marlin Model Golden 39A is still commercially available with a 24"" (61cm) round barrel, a pistol grip, and a signature golden colored trigger. The Golden 39A has a full length steel tubular magazine under the barrel with a brass inner tube and a hammer block safety. Magazine capacity is as follows: 26 .22 Short, 21 .22 Long, or 19 .22 Long Rifle [7] (total capacity is often cited as 26 Short, 21 Long or 19 Long Rifle counting a round preloaded in the firing chamber). Many previous variations of the model are still available from used gun dealers.
