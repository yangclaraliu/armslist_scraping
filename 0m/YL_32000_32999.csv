2 Remington 10 rd magazines.  I recently purchased one of these, it's still in the package.

The skinny: This is not you're average .22.  This thing is beautiful.  I just bought this less than a month ago from a member on okshooters, he told me he hadn't put many rounds through it since he'd purchased it.  I haven't even fired it yet myself.  I bought it about 3 weeks ago for $340.  An unexpected family emergency has come up and I need the cash more than I need another .22 so as much as I hate to see it go without even getting to send one down the tube, I need to.  If you have any questions feel free to email me.  

This rifle is beautiful and it's not dinged up and beat up.  It's as close to ""New in box"" condition without being brand new as you can get.  

As much as I hated to, I've lowered the price to $320.  Considering there is now an extra magazine and I paid more for it, the deal is even sweeter now.  

Hey to the guy I purchased it from, sorry for using your pictures but something came up and I had to unload this thing quickly to come up with cash and I didn't have any pictures.  I hope you're not angry about it."

This lightweight Hoyt bow weighs only 3.9 lbs. It can be adjusted from 23.5 to 30 draw-lengths and gives IBO speed of 321 FPS. The AlphaMax riser is the highlight of the AlphaMax 32. It has more open spaces to make it lighter in weight. Plus, it has XTS laminated limbs that are reduced and narrower to add to the lightness. Want more, the AlphaMax 32 also has redesigned ZT Lock limb pockets and upgraded XTR Cams to suit the redesigned AlphaMax riser and limbs. It is setup with a 28"" draw with a half inch d-loop to make the draw length 28.5, I have the draw pull set at 62# but it has the 60-70# limbs on it.. I haven't even dialed the sights in on this bow yet. I have alot of money in this setup so i'm asking $800. May take a trade on guns or ? just let me know what you have.

I also have a Targa GT model 26, 25acp found this one way deep in the back of my safe under some other stuff i dont need to look at to often kinda forgot i had it.

Also has wood grips and the original box.

I have a 12 ga. from Century International Arms.  Its model is the Century International Arms Ultra 87.  It will chamber both 2-3/4"" and 3"" 12 ga. shells.  It has a 19"" cylinder bore barrel, sling swivels, 5-round magazine capacity, day-glo orange rifle sights, and synthetic stocks.

I purchased this shotgun from Century; they said it might need a tuneup from a gunsmith.  When I tore it apart to clean it, everything seemed functional except for the ejector spring (missing).  I can attest that the shotgun ejects rounds fine without it (will eject shells several feet).  It appears the arms holding the shells in the magazine need to be adjusted as a new round isn't always released into the action when the slide is pushed rearward.  Safety, trigger, etc. all functions fine.  It just needs a going-over by someone with a little time and patience, hence the low price.

Let me know if you're interested and we'll get together.  Price is negotiable, just shoot me an email."

I have purchased most of the required hardware from HDPS.org for the conversion. This isn't your typical SW (special weapons) conversion.

I have also added the following:

ZF 3x4° dual optical sight that combines a 3x magnified telescopic sight (with the main reticule designed for firing at 200 m and bullet drop compensation markings for: 200, 400, 600 and 800 m cross hairs and a range-finding scale) and an unmagnified reflex red-dot sight (calibrated for firing at 200 m) mounted on top of the telescopic sight. The red dot sight is activated by ambient light during the day and requires battery power in a zero light environment. The optical sight system is produced by Hensoldt AG (a subsidiary of Carl Zeiss AG).

G36 front Hand guard 

Heckler and Koch removable folding bi-pod

Heckler and Koch Folding butt stock

SW AR15 magazine well conversion-Completed

Clear Ram-Line AR15 magazine

Heckler and Koch G36 SEF lower (with SL8 trigger group installed)

I haven't done anything with the barrel. I like the recessed crown it has.

The rifle is very nice shooter; it has a very smooth action. I prefer the shooting quality of this rife as compared to my AR-15. The amazing thing is you can shoot over 60 rounds through her and the changer/bolt area won't even get dirty. 

Why it's for sale?
My ultimate goal is to get a solid long range rifle. I'm looking at the Remington 700 .308 family.  I will also trade straight up for a Schmidt and Bender PMII 5-25x56 P4 Fine.
 I believe the value of the rifle I'm selling to be in the $3,500 range as compared to the brake down of parts. Please let me know if you are interested. 
I will ship from my FFL to yours. I cannot ship to California residents. 

$3,000 Face to face sell.

In Very Good condition. The P-64 pistol (official designation 9 mm pistolet wz. 1964) was developed in Poland during late 1950s and early 1960s, as a compact and lightweight replacement for Tokarev TT pistols, manufactured in Poland under soviet license. Following the Soviet road, Poland replaced the powerful 7.62x25mm ammunition with less powerful, but still effective 9x18 Makarov ammunition. P-64 has been used by both Polish military and police, and still can be found in holsters of some Polish police officers. In military service it has been superseded in mid-1980s by the P-83 pistol. The P-64 was small and light enough for a pocket or a concealed carry sidearm. P-64 is a blowback operated, semi-automatic weapon, made almost entirely of steel. P-64 is hammer fired, with double-action trigger and decocking safety, mounted at the left side of the slide. Safety features also include loaded chamber indicator in the form of a small pin, which protrudes from the back of the slide, above the hammer, when chamber is loaded with cartridge. Trigger guard is a separate unit, which is hinged to the frame and served as a disassembly lever when pulled down. Single stack magazine contains only 6 rounds, and magazine release catch is located at the bottom of the grip. Perfect for licensed concealment carry.

I have personally shot this rifle under .5 MOA at one hundred yard, and have consistently shot 1 MOA at 500 yards,  and hit man size steel silhouettes at 700 no problem, Im sure that this rifle is capable of longer distance, but this is the farthest my club has to offer.  Furthermore this gun also outshoots my FN SPR, Remington M-24, Remington 700 PSS, for about 1/4 the price.  I will not ship, Furthermore purchaser must have a valid CODL, is 21+ and meet state firearms purchase eligibility, and will sign a affidavit stating the above.

A Full octagon barrel and full length magazine tube which holds 15 rounds. The barrel and tube have developed an eye appealing even light chocolate brown patina. The barrel shows silvering on edges and scattered light pitting. Both have scattered light rust specks and a few nicks and scratches. Lettering on top barrel flat crisp including patent dates. The receiver retains about 75% original bright blue with silvering on edges and light rust specks and light pitting towards the front. Bright nitre on loading gate and trigger. Strong blue remains on bottom tang. Good case color on hammer and faded color on finger lever. Frame screw heads have very slight raised edges. Buttplate is gray with pitting on top. The stock is overall smooth with the buttstock showing no visible cracks and only a few light scattered indentations. The forend has lesser handling but does have a small worn chip on right side adjacent to cap. Made from 1883 to 1885, this levergun was part of Colt's plan to provide a well-rounded complement of firearms to the shooting public. Produced in caliber .44-40 in both carbine and rifle form, just a little over 6,000 were ever produced. According to stories when Colt tooled up to produce this levergun, Winchester tooled up and made a few revolvers. Winchester then told Colt they were thinking of going into the handgun business, especially if Colt was going to go into the levergun business! Shortly thereafter Colt dropped the Burgess and Winchester made no more handguns."

My last pistol is a sister pistol of the one that I sold here last week.  It is a Like New In The Box Kimber Desert Warrior.  This pistol was shot less than 50 times.  There is nothing wrong with anything regarding this gun.   

The Desert Warrior has all match grade components including the frame from Kimbers Custom shop.  It is a Custom 2 gun, but it is a series 70, it does not have the junk series 80 Schwartz firing pin safety which was a bad idea.  The pistol comes from the factory with the Kimpro finish witch protects it from everything.  The gun also has a rail for mounting accessories.  There were only a handful of these made and most collectors bought them up, I had 4 of these two weeks ago and now down to this last one.  The gun is flawless.  This is rare opportunity to buy one of these guns in this condition alone.  Price is $1150 firm.  No trades, just cash.

You must have a valid Colorado I.D. and be able to legally purchase firearms.  I will keep your name, drivers license number and current address on file per law.

Give me a call if you are interested in seeing the gun. REDACTED
