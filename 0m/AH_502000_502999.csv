I'll consider any revolver from Ruger, Colt, S&W, Taurus, Rossi, even those cheap Saturday night specials. Wanting a snub nose, but I won't turn down a good offer.

It's fast as heck and runs good. I will be deploying soon and do not want it to sit for a year. I'd rather have money waiting on me to get back or a bunch of guns sitting in my closet. I can ride the bike to you. Just shoot me a cash offer but no low ballers. Things wrong with the bike: It has been DROPPED not layed down while on the rode. It has been dropped in the grass in the previous owner's yard. He cracked the front fender and the left blinkers on the ground. The tank has a tiny quarter sized dent from the handle bars. That's why you don't go offroading on a cruiser... Things that are great about the bike: Runs GREAT. Goes really fast and is really loud. Has cobra pipes but will come with originals too. I'll even give you all 3 of my helmets. I have two opened face and one full face. The full face is a large and has flip down shades for the sun it's brand new, and I have one medium and one small open faced. Weird I know, but they all fit me great. If you send me a trade offer, I will take partial trade but I am interested in assault rifles, battle rifles, H&K handguns, Glock handguns, Walther handguns, and cowboy revolvers like Ruger Vaquero's, Colt SAAs, etc. I will also consider snubbies and other wheel guns. Basically just let me know what you have but NO shotguns, .22's, and crap like that. I'm not into hunting anymore. The only shotgun I may consider to put in the trade would be a nice double barrel but only if it's a short one like an 18"" barrel or less or if it's a nice over under.  Cash price and trade value is $4500 OBO but like I said, no low ballers. I can ride the bike to you but only as far as Ralleigh or Wilmington. Can email or text pictures but only to serious inquiries, don't waste my time. The bike is red and chrome."

I participated in July and had a lot of fun and learned much more than I thought I would.  I qualified as a Rifleman with my AR but I feel so strongly about getting my friends and family to participate, I am willing to try and get ahold of a few used Ruger 10/22's to have on hand, setup with aperture sights for use in the apppleseed shoots.  I own one Ruger 10/22 which I have done a lot of my own work on, setup for silhouette matches, so I would prefer to leave it alone.  I am very familier with the 10/22, if you have one that is in need of a little work, not a problem.  If you're looking to trade one in, please let me have a chance to buy it first.  I was in a local gun shop in Northern Racine county prior to the appleseed shoot and they just got in a used 10/22 on trade for sale for $125.  I should have bought it the day I was there, but waited a few days, called and it was sold.  The first one I get I plan on trying to get my dad to participate in the event, I'm not sure how much response I'll get from this but if you have one collecting dust or want to upgrade, please consider emailing.  I can show my drivers license and Wisconsin CCW license to prove I do not have any criminal history.  I'm completely honest in my intensions written here.

I got a Bushmaster ARM, it dry fires and will cycle rounds by hand just fine. It's from about the 70's and is considered a Pistol. There were only a few thousand made and this is one of them. It takes AR15 magazines and P-mags fit inside of it and cycles by hand as well. No magazines are included though. This one has a very low serial number, in the 400's. It looks like it could use a paint job, but it looks like a cool gun and is VERY RARE. After a new paint-job it could be worth quite a bit more than I am listing it for. This is quite the collector's piece.  I am looking for a sale or  trade (even multiple guns on your end), but prefer partial trade. I'm not looking to trade up at all.

I WILL NOT TRADE THIS FOR A $250 GUN I AM NOT RETARDED. Please do not treat me like I am, I will not treat you like you are. This is probably your ONLY chance to own one of these guns and I am even selling this for a steal! I WILL TAKE MULTIPLE GUNS IN TRADE THAT ARE LISTED BELOW. IF YOUR GUN DOES NOT EQUAL THE VALUE OF THIS ONE, THEN YOU ARE TO ADD CASH TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE.

DON'T EMAIL ME RETARDED OFFERS.  I am not stupid, but I may take reasonable offers of guns and cash or combinations of the two. I AM FIRM ON THE PRICE TAG AND VALUE OF THIS GUN.

You can buy replacement foam from Pelican Cases so you can cut it for whatever you'd like. I have the current foam cut out to hold the following(none of which is included):

-Flat top AR
-3-9x32 scope
-red dot sight
-6 30 rd AR magazines
-dual AR mag clamp
-Grip Pod
-forward vertical grip
-flip up front and rear sights
-cantilever flashlight mount for quad rail 
-quad rail covers
-full size handgun in holster such as an XD/m, MP, Glock, HK etc.,
-3 double stack handgun magazines

I just ordered a bigger Pelican Case and no longer need this one and would like to trade it for optics to go on an AR project. I put the trade value on the case with the foam around $110-$120 since they sell for $180-$200 new without the foam. If need be, I can meet up with you anywhere between Elizabethtown and Upton. Thank you for taking the time to read my post."

Rifle is brand new, again I say brand new, all the accessories are brand new as well. Only reason I'm wanting to part with this set-up is I have been blessed with a new job, and I just dont have the time to devote to precision shooting like I want. This rifle is not even 3 months old, never been shot, hence the new condition. This is not your average 308, this is a serious precision shooting tool, very well balanced and sturdy. Excellent machining and tight tolerances. I'll list out everything that you will be getting, if you have any questions please feel free to contact me. Cash only and not accepting trades unless it's of the M1 Garand type. I'm very familiar with M1's so dont try any fast ones! ;-) K98's, Enfields. I like WWII era battle weapons to keep it simple. I'm assuming if your looking at this rifle, you know the cost's involved in obtaining accuracy, I have to say it because it always happens, please no low ballers!!!

I have only shot about 200 rounds through it. I had a red dot on it and it was extremely accurate.

This is a rare AK, they are not making or distributing them anymore. It is made to a higher quality standard, you will see every inch of this rifle is machined cleaner, fit and finish is hands above a Romanian. The receiver is thicker than a normal AK and the barrel is too, so that it could be used to shoot grenades. There is a grenade sight on the gas tube as you can see. It also has an extra flip up sight in both the front and rear iron sights that could be set up with night sights.

The bolt and carrier/charging handle rod is stainless steel. The machining is so fine, that you can rack the action with just your pinky.

Im asking 750.00$ Check your local gun store, regular AK 47s are really hard to find now, everyone is buying up assault rifles before the election potential gun ban days ahead of us. By Christmas this one will be selling for around 900$ The price on 556 ammo is going to continue to go up, but good old Russian 762x39 will continue to be available for much less and greater firepower. This is a gun you roll in the mud and will shoot perfectly every time.

I have had several AKs and this one is the finest I have seen. There are no more Yugo's being made, so get a great piece for your collection, that is rare and going to increase in value.

Comes with steel magazine, and original polymer fore-end pieces. {Tapco polymer mags work great too.}"

This is an original Norinco NHM 90 rifle in 7.62x39 that has been converted to the originally intended AKM format. It is built on a stamped receiver and has laminated wood furniture with a tapco slant muzzle brake. This weapon is the very definition of reliability and has functioned flawlessly every time it was taken to the range. The round count is still under 2000 and even though its an AK platform rifle, it has been maintained as meticulously as any AR could hope to be.

Also included is 300 rounds of steel cased ammo (which has always shot like a dream in the firearm) and two steel 30 round magazines.

I apologize for the horrid pictures but I cant seem to find my camera when I need it. I can e-mail somewhat better quality when I locate it if necessary."

The gun works flawlessly, even though Kimber's are notorious for their ""break in periods"" this gun has had zero FTF's or jams.  It has Trijicon night sights and they are awesome.   I also have 3 Kimber factory magazines, the original owners manual and Kimber case which i will include too.  

This gun is a true work of art.  

I take good care of my guns, both times after shooting i cleaned and oiled it.  The MSRP on the Kimber website is $1,380.00 which is pretty much what i paid for it.  

I would also be willing to trade for an AR-15 or AK-47.  I am asking $975.00 which is more than a fair price for a basically brand new gun.

It's had a bunch of upgrades and has amazing trigger. Gun comes with 2x 18 round mags because of +1 pinky rest floor plate and 2x 17 round mags,night sights,extended slide release,polished inners,spring kit.

Weapon is in good condition - couple of dings in the finish that don't affect function or performance in the least.

Sling swivels on fore-end clamp and stock, front bead sight, space to mount a tactical rail along the top for ghost rings or other optics.

Functions flawlessly (it's a Remington 870!), I've never had a FTF or FTE with it and has about 400 rounds through it.  Had it for HD so it spent a fair amount of time magnetically attached to the side of my headboard in the bedroom.

 BLACKSIDE 45 is a handgun suppressor designed from the ground up to be the shortest, lightest weight, and highest efficiency suppressor in the most compact package possible. Highest performance is achieved with only a minimal amount of artificial environment (such as light oil). Although not as efficient dry, it is acceptable when artificial environment media is unavailable. The mount features positive front stop threading to reduce thread wear and provide proper alignment on 1911 and other pistols. The BLACKSIDE may be ordered with your choice of recoil booster thread pitch (L.I.D.) or on special order, the unboosted variant for the 1911 may be requested for the lightest and shortest possible package.
