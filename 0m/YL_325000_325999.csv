I am selling my two tone HK USP 9MM, V1. This gun is as new. It comes with two 10 round mags, three 15 round mags and three 18 round mags and a Galco IWB holster. 

I bought this HK brand new and put 50 rounds through it. I then loaded it up with bullets and placed it in the safe for home defense. I bought a holster for it last year thinking I would carry it CCW, but it was just a little too big for my liking. This gun is a true safe queen and needs somebody to take it out and shoot it like it was meant to be shot.

I have too many firearms and too little space, so I'm going to thin out the collection a bit.  Here's an AWESOME Spike's Tactical M4 Lightweight Carbine with Eotech Clone Red Dot Scope.  If you're reading this ad, you already know that Spike's Tactical is one of the few true ""Tier 1"" AR-15 manufacturers.  The quality is outstanding.  This rifle is a gently used (under 500 rounds) Spike's complete lower receiver mated with a brand-new, only-test-fired-by-Spike's Lightweight M4 upper receiver.  This is a fantastic quality rifle from a manufacturer with a 3 month waiting list.  The Eotech is one of the high-quality clones, not a cheap knockoff.  I'm asking $1100 cash for the complete M4 carbine with sight.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks for looking.

The original varnish on the walnut pistol grip stock is chipped and scratched but the wood is good. The metal finish is smooth, mostly gone to plum brown or silver, not rusty or pitted. It's never been polished off or refinished, no dents or scratches on the original metal finish. So, it ain't pretty BUT the action is crisp, smooth and tight. If you close your eyes, it feels better than any modern pump that I've handled. So, it's up to you. Get a new shotgun made in Russia, Turkey, China, that may be about the same price and MAY work okay or get a historic quality made weapon. NOT interested in trades, shipping, or lowball offers. Local deal only.

This satin walnut set includes a Winchester butt plate and will fit .22 Long Rifle, .22 Magnum and .17 HMR models.  The forearm is the 8” piece.

These are Winchester factory originals and have not been carried so the checkering is still sharp and well defined.  Only thing done to this set is to wax it so it may appear slightly glossy in the photos but is the satin finish.

Here is a great way to upgrade your classic Winchester .22 if it has a worn or damaged stock or if you just want to change to a checkered set instead of the smooth stock set.  These sometimes show up at auction but tend to be hard to find since the 9422 model has been discontinued for a number of years. 

I tried to show three defects.  There are two very small spots on the bottom right side of the stock and a ding in the forearm.  The ding in the forearm will be under the barrel band and not at all visible.  The two spots on the stock are apparently a slight defect in the finish, possibly some sort of box wear.  In all other respects these look like new with no scratches or wear on the checkering or butt plate.

Asking $200 OBO which is a little more than half the price these normally go for."

Suomi was used with great sucess during Winter War of 1940 against the Soviet Union, when, wisely used, this SMG showed to the world the importance of the submachine guns to the modern warfare. Manufacture of the Suomi was ceased in Finland in 1944, but it was used well until the 1990s, when finally rendered obsolete and replaced by modern military rifles."

BUSHMASTER FIREARMS INTER ACR (Adaptive Combat Rifle) With ability to rapidly change calibers, barrel lengths and stock configurations, the Bushmaster ACR adapts to varied conditions like no rifle that has come before it. In minutes, without tools, it will go from 5.56mm to 6.8mm to 6.5mm by swapping the bolt head, barrel and magazine. With an exchange of stocks, barrels and accessories, it transforms from a close quarters weapon to a designated marksman platform. Simply put, the Bushmaster ACR is the highest evolution of modular rifle utility. This rifle is built specifically for law enforcement and tactical applications - with Bushmaster's unrivaled standards for durability and precision. They've nearly doubled barrel life and reduced maintenance with the addition of an innovative protective coating. This is also featured on action components for dramatically reduced wear and enhanced operation. For the ultimate blend of strength and reduced weight, they used rugged, high density composite for the hand guard, lower receiver and stock. The heart of the ACR is their gas piston operating system. It's torture tested and proven reliable in the most brutal conditions on the planet. From the magazine release and fire selector to the non reciprocating charging handle, ambidextrous controls optimize user effectiveness. Add Bushmaster's hallmark commitment to quality down to the slightest ingredient, and you have a platform that's a natural fit for any operator and every mission."

$100 (price includes shipping anywhere in the continental United States)

This is a weapon-mounted light for a Beretta 92 9mm without an accessory rail. You young kids probably have no idea what I'm talking about.

This was made back when ""Sure Fire"" was named ""Laser Products,"" and ""Sure Fire"" was one of their lines of flashlights. 

No alteration to the gun is required, but it does require replacing it with the Sure-Fire take-down lever (included and pictured below), which only takes a few seconds to swap out.

The adhesive on the switch is worn (I used double-sided tape), and the lens of the flashlight has black-flecks on it that I can't clean up.

The now discontinued OA-93 Carbine was an inovative design that placed the buffer assembly on top of the upper, allowing for the use of a side folding stock, much like the AK-47. Unfortunately, low sales at the time caused the discontinuing of the line. 

The lower receiver is post ban when Oly Arms, in answer to high demand for AR-15s, took some of the pre ban OA-93 pistol lowers off the shelf to make rifles after the restricitons from the Clinton Assault Weapons ban went away. Note the steel inserts at the front takedown pin. The OA-93 pistols had a larger front takedown lug on the upper to keep people from changing between pistols and rifles by switching uppers. I believe Oly Arms stopped making the OA-93 carbine around 2009.

For your consideration is a Beretta 948 .22 long rifle that was made in Italy in 1958. It comes with both barrels that are serial numbered to the gun, the original grips, a holster, and the Circassian walnut grips that are on the gun. I got this from the original owner who purchased it new in Rome while he was stationed in Italy. He was transferred to Turkey which is where he had the grips made. The pictures that I took aren't the greatest but I would rate the gun conservatively at 85%."

Out of the 8000 of these revolvers contracted for the US military, nearly all were modified with an internal cylinder lock and a lanyard ring.  This gun has no such modifications.  All serial numbers match and all cartouchings are intact and correct.  From the serial number, this gun is a first year issue (manufactured in 1892) and inspected by Captain David M Taylor in 1893.

From research that I've found, which is few and far between, there are very few known examples of unmodified 1892's.  Truly a once in a lifetime find!  85% overall condition.   Anyone with additional information that they're willing to share with me about this gun please do!

I bought this new yesterday at 5280 Armory, and it does not fit where I need it to. There's a no-return policy at 5280 (and now I'm paying the price for not bringing my rifle in with me when I purchased it). I payed almost $45 with Tax, will sell for $40.00 (OBO), and will deliver within a reasonable distance. 

The Daniel Defense 1 O’clock Offset Rail is optimized for mounting miniature red dot optics in the 1 O’clock (right-hand) or 11 O’clock (left-hand) positions for quick, non-magnified, transitions when employing magnified primary optics on AR-type rifles with MIL-STD-1913 rails. The geometry allows for zero cheek-weld shift during the transition. This facilitates very fast transitions from magnified to non-magnified optics, and back. The 1 O’clock Offset Rail can also be used to mount a variety of lights or other accessories that mount to a MIL-STD-1913 rail. By flipping the part upside-down, one can mount a light in a good position for use with a vertical foregrip.

All Daniel Defense Rails are built to the 1913 Military Specification and are 100% Quality Assurance checked for conformity to the specification.
