The Philly Connection is noted on the stock .  Which has stamped on both sides ""Property of Lubin Manufacturing Company"".  I have included some text discussing the History of the Company.
The Lubin Manufacturing Company was formed in 1902 and incorporated in 1909 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Siegmund Lubin. The company was the offspring of Lubin's film equipment and film distribution and production business began in 1896.

Siegmund Lubin, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, was originally an optical and photography expert in Philadelphia but who became intrigued with Thomas Edison's motion picture camera and saw the potential in selling similar such equipment as well as the making of films. Known as ""Pop"" Lubin, he constructed his own combined camera/projector he called a ""Cineograph"" and his lower price and marketing know-how brought reasonable success. In 1897 Lubin began making films for commercial release. Certain his business could prosper, the following year he rented low-cost space on the roof of a building in Philadelphia's business district. He exhibited his new equipment at the 1899 National Export Exposition in Philadelphia and the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.

The insatiable appetite of the American public for motion picture entertainment saw Lubin's film company undergo enormous growth. Aided by French-born writer and poet Hugh Antoine d'Arcy, who served as the studio's publicity manager, in 1910 Siegmund Lubin built a state of the art studio on the corner of Indiana avenue and Twentieth Street in Philadelphia that became known as ""Lubinville."" At the time, it was one of the most modern studios in the world, complete with a huge artificially lit stage, editing rooms, laboratories, and work shops. The facility allowed several film productions to be undertaken simultaneously. The Lubin Manufacturing Company expanded production beyond Philadelphia, with facilities in Jacksonville, Florida, Los Angeles, and then in Coronado, California. In 1912, Lubin purchased a 350-acre (1.4 km2) estate in Betzwood, in what was then rural countryside in the northwest outskirts of Philadelphia and converted the property into a studio and film lot.

Some of the pioneer actors who worked for Lubin included Harry Myers, Florence Hackett, Alan Hale, Arthur V. Johnson, Florence Lawrence, Ethel Clayton, Gladys Brockwell, Edwin Carewe, Ormi Hawley, Rosemary Theby, and Pearl White. Lubin films also marked the first film appearance of Oliver Hardy,[2] who started working at Lubin's Jacksonville, Florida studio in 1913. Hardy's first onscreen appearance was in the 1914 movie, Outwitting Dad where he was billed as O. N. Hardy. In many of his later films at Lubin, he was billed as “Babe Hardy.” He was most often cast as “the heavy” or the villain and had roles in comedy shorts, appearing in some 50 short one-reeler films at Lubin by 1915.

However, the company's downfall came even faster than its meteoric rise. Not being as adroit as its competitors in shifting to quality feature-length films plus a disastrous fire at its main studio in June 1914 that destroyed the negatives for a number of unreleased new films, severely hurt the business. When World War I broke out in Europe in September of that year, Lubin Studios, and other American filmmakers', lost a large source of income from these foreign sales. In 1915, the Lubin company entered into an agreement with Vitagraph Studios, Selig Polyscope Company, and Essanay Studios to form a film distribution partnership. However, the decline of the Lubin operations continued and the United States Supreme Court rulings against the monopoly of the Motion Picture Patents Company spelled the end of Lubin's business. After making more than a thousand motion pictures the corporation was forced into bankruptcy and on September 1, 1916 the Lubin Manufacturing Company closed its doors forever.

http://www.cflgunandtactical.com/servlet/the-32/POF-USA-P415-FACTORY/Detail

The manufacturing date of the complete lower is 4/30/2010.  All POF lower receivers are machined from 7075 aluminum, and are MilSpec type III hard coat anodized.  They have a flaired magwell for speed loads.

The manufacturing date of the SIG US516-16 upper is 4/13/2011.  SIG SAUER® advanced short-stroke pushrod system. This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment.
Features a free-floating, aluminum, M1913 quad rail and 1:7 right-hand twist bore configuration.

An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts.

You must be at least 18 with a valid Ohio DL.  I am really not interested in trades with the exception of possibly aSig P226 TACOPS and cash.  Take a serious look at this before you buy a DPMS,RRA, Spikes, etc.  They are all fine rifles but the are not the same as what you have an opportunity to buy here.  I will be listing this on paid sites so this is subject to prior sale.

The pictured optics (EOTech XPS-03 and Magnifier) and bi-pod are not included in this sale.  They work great and you can find them on-line for just over $1,100 for the pair."

This gas operated semi-automatic packs a bigger punch than our 5.56mm/.223models – a .270 cal. 6.8mm SPC (Special Purpose Cartridge) specifically developed for the military, but now available commercially. Velocity averages a bit over 2600 FPS (with Hornady 115 Gr.V-Max), and the heavier bullet weights deliver excellent terminal energies. The 6.8 mm SPC was developed from a .30 Remington case which is shortened slightly to fit the AR15 type magazine. Due to the “fatter” case diameter, magazine capacity in a 30 Round AR type shell is reduced to 26 Rounds, and 6.8 specific springs and followers are used. The bolt is also different - due again to case diameter (take care not to interchange a 5.56mm/.223 bolt with a 6.8mm SPC bolt).

The three included elevation drums are precisely calculated to compensate for the elliptical drop of 50-, 55- or 62-grain bullets. The trajectory is compensated to any given distance between 100 and 400 yards by turning the elevation drum to the desired distance."

From Brownell's website:
""Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."""

If you can get it cheaper through a local gun shop or an on line gun store, then do it. I'm asking a fair retail price. I'm a private owner, not a wholesaler. Please don't contact me if you can get it cheaper elsewhere and its in stock at your local store. If so, buy it there! Don't waste your time or mine.

Consider this:
1) availability - I had to wait six weeks; 2) shipping cost 3) FFL fees 4) taxes. Add cost of extra magazine, compensator and extra items listed; $370 is a fair price. The first person with the cash, gets the gun. I've held this gun for several people in the last two weeks just to get a message at the last minute that they can't buy it."

This thing is in beautiful shape!  

The bolt cycles smoothly.  The stock is in great shape, no cracks, a small nick here and there but otherwise beautiful.  The rifling is great and the bore is bright.

The gun shoots great and has no issues.

I'm not an expert on these but I believe this was made by the C.E. Welstead company in the UK.  It has the broadhead mark also.  Other markings I could find are:
CE1967 on the lower portion of the stock (I believe it was replaced)
CAI ST ALB import mark by the bayonet lug

It comes wearing a bolt on Weaver mount and Bushnell 3-9x40 scope.  The scope mount is the kind that bolts on and one could go back to traditional iron sights if you wanted to.  Unfortunately the rear sight has been misplaced but a new one can be found here:

American made 1911 clone, lacks grip safety and has its safety built into the slide.  Not 100% 1911 compatible.  All stainless steel.  Solid and well made gun.  Shoots well.  Originally they were plagued with reliability problems due largely to a lack of mainspring guide rod and a poor quality main spring.  This pistol has had a full length stainless steel two piece guide rod machined to fit it greatly reducing the reliability issue.  The only thing I would say it really needs is a new, better quality main spring.  It still has the original which lacks properly wound and ground ends.  That said, I would call this a pistol that is great inexpensive, low maintenance, durable fun for the shooting range.  But not one I would recommend for personal protection, at least until it gets a new mainspring.  Includes one Colt Delta Stainless 8 Round magazine.

Lowered Price, did more research.

For sale is a 1978 S&W 22lr 6"" Blued Revolver.

It was my father's and last it was shot was 2 years ago at the range, shot about 36 rounds. Probably about 150 to 250 total through it.  It just wasn't used at all. My father bought it new in 1978 and my brother and I have only shot it twice in over 10 years and no use for it now. 

Fully functional.  Don’t know where the original box or papers went.

I also have 300rds of 7.62x39 to throw in for the right trade.  Comes with 2 30rd magazines. 

Realistic cash offers only, low balls will be ignored!  I'd also be interested in home defense set up 870 12ga or Mossberg 500/590, or other types of tacti-cool pistols/rifles.  Thanks!"

The rotating motion of the barrel is controlled by the stud on its bottom, which follows the cam track in the steel frame insert.

All in good condition. Looking to narrow down the gun collection. Getting rid of some good guns to buy a great one. Really want an AK.

Have several scopes that can be attached, will give more info if needed.

Looking to sell as a PACKAGE. I know 500 looks like a lot for these but that's about $160 per gun..which is pretty fair in my book.
