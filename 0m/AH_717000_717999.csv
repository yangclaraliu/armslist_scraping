NOTES: Although the .40SW caliber is sometimes known as a ""snappy round,"" you'd never know it after firing this gun. It is a very smooth and highly accurate gun, even with factory sights. This gun does not jam and has been my personal sidearm of choice for defensive carry. 

On that note, there are some visible signs of wear on the slide. This is only due to holster wear, not abuse. I have cleaned it after each trip to the range.

While I was at work my roommate wmmas getting ready for a date and walked into a kitchen with two unknown men trying to unplug the refrigerator. We have changed all the locks and the last time they drilled out the deadbolt. I'm looking for a revolver for cheap as I'm rather broke. If you can take payments that would be great. I can pay $100 upfront and the rest we can discuss. Interested mostly in a 38 special and found a few on Gun Broker for around $200 but I can't come up with that all at once hence why Im looking to do payments. Or if you're willing I could do $100cash and about $300 in DVDs. I don't watch them really and most were purchased in the past 3 months and only watched once. I would take them to a pawn shop but they will only give me about 50 cents a movie and that's BS. Please if you can help me out it would make my Christmas and my year.

For sale Egyptian Hakim-8MM semi-automatic. In custom laminated stock with removable leather covered check piece; ready to be scoped. New Barrel. Very Very Nice gun, lightly used.  You should know that custom work was done on this gun's lower receiver to Accept B.A.R. and German 8mm Magazines.  There is 1 5rd BAR Mag, 1 20rd BAR mag, 2 20 rd German 8mm mags.  Also there's a german 8mm mag shell(not complete), should be used for experimentation.  THis was done due to the commonality of those magazines vs. Hakim at the time.  

There are misc parts included such as rear sight, front sight, flashider, complete UNALTERED lower receiver in great shape, buttbad, stock rings etc.  Someof the smaller parts have rust.  Also is included is a partial HAKIM(short Gas system, Bolt, and Lower internals) that is half in the process of being fitting to a fiberglass E2 stock that accepts an FAL grip.  The stock needs some fitting around the lower receiver should be replaced with the extra one i'm throwing in, as it has also been modified to take BAR mags(this way you could use actual HAKIM mags.  Finally there is original military stock in good shape, just needs cleaned up.  

The one on TOP I've had listed for the last week or so.  It will FEED and FIRE with the BAR mags.  The other should be considered a PROJECT.

There are almost enough parts here to build two hakims, and parts to experiment on as well before you do the real thing.  These are great guns, just havent been worked on in about 10 years, as we've moved onto several other projects and these just got boxed up.

Asking 500 

Can send additional pictures.  Will consider trades/partial trades, but mostly looking for CASH.

The original diamond checkered grips are in fine shape, free of cracks, just showing some normal wear. Excellent mechanics and good bore that shows strong rifling and some frost in the grooves. The correct two-tone magazine is in excellent condition and marked ""A"" on the toe indicating WWI manufacture by American Pin Co. Included is a 1918 dated US marked holster (overall excellent but with a repair to rear), and a pair of field binoculars w/ case. The binoculars are in good working order but do show some wear. These three items (pistol, holster, binoculars) was purchased from the original WWI Vet in the mid-1960's and have remained in one gentleman's collection since that time. The pistol has been cleaned and oiled, but never fired while in his possession. Records indicate that this pistol was shipped from Colt to the Springfield Armory on June 11, 1917.

I bought this CZ RAMI about 6 months ago as a concealed carry handgun.  It has seen about 200 rounds through it during that time, and has performed flawlessly.  It’s in excellent condition.  Looks practically new.  VERY accurate little handgun, shoots anything you feed it, and conceals very nicely for a subcompact, but doesn’t disappear in your hands like the KelTec’s, or other carry size 9mm’s.  

I’m selling b/c this is one of two that I own currently, and I can use the money for other things right now.

Comes w/ the following:
CZ 2075 RAMI-P w/ LimbSaver handgrip

I am looking to sell or trade (for an 1911 .45 and $$ on your side) my AR15 to get some extra money for xmax gifts and pay school tuition. This is a semi-automatic AR 15 with a quick adjustable vertical grip and an aftermarket barrel guard that has picatini rails on all 4 sides, and if you do not want to use them you can cover them up with the extra plates included...see photos. 
Included are also 2 x30 round mags and the original barrel grip as well as all the documentation and the cleaning plus the original padded case and extra scope lens protectors. The sight on the rifle is a AIM sight and although it was not one of those beyond reasonably priced sights it is very good for the purpose....you can easily hit your target at 100 yards and its adjustable for windage, elevation and bullet drop, has zoom in capability and a quick release mounting bracket...very good sight all in all. 
I purchased this gun from budsgunshop.com and had it shipped to a dealer where i had it transferred, i honestly put about 120 rounds through it at the plantation range in bellingham and thats it...as you can tell by the case its been sitting in the case for a long time. The rifle is clean and ready to go to a good home. 
THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR THAT HUNTING/GUN ENTHUSIAST IN YOUR FAMILY...shoot me an offer!"

522,http://www.armslist.com/posts/717522,For Sale:  Bersa BP9CC as new in box compact carry 9mm,"Spartanburg, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 400,"Listed On: Thursday, December 13, 2012",Handguns,Bersa-Eagle                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Overall dimensions for the BP9CC are 6.35-inches long, 4.8-inches tall and 0.94-inches wide. It weighs 21.1 ounces, unloaded, and has a 3.3-inch barrel. External controls include an ambidextrous magazine release button—in its usual position just behind the trigger guard—a disassembly pin and a key-operated locking safety. Other safety features are the loaded-chamber indicator—a metal flag behind that ejection port that is raised by the rim of a chambered cartridge—and a magazine disconnector that prevents firing if a magazine is not fully seated and locked in the magazine well. The stamped metal magazine holds eight rounds and utilizes a plastic follower.

The Bersa’s polymer frame has a fairly unique and modern appearance. Made of what Bersa calls High Impact polymer, it felt light but rigid. Applying pressure to the sides of the empty magazine well yielded no discernible flexing. Molded into the dustcover is a 1 1/2-inch section of Picatinny rail. Behind that, and just above the front of the trigger guard, an arrowhead-shaped portion of the frame has molded-in stippling in a fine, mosaic-like pattern. The stippled area tapers back toward the shooter and serves to guide the trigger finger into a good “ready” position outside and above the trigger well. It is present on both the right and left side of the frame. Also featuring stippling are two polygonal sections on each of the grip panels, providing purchase for the tips of the three supporting fingers. Front- and backstrap molding consists of shallow grooves that curve around the grip and angle down from back to front. The frame seems well made and the molding is precise and consistent.

Your are looking at my Model 21 Beretta Bobcat 7 round mag .22 LR that I am looking to sell. This little bad boy has been my trusted ""bar gun"" for years and thankfully i never had to use it, but i am sure you know the feeling of packing or not packing when you go out at night! It is the most concealable gun i have ever owned, i mean this thing is smaller then ones hand but at the same time packs a punch and is very comfortable to carry or hold. This model would also make a great lady or starter gun, but the main reason i got it is for its compact-ability. I no longer need it as i have a wife thats not big on guns now lol...and no more bars for this guy :( 
BTW: the pic only shows 6 rounds but it takes 7...one fell on the floor during photo shoot!

This is a great option if you're looking for a subcompact 9mm but don't want to spend a fortune on a Kimber Solo or if you want more ammo per mag than the Glock 26.

Bell & Carlson's Medalist Stocks were designed from the ground up to help maximize a rifle's performance by providing a rock-solid, ergonomic firing platform incorporating the accuracy enhancing characteristics demanded by today's serious shooters and the resilience necessary for use in extreme environmental conditions.

A precision, CNC-machined aluminum bedding block makes contact with the full length of the rifle's action, ensuring a perfect metal-to-metal fit as well as aligning the barreled action, stiffening the forend, and eliminating the need for conventional bedding methods. Medalist stocks come complete with a premium Pachmayr Decelerator recoil pad, front & rear sling swivel studs and a textured exterior surface. Stock comes with a lifetime factory warranty on materials and workmanship.

NOTE: This Sporter style stock is designed to fit Right Hand, Long Action Savage 110 Series Rifles with a blind magazine. Stock weight is approximately 3 - 3.25 lbs.

If you require more info, please email me.
My name is Dave,
I am the owner of DR's Coins & Collectibles in Lakeland FL. I don't have a store front right now, I mainly deal at Coin Shows and on the internet.  Currently I am enrolled in an online college program at Penn Foster to earn a Gunsmithing Degree and get my FFL. I have been working on this degree since August 2012 and I should be done in July of 2013. 
I am trying to aquire, either cheap or for free, unwanted gun parts, and certain tools that are useful in the gunsmithing field. I currently build custom AR-15's and then sell them in a private sale(I can send you photo's of one of my most recent builds). Some of the tools I am looking for are for stock making and grip making. 
Tools like Scroll Saws, sanders, wood chisels and hand lathes, stuff like that.
I'm not trying to be a cheap SOB and get free stuff, several unexpected situations came up in November that cost me over $5,000. On Thanksgiving, I got in a car accident and the other guy took off, I had to pay a $1,000 deductible for my car to get repaired, and I had to pay $4,750 in medical expenses, and a rental car. Now with Christmas right around the corner, I am just trying to reduce my expenses for a month or two, and be able to further my education and small business plan.

If you can be of any help, I would really appreciate it. If I don't move out of FL, I hope to open my business in Lakeland or Auburndale in late 2013.
You can check my DBA on SunBiz. Org, but it is DR's Coins & Currency. All the info is still accurate.
Please call or email me with your name and what you have. I can drive to meet you. I live in Lakeland. 
The only stuff I really have for trade is Bass fishing tackle.
Thanks very much for reading this. Have a great and safe holiday season."

It is chambered in 7.62X54R (Russian) features a 18 1/8” barrel overall w/ flash suppressor welded. I have performed a reverse rivet process where all the rivets are welded flush into the receiver. The safety has an extended finger latch so you can easily activate/deactivate it. The PSL also has a Harris Bipod and 2 MOE Magpul rail sections attached to the sides of the hand guards.

All furniture is wood but I have refinished to make it look like synthetic. It also has a side mount weaver rail and includes a BSA Mil-Dot 6-24X40 scope w/ rings. BSA is not a very high quality brand but it matches the gun. It is always good to have an extra scope lying around too. The PSL is coated with Cerakote in Coyote Tan and Magpul Foliage Green™. I will do a lifetime warranty on the Cerakote application. PSL has 2 mags.

I also have 1000 +/- 100 or so rounds (not sure how many) of 7.62X54R Steel Core Penetrator (silver tip) non corrosive w/ Ammo cans and I have a black gun case I’ll include on a full price offer. gun only is $1400

It is a great shooting gun with Low round count (300 +/-). It is in excellent condition but looking to get a NATO caliber.  This rifle also has the bolt hold-open mechanism that is on the true military spec PSL rifles that US commercial-spec PSL rifles often omit. 
MFG:  SC Fabrica de Arme Cugir SA (ARMS arsenal)
It is chambered in 7.62X54R (Russian) features a 18 1/8” barrel overall w/ flash suppressor welded. I have performed a reverse rivet process where all the rivets are welded flush into the receiver. The safety has an extended finger latch so you can easily activate/deactivate it. The PSL also has a Harris Bipod and 2 MOE Magpul rail sections attached to the sides of the hand guards.
All furniture is wood but I have refinished to make it look like synthetic. It also has a side mount weaver rail and includes a BSA Mil-Dot 6-24X40 scope w/ rings. BSA is not a very high quality brand but it matches the gun. It is always good to have an extra scope lying around too. The PSL is coated with Cerakote in Coyote Tan and Magpul Foliage Green™. I will do a lifetime warranty on the Cerakote application.
I also have 1000 +/- 100 or so rounds (not sure how many) of 7.62X54R Steel Core Penetrator (silver tip) non corrosive and I have a black gun case I’ll include on a full price offer.
Please feel free to contact me anytime. I prefer to do a Private Party xfer FTF & must show CO ID. However, I do not mind letting a dealer who is close do it if that is the route buyer prefers. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if you would like more pictures.

Perfect for small events. Enable DEEP mode, get more bass without muddying the sound, no need for a sub. Perfect for mobile gigs. Far more convenient than hauling passive cabs, extra cables, and amps around. Not heavy - I haul them in one trip.

Doubles as a monitor. Sometimes I do events where we end up with no monitor, poor monitors, or monitors where I can't control the levels (I like monitors low enough that I can hear the mains as well, and I don't need the monitors blasting my ears all night). Bringing along a K12 takes up little room, but has more than enough power, and gives pristine sound. Angled side allows it to be a wedge as well as sit on a chair or stand. Played with Heavygrinder at a gig where the promoter forgot to have mons set up at all; she appreciated borrowing a K12 for her set.

The size belies their power. High SPL from a little 12"", with excellent clarity. Does not distort at high volumes, unlike the EONs I've had that sounded like laptop speakers past 1/2 volume and barely cut it for house parties. I've shown up to gigs where the 15"" mains didn't have the power and clarity of the K12s, so we just swapped them out.

Input matrix allows two simultaneous inputs; it's basically a two channel mixer. Also has ports for daisy chaining.

EXT SUB mode for use with external subs without needing a crossover. VOCAL BOOST mode for public speaking gigs.

Triples as part of an awesome home theater system. Had them hooked up to the PS3 and DVD player, with video going to the projector. Puts the ""theater"" in ""home theater"".

Purchased new a little over a year ago. Pristine condition. Not even dusty. Only flaws are some scrapes in the paint on the sides from normal use.

Asking $1500 or best offer. 
Willing to ship within the US. 
Open to trades for quality modern firearms (e.g., M1A, MPA MAC clones, ""tactical"" 22s), nice somewhat-portable synths (e.g., Nord G1), Ecler Nuo 4 (not 4.0), and/or a portable audio/MIDI to USB/FireWire interface with low latency (e.g., Komplete Audio 6).

I also have several lights for sale or trade.

2x ADJ Mystic LED
1x ADJ Quad LED
1x Chauvet Galaxian 3D R/G laser
1x On Stage Stands lighting tree

Everything is near mint. Comes with original boxes, manuals still in the wrap, cables, etc. Bought it all in an emergency (lighting guy bailed last minute for a mobile gig, so I went out to GC and bought the minimal amount of lights we needed). They've since sat in their boxes, all of which are inside a crate, which itself is inside air conditioned storage. I have since gotten together with a top-notch group of lighting wizards, and most of the clubs I play already have their own lighting.

Everything is DMX-aware. I chose these units for their wide coverage. The Mystics will strobe as well as moonflower, which is pretty cool.  

$800 or best offer takes all the lights and tree. Paid $1100.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin"

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style."

I  have a Used Trijicon Reflex sight with m16 handle mount. Got this on a gun I bought used. Gun and sight didn't actually show any signs of use save for a little bit of powder residue on the mag follower... If it had more than a test shot fired through it, I would be greatly surprised. Sale is for the Reflex sight, handle mount, lens pen, and dust cover. $375 CASH. If you are from out of state, I can do paypal and ship, but it WILL COST EXTRA. Otherwise CASH ONLY Model number is RX01-10 Manufacturer's website is here: http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=RX01-10

Mags are 20round C-Products Aluminum, unused. Mags have the No Tilt Followers installed. I've switched over to using only Pmags, so the mags can go with the sight.
