Nice AK-47, wooden thumbhole dragunov stock. Short length rifle for easier carrying. Comes with one 10 round magazine and one sling. Will only accept the 10 round magazines due to it being a California model. You can mod the receiver with a dremel tool to make it accept standard AK mags and it is simple to do. There are instructional videos on youtube, I just dont have the time or the dremel tool to make the mod. Or just keep it the way it is. Great shooting gun. My loss is your gain.

They are 1399.99 for two, and 1899.99 for the other.  The trio for 4699.97.  Sorry, there is no group discount for all three.  These guns, and all the other Commemorative guns I'm putting up are from an Estate Sale that we are handling and the prices are not negotiable for these guns, unfortunately.  I don't even get an ""Employee Discount"" on them... so don't try to twist my arm on them.  
These guns are very special... each one has a case with the history of the battle on back.
If you love the 1911, you will really love these guns.  Colts.  Commemorative Colts for the price of a new production Kimber... so you know these are not priced high at all.
Call Basin Sports at REDACTED and ask for George.  Or email me.  Or better yet, come on by Basin Sports at 511 West Main Street in Vernal Utah, 84078 and see these fantastic guns for yourself."

Fired appx. 300 rounds.  An absolutely amazing firearm that I hate to part with but I am moving to New England for a job and won't use it there.  Holster was custom-made at Twin Peaks Leather in Arvada and cost $300.  There are no factory-made holsters for the X-Six.  The price is for the gun and the holster together.  Trigger is fully adjustable for weight, reach, and length of travel.  I put just shy of $3000.00 into the gun and holster so this is quite a deal!  Target shown in picture is from Sig and was fired at 25 meters.  This is the very best handgun Sig makes.

Ruger GP100 357 Magnum SS  
New, In Original Plastice Case, Never Fired

Specifications:
•	6-Shot .357 Magnum
•	4-way Adjustable Sight
•	Stainless Steel
•	Rubber Cushion Grip with Walnut Inlay
•	Original Case
•	Original Paperwork
•	Case Lock
                Humidity Control Sock-Sack  
•	Weight: 2.2 lbs (1000 g 4) The type of sights and barrel profile
                affect the weight of the revolver. These are representative
                weights in the most common configurations.
•	Barrel lengths: 4"" (102mm), 
•	Double Action. The GP100 may be fired by either cocking th
                Action), or by merely pulling the trigger when the hammer is 
                not cocked.
•	Maximum effective range: 55 to 110 yards (50 to 100 meters) 
                depending on barrel length, cartridge load, and additional
                optical sights. Projectiles from this weapon can still be 
                dangerous up to several thousand feet from the muzzle under
                optimum conditions. The quoted range is more a function of 
                the useful range of a typical handgun than a statement of the
                maximum lethal range of the projectiles.
•	Triple cylinder lock. When the cylinder is closed and the gun is
                at the point of firing, the cylinder crane is locked into the
                frame at the front and rear of the crane and by the cylinder
                lock at the bottom of the crane opening.
•	Disassembles quite easily into three major modules with only
                limited use of tools. This allows the user to easily clean the
                revolver after shooting.
•	The design of the gun eliminates the need for a
                frame ""sideplate"", a feature which contributes to the GP100's
                well-deserved reputation for strength."

This ia a collectible Beretta 92F 9MM FBI National Academy Graduate Model. Graduates were offered an opportunity to purchase these Beretta 92F which has gold inlay, and FBINA seals imbedded in the grips. It is in an Oak case with a  glass presentation lid with, embedded, etched seal in the glass. Case has a lock and key. This gun has never been fired. This belonged to a friend that graduated and later sold it to me. It has been sitting in my safe for the last several years and I have decided to sell to put it in the hands of a serious collector. I also have the original cardboard Beretta box that it was shipped in. The later issue ones did not include the wood case and was replaced with the standard plastic case. These are very rare but do show up from time to time. Additional pictures can be supplied upon request. $1895.00 cash face to face sale. I feel that the price is fair considering one sold on one of the auction sites for $2200.00

I lowered the price on this package$100 on 6/13/12. In adition to the package advertised, I had a  Hard Plastic, Foam Lined carring case, A hunmidity control Sock-Sack and Breach Lock for an additional $50.00.

This is the Package that is for sale: Mossberg Model 88, Maverick 12 ga.  Also included in the Sale Price is: Synthetic Stock and Forearm that came with the shotgun from the factory and Synthetic Pistol Grip and the Wood Stock and Wood Forearn mounted as shown. 

The Model 88 Maverick shotgun had a synthetic stock and forearm standard from the factory instead of nice wood. However, I purchsed the Wood Sock and Froearm and mounted them on the shotgun. I also purchsed the Synthetic Pistol Grip. Total Package as shown: New, Never Fired, Grips & Stocks Never Used.  

The Maverick is identical to the Mossberg 500 in every way except three....the safety is moved from the receiver to the trigger guard, the forearm is a one piece instead of the Mossberg steel tube, and the Maverick has a synthetic stock and forearm standard from the factory instead of nice wood. 

Those three things were cost cutting measures so Mossberg could market it as an economy line 500. Other than those three things, the Maverick 88 is identical to the Mossberg 500. They're made from the same parts on the same assembly lines as the Mossberg 500 and all accessories except the forearm are interchangeable.

This Model will last as long as any Mossberg 500 or Remington 870. It won't break or wear out if you don't abuse it. If in some way you manage to damage it, it can be repaired in five-ten minutes or less with replacement parts. 

A very good and versitile shotgun. It's inexpensive....it's not cheap."

The Hawken brothers established a reputation for manufacturing excellent Muzzleloading Rifles. Their claim to fame was the ""plains rifles"". The Plains Rifle was what their customers needed when they ascended the Missouri River in search of Beaver, a quality gun, light enough to carry all the time and capable of knocking down big targets at long range.

They called their Rifles ""Rocky Mountain Rifles"". Rifles Stamped “J&S Hawken St. Louis” were sought after throughout the rapidly expanding frontier among trappers and mountain men. In 1849 Jacob Hawken died and rifles were marked S. Hawken. A number of famous men were said to have owned Hawken Rifles, including: Jim Bridger, Kit Carson, Joseph Meek and Theodore Roosevelt.

Undoubtedly the most copied rifle in the history of firearms, the T/C Hawken was designed for the American shooter. This is a top quality firearm—every bit as fine as the one your great, great granddaddy carried across his saddle pommel or packed along on the wagon train. It captures the romance of the original but it is manufactured to standards of quality control that were unheard of in the early 1800’s. The proper use of the investment casting, improved methods of hardening parts and deep hole drilling, the use of continuous Magnaflux process to guard against imperfections in the steel itself coupled to our constant attention to min./max. tolerances is what allows us to offer a lifetime Warranty! Thompson Center arms manufacture the finest quality muzzleloading firearms available.

It has a double triggers; the rear trigger is a ""set"" trigger. When the rear trigger is pulled, the hammer does not fall but rather the action ""sets"" the front trigger, the front trigger becoming a ""hair trigger,"" tripped with a light touch. When the front trigger is used without using the rear ""set"" trigger, it requires a firm pull.

I am the original owner; Gun is practically brand new, it has had approximately 150 rounds through it. It works great and is surprisingly lightweight. I had no intention of selling, however I need some cash for a summer vacation and moving expenses. Note: This is not a pieced together upper. This is a FACTORY built 9mm upper. It was manufactured FOR 9mm, not some throw-together build!!! I am a TX resident w/ CHL. DFW face to face preferred. 

Complete Gun: $875 (as pictured, less optics)
Upper ONLY: $700 
Add the red-dot and 3X magnifier for $150
Cash is KING. Trades would need to be in my favor; and I'd prefer several hundred cash included. 
Bill of Sale Required if lower or entire gun sold! I will NOT sell to; younger than 21, felons, non-citizens."

with the bullet guide it will feed from tapcos galil mags and will be able to use most AK74 mags and AK .223 mags without needing to modify the mag. it will not feed factory saiga mags without modifying the mag.(they are way too expensive to buy anyway). I really love this gun, i just perfer my AKs in 7.62x39. and a little info for those who dont know, the saiga '.223' is actually chambered in 5.56, its just marked .223 to ease import hassle. so it is perfectly safe to fire 5.56 in this gun. i will send more pics to seriously interested parties.  missouri residents only.  As far as trade im looking for an AKM chambered in 7.62x39 or something semi auto chambered in .308, maybe cash, but i would perfer to trade.,  thanks and let me know."

I REAALLY wish I didn't have to sell this one, but taxes got me behind on credit card payments last month so I'm forced to liquidate some stuff.

It comes with all original accessories (including the original stock) and has been upgraded with a pistol grip stock with nice rubber butt pad.  Also included but not pictured are the adapter plates for changing the angle of this tactical stock.  it also comes with half a box of ammo and a gun sock for hauling it in the car, and everything pictured.  Except the carpet.

The ghost ring sights on this are awesome, the front sight glows nicely for quick target acquisition.

It holds 8 rounds in the tube + 1 in the chamber + 1 ""ghost round"" as they call it.  I never tried the ghost round but it looks simple.  check it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpyNoCnO4B4

there are light marks on the magazine tube that you can see larger than life in the pics.  

I'd estimate between 250-300 rounds down the pipe.

Asking $575 for this sweet shottie kit.  
That's at least $100 less than I've seen it selling for new, especially when you consider either ffl transfer fees + tax or shipping costs.  

EDIT: not sure why these pics are displaying so tiny.  I can email you full-size ones on request.




I'll meet somewhere near Monument, or I'll ship to your FFL at actual cost.

The power is 1-4X24 with the amber triangle as your aiming point. I purchased this last month for a rifle that I just sold and no longer need. This is the ultimate 3-gun competition scope. The scope is designed for both eyes open shooting. This is an awesome scope and is worth every penny. The scope retails for $995 plus tax. MAP pricing is $850, which means a Trijicon dealer cannot sale it under that amount without being in trouble with Trijicon. The cheapest I can find it online is at MAP pricing plus shipping. Which is a great deal but I felt uncomfortable spending that amount of money without first being able to look and touch the actual product I was buying. Im asking $875 obo. Thats a savings of over $175 off retail including tax. Below is the actual description off of Trijicons website. Make me an offer, all I can say is no. Thanks for looking.

Ideal for big game hunts or anytime you expect to shoot at shorter distances, the Trijicon AccuPoint® with its patented illuminated aiming point will help you get the job done. The scope is illuminated through the use of fiber optics and tritium, providing a vivid aiming point without the need for failure-prone batteries.

The TR24 also includes: 1 Trijicon Logo Sticker ( PR15 ) 1 LENSPEN® ( TA56 ) 1 Set of Lenscaps 1 AccuPoint Manual 1 Warranty Card

$350 (Paid about $450 including tax for this sight at Bass Pro. See photo of receipt.)

EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility but don't need night vision. The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment. 
The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails."

Please read: I don't want old PTR91's with all different parts and stocks. I love PTR91's but I only want a SC or MSG new or very new with everything that came with it. That's it. Also the same for other guns new and unmodified and have everything that came with it.

No six different stocks, different parts, 3 different rails, 200 mags. Just a unmodified gun. Simple:razz:

I will think of more. No hurry here and don't mind keeping it if nothing comes along.

As for trades they must be in perfect condition and have everything they came with.

I don't want any parts gun period!

Or guns with 50 MagPul parts on it or any optics. The thing is we all pay different prices on optics and parts and I will leave it at that. Unless it is a nice optic at a great price.

I would rather dress it up the way I want. 

I will get pics up tomorrow as I don't want to go into the safe right now.

I know what this gun is worth so lowball offers should be kept to yourself or others may see them.

I have always been fair and will continue to be so.

This is the most sought M1A and are very difficult to find. So I am just not going to just let it go.

I ordered this back in March and it finally came but my financial situation changed a bit so I need to sell it.   These are hard-to-find, sold out, and back-ordered everywhere and there is a 90 day wait time on them.  Check for yourself on Rock River's web site and click the Lead Times tab.  Also, good luck finding them at your LGS, and Bass & Cabelas don't even carry them . I did weeks of research online, and at gun shops before I narrowed it down to this one.  Sure you can buy cheaper AR's but there is a reason why these are back-ordered, and those are on-sale. Included are 2 factory mags, factory case, plus 1-magpul, and 1 CMMG mag, which makes a total of 4 magazines.  I will also include 2 bxs of ammo. Price is firm, my asking price was my cost, but remember, there is  a 90-day back order already and that's just going to get longer with the election and all this talk of doomsday and zombies.

This is my Fiancee's winter Spare Vehicle and is no Longer Needed, Looking to Trade for Guns of Equal Value. 

I Do Have A CarFax On This Jeep, So Your Mind Can Be At Ease When Purchasing This Jeep! Do you want it all, especially sheer toughness? Well, with this hardy 2001 Jeep Cherokee, you are going to get it.. This SUV will save you money by keeping you on the road and out of the mechanic's garage. 

I'm going to be as honest as I can, because I really don't want to waste my own time showing it to people who don't know the condition before dragging me out to look at it. 

Interior 9/10 - Jeep is all stock besides a JVC CD Player. 

Exterior 8/10 -The body is straight and dent free, and the under body is clear of rust, looks like its always been garaged kept, It cleans up nice, which I'll get around to doing before it sells ... Upgraded Jeep Alloy Wheels, Towing Package

Mechanically 9/10 - Drives like a 11 year old Jeep... but at least it shifts smooth, drives straight and doesn't vibrate you to death. Drips a bit of oil (not enough to matter between changes), This 4.0L 4x4 is virtually unstoppable! The LEGENDARY 4.0 Liter High Output 6 cylinder motor is powerful, yet quiet and smooth. The Automatic transmission shifts surely.

Recent maintenance: New timing chain, and crank shaft sensor, and oil/coolant/trans/diff changes were maintained to a meticulous degree. Since I've had it I've replaced the A/C compressor, blower motor and resistor, turn signal switch, brake light switch, thermostat, rear hatch shocks, heater core, water pump, cooling system just flushed.

Under The Hood Is A Spotless 4.0 Powerhouse That Runs Like A DREAM with 159,XXX Miles. Automatic 4 Door with Power Windows And Door Locks, Key Less Entry, Tilt Steering Wheel, Leather-Wrapped Steering Wheel, Rear Window Wiper/Washer; Power Heated Mirror's, Fog Lights, Cruise Control, Rear Air/Heat, Upgraded Jeep Alloy Wheels, Towing Package. All fluids changed on a regular basis, always used synthetic oil, transmission fluid, and diff fluid. Interior is pretty much flawless. 

KBB lists it in ""Very Good Condition"" at Excellent $6,506 - Very Good $6,206 - Good $6,031

The HK USP is the first HK pistol designed especially for American shooters. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely influenced by such famous designs as the Government model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP tactical is built for a rugged, dependable lifetime of service.

The Kestrel 4500 NV with Horus ATrag Ballistics combines Kestrel's flagship meter, the Kestrel 4500 with Night Vision, with Horus ATrag Ballistics software to bring you the first lightweight, hand-held tool to give you both comprehensive environmental data plus integrated aiming solutions. Kestrel Pocket Weather Meters and Horus Vision partnered to provide a powerful shooting tool that combines the critical environmental data and targeting software solutions required for precision shooting. 


 The Kestrel 4500 NV with Horus ATrag Ballistics allows you to load, customize and store multiple guns, rounds and targets. Target parameters include distance, angle, longitude, speed, direction and wind. Kestrel's highly accurate measuring and averaging of wind together with built-in digital compass for target bearing and wind direction assists in defining the target winds. The Kestrel 4500 NV with Horus ATrag Ballistics is available with Bluetooth technology, which allows you to communicate with your Kestrel wirelessly at a range of up to 30-feet, and maximize the battery life of your meter.
The Kestrel can measure in TMOA (true minute of angle), SMOA (shooter minute of angle), and MILs (milliradians).  The unit displays ballistic tables with data of the shot extending out to various distances (see Range Card on page 17 and 18 in the manual).  This Horus meter can provide ballistics solutions out to 4000 yards (or about 3700 meters). 



Once you’ve built the gun that you’ll be using (and you’re at the range of course), you need to enter the target range into the Kestrel, as well as the latitude (if you’re concerned about the coriolis effect), then either manually enter the wind or use the auto capture feature to capture the wind speed. 


The Bluetooth serves to connect the computer to the Kestrel if the user is interested in logging weather data (just like in the non-Horus version) and uploading to the computer, or the user can utilize the Gun Library software created by (and available from) Horus Vision.  This software will allow customers to build guns on their computers, download them to the Kestrel, or upload guns they’ve modified in the field.



Horus software that comes with the 4500 Atrag Ballistics is the civilian version."
