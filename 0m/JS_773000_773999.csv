If you're looking for the highest quality and most durable Lower Parts Kit on the market with all of the upgrades, look no further. The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that breaks at around 5 lbs and gets even smoother the more you shoot it. 

The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out (a problem in some 9mm ARs and full auto M4/M16s) and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and our Ergo grip featuring our Spike’s Spider logo. 

The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs. We also include quality spiral roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch as well as a ¼” allen screw and washer for the Ergo grip. 

This is the best Lower Parts Kit on the market that you can put in your lower.

Virtually no recoil due to the piston system. Magpul ASAP single point sling attachment and MS2 sling are also included. Vertical fore grip and Troy BUIS sights shown will be included. 

The Eo Tech is a 556.A65 I know the box says 516 but as you can tell it is Night Vision compatible. Notice the controls on the EO Tech are located on the side of this model in case you ever decide to add a magnifier to it. This way they are out of the way and easy to get to when you need them. I added the GG&G hood to protect the lenses of the optic they also work as a sun shade when it is flipped up. I will include the OEM hood with the purchase as well since I have no use for it. 

2 of the now rare Magpul Pmags are included in this set up. As well as all the Green tip M855 Lake City ammo in this Tupperware bowl. I can count it for serious inquires. 

I hate to see this rifle go but I purchased a JP competition AR and Im not using this rifle anymore.  I have a friend with this exact AR and his has 10,000 rounds through it with 0 failures other then bad rounds. This is a purpose built rifle designed not to fail."

I have 1 M4 style AR15 with the following Features
- Birdcage Fflash suppressor
- Palmetto 1/7 twist chrome lined 16 inch barrel with fixed A2 front sight
- CAR lenth handguards
- A3 flat top upper reciever

- Bayonet Lug
- Surplus Ammo Arms lower reciever
- UTG Ergo pistol grip
- FAB Defense magwell grip
- Eotech XPS2 Holographic sight ( Real Eotech, not a copy ) with 13 Surefire Batteries.
- 19 30rd AR15 magazines, all have MagPull non tilt followers 
- 6 new made tan followers

- I also placed an order ( before the AWB scare ) with Freedom Munitions for 500rds of XM855 5.56 62gr green tip Remanufactured ammo
- The order was placed on the 13th before the prices took off and the availablility dropped, the order will be shipped within 1 - 2 weeks from today the 29th Dec.
- the current count at this time is approx amount, an exact count will be posted in a few days but the total count will not be off by more then a few rounds ( I think 15 - 20 rds )
- 1 OD green Midway USA Rifle Case

Of course the standard forum rules apply. Al NC State and Federal Laws apply. Proper ID will be required . I have both NC state ID and CCW if you need to see it. And a bill of sale will be completed.

Im only looking to sell as a package deal , selling it out piece by piece is not realy worth it at this time.

I honestly have no idea what a far price will be in the current market at this moment since AR15s are going from "" really high "" to "" you must be smoking crack . and lets face it fair market pricing has gone bye bye for the near future.

So the List Price will be $4000, was $5000. Trade plus cash is also possible, we can work out the details later.
My asking price will reflect what the market is asking for at the time. If the market prices drop then my asking price will do the same. 

Trades, Im open to the following
- must be legal for me to bring back to NY
- Pistols of any brand , Sigs a a favorite. I have been on the market for a Sig 228/229 9mm, or a HK USP Compact 45 / HK45 Compact.
- Rifles let me know if you have something Pre 1994 AWB. But open to most anything .
- Ammo, 12g 2 3/4 or 3 inch, 45acp, 7.62x54r, or good .22lr ( dont need hunting ammo )
I will look at all trade at Current Market Value, not all prices have sky rocketed.

Cash is king so first "" I'll Take It "" in a Private Message will get the prize, but I am reasonable so lets make a deal. 
I do reserve the right to cancel negotiations prior to a final deal being made if I find a Pre 1994 AWB lower reciever. If we agree to a deal then i will follow through.
We can negotiate travel distance to me or to you.
Test fire is not a problem at all as long as we can agree on a time and a place, more then likely on a weekend.
FTF transaction only.

I don't know much about the gun. It was in my grandfathers gun case, and I inherited it.  Has some nicks and scratches from being in the field. I don't think it's been shot in about 30 years. I looked up the serial number and it's a 78xxx number, which from where I've seen, dates it to 1929. It might have been my great grandfathers gun if that's true. The last picture shows the most marks i could find. everywhere else is real nice. some nicks here and there but its an old gun so. Open to trades or cash. 
 Thank you."

Barrel has been cut to 12 and 3/4 inches, and has 6 inch muzzle brake welded to meet 18 inch legal barrel length for shotguns without NFA registration and tax stamp. Muzzle brake is a beast and balances gun at magazine well to increase pointability and keeps gun on target.

Installed reciever block that allows for attachment of AR style buffer tubes and used an Enidine Hydraulic Shotstock that both absorbs and directs recoil straight back, instead of up and right. Which reduces fatigue and increases speed of follow up shots. Currently outfitted with Magpul Mil-spec STR buttstock, with compartments to hold batteries/matches or other small items.

Fire control group has been moved forward to accomodate a pistol grip, and modified trigger guard attached that allows attachment of AR style pistol grip for increased options and ergonomics. Custom trigger also installed, which breaks very clean and has a great reset.

Attached a three sided picitanny rail, low profile rubber inset rail guards and an olive drab generation one Magpul AFG.

Shotgun has been coated in a mix of black and olive drab DuraHeat to withstand high temperatures without damaging the finish.

Including three magazines (Two 8 Round Pro-Mag magazines, and one 5 Round Izhmash magazine)

Specific brands I am looking for are Spike's, S&W, LMT, Colt, Armalite, LWRC, BCM, Noveske, Daniel Defense, or any tier one brand lower. It should be noted that this lower has a very low shelf (rare), meaning it is capable of receiving a REGISTERED lightning link or REGISTERED drop-in auto sear for some full auto fun! I *MIGHT* consider selling for the right amount. Thanks for looking and God bless!"

The Starr revolver is an early development of the double action mechanism, it was a complicated but advanced design of the period, and generally made before the Civil War. It has two triggers which function as follows. Depress the forward trigger slightly and the rear trigger will become active, further depress the main trigger and the hammer will cock and hold in conventional single action manner. At this point the forward trigger is disengaged entirely, and single action firing is effected by depressing the rear trigger, or the cock can be slowly released by depressing the rear trigger and controlling the hammer back into resting position. Alternately the forward trigger can simply be operated from resting position without cocking, it will fire the round and advance the cylinder in one motion, hence the ""double action"". The revolvers are fitted with a single wood grip, another departure from the two grip convention of the period. Manufactured by Starr Arms Co , New York, NY. Frame is marked on right side, ""STARR ARMS. CO. NEW. YORK."", and left side, ""STARRS PATENT JAN 15, 1856."" Serial number is marked on cylinder, and is visible on the frame with the hammer cocked. . Round barrel length 6in. VERY EARLY PRODUCTION #264 matching

Once i purchased the gun i wore it around the house to break in both holsters but never had time to take it to the range as i started a new job (its illegal to wear it where i work) and so i just continued wearing my usual EDC when away from work. 

It is brand new and never fired, comes boxed with all original accessories plus the choice of 1 of the 2 holsters mentioned above (Crossbreed or CX2). It is a very nice ergonomic pistol, i tried out (at various ranges) as many 9mm as i could and this was the best for me. 

At this point i am not interested in any trades, cash only (unless you have a brand new CZ P07 Duty 9mm?). CPL and WA DL are required for sale, no exceptions sorry.

Please PM me with any questions, i will work on pics this afternoon...t

This is a phenomenal rifle and took me two years of piecing together to build because of the market and demand of this company now becoming a industry standard. It has precisely 90 rounds (3 pmags) through it and is in pristine shape. Its the lightest and most comfortable AR ive ever shot with the least amount of recoil of any AR ive ever shot. It turns heads everytime its pulled out of its case. I require a DL # or CPL provided and signed bill of sale for my records with transfer, face to face. Will include 1 Pmag with sale.

I'm looking to spend between $300 and $350

I'm about to sell my hi-point 9mm and I need to replace that gun with a decent one -- I will pass a background check so no delays to worry about.

I'd prefer someone close to stroudsburg as ideally we'd make the transfer at Dunkleburgers, however, we can do it where ever you like (If you have someone that does cheaper transfers, thats good too!)

Also, I'm really not interested in haggling too much, honestly, I'm looking for people who are already considering selling theirs, and will most likely not get more than this at any gun shops, so this will be a quick exchange and we will both walk away happy!

Has brand new DAPS, groin and butt protector, bunch of misc. pouches. I'll set it up really nice for you. I have seen this same body armor system save plenty of lives, it is definitely bullet proof. The Army ""forgot"" to take this back when I was honorably discharged after being wounded. 

The vest itself is going for $800-$1000 online, used, without plates. The plates range from $400-$600. I have switched to a plate carrier, and this setup is too heavy for my girlfriend. Make me an offer. Cash, or would trade for an AR or Mini 14."
