Product Description
Aimpoint® CompM4 M4h 2MOA with LRP mount ARD and rubber covers

The Aimpoint® CompM4 sight, with high battery compartment, belongs to the CompM4 series sights which are the finest sights Aimpoint has ever produced. Improvements include improved energy efficiency that provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery!

Launched 2007



High or low battery compartment

To accommodate our customers, the CompM4 series of sights are available in two versions:

The CompM4 offers a high battery compartment. This is the product shown her.

The CompM4s offers a low battery compartment. Follow link to see the CompM4s.

In all other aspects, the Aimpoint CompM4 and Aimpoint CompM4s are identical.

We choose to present these 2 sights separately on the website as they do look different.

Designed for 3rd generation night vision technology

The CompM4 sight can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility.

The performance of CompM4 sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.



The clearest, brightest image possible

Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).



Ready for use around the clock

With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 sight is ready for round the clock use.

Would be great for the hunting club or with a little TLC a great first family camper. It has roof air, fridge, and microwave. All work great. Electric lift that also works, with hand back up. Sleeps 5 comfortably, 2 on each bed and one on the dinette. Has inverter to run lights off of a tongue mounted battery or also has 110V hook-up. Has water tanks and city water hook-ups. 

Whats needed:
Two vinyl zip in windows need replaced on one end of the camper, mesh is perfect. Just two sections on the tail end could use two windows made. Prior owner had misplaced them. I've heard a company in B'ham can replace it. I never tried to contact them. Needs countertops replaced, I can buy them locally for a great price and might have them done. Other than that it is a great little camper for the hunting club or weekend use.

Hogue synthetic overmold stock ... non-reflective matte finish on receiver and barrel ... 2 front & 1 rear sling swivel studs. This professional Winchester Model 70 controlled feed claw extractor action gives the strength and accuracy of machined chrome-molybedium steel with all the most preferred features. The manual blade-type ejector lets you control ejection force. How fast you work the bolt translates directly to the way the cartridge ejects. The anti-bind bolt design helps to insure smooth cartridge loading. The innovative, field strippable bolt assembly is easy to inspect and service without tools. The gun offers precision and durability from the cold hammer-forged rifling (1:12 inch, right hand twist) and the medium heavy fluted barrel is free floating for consistent performance and accuracy. Comes with the factory with a Mil-Std 1913 type machined steel rail, with 20 MOA additional elevation built in, installed for mounting optical sights. All of these features are wrapped in a FN/Hoague synthetic stock with anti-slip texturing on the forearm and the flared bottom pistol grip. SUPER ACCURACY! With hand loaded ammo I get sub-MOA groups at 100 yards.

The price is low because I want the reviews.	

If you live in Central Florida, we can talk about possibly meeting up face to face for a consultation out at a coffee shop or at my office(different address from the one listed below). Feel free to call ahead of time to ask questions. I'm only selling NFA Trusts through gunbroker at this time, so I can get the reviews. The reviews are worth more to me in the end. That's the why the price is good, and the additional deals are better. In Florida, Private ownership of Class III firearms and items requires the local chief of police or sheriff's signature, fingerprints and photos. When you are not around, and if you don't know the laws behind proper storage, you possibly leave your loved ones with constructive possession issues. Also the local chief of police or sheriff is not required to provide their signature and they may deny you your right to own Class III items by simply ""losing"" the paperwork. With a proper Trust, that is avoided. Also my Trusts can be used in conjunction with a wide array of other estate planning documents. The NFA Trust in actuality is initially(can be modified as you wish before execution) a Revocable Living Trust with NFA friendly provisions that properly deal with the transfer(purchase), storage, and possible future transfers in relation to the acquired Class III items. An LLC requires annual fees and state filings or the LLC defaults leaving both you and your loved ones in possession of a restricted item. A Trust allows for people other than yourself(acting as Trustees) to use and enjoy the firearms as part of their duties in ensuring their proper protection, function, maintenance, and value. A trust is a BATFE approved method of Class III item ownership that protects you, protects your friends and family from constructive possession issues and gives you the control over when and where your items will be transferred after your death. Who will inherit them, who can inherit them, and if you would like, for the Trust to keep going on after your death so that your inheritors are still protected by the Trust. Generic and fill-in-the-blank asset or estate trusts from the internet or your buddy down the street who is not a lawyer, are not good enough. It may be enough for the application, but it might not be good enough should BATFE ever have a reason to look closer. Do it right the first time with a Trust that not only protects your Class III items, but can also protect your other assets. My Trusts are not slapped together Trusts, I can only finish them after I have spoken to you personally and consulted you about your needs, they are painstakingly assembled to work with Florida's laws and the NFA. The Trust can be used later in the future to acquire more Class III items as well, or as a larger part of your estate planning needs and desires. For a total of $400 you can also get the Trust and: Simple Will: for dispensation of personal effects and determination of burial. Not for the dispensation of your house. May be used to determine you takes your cars when you pass. Memorandum of Trust: necessary for creating bank accounts in the name of the Trust. Pour-Over Last Will & Testament: for having what assets you have not put in the Trust, added to the Trust. Also for having the proceeds from life insurance policies go to the Trust. Also I can prepare and mail letters to your life insurance carrier so that they put your Trust down as the beneficiary. General Durable Power of Attorney: typically for when or if you become legally or medically incapacitated. Specific Durable Limited Power of Attorney: can be used to take care of specific measures like selling or buying a car or house. Appointment of Healthcare Surrogate Alternative Appointment of Healtchare Surrogate Codicil/Amendments: for when you may want to add things to your Will such as personal possessions. Living Will: to have your desires be known in case you become afflicted so as to be in a vegetative state. I.E. be kept on life support, have the feeding tube remain in place, or prevent heroic medical measures. Pet Trust: In the State of Florida it is no recognized how one can create a Trust for the care of their pets should they pass. David Koberlein, Esq. David Koberlein, P.A.

A new, unissued Bulgarian AK47 rifle imported/assembled by TGI. 922(r) compliant parts allow for using foreign magazines if you want. 16"" chrome lined barrel and chamber, chrome bolt, carrier, and piston. This is considered a middle-grade AK (as opposed to the cheaper Romanian or expensive Arsenals). Rifle with two steel mags was $530. 

Add-ons include:
-Hogue rubber overmold pistol grip ($25)
-Magpul MOE mil-spec 6 position collapsible stock on mil-spec tube ($60 stock, $40 tube)
-Stormwerx stock adapter bolted to rear trunion to mount AR stock ($35)
-MI/USPalm tri-rail aluminum upper and lower handguard kit with Primary Arms microdot red dot sight set up to co-witness with iron sights ($190)
-Magpul angled foregrip. ($33)
-2 tapco 30 round mags ($40)
-Tapco universal sling ($30)

Fired about 200 rounds through the gun, kept it cleaned and lubed. I've seen a feeding issue come up from the magazine sitting too low which has produced a handful of FTFs. It's either the mag release lever being a little low or the mags I'm using (tapco) are not the right fit. I think new steel mags (intended for this gun) are the best solution. This gun, in my hands, got a good solid 2.5MOA at 100 yards which is what to expect from any AK. I got about the same with an Arsenal I once had.


I've put just about $1000 into this gun with shipping. I've got 400+ rounds of polymer coated Tula ammo I'll throw in to sweeten the deal ($100 worth) and two steel magazines that came with it that I don't use because they look like crap..though they still work. I think $[800] is a good price to ask but will take offers because I need the money bad.

Private party sale only, prefer face to face but will ship on your dime AFTER a confirmed wire transfer of funds only. $750 without ammo."

Right Hand Stock 

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide the ability to Slide Fire safely, offering a new element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! 

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to bump fire, the SSAR-15's radical design enables the shooter to fire and AR-15 as quickly as desired without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike traditional bump firing. The SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly hold their firearm and maintain complete control at all times. In addition, as a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round, the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction. 

In principal the SSAR-15 functions similar to the Gatlin system. When operating a Gatlin system the shooter operates a crank in a circular motion to activate the firing mechanism. Every 1/5 rotation of the crank will discharge a round. The shooter will then continue forward another 1/5 of a rotation to fire the next round, and so on. With the SSAR-15 the shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward to discharge a round. To discharge the next round the operator must again move the upper assembly forward. As with the Gatlin system, an AR-15 equipped with the SSAR-15 will never fire automatically.

From the BlueBook: DALY, CHARLES: JAPANESE MFG. : SHOTGUNS: O/U

In the early sixties, C. Daly guns were manufactured by the firm of B.C. Miroku in Kochi, Japan. This Japanese gun manufacturing company has produced guns for many companies, Browning being the biggest current customer. Miroku guns are high quality with excellent fit and finish. Many of them are highly engraved and are fine examples of the gunmaker's art. Charles Daly Miroku Guns are becoming quite collectible in some areas. Their production ceased in 1976.

Since BSA did not make as many rifles  and are not as common as a Savage or a Longbranch, that makes this rifle that much more rare and more collectable. I have taken this rifle apart many times to clean it (as I do religiously) and there is no pitting or rust to be found. However, there is an import mark at the end of the barrel that link it to Vermont (?). This rifle is in great condition and has great rifling and a dark, but very clean, bore. Also has flip micrometer/300yrd Battle sight.

Technical  Specifications

Model - MKA 1919
Operation - Gas operated Semi-auto Shotgun
Caliber - 12 gauge
Range - 35 mt.The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms*.  The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar.  The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.

The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel.  The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard.  The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver.   The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.
The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes.  The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location.  The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.  The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and  integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories.  The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts.  It comes in Black and ""BONZ"" camo versions and is reasonably priced for our distributors and customers alike.  

Weight (Empty) - 6 1/2 lbs 
Barrel Length - 47 cm.
Magazine Capacity - 5 Round
Safety - Manuel safety lever
Overall Length - 96,40 cm.
Mobile shock - 5 cm — 10 cm — 15 cm 

Comes with two five round metal mags, 2 3/4 and 3 inch. Three internal chokes, Full, Modified and Cylinder Bore. Chrome lined barrel. Gas operated-piston driven below the barrel. Self adjusting gas system. Carrying handle/sights is removable with a picatinny rail on top. Front sight is removable to set up optics on the rail. 6 1/2 pounds empty. Barrel comes out to give the option of interchangeable barrels. Last round bolt hold open. Manual safety lever."

Right now it is pictured in a Custom Cherrywood Monte Carlo stock By Bishop
 which I put on- to not mar/scratch the original so my wife and sons could use it for 1st deer hunting rifle .

It has served its purpose every one has graduated to more suited to them guns and this old soldier needs a new home 

I have the original furniture for it and many extra magazines 2-5`s / 4-15`s and 1- 30 - we have only used the 5`s for hunting and range shooting

the monte carlo stock and sling are the only parts not original put the original stock back on its 100% original as when the soldier used it in WWII

I am looking for best offer Please dont lowball me an offer check online and see what they go for and shoot me a offer --- remember it also has a custom made cherrywood monte carlo stock extra magazines some ammo less than 50 rds some ball- some soft- some hollow point 

metal on gun is good to very good condition has some scrathes of course and the original stock is is way better shape than the ones I saw the last gunshow I was at and those turd guns were going for outrageous prices I now its not a golden gun but it is worth a chunk of $$$
