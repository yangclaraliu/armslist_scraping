I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

Thanks for looking and for your donations.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

136,http://www.armslist.com/posts/658136,For Sale:  Browning BOSS A-Bolt 300 WIN MAG Leupold Scope,"Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States",$ 775,"Listed On: Monday, November 12, 2012",Rifles,Browning                                                                                ,300 Winchester Magnum                                                                                ,Bolt Action,no type,"FS/FT Browning 300 WIN MAG A-Bolt Matte Black Stalker With BOSS system. Purchased new. Very Good Cond.  Have the BOSS wrench and standard recoil piece.  Leupold Vari X II 3-9X40 Scope with box and felt bag. Browning Rifle Soft Case, Browning Strap, I have a box or two of shells as well that go with it. This is an awesome big game setup; I just don’t hunt anymore and have no use for it. This thing was hitting right on at 100 yds  with a very tight group last time I shot it in 2009. Ready to hunt! The 300 WIN Mag is the most versatile big game rifle offering the most variety of bullet grains. Hunt Antelope with 165 Grain, Deer and Elk with 180 Grain or Moose a Grizzly with 220 Grain.  The 180 Grain makes this one of the best long range Calibers and bullet weight.  Winchester trajectory tables show that the 180 grain Power Point Plus bullet zeroed at 200 yards rises only 1.4"" at 100 yards and falls just 6.4"" at 300 yards. This is identical to the trajectory for the 130 grain Power Point Plus bullet in the famous .270 Winchester caliber. Obviously, Winchester's .300 is a fine long range big game cartridge.

The flip side of launching heavy bullets at high velocity is recoil, and abundant recoil is the dark side of all .300 Magnum cartridges. You can't cheat Mother Nature or the laws of physics.---The BOSS System Revolutionizes this though.  This 300 Win Mag has the kick of a 270 or lesser powered rifle thanks to the excellence of Browning's BOSS System. 

For those not familiar with Browning’s BOSS system. Ballistics Optimizing Shooting System is a fully adjustable muzzle break with settings for each specific brand and grain of shell. Allows you to fine tune your groupings to amazingly tight patterns.  For those who like the standard recoil of the 300 Win Mag, the standard recoil BOSS attachment is also included.

Asking $775 or Trade for SS 44 Mag revolver or SS 40 Cal Semi Auto Handgun.  Might take partial trade of other decent quality firearms.  I'm willing to seperate from the scope if desired."

The reasons vary from something that is easier to grip for more control, smaller hands, or something for ladies to use. Based on these requests they are proud to introduce their collaboration with Richard Heinie: the new Lady Hawk.

The Lady Hawk uses a both a frame and a mainspring housing that have been thinned down and scalloped to reduce the overall circumference of the grip. They also install thin Alumagrips to further reduce the circumference of the pistol grip. These features make for a pistol grip like no other, a perfect fit for those with small hands or for a female shooter.

The first thing they were asked was ""Can I get it without the Lady Hawk model name on it?"". So they have decided not to put ""Lady Hawk"" on the slide unless the customer requests it. The Lady Hawk comes standard in 9mm. The Lady Hawk also comes with a Titanium Blue Frame and Slide finish with Black controls.

I am in Elkhart,IN.  That is 20 minutes east of South Bend, IN.  I am about 3 miles from the Indiana/Michigan state line.  With this being said you now know where I am located.  I am not traveling more than 10-15 miles to meet you.  I have been burned way too many times making long travel arrangements and then not having someone show up or cancel at the last minute, plus with fuel cost it is not cost effective for me to drive very far.  I WILL NOT sell a handgun to an out of state person.  You must be an Indiana resident and have proof, Indiana State Issued ID.  I also WILL NOT sell a hand gun to someone under 21 years of age.  All long guns must be 18 years of age.  I set my prices accordingly to the condition of the firearm,accessories with the firearm, what the blue book recommends, and local dealership prices.  I am willing to negotiate on prices but please don't insult me by low balling me.  I know exactly what all of my firearms are worth so please don't waste my time and try to teach me what you think you may know.  This goes for firearm laws too.  Please be respectful and not text me or call me past 9pm or before 8am.  Text in-between  9-pm and 8am will be considered RUDE and ignored.  I do not hold firearms for someone for more than 24 hours. If you can not afford it within 24 hours of contacting me please don't waste your time or mine asking me to hold it for you longer than 24 hours. I am in no need for money and do not NEED to sell you a firearm.  I am thinning out my collection of the firearms I do not want anymore to make room for new firearms that I am building.  I don't mean to sound like a complete control freak or jerk, it's just that I have posted here before and have too many game players and I am fed up with those people.  

I am not really interested in trades but I will consider other firearm trades if it's something that strikes my interest.  (AR stripped receivers, AR parts, bulk 45 ACP ammo)

I've put maybe 100 rounds through it and my grandfather didn't shoot it. This rifle was originally owned by my great grandfather who rarely shot it. It was kept in a grandfather clock then a closet.

This model was produced sometime in the 80s or 90s. It shows signs of use (mostly finish wear), but is in excellent mechanical condition. There's no rust, corrosion, or pitting. It's actually marked as a ""New Haven 600AT"", which Mossberg produced for a series of department stores. Other than the engraving, Mossberg made these to be identical to the 500 and it's compatible with any 500 parts and accessories. 

The action on this gun is really smooth and I've never experienced any problems with it. The 26"" barrel has some marring around the screw that secures the barrel (it looks like a previous owner used the wrong tool to try to get it off). However, it still works just fine, it just doesn't look pretty. The 18.5"" Mossberg barrel was purchased three years ago and has had about 100 shells through it. It looks nearly new.

I'm also including an elastic stock-mounted shell carrier (ammo not included).

This is a great low-cost setup if you want one shotgun for both home defense and hunting/clays.

I just want a hunting rifle.  It can be scratched, flecked with rust and it might have sat in the back of your closet or gun safe for years. That's ok.

I'd prefer either a 16 or 20""  round barrel, but when it gets to it, I guess it doesn't really matter if it is a 16, 20, or 24"" barrel. It doesn't matter if it is round or octagon or whatever. 

I don't want to steal it, and I don't want to get fleeced - I'd like to buy it for a fair price - somewhere between $250 and $550, depending on condition.   I would be open to trading for my Maverick 12g shotgun (+ 80 or so rounds of ammo) , plus a Marlin 795 rifle (500rds of ammo) plus some $cash$ to even things out.  

I'd like to buy it face-to-face somewhere near Winston Salem or thereabouts.

I have never shot the gun; however, it has great rifling and is very solid. I see no reason that it could be fired if you get some .32 rimfire ammunition.  It looks like ot might be possible to convert to centerfire....I'm sure a good gunsmith could do it!

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees.

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

Thanks for looking and for your donations.
