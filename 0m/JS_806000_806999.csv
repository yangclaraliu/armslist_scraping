According to the Winchester book 720,600 1873 Winchesters were made. Eight out of ten were .44 caliber which leaves 144,120 that were either .32 or .38 caliber. The book also says the .32 caliber sold 4 to 1 over the .38. So if you  follow the math 28,824 were .38 caliber. This rifle has a twenty-six inch barrel. Again, if you follow the math, 1 in 600 rifles had longer than standard barrels. If you divide the number of 38 caliber rifles (28,824) by 600, you come up with only 48 .38 caliber rifles with longer than standard barrels. The only things I know to be wrong with it is the cleaning rod kit is missing and the rear sight adjustment ramp is missing. Most of the blueing is still on the gun but had browned with age. The gun does fire and the action works flawlessly. I also have a partial box of old 38-40 ammo that will go with it. I really just want to trade this gun for a gas piston AR15 but I am open to other trades as well or will sell for the right amount of cash. If the right deal comes along I would trade for guns, ammo, and cash, either way. Just let me know what you have. I will be glad to send you more pictures of anything on the gun you want, just ask. I will also be glad to make an appointment for you to see this gun in person."

Product Description
remington You've probably never heard the words comfort and performance used to describe a high-performance shotgun slug. Until now. Using the same technology found in our other Managed-Recoil loads, the new Managed-Recoil BuckHammer lead slugs generate 40% less felt-recoil without sacrificing its devastating on-game performance.

Product Information

This is a factory original, drop-free magazine for your Glock. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height. 

Technical Informaion: 

Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity. 

If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load.

History

The PPS was created in response to a Red Army requirement for a compact and lightweight weapon with similar accuracy and projectile energy to the Soviet PPSh-41 submachine gun widely deployed at the time, with reduced rate of fire, produced at lower cost and requiring less manpower, particularly skilled manpower. During design, emphasis was placed on simplifying production and eliminating most machining operations; most of the weapon's parts were sheet-steel stamped.[1] These measures reduced the number of machined components to a bare minimum, cutting down machining time by more than half, to 2.7 hours of machining instead of 7.3 hours for the PPSh-41. There were also savings of over 50% in raw steel usage, down to 6.2 kg instead of 13.9 kg, and fewer workers were required to manufacture and assemble the parts.

Prototypes were evaluated successfully during the spring of 1942; the firearm was accepted into service later that year as the PPS-42 (Russian: Пистолет-пулемёт Судаева—ППС or Pistolet Pulemyot Sudayeva model of 1942).[1] The weapon was put into small-scale production during the Siege of Leningrad; mass production did not commence until early 1943 at the Sestroryetsk Arsenal (over 45,000 weapons were produced before being replaced by the improved PPS-43).[1] The improvements to production efficiency allowed the Soviets to increase monthly submachine gun output from 135,000 units to 350,000 weapons.

Buyer pays for shipping and insurance to your FFL; not included in sale price. Cannot sell to individuals in States that do not allow high capacity magazines.

For the next 7-days, Glock-19 Gunfighter Kit#1 is listed at $1950 and Glock-19 Gunfighter Kit#2 is listed at $1950 (combined total of $3900).

Will consider other Glock Gunfighter Package Combinations on a case-by-case basis, as well as other trades on an individual basis.

Note (1): Not all 9mm Factory New Ammunition has original boxes because for high round count training classes, dumped ammo in baggies or ammo can for ease of transportation, reloading mags and weather protection; 908 rounds are bagged; 4-200 rounds bags adn 1-108 round bag.

Note (2): All Holsters are for Right-Hand

PLEASE: Serious offers and inquires only, because I do not ""need to sell"" and can always use with my Students in 2013 (see WWW.APW-LLC.COM) 

Based on immediate availability of quality and quantity of ammunition (5750 rounds factory new FMJ ammo and 400 rounds of Factory New Personal Defense/Duty ammo), and 11-high capacity magazines (21-rounds each) and 5 standard 15-round magazines -- this is a good investment.

Selling our Glock 23 .40 with 3 Glock clips and 450 rounds of ammo for it. This is being sold as a package deal only and we're asking $800 plus any fees to get it to you although I'd prefer a local sale. I've probably shot under 500 rounds through this and it a great gub, but I've gotta thin out the herd as they say. It has one scratch on the handle that can be seen in the picture. We bought this new. Thanks for looking and please let me know if you have any questions!"

The barrel is in perfect shape with the exception of a cosmetic blemish at the beginning of the barrel shown in the third picture. The wait on the SBX barrel from Tactical Solutions is near 4 to 5 months. These are getting harder to find. I am firm at $275. 

Tactical Solutions’ X-Ring SB-X barrel is a precision machined, lightweight barrel upgrade designed to easily fit the popular 10/22® without gunsmithing .The SB-X shortens the overall barrel length, giving the shooter the advantage of an SBR without the paperwork. X-Ring SB-X barrels have a bore length of 12.25” but an overall length of 16.5” due to the permanently attached shroud to house your suppressor.

Machined from 6061-T6 billet aluminum, this .920 diameter barrel is essential for the serious shooter who demands accuracy. For a custom fit, the X-Ring SB-X barrel has an oversized shank to fit a vast array of 10/22® receivers. A 1 in 16” twist chrome moly button rifled barrel makes this an accurate and reliable choice for the 10/22® shooter."

Only reason I'm selling it is because 20 years of military training has me locked into DA/SA triggers.  I can shoot the striker fired pistols pretty well, but just feel more comfortable with what I've been trained on.  

It's a LNIB XDS Bi-tone for sale, bought in mid Novemeber.  I've put about 200 rounds through it at the range; combo of target and self defense ammo.  I have had ZERO FTF, FTE, double feeds, etc.  It shoots very accurate, no sight adjustments necessary.  Cleaned after both trips to the range.  

The following are included along with the XDS:
- Original case and all XD Gear (dbl mag holder, lock, holster, backstrap, manuals)
- 7rd magazine along with the two original 5rd mags
- Pierce pink extension on both 5rd mags
- Crimson Trace laser
- Multiholster IWB Kydex holster (accommodates the laser)

- About 30 rounds of self defense ammo, hornandy zombie mostly

The manual gain control feature allows the user to increase or decrease image tube brightness for best possible image contrast in high and low light conditions. The most versatile night vision system on the market, the PVS-14 Alpha can be used hands-free, weapons mounted or attached to a camera or camcorder for nighttime photography."

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately."

This is the premium tactical version that they made for the first couple years of production.  This model has the Troy aluminum flip up sights and aluminum quad rail. Also has chrome lined barrel.  In 2011 S&W cheaped out and started using cheap magpul sights and poly rails on this gun as well as did away with the quality barrel.  This is a very nice firearm and assembled with premium pieces from the factory.  Rifle is used but in perfect condition, it has about 500 rounds through it.  Comes with one loaded magpul pmag and case."

For the 50rds of .308 - I'm asking $30 or 100rds of 9mm range ammo (nothing expensive, just something to plink at the range with, such as Winchesters value pack), 75rds of .45 ACP, or 60rds of .223. 

For the 100 rds of 8mm - I'm asking $50 or roughly 200rds of 9mm range ammo (again, just plinking ammo), or 100rds of .45 ACP ammo, or 100rds of .223 ammo.

I have pictures available for those interested, face to face in Dallas / Fort Worth metroplex only please - if you look young, be sure to bring an ID (as I'll have mine with me as well)."
