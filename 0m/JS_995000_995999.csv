The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Adjustable sights, slide out folding stock. Sling rings and accessory mount. Really cool design.

It was cleaned up and put in the original cardboard box (K-Mart I think was the place back then to buy them lol) , the store price-gun-sticker still has the date it was marked lol.

These are beautiful, this one is very very nice, I won't say its PERFECT because it has been fired and is 40 years old, but it's definitely in the VERY VERY GOOD category.

Comes with the factory 15-rounder mag-- NOW IS THE TIME, it is a great looking, extremely reliable, war proven, perfectly-pointing semi-auto that has 15 round magazines with the capability of finding larger aftermaker.  It is NOW THE TIME to get this IDEAL ranch rifle / truck gun / home defense implement that is ideal for teaching the wife or frist timer with because of its lack of recoil and nicely shaped/contoured build.  GET IT NOW before they are no longer avalable, the PRICE IS GOING UP EVERY SINGLE DAY, AVAILABILITY GOING DOWN, and you want to get it and get to Cheaper than Dirt/etc. for your mags and ammo."

It does not even have a full box of ammo through it.  It has everything that originally came with the firearm, which includes the box, two 17-round magazines, three backstraps to adjust the size of the grip for your specific comfort, a lock, and all original paperwork.  This one is a full size frame with a 4.25"" barrel.

The M&P is a solid firearm for personal and home defense and smooth to shoot.  Perhaps the one criticism often heard is about the mushiness of the trigger, especially on reset.  To correct that, this firearm already has Apex's Universal Striker Block and also it's Reset Assist Mechanism (RAM).  The trigger reset is now both tactile and audible.

I'm asking $625 OBO for this firearm.  I saw a brand new one just last week at Superior Pawn but it was just stock and their price with tax is still higher than my price.  So to do this you'd have to pay about seven hundred in total.  I won't call mine new because that would be a lie; but, the only difference is a few extra rounds fired.  Look closely at the pictures though, and you will see that the slide has no holster wear.  On top there is a little rubbing but nothing else, which supports that only a few rounds have been fired through this firearm.

Pictures will be sent upon request.  If you think I'm too high, make me a fair offer.  My preference is to sell but if you have a really interesting trade, I will consider it.  Thanks."

Not enough bullet tumble to be the right thing from 1-100 meters...but I'm sure you know that. I'm also sure you know how difficult and expensive 223 and 5.56 ammo is to come by, and the govt. just ordered another 450 million rounds assuring it will not get any easier and yet shotgun rounds are EVERYWHERE and plentiful. An AR without ammunition is well...lame.  For close combat/home defense situations NOTHING a civilian can legally own will outperform this weapon in terms of sheer firepower. This drum and magazine fed system cycles both 3"" as well as 2 3/4"" 12 gauge rounds at an incredible rate of speed with consistent precision.... Fully converted and customized top to bottom with no expense spared. Legal and compliant in the State of Oregon. Will not ship. Please note if you intend to travel or move to another state checking local law would be advisable. The drum alone is a criminal offense in many jurisdictions.. Notice the trigger position on most other Saiga's you view. If the trigger is a distance from the magazine well, it has NOT had the trigger modification, and that is a problem. These weapons are imported neutered and how they are built out is everything. With these Russian weapon systems you DO NOT want new and in the box unless your goal is to build your own dream set up. This particular Saiga 12 is a one of a kind and stands on it's own as a collectible and extremely functional art piece of an era that is quickly coming to an end. I would encourage you to seriously wake up if you don't sense what is on the horizon. Never again in U.S. history will you, an American, be allowed to purchase a weapon of this magnitude. This is the most devastating weapon a civilian can legally own in any of the states. It doesn't get any better at any price.......take this bad ass weapon to the Portland Gun Show and make a $1000 before you get to the front door of the place!!  ...just sayin"

If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.

REVIEWS BY ADVANCED WEAPONS:
First field test of the SR556- Sheridan, Wyoming. Ruger factory sponsored prairie dog hunt. We were privileged to attend the hunt, and an Impact employee was the first to take an animal with the SR556 rifle!

Function and reliability were 100%. The dog town we were shooting at had dogs out to 360 yards. All ranging was done using the new Ziess 8x binoculars with range and holdover function. Even with a low 10x scope, dogs were taken all the way out to 361 yards. Very impressive for any rifle, and even more so for a carbine!

We were shooting Hornady TAP ammo, 55g, loaded into the P-Mags that are included with each rifle. Effect on the targets was devastating. Multiple hits and complex gymnastics by the dogs were the norm.

All in all, our experience with the SR556 was beyond our expectations. The gas system gives the gun a softer recoil that a standard gas AR, and the chamber/bolt area was much cleaner that a gas AR. This SR556 is a keeper, and a really good value with all the good kit that is part of the base rifle.

We have sold literally hunderds of the Ruger SR556 rifles. They are incredibly reliable and several of our customers report that even after thousands of rounds (some without cleaning) they have not experienced a single malfunction! 

If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.
Piston AR's are more Reliable, Cleaner and Smoother Shooting!

    The new standard of personal defense. Super Carry .45 ACP pistols are made in the Kimber Custom Shop to unequaled requirements of usability, dependability and performance. Light, powerful and loaded with the very best features for concealed carry, this is the Pistol to have on your side.

    Super Carry pistols have highly refined features like night sights with cocking shoulder, Carry Melt™ treatment for rounded edges that will not cut or snag and special beveled slide serrations for positive operation.

    Custom Shop enhancements include recessed slide stop pin with surrounding bevel, high cut under trigger guard for better recoil control and aggressive front strap serrations that ensure a positive grip regardless of conditions.

    Round heel frame configuration makes Super Carry pistols easier to conceal and more comfortable to carry. Serrated mainspring housing welds grip to palm, encouraging fast sight picture recovery between shots.

    The Super Carry family was designed with a single purpose, to be the finest concealed carry pistols available today. Night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety and match grade trigger group are standard. Stainless steel slides and light weight aluminum frames wear KimPro II, a proprietary high-tech finish that is self- lubricating and extremely durable. The Super Carry Custom has a 5-inch stainless steel match grade barrel, the Super Carry Pro has a 4-inch bull barrel and the Super Carry Ultra has a 3-inch bull barrel plus a frame with shorter grip. Super Carry pistols combine dynamic style with outstanding quality and performance – just what you expect from Kimber.

    The new standard of personal defense. Super Carry .45 ACP pistols are made in the Kimber Custom Shop to unequaled requirements of usability, dependability and performance. Light, powerful and loaded with the very best features for concealed carry, this is the Pistol to have on your side.

    Super Carry pistols have highly refined features like night sights with cocking shoulder, Carry Melt™ treatment for rounded edges that will not cut or snag and special beveled slide serrations for positive operation.

    Custom Shop enhancements include recessed slide stop pin with surrounding bevel, high cut under trigger guard for better recoil control and aggressive front strap serrations that ensure a positive grip regardless of conditions.

    Round heel frame configuration makes Super Carry pistols easier to conceal and more comfortable to carry. Serrated mainspring housing welds grip to palm, encouraging fast sight picture recovery between shots.

    The Super Carry family was designed with a single purpose, to be the finest concealed carry pistols available today. Night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety and match grade trigger group are standard. Stainless steel slides and light weight aluminum frames wear KimPro II, a proprietary high-tech finish that is self- lubricating and extremely durable. The Super Carry Custom has a 5-inch stainless steel match grade barrel, the Super Carry Pro has a 4-inch bull barrel and the Super Carry Ultra has a 3-inch bull barrel plus a frame with shorter grip. Super Carry pistols combine dynamic style with outstanding quality and performance – just what you expect from Kimber.

Model 3000246 - New In Box - Ships Fast

    The new standard of personal defense. Super Carry .45 ACP pistols are made in the Kimber Custom Shop to unequaled requirements of usability, dependability and performance. Light, powerful and loaded with the very best features for concealed carry, this is the Pistol to have on your side.

    Super Carry pistols have highly refined features like night sights with cocking shoulder, Carry Melt™ treatment for rounded edges that will not cut or snag and special beveled slide serrations for positive operation.

    Custom Shop enhancements include recessed slide stop pin with surrounding bevel, high cut under trigger guard for better recoil control and aggressive front strap serrations that ensure a positive grip regardless of conditions.

    Round heel frame configuration makes Super Carry pistols easier to conceal and more comfortable to carry. Serrated mainspring housing welds grip to palm, encouraging fast sight picture recovery between shots.

    The Super Carry family was designed with a single purpose, to be the finest concealed carry pistols available today. Night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety and match grade trigger group are standard. Stainless steel slides and light weight aluminum frames wear KimPro II, a proprietary high-tech finish that is self- lubricating and extremely durable. The Super Carry Custom has a 5-inch stainless steel match grade barrel, the Super Carry Pro has a 4-inch bull barrel and the Super Carry Ultra has a 3-inch bull barrel plus a frame with shorter grip. Super Carry pistols combine dynamic style with outstanding quality and performance – just what you expect from Kimber.

It features 2 GB of onboard 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM, a 128 GB Solid-State Drive (SSD), a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M ""graphics processor with 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory"", an integrated iSight video camera, a full-size backlit keyboard with ambient light sensor, and a 13.3"" widescreen TFT LED backlit active-matrix ""glossy"" display (1280x800 native resolution) in a razor thin (0.16-0.76 inch), three pound, aluminum case.

Connectivity includes AirPort Extreme (802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, a single USB 2.0 port, analog audio out, and video out capabilities (Mini DisplayPort) that support an external 30"" display. It lacks Ethernet (an external adapter is available), Firewire, and optical audio in/out.

The MacBook Air ""Core 2 Duo"" 1.86 13"" (NVIDIA/Late 2008) uses the same housing as the original model -- with the same 13.3"" display, full-size keyboard and single button, ""three-finger"" trackpad. Internally, it likewise lacks an optical drive, the battery is not designed to be removable, and the memory cannot be upgraded beyond the onboard 2 GB, but it has a number of internal improvements as well including a marginally faster processor (in this model), faster NVIDIA graphics, a faster architecture with a faster system bus, and faster memory, and a larger L2 cache. It additionally ships equipped with a larger SSD and swaps the mini-DVI port for a new Mini DisplayPort standard."
