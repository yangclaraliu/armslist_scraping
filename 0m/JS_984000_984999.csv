The Shoulder-Gard Rifle Rest (SGR-30) is MTM's first recoil reduction rest. With the growing popularity of magnum caliber rifles, heavy recoil can be a real pain. To address this issue, MTM has made a 4-point, flexible base, shooting rest designed to ease the shoulder punishment of sighting-in powerful magnum rifles. By utilizing the integrated recoil-reduction sling, shooters are able to relax and shoot more comfortably, knowing that less recoil from the gun is going to be felt. The recoil reduction sling does not have to be used with lighter caliber rifles."

I have a beautiful Polish Tantal for sale. This is Poland's redesign of the AK74. It has a rock solid folding stock, great muzzle brake and smooth action. This is a low recoil rifle that is fun and cheap to shoot. It was imported by Century Arms. It's one of the latest imports (TTL-C serial) so it has the proper barrel and does not key-hole. I've shot 100 rounds of non-corrosive Wolf though it and it's an awesome rifle. The condition is very good to excellent, it could pass as new. These are excellent rifles and in my opinion the best AK variant. I'd like to keep it but my safe is full and I need to make room for other projects. I have one 30 round steel magazine and the factory clip on bi-pod. 

I have many more detailed pictures, contact me and I'll send them through Email.

This is the best Tantal on Armlist in Washington, don't pay more for a keyholer.

I live and work in North Seattle but I spend most weekends east of the mountains so I can meet anywhere between Seattle and Ellensburg along I-90. I can either do a FTF sale or ship it to an FFL, buyer pays shipping. 

I'm open to partial trades in ammo, rifles, pistols, Nagant revolver, reloading equipment, magazines, tools, gold, silver, etc. Feel free to make an offer, the worst I can say is no. Cash is still king.

Here is information about #41 primers from CCI: 
Military-style semi-auto rifles seldom have firing pin retraction springs. If care is not used in assembling ammunition, a ""slam-fire"" can occur before the bolt locks. The military arsenals prevent this using different techniques and components - including different primer sensitivity specifications - from their commercial counterparts. CCI makes rifle primers for commercial sale that matches military sensitivity specifications that reduce the chance of a ""slam-fire"" when other factors go out of control*. If you're reloading for a military semi-auto, Look to CCI military primers. 
* Effective slam-fire prevention requires more than special primers. Headspace, chamber condition, firing pin shape and protrusion, bolt velocity, cartridge case condition, and other factors can affect slam-fire potential.

I bought this rifle almost fifteen years ago and it has sat in my safe since new. A magazine has been inserted and it has a couple VERY minor handling/storage marks, however I have never fired it and has only been test fired by Armalite. I have never mounted any optics on the flat-top rail or the front sight mini-rail so both rails are pristine. Ready to rock and roll, just add optics of choice! This rifle in stainless is very rare and may be the last you'll see before the impending assault rifle ban Obama is hell bent on passing. Included in the sale is the factory manual and paperwork, and one ten rd magazine. I also have several factory new in wrapper Armalite 20 rd mags that I will sell separately to whoever buys it. I hate to see this go, but need the funds for another rifle I want to get before they ban it. Willing to accept credit card payment through discreet Paypal transaction with buyer to pay additional 3%. Private sale- no paperwork or FFL fees."

I also have a 2000 Yamaha 6hp 2 stroke outboard that needs water pump service  and basically just gone through everything (thermostat, carbs, seals etc) to make sure its good to go. It fires up and runs great but hasnt been serviced in a while.. may trade out service depending on whats done and negotiate a price. Must know what you are doing and work has to be done with me present or at my home. Would not be able to be worked on until second week of feb maybe a few days later.

Made at the Tula Arsenal. It has the rare factory original laminate stock, all numbers match! The bolt carrier is black which tells me the rife was most likely factory refurbished at the Tula arsenal. However the serial number on the stock matches all the rest and has no Xs, indicating it is original and quite rare. Includes, Cleaning rod, cleaning kit in stock, bayonet, and sling.
The Russian SKS is the Original and considered to be the best quality of all the SKSs. Chrome lined bore, threaded on barrel, milled trigger group.

These are BRAND NEW to the market.  They are loaded loaded by Fiocchi using Fiocchi brass (and I would assume other components as well) and are branded for Tula (box is marked ""Made in Italy"").  Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition).  They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 15 boxes available. Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 2 box minimum on orders I have to ship."
