Comes with factory hard case, acc, and one factory magazine.  Rifle has a Magpul AFG installed.  It has had optics installed and there are some wear marks from that on the top rail.  You're going to have to mount something on it, there are no iron sights, so you will likely cover the marks.  

Rifle is in good used condition, but definitely not new.  I've fired several kinds of 22LR ammo, all functioned flawlessly.  

The Commando features an inert training suppressor mounted by standard ½ x 28 TPI threads. The inert tactical trainer can be removed and the Commando used in the standard rifle configuration. The threaded barrel also accepts many of the most popular flash suppressors and sound suppressor mounts on the market.

Available with either polymer handguards or in an aluminum quad-rail SWAT model, the SIG522 Commando is a cost-effective training tool for military, law enforcement or anyone who depends on a carbine or rifle for protection.

The Commando offers the same features as the original SIG522, with an anodized, alloy upper receiver and M1913 rail mounted for the easy addition of optics, sights, lights and lasers. A folding, telescopic stock provides a strong, stable platform for shooters.

The Commando accepts 10 and 25 round polymer SIG522 magazines, and weighing in at 6 lb, 2 oz, the Commando is lighter than a standard SIG556® and enables longer training time with less fatigue, but still retains enough weight for realistic training purposes."

This is a 4th generation (current) 40 caliber Glock 27.  It's the subcompact model of Glock's 40 caliber line of pistols.  It was for my wife who was not into carrying it and she preferred my gun (Glock 23) so guess what I get to do...

Anyway, it has a very low round count, no smileys on the barrel as you can see in the picture (<100 rounds), I've put a 3.5lb trigger bar that has reduced creep and barely lightened the trigger from it's native 5.5lbs to probably 4.5-5.0lbs.  It's been kept cleaned, detail stripped and cleaned for sale, and properly lubed.  There is some very minor finish wear as you can see in the pics (if you look close enough).  The wear is why it's not at full price, even though it comes with an extra mag (9 rounders) AND the magazine extension sleeve as you see in the picture on a 13 round Glock 23 magazine (mag not included).  This gun is in ""99%"" condition only because of the minor wear on the finish (serpa holster!!).  It shoots and fires perfectly and will for many, many thousands of rounds.

DISCLOSURE: I bought this from a guy who failed to mention a little issue with the gun. After about 10 rounds have been fired the hammer will not cock on close. The remedy is to spray the action with some gun scrubber then some oil and it's good to go again. It's not much of an issue for me, but something the prospective buyer should know.

Henry Repeating Arms has tooled up to manufacture a new and improved version of the famous U.S. Air Force AR-7, now known as the Henry U.S. Survival rifle. This compact and lightweight sportsmanâ€™s rifle is ideal for all outdoorsmen, including campers, backpackers, hunters, fishermen, boat owners and target shooters. And it can still serve its original purpose as a survival rifle for pilots.

The Henry U.S. Survival rifle is ultra-lightweight, weighing in at a scant 2.5 pounds. The unique design allows the rifle to break down easily into three pieces in seconds. This enables the barrel, action and two 8-round magazines to fit comfortably into the tough ABS synthetic waterproof stock. No tools are needed to assemble or disassemble. Once disassembled and stowed, it is only an incredible 16 inches long. Carry it in your backpack with room to spare.

To assemble, simply attach the receiver to the stock, insert the barrel, screw on the barrel nut and youâ€™re ready to fire. In seconds, youâ€™ll have the security of a semi-automatic rifle without the bulk and weight of a full size firearm.

The Henry U.S. Survival rifle features a steel barrel that is covered in a tough ABS plastic and then coated in Teflon. This unique barrel design allows the gun to balance properly and remain lightweight, yet withstand tens of thousands of rounds. The entire receiver is also coated in Teflon, making the Henry U.S. Survival rifle the most weather-resistant of any AR-7 ever made. As an added feature, the receiver rib is now grooved for easy installation of a scope.

I functions well, but I rarely carry it.  It comes with one magazine and the original box, manual  lock.  There is not pocket clip on this pistol.  Asking $200 firm.  Email or text REDACTED.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

For those of you who have seen our ads (now deleted) or bought from us before (thank you!) you know Hoffy's is very competitive.

Rather than join the big box retailers at nearly $600 for a new Glock, we are running sort of a silent auction.  Just pick out a new Glock from the list below and send me a response with your desired price.  I'll respond back and let you know if we can meet your price or not (be reasonable, guys!).  Give me a little time... there's a lot of emailing involved in this job.

The shopping basket for this week contains:

Gen 3 Models:  22, 23, 26, 27 (these include 2 magazines)
Gen 4 Models:  22, 23 (these include 3 magazines)

See the Glock web site for exact details on these pistols.

Inventories on other Glock models are tight right now.  Ask and I'll look if you just have to have something else!  Also, we sell just about every brand of firearm.  Let me know what you are looking for and I'll do some searching for you.

Who are we?  Hoffy's Shooting Supplies is a gun and reloading supplies shop located in Woodbury off of 494 and Valley Creek.  We are adjacent to the MGM Liquor Warehouse.  Although we have only been there since July, our reputation for good service and low prices is getting around.

As inventories move out we reorder from our distributors.  Lead times are usually 3-4 days.  We do not need a credit card number (unless we are shipping to your FFL somewhere out of town) but will order your selection up for you in good faith when you commit to buying.  Please make sure to have your permit up to date if buying a handgun or ""assault weapon"".  If you aren't sure what qualifies please call Nancy Pelosi's office and talk to her about it!

NEW IN BOX


Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.

Also included is a Kimber 22LR conversion kit with adjustable sights and 2 polymer 10 round mags.

Everything is set into a waterproof / lockable Pelican gun case that has been formed to hold everything snuggly in place.

The pistol frame is aluminum and the slide is steel. I have put just under 200 rounds through the pistol for a break in, but never had a single malfunction with it.

Both calibers shoot exceptionally well. The polymer mags can be a bit aggravating to seat and eject at times but function flawlessly.

There is a little wear on the finish around the trigger frame that was there when I purchased it new. It is very minimal and didn’t bother me because I use my firearms and expect to get scratches eventually.

Pistol is not for sale.  It is for trade only.  Thanks

Would also be willing to trade on a Sig 551"

UTG 6 position M4 stock (mil spec tube)
Double Star lower with DPMS lower parts kit.
Chambered for 5.56 NATO with Military head space (between 1.4636 and 1.4736)

This was a specially requested build for a former soldier and the buyer backed out on me after I had already gotten the parts in. Has had a total of 30 rounds (Federal XM193) through it to test for function. Must go ASAP. Comes with 30 round magazine. This thing is a BEAST and weighs 9 lbs unloaded. I would keep it for myself but I don't like the feel of the HBAR, much less the length of this one. Barrel is NOT chromed and has 1 in 9 twist. Great for long range and heavy fire, not so great for carrying around all day.

This Night Defender is NDF09xx. So it was part of the second 800 shipped, and there was a price increase between the first and second 800. So there are only and will only be 1,600 of these ever made, and here is your chance to own one. This gun comes with 2 7 round magazines, and the hard Colt case. It has a Trijicon 1 dot front site and 2 dot back site. An Alluminum Skeletonized trigger, and black slide. It has minor holster wear, but is in overall great condition. I will entertain any trade, but only for handguns. No rifles, derrringers, or shotguns please. Looking for other high end 1911's like Springfield, Kimber, or Colt, but like I said I'm open to all trades. I can add cash to my gun if necessary or take cash and a gun if necessary for the right deal. I will also consider multiple guns for my gun or give multiple guns for your gun. Just make an offer, but please don't lowball me. I know that this gun is extremely hard to find, and it's not just a regular Defender."

The one on the top is a Bushmaster Bullpup .223/5.56. It is the Model M17S. It is NOT a bullpup kit, but a true factory made bullpup rifle. It is piston driven. It is far from stock. The guy I got it from had the sides custom ported using professional machining to reduce heat build up, as well as he had rails put on the top, bottom, and sides. It is equipped with a drop down grip and an EoTech XPS sight on it. 
The next item in that picture is a Century Arms AR-15 .223/5.56 full length upper with quad rails and an Osprey 3-9x40 scope. The one below that is a carbine length DPMS 6.8 SPC upper with MAGPUL handguards. The lower in the picture is a Century Arms standard lower and will work with both the 5.56 and the 6.8 uppers. The magazine well holds both types of magazines. I dont plan on separating the uppers and the lower. I would like to sell them as a package so I dont have a random upper laying around with no lower platform. Makes a nice interchangeable rifle when you have both the uppers. You can swap from 5.56 to 6.8 easily. I have a 5.56 mag and 2 6.8 mags. Might have some ammo left, but not sure.
These prices are negotiable, but not by much. Im not giving them away and will not respond to ridiculous low offers.

GLOCK 35    	
Glock 15 + 1 Round Double Action Only 40S&W w/Adjustable Sights.  The introduction of the Glock 35 pistol was a revelation to the law enforcement and self defense community. With its extended barrel and extended line of sight, it allows accurate hit patterns even with rapid firing. This has resulted in widespread distribution of the Glock 35 among the practical shooting community.

The one on the top is a Bushmaster Bullpup .223/5.56. It is the Model M17S. It is NOT a bullpup kit, but a true factory made bullpup rifle. It is piston driven. It is far from stock. The guy I got it from had the sides custom ported using professional machining to reduce heat build up, as well as he had rails put on the top, bottom, and sides. It is equipped with a drop down grip and an EoTech XPS sight on it. 
The next item in that picture is a Century Arms AR-15 .223/5.56 full length upper with quad rails and an Osprey 3-9x40 scope. The one below that is a carbine length DPMS 6.8 SPC upper with MAGPUL handguards. The lower in the picture is a Century Arms standard lower and will work with both the 5.56 and the 6.8 uppers. The magazine well holds both types of magazines. I dont plan on separating the uppers and the lower. I would like to sell them as a package so I dont have a random upper laying around with no lower platform. Makes a nice interchangeable rifle when you have both the uppers. You can swap from 5.56 to 6.8 easily. I have a 5.56 mag and 2 6.8 mags. Might have some ammo left, but not sure.
These prices are best offer prices, meaning make me a good cash offer and we'll talk.

968,http://www.armslist.com/posts/345968,For Sale:  One-of-a-kind folding AK stock,"Sneads Ferry, Jacksonville, North Carolina",$ 120,"Listed On: Friday, March 23, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have to sell this stock because it makes my weapon illegal in my home state of Michigan. 

This stock was originally a Russian triangle folding stock that had to be riveted into the receiver, which also had to be modified with a latch to hold the stock closed. Many of these were bought by the state arsenal in Bulgaria and fitted into a receiver block so they can be a drop in replacement for standard AKM stamped receiver stocks. Naturally this stock has a longer length of pull than the ones that just rivet in, which is a plus for most people of larger stature. This stock is very solid. There is NO slop at all when it is locked in the open position. There is a latch on the side of the receiver block that holds it in the closed position. The fit and finish of the stock is typical of any product from the state arsenal in Bulgaria and especially typical of an ARSENAL USA import. These people make the best AK rifles money can buy and they make the best parts. I personally bought mine from K-VAR, ARSENAL USA's distributor. MIDWAY USA still has the last of these stocks and they sell for $160.00 before tax and shipping. Mine is only very slightly used and doesn't have any finish wear so I think I have a very fair price on it. There is no tax, shipping charges, wait time, or shipping hassle for this product, so taking $50 off is a fair price. After all it is almost new. 

 Price is non negotiable. It deeply saddens me to have to get rid of this great part. I will be adding a picture of it on my rifle soon and I'll try to get a close up. I can be reached at REDACTED

I've had this pistol about a year (purchased new) and have only put 200 rounds through it. Due to outside interests, I'm downsizing my gun inventory a bit. This is the last one for sale right now. Hard to let go of this one, it shoots real nice and has not had a jam, shooting a variety of factory loads through it. Comes with most paperwork, 1-factory mag (new it only comes with one); the other mags you see in pictures are Chip McCormick mags. I have added bumpers to the bottom of them, a personal preference - they can be easily removed if desired. As I'm reducing the number of guns I have, I'm not looking to trade for anything. So this is cash and carry. $899 - Best Offers will be entertained if REASONABLE. You know what it is, and what its' worth...don't waste my time and yours. Thanks for looking."
