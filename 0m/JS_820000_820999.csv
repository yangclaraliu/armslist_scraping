A design adopted from the popular SpecOps stock, the BreachersGrip is a shotgun pistol grip that can cut the perceived recoil produced by heavy loads and breaching rounds in half. When fired, the shotgun body pivots up and to the rear along an inclined ramp while pulling on a compressed spring within the pistol grip. This movement coupled with the resistance of the powerful spring absorbs a significant amount of the recoil impulse. Thus, with the BreachersGrip, a compact pistol grip-equipped shotgun can be deployed with relative ease by most users without the fear of painful recoil.

The rifle itself is in great condition overall.  

The front and rear sights are canted but surprisingly accurate.  
Round count is less than 20 overall(I shot 5 rounds thru it, cleaned it and then put it up. The guy before me shot less than 15 rounds thru it). 

Has the 4x scope on it. Comes with the scope cover also

Comes with 2-10 round mags and a 4 mag carrier.

Comes with 45 rounds of surplus 147gr FMJ

Will come with 879 rounds of silver tip(steel core) 147gr, from  Bulgarian.  Yes 879, I took one apart to weight it and to cut it open to verify it was steel core.

Option 1-Price is $1450 for the rifle and all ammo.  

Option 2-Rifle with the 45 rounds of FMJ, $1200.

Option 3-If the buyer don't want the 879 rounds I will sell them for $350 but only if the rifle sells first.  

Either way there will be ammo going with it.



It will be a FTF transaction around Taylorsville NC.  Serious buyers can swing by for a test fire i(I will provide 3 rounds for test fire).  All laws apply.  So bring NCDL and must be willing to sign a basic bill of sale.  A purchase permit or a conceal carry permit is a big plus but NOT required.

My number is 8two8-2to8-7O33.

I will get more pics to any potential buyer."

This is the version closest to the AUG in that it comes with the 1.5X optical scope. The scope can be removed and another rail mounted for other siting options, but the scope works great at distances up to 50 yards. Less than 200 rounds through gun. Comes with a Desert Storm tan stock. This comes complete with the five 30-round OEM, see-through magazines. (These are not AR mags.) It also has the Steyr AUG/STG style shoulder sling allowing the gun to be carried and moved to the firing position without moving the sling over your head. Also comes with a combination flashlight and laser attached to the right-side rail. It allows you to have flashlight, laser or both.

A design adopted from the popular SpecOps stock, the BreachersGrip is a shotgun pistol grip that can cut the perceived recoil produced by heavy loads and breaching rounds in half. When fired, the shotgun body pivots up and to the rear along an inclined ramp while pulling on a compressed spring within the pistol grip. This movement coupled with the resistance of the powerful spring absorbs a significant amount of the recoil impulse. Thus, with the BreachersGrip, a compact pistol grip-equipped shotgun can be deployed with relative ease by most users without the fear of painful recoil.

Manufacturer: Laserlyte FSL-3
Item: 2-LLFSL-3


The new V3 from Laserlyte is the smallest rail mounted laser ever produced by the company. It requires only ¾"" of rail space and at less than half an ounce, you'll barely notice the additional weight. Four 377 Lithium batteries provide as much as 10 hours of total run time with the laser in pulse mode, while the auto-off feature automatically shuts down the laser after 6 minutes of use. The unit flashes a unique notification light to alert the user for 1 minute prior to shutdown and is reset with the press of a button. 

The Version 3 can mount directly on all the 3"" barrel subcompact railed pistols and all other railed weapons. The laser features an integrated cross lock bar, hinge clamp system and a quick detachable release. One of the most innovative features is the removable accessory rail. The small Picatinny rail attaches to the bottom of the laser and allows the mounting of flashlights or other accessories. Take the small rail off and now you have a very low profile laser that will fit into any nylon holster. 
Laserlyte won the 2009 NRA Most Innovative Shooting Accessory for their sub-compact V3 laser, item number SCP-788.

This replacement magazine for the Sig Sauer P250 is a factory original from Sig Sauer. Factory replacement parts are manufactured to the exact same specifications and tolerances and use the same manufacturing materials as the original parts which guarantees excellent fit and reliable operation. 

Keeping a few extra factory magazines around is never a bad idea; extra magazines save loading time at the range and also serve as a backup for those days when you simply cannot remember where you put your primary magazine.

Holds 7 rds or 2 3/4. 6rds 3inch  This gun is used by several police and special force teams world wide. Info from Beretta:

This shotgun, developed in the late 1980s or early 1990s by the famous Italian arms manufacturing company Pietro Beretta, is, basically, an upgrade over the preceding model, Beretta 1200. The 1201 was manufactured in two versions, 1201F,intended for hunting and sporting, and the 1201FP, intended for police and other such duties. Interestingly enough, the 1201 is extremely similar to the BenelliM1 Super 90 shotgun, and had the same recoil-operated semiautomatic action,developed and patented by Benelli. The production of the Beretta 1201 shotguns had been completed.

Since the basic action of the 1201 is similar to such of the Benelli M1 shotgun,for the technical description please refer to the appropriate article at this site. The 1201FP was available with polymer furniture and stock, either with classic or pistol grip. Since the recoil spring is located in the buttstock,this shotgun cannot be fitted with the folding buttstock. The 1201FP can be found with either ghost-ring (large aperture diopter) or open rifle-type rearsights, and with the blade front sight."

Plus people aren't hoarding .204 like the .223 these days.  The bull barrel on this tack driver is 24"" long stainless steel and cryo treated.  Another great thing about this rifle is the forged elevated optic rail.  This allows easy instalation of a large objective scope and lets you get a much more comfortable sight picture.  Something that can be a pain with putting a long range scope a conventional flat top receiver!  The rifle also has the RRA Winter Trigger Guard.  This feature makes it much easier to shoot while wearing gloves.  Aluminum free float handguard and A2 style buttstock with sling studs. This well cared for rifle has only been shot 8 times.

The MagPul Back Up Sight (MBUS) Flip-Up Front Sight is a durable, inexpensive Back Up Iron Sight option specifically tailored for the AR-15 platform. Constructed of high impact polymer, the sights are lightweight, unobtrusive, and capable of withstanding harsh environments and rough handling in the field. The Flip-Up Front Sight is spring loaded, popping up instantly when activated by pressing down on either of its side levers or from the top. The sight remains upright under spring and detent pressure, folding only when deliberately stowed by the shooter or in the case of a jarring impact to prevent damage. The MBUS clamps to any standard Picatinny railed handguard, providing the same height-over-bore as a mil-spec A2 fixed front sight. 

The product-improved Gen 2 MBUS Front Sight features a slimmer profile for greater optics compatibility when in the folded position, while the front sight post now incorporates a spring lock for consistent elevation adjustment. 

NOTE: MBUS Front Sights CANNOT be mounted to a railed gas block due to the extreme heat generated during firing. The MBUS Front Sight must be mounted to a railed handguard on the same plane as the receiver rail. MBUS front sights are not compatible with MOE Handguards.

I've decided to part with my LWRC M6A2 SPR AR-15 in FDE (Flat Dark Earth) Cerakote that was purchased brand new from Superior Pawn on 10/30/2012, the gun was fired once at Colonial Shooting Academy at which point I ran approx. 122 rounds through it. Since that point the gun has been wiped down and kept in a rifle bag. 

This rifle comes with a AimPoint Micro T-1 on a tall LaRue mount that were both purchased brand new from LaRue tactical. However, this gun also comes with the LWRC marked backup iron sights which are still installed.

In addition to the rifle I have a total of 5x 30 round P-Mags that go with this gun. (1 non-windowed, 4 windowed) and 700 rounds of 55g PMC Bronze 5.56/.223 ammo in 35 boxes of 20 round each.

The Vortex Optics HS-1M-QR Quick-Release Riflescope Rings use a unique lever system that allows you to remove and reattach the scope from rifle without loss of zero. Four T-15 Torx style socket cap screws securely mount your riflescope. Once the rings are affixed to the base, the location of the lever can be indexed.

The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks. The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts.

This AR also has the Magpul Rifle Grip as well as the Magpul Vertical Grip in tan. This weapon will come with a 30rd steel mag as I am keeping all of my 30rd Pmags.

I will take $1850 OBO for the AR. My local shop has AR's listed right now much higher than that and lots of them are of lesser quality. Figured I would try to sell it on my own first so number one I dont have to pay them a consignment fee and number 2 someone has the option of purchasing one without paperwork. I also do not mind working through an FFL if that makes you more comfortable. However I will require a valid id or drivers license regardless. At the gun show over the weekend and they were selling AR's for much more than $2500 and Pmags were going for $100 each. I am taking a gamble on selling this one because if this ban does go through and if anyone remembers the Clinton ban knows what these weapons and mags will be worth if they get it pushed through and my feelings are you wont be able to purchase one again without class 3 paperwork.

If you are really serious please feel free to email or call or text REDACTED. As info if this listing is still present then the rifle is still available. Only trades that really interest me would be a Benelli Super Vinci or Wilson Combat 1911's."

Those who know YHM (Yankee Hill Machine) and RRA (Rock River Arms) know this is not just another AR that has been thrown together and it has some extras. Details on the upper are as follows:

The Diamond forearm bridges the gap between the upper receiver and hand guard and is marked for position on all 4 sides. YHM's diamond pattern in the hand guard reduces weight and blends perfectly with the diamond fluted barrels.

Features Include:
* Forged 7075-T6 Aluminum YHM Flat Top Upper Receiver
* ""T"" Marked Upper Receiver
* Forward Assist
* 16"" 4140 Steel Barrel, Heat Treated to RC 25-32
* Chambered in 5.56 N.A.T.O., Chrome-Lined with either a 1:9"" or 1:7"" Twist
* YHM Diamond Fluting Improves Rigidity and Aids in Barrel Cooling
* YHM Phantom 5C2 Flash Hider / Compensator (YHM-28-5C2)
* YHM Specter Length Diamond Handguard (YHM-9637-DX)
* YHM Forearm Endcap (YHM-9484-A)
* YHM Low Profile Gas Block (YHM-9384)
* YHM Forearm Mounted Flip Front Sight (YHM-9627)
* YHM Flip Rear Sight (YHM-9680)

This AR also comes with the collapsible Vltor EMOD (Enhanced Modstock) this stock is not just your plain jane collapsible stock! The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks. The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts.

This AR also has the Magpul Rifle Grip as well as the Magpul Vertical Grip in tan. This weapon will come with a 30rd steel mag as I am keeping all of my 30rd Pmags.

I will take $1850 OBO for the AR. My local shop has AR's listed right now much higher than that and lots of them are of lesser quality. Figured I would try to sell it on my own first so number one I dont have to pay them a consignment fee and number 2 someone has the option of purchasing one without paperwork. I also do not mind working through an FFL if that makes you more comfortable. However I will require a valid id or drivers license regardless. At the gun show over the weekend and they were selling AR's for much more than $2500 and Pmags were going for $100 each. I am taking a gamble on selling this one because if this ban does go through and if anyone remembers the Clinton ban knows what these weapons and mags will be worth if they get it pushed through and my feelings are you wont be able to purchase one again without class 3 paperwork.

If you are really serious please feel free to email or call or text REDACTED. As info if this listing is still present then the rifle is still available. Only trades that really interest me would be a Benelli Super Vinci or Wilson Combat 1911's."

Only 100 of these sets were made. The Midway Foundation commisioned Winchester to make these rifle sets. The pictures do not do these rifles justice. They are stunning.

Rifle #1 is the Varmint Rifle chambered in the blistering 22-250. Rifle #2 is the Deer/Antelope Rifle chambered in the flat shooting 270 Win. Rifle #3 is the Elk/Moose chambered in the potent 300 Win Mag. Rifle #4 is the Dangerous Game Rifle and is chambered in 375 H&H Mag. All of the classic Model 70 Super Grade features are present – the fancy grade checkered walnut stock with shadowline cheeckpiece and ebony fore-end tip, the engraved crossbolt head and the traditional Super Grade pistol grip cap. Each of these beautiful rifles is built with the Pre-’64 style action that offers a forged steel receiver, massive external claw extractor, controlled round feeding and reliable blade ejection. 

Not only did Winchester only make 100 of these 4 rifle sets but...they do not make a Model 70 SuperGrade in 22-250 or 375 H&H Mag. This adds to the value and uniqueness of this set. These rifles are NIB...never been fired. In 2012 one of these sets auctioned for $16,000.00 up in Wyoming in a Wild Sheep Foundation Auction. See link...

Those who know YHM (Yankee Hill Machine) and RRA (Rock River Arms) know this is not just another AR that has been thrown together and it has some extras. Details on the upper are as follows:

The Diamond forearm bridges the gap between the upper receiver and hand guard and is marked for position on all 4 sides. YHM's diamond pattern in the hand guard reduces weight and blends perfectly with the diamond fluted barrels.

Features Include:
* Forged 7075-T6 Aluminum YHM Flat Top Upper Receiver
* ""T"" Marked Upper Receiver
* Forward Assist
* 16"" 4140 Steel Barrel, Heat Treated to RC 25-32
* Chambered in 5.56 N.A.T.O., Chrome-Lined with either a 1:9"" or 1:7"" Twist
* YHM Diamond Fluting Improves Rigidity and Aids in Barrel Cooling
* YHM Phantom 5C2 Flash Hider / Compensator (YHM-28-5C2)
* YHM Specter Length Diamond Handguard (YHM-9637-DX)
* YHM Forearm Endcap (YHM-9484-A)
* YHM Low Profile Gas Block (YHM-9384)
* YHM Forearm Mounted Flip Front Sight (YHM-9627)
* YHM Flip Rear Sight (YHM-9680)

This AR also comes with the collapsible Vltor EMOD (Enhanced Modstock) this stock is not just your plain jane collapsible stock! The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks. The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts.

This AR also has the Magpul Rifle Grip as well as the Magpul Vertical Grip in tan. This weapon will come with a 30rd steel mag as I am keeping all of my 30rd Pmags.

I will take $1850 OBO for the AR. My local shop has AR's listed right now much higher than that and lots of them are of lesser quality. Figured I would try to sell it on my own first so number one I dont have to pay them a consignment fee and number 2 someone has the option of purchasing one without paperwork. I also do not mind working through an FFL if that makes you more comfortable. However I will require a valid id or drivers license regardless. At the gun show over the weekend and they were selling AR's for much more than $2500 and Pmags were going for $100 each. I am taking a gamble on selling this one because if this ban does go through and if anyone remembers the Clinton ban knows what these weapons and mags will be worth if they get it pushed through and my feelings are you wont be able to purchase one again without class 3 paperwork.

If you are really serious please feel free to email or call or text 870-577-4472. As info if this listing is still present then the rifle is still available. Only trades that really interest me would be a Benelli Super Vinci or Wilson Combat 1911's."

Large manufacturers get tax payer money and sales are heavily regulated by government....nothing free market about that.
The price increases in firemarms we are seeing now have nothing to do with a free market. They are the direct result of government/political intervention in the market.
Sure, you can ask what you want for your guns...but there is nothing ""free market"" about the situation.

Free Market:
1. Business governed by the laws of supply and demand, not restrained by government interference, regulation or subsidy.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.
