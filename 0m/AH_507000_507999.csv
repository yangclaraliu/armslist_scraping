The revolver is in excellent condition. It has a few scratches but much better than expected, considering this is a 35-40 year old revolver.  This very collectable and sought after pistol has a Double Action/Single Action trigger that is super clean and crisp. The Single action on this gun is unbelievable! S&W is known for the amazing triggers on their revolvers. This model 66 NO DASH is easily identifyable due to its pinned barrel and Recessed Cylinder, which from my understanding was only manufactured that way during the first run of these pistols in the early 70's....making the revolver extremely collectable. The revolver is wearing very comfortable after market pachmayr rubber grip. This firearm is a prior
 duty pistol and is engraved as such on the inside of the frame.  I am in no
rush to let this firearm go and may very well just keep it if I don't receive a 
viable offer. As of now, I am asking $650...although I will consider trading for cash plus firearm...or just a firearm, if worth the trade.

PS- It has a red notch on stainless steel front sight which I've been told is factory original, meaning at some point S&W modified the front sight from its original all stainless steel sight, which in my opinion makes for a much better sight picture.....although once again, the authenticity of the revolver is easily identified by the Pinned Barrel and Recessed Cylinder."

Range thoughts: 

Firearm is crisp and tight. Recoil is ""fast"" for a .45 a little snappy but the weight of the gun eats up recoil vs. other .45s I shot that day. (Much better than a Glock 37 I range tested in .45GAP)

Follow up shots where amazingly fast, trigger reset clean with an audible click. Outshot my Sig 220 which has been top dog of my personal .45 collection.

The gun does have an aggressive feel. It's comfortable, and grips well, point of aim and impact great. Very accurate groups, fast follow up shots. Need to control the gun like a man. It is a .45ACP. Badass.


Available for FTF in Longview/Tyler area. Otherwise I will ship nationwide for $20.00 to your FFL!

This gun gets excellent reviews based on its accuracy and reliability.  It's a mean and intimidating looking firearm with a long barrel and good weight, so with the compensator, you will experience very little recoil.  This gun also comes with 3 - 10 round magazines.  I got it from the original owner, and he didn't put too many down the pipe, so it's in  excellent condition.  Another cool thing about these is that you can change out the barrel, slide, and magazine to turn the gun into a 9mm, 40 cal., or 10mm, because they all use the same frame!

This is based on the CZ, and is similar to a 1911, only it doesn't have a de-cocker.  You can go half or full cocked with the thumb safety on, and of course this goes double or single action.  

These are $400 new, plus the accessories brought this to around $500, so I believe the price is fair considering the condition.  I am ONLY selling this because I really want a Glock 20c 10mm, and a Glock 19.

We have 3 Dueling Tree models. Our Pistol Dueling Tree has a mild steel frame and 3/8"" thick AR500 target plates. Our Tactical Rifle Dueling Tree has the same 3/8"" thick AR500 target plates, but the front of the frame is made using 3/8"" thick AR500 plate rather than mild steel. Our Large Caliber Rifle Dueling Tree features the 3/8"" AR500 frame-front, but gets upgraded to 1/2"" thick AR500 target plates.

We have upgraded our Rifle Dueling Tree frames. The AR500 plates that make the front of the frame are now overlapped on the front and welded only on the back. We no longer have the weld up the front of the frame, as seen in these photos. We will put new photos up soon.

>Large Caliber Rifle Dueling Tree - $725.00 

Our Tactical Rifle Dueling Tree is great for pistols, .223/5.56 ARs and 7.62x39 AKs. Our Large Caliber Rifle Dueling Tree is great for .223/5.56 ARs and 7.62x39 AKs, as well as larger rifle rounds such as 30-06 and 300 win mag from 150+ yards depending caliber.

Our AR500 steel is certified for ballistic-resistance. THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR ALL AR500. Every batch of AR500 plate we buy is tested, and we reject the material that does not measure-up.

I am just looking to see what is out there to trade for, I am not desperate.

For the right trade I will add more accessories-a see through mount type scope, a tactical type sling, magazines and if all that doesn't even up the trade I will add some cash.

This Bushmaster has a lightweight barrel and is quite nice to carry. The barrel is about 11.5"" with about a 4.5"" compensator(compensator is permanently attached), it also has a Hogue grip. It does have scratches and some wear. I think the muzzle brake works well to reduce recoil for such a lightweight rifle. 

It has front and rear Tritium sights (sometimes called night sights, actually called low light sights). 

I heard that Bushmaster has increased their prices. 

What Am I looking for? PSL, M14, or longer range ar15 with 20+ inch barrel.



DISCLAIMER- in the long length of time I have been on this site, many mall ninjas and internet commandos like to comment that my weapons are worth less than my price (many times I hear this right before I sell which always gives me a chuckle). If you are one of these 'experts', I have only one challenge to make- I can listen to anyone who can ARTICULATE with proof- However actual articulation with fact rarely if ever happens from these quasi 'experts'. If you think my weapon is overpriced copy and paste a link to this same model of weapon with a cheaper price. If you cannot articulate what you say, you are wasting my time, go back to the minions of inarticulate ""change, change, change"", ""yes we can"" crowd.

The gun was purchased in March of this year and was manufactured in late 2011.  It has 1200 rounds down the pipe which is basically just past the recommended 1000 round break in period that Les recommended himself on the phone (yes, he comes to the phone when you call customer support with any question they can't answser themselves!).   These are the tightest fit guns you will find out of the box with the break in period merely serving to perfect the fit between the slide and frame.  This gun is extremely accurate and very well made with a 3"" inch group guarantee at 50 yards.  Check out their website for full gun specs.  Retail is over $1900.  Blueing is 98% with only a slight mark on the bottom right side of the slide close to the frame as a result of my shooting rest I use at the range, as well as a couple of brass marks on the ejection port.  This has strictly been a range gun and has never been carried.  Interested in selling outright or partial trade for Dan Wesson V-Bob, CCO, ECO or Guardian.  Email with questions or call REDACTED.  God bless!"

SA/DA much like a revolver. Has a safety as well, I keep it in my small gun safe on my bed stand with a round in the chamber and safety off so it’s pretty much like a revolver except after the first DA shot, it becomes SA and semi-auto until the last 7 rounds are spent. I could also just pull the hammer back and fire all 8 rounds in SA. Of course, you could also rack the slide extremely easy and have 8 SA shots. This gun is particularly nice for ladies as the slide is very easy to rack. Has a nice trigger reset for very fast follow up shots. Includes 3 mags (expensive) and they hold 8 rounds each. I also have a laser that’s built specifically for the gun. Other than that, I have a Pachymer grip on it which is really nice as well. Great little gun especially for carry, just trying to raise some money as we need it for bills. I paid over $425.00 for the gun with the laser. It has around 500 rounds fired. It is very easy with ammo. I haven’t found a brand it doesn’t like. I have been using Armscor with very good results. For $565, I will include 350 FMJ rounds, about 20 rounds of JHPs plus a partial box of Hornady Zombie Max rounds which are the same as the Hornady Critical Defense rounds except with an zombie green polymer tip instead of orange (about $240.00 worth of ammo total). The Zombie Max are very serious home/self-defense rounds. I will also include a few Magsafe .380 rounds which are also very powerful home/self-defense rounds. I take very good care of my guns. I clean them EVERY time I go to the range no matter how many rounds fired. You'll find the barrel of this gun to be mirror clean and the rest of the gun is also very clean. There are some minor surface scratches on the slide but they are not deep. Just light scratches on the finish. The gun is is great shape all the way around. Price is firm considering the ammo and extra mags.

I was told it was an Israeli survival rifle for pilots when I bought it 10+ years ago... I recently was going to buy more accessories for it and found out it is rare...  I am not really into collector value, I am into common and practical... I am definetely not desperate, and I am happy to keep it in the hard case in my trunk if no collectors want to trade.

If you are unfamiliar- There is an Armalite AR7 that happens to be listed in springfield right now- there is lots of info about the rifle in his ad.
He has his listed for $600- his is in nicer condition but only comes with one 7 rd mag- 
I googled an Armalite ar7 that sold at auction on gunauction's website in 2010 with a 7 rd mag and nicer sling for $566 -

 Mine is not as nice of condition- but I think mine is a way better package- I have three- 20 round magazines for mine- the one that sold in 2010 only had one 7 round mag. Check out the price of 20 rd mags... I think you will be satisfied this is a better package. 

Also- I am a fan of spare parts- so I have a couple extra SETS (2 sets of 2= 4 total springs) of action springs for the AR-7

I am looking to trade for a common ruger 10-22 + cash or .22 GSG or Chiappa pistol +cash...  

I know that the Henry AR7 rifles are much less expensive, please don't be the genius who wants to tell me about that...If the right collector does not come along I am very happy to keep it:)


DISCLAIMER- in the long length of time I have been on this site, many mall ninjas and internet commandos like to comment that my weapons are worth less than my price (many times I hear this right before I sell which always gives me a chuckle). If you are one of these 'experts', I have only one challenge to make- I can listen to anyone who can ARTICULATE with proof- However actual articulation with fact rarely if ever happens from these quasi 'experts'. If you think my weapon is overpriced copy and paste a link to this same model of weapon with a cheaper price. If you cannot articulate what you say, you are wasting my time, go back to the minions of inarticulate ""change, change, change"", ""yes we can"" crowd.

A link below with more pictures. Email me your number if you would like to talk. I am on Mountain Time so let me know your state so I am not calling too late. Hello and thanks for looking. I am selling a MetroArms American Classic II chambered in a .45 ACP. I am the rightful owner of the gun. I purchased it last month from a friend. Upon purchasing it I was told that the gun uses only certain types of ammo due to it sticking between the feed rail and barrel, with the .45 ammo I have, I have a hard time getting it chambered. If you can fix it, you can have a great gun at a great price, plus you get all the extras listed below. I am the second owner as the guy I purchased it from has owned it since new. What you see is what you get. I am not a gunsmith and I purchased another gun in it's place. It comes with 1 extra barrel; the original and another. I do not know the make of the extra barrel. It also comes with 2 clips which 1 is a 8 round clip and the other is a 7 along with a right handed holster made by blackhawk and made in the USA size 3 that fits the gun well and holds a clip. The grips are rubber and made by Hogue and are in nice shape. The gun looks nice. It does show a little wear. It has a small scratch about 1/4 inch long on the right hand side next to the hammer on the slide. Forgive me if I don't know the proper terms, but it has an exteded thumb release put on. It also has a suppressor on the spring to help with recoil and the trigger has what I was told a 3.5lb pull as the guy I bought it from has problems with hand strength due to arm surgeries. Look at all the pictures I have provide. I do show 1 picture in my set of what the ammo does when it's stuck. If you have any dought or questions, please email me first. I can ship this in state for $20.00 or just pick it up. I accept money order or check or if you want to do paypal as long as they know it's not a gun, 3% will be added as they charge me. I will ship immediatly if I get a money order or if you pay by check, the check must clear before shipping. Email me if you would like to talk about the gun via phone. Just put your phone # in the email. Thank you for looking. Link to more photos, you must copy and paste this in your address bar.

Ponsness/Warren reloaders use a full-length resizing die for the shells. The shell is held inside the die during the entire loading process, which produces a finished shell that is perfectly sized for cycling through any type of shotgun. The finished shells are superior to those produced by MEC reloaders. Fast, solid, durable.
