.223/5.56

This rifle includes:
- one 5 round detachable box magazine
- a lock-tightned winchester bipod
- a 4-16 power center point scope with an illuminating red/green mil-dot reticle(six dots) 1/4 MOA adjustments with locking and resetable turrets.
- combfortable padded sling, 
- standard 6 pound hunting trigger
- safety switch
- generous padded butt plate
- two 5.56 snap caps ( training rounds )
The scope has been leveled to the rifles action to maximize it's potential for accuracy. This rifle would make a great first gun or a good gun to teach the fundamentals of marksmenship to someone. I have used this rifle to eliminate over 250 varmints from my property and so the rifle does have some scratches on the stock and minor wear on the barrel. However it's nothing that a can of camo won't fix, afterall it's a $250.00 gun why would you worry about finish when you paid almost nothing for it? The rifle is cleaned, lenses wiped, and action greased. The rifle seems to like russian ammo and hornady ammo. It shoots great with nice tight groups.

Papers for the scope are included
Bill of sales also included

Would be willing to trade for a rifle of about the same value.

I also have a stainless Lone Wolf barrel in 9MM for it. I am asking $450 for the Glock, $80 for just the barrel and I'll throw in an imported 30round 9mm magazine for free. $500 for the package deal. Everything is in great shape. I keep it clean and carry it only occasionally. The 9MM barrel/mag make plinking cheap and have no feed or jamming issues with decent quality ammo.
Gun was made in 2008, LPLXXX serial number. I bought it used last year, it was practically new then. I've shot about 500 rounds through it. One picture shows the only worn spot on the gun, the bbl. The Tenifer finish on the slide is perfect.

This gun is in by no means perfect condition. It has scratches and dings and the bluing is faded. it does have a 3 inch chamber, fixed modified chock and 5 shell total capacity. It functions, no jams, kills pop cans and clay pigeons and throws a slug fairly straight. 

This is the kind of gun you carry through the brush and don't care if it gets scratched or give to a kid to hunt with as a starter gun. There is recoil but its not a mule kicker. L.O.P. is about 14 inches

37MM Launcher, with a full stock system, as well as flip up sites. This is one bad ass little launcher, that does not require any special license to own. 

This package includes the following:

- 1x rail mountable 12inch 37mm launcher. Yes, this can can mount on your AR
- 1x 37mm 12 inch rail stock system. It makes this a standalone system
- 5x 3.5 inch aluminum hulls, for reloading your own rounds (uses shotgun #209 primer)
- 5x mini-MOAB projectile, unfused (1x head, 1x bottom, and 1x fin)
- 5x mini-MOAB projectile, fused  (1x head, 1x bottom, and 1x fin)
- Reloading instructions
- ONE SUPER BADASS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT

Parts are CAD designed and CNC machined from solid billet material rather than the typical stamped and welded construction of other launchers. The 6061 T-6 aircraft grade aluminum components are anodized in a non-glare matte black finishing for maximum durability and ease of maintenance. 

Additional components are built from 1018 cold rolled steel and plated with a mil-spec black oxide finish. The proprietary STZ push button cylindrical breech lock design is 3 times stronger than existing lever lock systems. The Havoc is designed to mount on any mil spec rail system. Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the handguard and tightening two set screws which are included.

This is one of those things that makes gun lovers get a little wet. Its a non-restricted item, marked for use with gas, pepper, and smoke rounds. Any other round would require you to declare this a destructive device with the ATF, and get a stamp for it.

No powder or primers are included. This is just the parts and pieces.

This was a project I put together, then put down. I really love it, but I just don't have the time to put into this anymore. Save yourself a grip of time and research with this really beautiful set.

Open to trades, partial trades, but cash is preferred. Or best offer.

NOTE: No powder or primers are included. This is just the parts and pieces.

If you want to have this turned into a registered destructive device, you must first get a serial number engraved onto it, then apply with the ATF. 

These are all brand new parts and pieces, never used.

Please include a callback number in your email."

Need a complete rifle set up? Take a look at this... don't have to shop around, I've got a lot of kit right here.

Just moved back into Colorado, needing to part with my hardly used rifle for the cash. Comes with lots of extras and I'll try to list them all. All original stock DPMS components come with it, like furniture and standard stuff in the original DPMS case and original 2x 30rd black finish mags.

PCAR15 - A2 - 11 inch barrel with a 5.5 inch permanent fixed flash hider.
Magpul items - OD CTR stock, OD Handguards, OD gloved Triggerguard, OD Vertical Grip, Black MOE+ pistol Grip, Black Polymer Rail, Black MSG2 Single Point sling, Black ASAP Ambi sling point, 11x Black 30rd PMAGS (one with ranger plate, most have dust cover.)

Also I will consider adding the pictured Voodoo Tactical AR15 MOLLE pouches. A double pouch and a single pouch, both in OD Green.

Reach me through the Armslist messaging if interested or have any questions. Might not be able for a few days to meet up for the sale, my car is snowed in still and I'm sore from moving and shoveling so I'm taking it easy for a few. I'll try to respond to all emails or offers promptly. I'm not seeking a trade necessarily, but I'm not beyond a small trade of something plus cash. I am in search for a 18 inch Rem 870 barrel, simple Mossberg 500 (any size, I've got furniture to through on it) or a Makarov (Russian, Bulgarian, East German), Beretta 92FS or Glock 19. Suggest something, it couldn't hurt."

This gun altogether does not look bad at all and the bore is very good and it shoots very straight. The price is $ 150"

I believe they are 126mm, but they measure 123mm. These magazines are being sold as is. They include the base pads (2 standard and 2 IPSC), and new springs. These DO NOT come with followers.  Please note that these magazines are welded and have cuts in the magazines that limit their capacity. They can not be converted to hold more rounds.  I contacted STI and they say that these are the older style and most likely will run just fine without spacers.  You would need to determine if that is true.

These mags are perfect for an IDPA shooter. I attend most USPSA matches in Wisconsin, and obviously do not live far from Ripon, and can bring it to a match.

Features include: Target bull barrel, recycled 44 DOU Nazi marked receiver, Swedish aperture/diopter match sights, custom bolt handle, floated and bedded solid walnut target stock.

Not sure of the manufacture date on this thing, but it's near pristine with very few rounds through it. The weight is incredibly nice just like it should be, it's a great bench rifle for 500-600 yards out.

I'm selling it because I no longer need it and can use the money for something else. It's a very accurate rifle, much more accurate than I am, and with a correct scope it will shoot sub-MOA groups if you're a well enough shot.

Price is $800

Winchester Model 70 / 300 Win. Mag.
This is a Model 70 Grey Shadow manufactured for RMEF as the 2002 RMEF sponsor gun. The gun is push feed. The left side of the barrel is stamped with standard ""Winchester Model 70 300 Win. Mag.” The right side is stamped with ""RMEF 2002"". These guns were never listed in the Winchester catalog that I know of. It could only be obtained at an RMEF banquet. Stock is a light grey composite, with black 'rubber' Winchester recoil pad. Magazine has hinged floor plate, rather than a blind magazine. This gun is no longer manufactured. 

Used but not abused, looks like it’s had a few boxes of shells through it, 26 inch barrel, action and bolt are in great shape. Stock is in very good shape, it does show some use as a hunting gun as it should. Nice set of Redfield rings and bases. Redfield 3x9 five star scope with duplex retical has seen some real hunting use, more than likely on a different rifle, it has some scars/wear but glass is in great shape. I tested the scope on a 7mm-08 a few weeks ago and it held under an inch at 100yd.

Its a non-matching Norinco SKS built on a good receiver with a screwed in barrel(Considered more accurate than the later pinned barrel models.)

Has all the issue goodies other than the wood stock and the cleaning rod, the wood stock wasnt that great of condition and has walked off. Black ATI folding stock that I worked most of the wobble out. Two 20 round detatchable mags from Tapco that have been fitted to it but will still function on other SKS models, one is a little finicky on occasion, 12 Yugoslavian stripper clips also included. Also included is a NC star tri-rail receiver cover as well as the original, please tell me if you want the tri-rail as I'll have to find it.

Condition: 

Very good, other than a few shiny spots on the hammer and rails, the only other spot that shows that its even been shot is the head of the piston is a little sooty, Ive tried to get it off but not gone nuts on it and a good deal of it came off. Chrome in bore is superb still, Ive only put right around 100 rounds through it since I purchased it new, just enough to soak out some of the cosmoline from the bad spots. Ive been pretty good about cleaning it from tip to tail even after putting a round through it so its in very good shape. The only funky thing with it is that the pin that holds the safety spring down seems to be a chunk of allen key? It doesnt affect the feel of the rifle, I only discovered it when I took it down to clean out the grit and grease from the FCG. Very nice trigger for an SKS, pretty clean and crisp with a short travel once the dead travel is taken up, also quite light.
