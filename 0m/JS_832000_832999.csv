I'm selling my FN five seven. It comes with the FN hard box, three 20round mags and 300rounds of ammo. I purchased the gun about six months ago and took it out once. I fired one box of 50rounds through it. It fires like a dream and us by far my favorite gun. But I'm cursed with this constant desire to have something new and I've now got my eye on an AR10 with the impending gun ban. This is literally the perfect firearm. Ignore the ignorant claims of it being less lethal. The secret service uses these for their controllability and natural armor piercing capabilities. If you want to know how it shoots, I'll pass on the way it was described to me before I found out myself. ""It kicks like a .22 with the loud fiery discharge of a rocket launcher.""

Right now, they are selling for $2500 for the black model and $3000 for the dark earth with a threaded barrel. (Prices based on Delray Shooting Center)

I'm asking $2500 for mine. Which will include the box, mags, ammo, and a handshake. 

As I stated before it has been fired exactly 50 times. The first time shooting in six months, first gun of the day and very first round put through the gun went clean through the ""0"" of the 10 in the middle of the target. If you aren't thoroughly impressed, I'll buy the damn thing back! 

*IMPORTANT*- The ONLY trades I'm interested in are as follows. An AR10, HK USP +Cash, Tactical Shotgun +Cash, Remington 700 VTR or LEM +Cash. It is first come first serve and cash is KING! I do accept credit or debit card (via my business), PayPal or of course US currency. I will NOT ship and the buyer must have a FL ID and preferably a FL CCP. 

Call or Text if you're interested and serious. REDACTED
btw, if you have a trade other than what I listed that you think will impress me, feel free to give it a shot. But please don't waste our time."

The gun was originally the standard bluing from the factory.  
1.  I had the entire gun blasted with Aluminum Oxide to give the slide and frame a very light texture and to remove any scratches or wear.  

2.  From there we treated all parts with Micro-Crystalline Zinc Phosphate and then had it professionally coated in Cerakote H.  The target range for Cerakote is between .5-1 mils and our average was .78 mils all over.  

3.  Finally we replaced the grips panels with milled/anodized dragon scale aluminum panels.

Micro-Crystalline Zinc Phosphate and Cerakote is the new Military Spec Coating proceedure and there are only a handful of places in the US that do both.

This pistol is absolutely beautiful.  the trigger pull is somewhere around 4 pounds and is very smooth.

Featuring a completely adjustable rear sight, the finish is mat blue with polished sides of the slide. The Chiappa Model 911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun."

As stated in the title, this is a converted Saiga in 7.62x39. A solid Russian gun that works, not some cheap clone with canted sights. It comes with everything in the pictures; sling, 4 factory magazines, factory cleaning kit, manual and box. The rifle DOES have a bullet guide for use with normal AK magazines. There is some paint missing on the trigger guard, as seen in the pictures on the right side. I would prefer a face-to-face sale so there is no shipping/paperwork hassle, but I will ship. Looking for cash but I will consider trades as well. The pistol grip will be swapped for the one in this picture:

What CT compliant means is no bayo lug and no flashhider.  Compensators and muzzelbreaks are okay as long as they are non removable.

The stag is what I really want but am open to all offers.  If you've got an upper you want to sell send me an email with pics.  Willing to pay a price respective of the current shortage but not insane.

I'm in the military and know how to keep the weapon clean and do so with this rifle. It also comes with a hard case and several magazines.

Slight wear behind the ejection port from shells will show less than 500 rounds have been fired. No other wear or damage on the weapon. Iron sights have been very accurate for me. This model has no windage knob but I have hit a softball size target at 200 yards consecutively with these sights before.

Red Dot sight aperature included as wel, which is ow end but useful for close and mid-range shooting.

Also included with kit is the receiver flat with rails and rivets. Basically everything you need to put this gun together. This particular kit is rare in the fact that it has the original chrome-lined 12.6"" barrel with muzzle brake unique to the AMD-65. Also, the barrel is already pressed into the trunnion so you wont need to worry about head-spacing. They stopped selling these kits some years back. Parts kits now (if you can even find them) either do not include the barrel or come with an unfinished sub-par quality US barrel. All the metal is black painted and the kit as a whole appears to have been made from an un-issued firearm(obviously I cannot confirm this, just using my judgment). Also included is a TAPCO G2 Double Hook Trigger Group. Great kit, and borderline impossible to find. I Don't need to sell this, more open to trades of unique or obscure firearms, particularly military.

I may have something to trade, but am really interested in an honest, face-to-face, cash deal. 

Yes, *I do understand that things are crazy right now,* and there are folks out there trying to sell used guns for way more than they are actually worth. I don't care what some book says they are worth, or what some idiot listed theirs for at Gunbroker.com trying to make some obscene profit... Price Gouging is price gouging.

I am not in a rush, and I actually can pass a background check (the current delays are annoying, but they are getting shorter too)...

I am simply not going to pay more for a used gun than I can still buy exactly the same model (or a more valuable one) new.

But I can and will pay CASH, IMMEDIATELY, for a fair offer.

~~~These are not really rare, they are NOT assault rifles, and they are not really in short supply. Go to a Tanner show, or a Sporting Goods store there are still some out there~~~

I also realize that there is a ton of aftermarket ""stuff"" available for these... If you spent hundreds of dollars on yours, cool... that was your choice, not mine... I may be interested in the right accessories, but I can figure out what a cheap red dot, or an aftermarket stock is worth too...

In case you haven't figured it out by now, this is not my first rodeo, so please, let's not waste each other's time. 

I know there are a whole lot of flakes out there right now. 

I am not one of them.

If you buy both the magazines and the Lower Receiver, I will sell you the entire package for $700 (1 lower receiver, 10 magazines)

Unfortunately, everything in this package will probably be illegal in NY next week. Buy it now and get grandfathered in. You'll be handing these down to your children some day. 

I prefer face to face, but I will ship to an FFL if appropriate documentation is sent. You pay shipping. We will complete a bill of sale, and I'll need to see your driver's license to confirm you are who you say you are. 

I am open to trades for complete upper receivers in unfired condition plus cash. Preferably NYS compliant."

The original assault rifle! I have for sale a well loved M1 Carbine. I have done all the research on it so never worry! It is a typical mix and match from the Korean war, though the receiver most likely saw service in Europe during world war 2. The receiver is an underwood receiver from late 1944, Inland low wood stock from Inland (hard to age) came from South Haven MI, has visible cartouche and OI marking. Magazine and ejector button are consistent with late WW2 service as well. This carbine has a wonderful Blue Sky barrel, verifiable to not not have stamp damage. Late WW2 band, and late WW2 shell deflector. No loss of parkerizing, no rust (though I have not verified under the barrel and action however. Good coloring and just an overall nice little rifle.
What else can I say? Straight shooter, I even sighted it in with some vintage ammo just before deer season and is still within milspec at 100 yards. I mean at only 35 1/2 inches, this is the perfect hallway gun.

What do I want to do with this rifle? I would like to sell it of course, cash is King and I don't typically hold rifles on promises of payment.

However I am very interested in trading for a few things: M1 Garands (remember though that they still have these at CMP in Ohio for 525 so must be about same value as I am asking) .308 Garand would be amazing as I would like to start mechanical sight competitions! I am also looking for a good semi auto pistol, prefer 9mm, let me know what you got. No Smith and Wessons or glocks, I like sigs, Springfield XDs, Berettas, and the new walther if you got it. Bonus: I have been looking for a Browning Hi Power for a long time, I would add cash for one of these.
But don't let my list discourage you, send me an email and make me an offer!

Bonus, Bonus. Have you seen .30 cal ammo for sale? Me neither, you can't hardly get in anywhere. But I have just over 200 rounds that I can put with this rifle to make a deal. In this market that is over 100 bucks worth of ammo. In fact for you collectors, 200 of the rounds are still in original issue strippers, inside military boxes and Viet Nam era OD green pouch belt (pictured).

I have a valid WI CW permit, no felons, must be WI resident, prefer bill of sale but am flexible."
