This is the hard to find 2"" version of the classic S&W Model 64.  It is a mid-size matte stainless six shot revolver with fixed sights.  It is in excellent condition.  This was an LE trade from the California Department of Corrections and is professionally stamped with a CDC serial number on the left side of the frame (doesn't show in pics due to glare).  It appears to have been shot very little and well maintained.  It has the typical tight lockup and smooth action of a S&W K-frame.  This will make a nice addition to any S&W collection and will make a perfect home defense or concealed carry weapon with its compact size and dependability of a revolver.  Will shoot 38 special or 38+P and is very accurate for a snubby.  Comes with a brand new set of Pachmayr Compac Pro grips with exposed backstrap.  Sorry, no box or papers.

these rifles were manufactured with fn herstal barrels . they are sometimes called sneaks because they were made after the war with russia against the treaty the two countries agreed to.
 they are beautiful and highly accurate rifles. the finnish military did not let these leave the arsenal unless the were less than 1.3 moa.
 they were to be issued to officers for national match shooting.
this one is a non issued rifle making it even more rare.

It comes with 2 magazines, the grips pictured and a cheap set of black plastic thumbrest grips with no texture.  It also includes a great leather single clip IWB holster with about a 20 degree cant.  I ordered a surplus holster for it about a month ago and it should be here within a week (it came straight from Bulgaria).  Lastly, I have 17 rounds (2 mags and one in the chamber's worth) of 9x18 JHP defensive ammo (Hornady, I believe).

This was manufactured by Filli Pietta and imported by Bingham Firearms. 

It shoots .22 LR and is designated the PPS/50.  

The weapon comes with an original 50-round drum (drum alone goes for big money on auction sites).  I recommend the buyer purchase an after-market drum (these are still readily available) and store the original drum.  

This rifle was purchased from the Gun Library within the Owatonna Cabella's. 

After the last time I brought it to the range I had it professionally cleaned at Gander Mountain and then I put it into storage.  This a clean weapon with no rust or pitting.  One of the images may look like there is some discoloration - that doesn't exist on the rifle so it must be shadows.  

This is a fun rifle to sling lead with, especially in .22 LR which means you don't go broke while having fun.  

More pictures are available if desired.  Feel free to email with any questions."

This shotgun has been fired only twice, once from each barrel. This is one of the first market testing EAA imports that were a bit rare and hard to track down because they were 20ga. and had the fixed chokes instead of the screw chokes, and also extremely tough beach wood stocks instead of the later walnut or soft birch. Also the fancy engraving and a bit more attention to fit/finish from the factory than the mass production imports that followed, and far cleaner than the new USSG imports. The professional improvements are as follows, triggerguard refinished/polished @ reblued, muzzle refaced flush- polished & reblued, and the stocks stripped/fitted and refinished with hand rubbed oil finish. Basically the shotgun is in new condition and better than it rolled out of the factory. The original manual is included but the box was destroyed in storage, so no box.

From my research this was likely imported during a ban on the bayonet so it was removed for that purpose.

I have 80 rounds of ammo a waterproof ""gun boat"" soft case, and a remington trigger lock on it, plus a manual for servicing(that was given to me, it's not original but relevant to this model)

I'm not 100% I got the year right, I researched it when my sister gave it to me and it was a while ago, but I believe it was or was around 1965 that this one was manufactured.

This is a carbine and has a short barrel, I've read that these make good hunting rifles and have great range.

This rifle was a special order model from the Custom Shop in 1969. This is a very rare rifle. You can be sure your friend will never show up to the hunt with one of these, and given the quality and collectability of this firearm, they wont show up with a rifle nearly as nice as your's. The stock has rosewood on the grip and end caps. The bolt is jeweled. It has a 26"" Bull barrel. The action is one of the smothest actions I have ever felt and the trigger breaks like glass at about 2lbs. The barrel is drilled and tapped for safarie sights but the rifle is set up with a variable 2x7 Leupold scope. This rifle is all original, even the buttstock pad. You will not find this rifle in better condition. If you are reading this you allready know how powerfull the .375 H&H Magnum round is. This is the prefered round for African big game hunts. It is a massave, powerfull and flat shooting round. The only reason I am considering letting this go is I am not planning any big game hunts any time soon. I have taken an intrest in long range shooting compitions. I would be open to trades for .338 lapua rifles or other tactical firearms. I will also consider reasonable cash offers. Must have Ohio ID. Email, Call or Text REDACTED. 
Thank you for your interest,

Note- There have been some questions. No, this is not the BDL model. Remington did not offer the big bore calabers from the factory in 1969. They had to be ordered from the custom shop. Note the rosewood and barrel. It is a ""C Grade"" custom, meaning there is no engraving. The custom shop's grading system starts at C, then moves on to D and E. These levels are determined by the ammount of engraving you order. The quality of firearm put out at that time this rifle was made is superior to what you would get today with their current models that cost over to 4k. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Because of this, I am throwing in a full 20rd box of Federal ammo valued at $55. Also do not be shy to make me an offer. I am prepared to negotiate in order to make the price work for both of us. I am a reasonable guy, that want to sell a very nice rifle, so no reasonable offer will be turned away."

Original grips come with as well as two mags. 2. A Taurus pt809. Very good shooting pistol. I will provide and shoot at least 50 rounds a piece to show and prove reliability of each then allow you to do the same. I really want a sig. Preferably a 226. Must be nice though considering I'm trading about a grand in firearms for it. I'm a member to a nice range we can shoot at. Also I'm very picky when it comes to care on my weapons so they will be very very clean and smooth. The 809 has wear on it. Just cosmetics. I can count on one hand the number of malfunctions I've had with both and I've been shooting steel. My number is REDACTED. Will send pics. Remember, must be very nice."

These stands are dummy proof and contain no parts to loose. They are as simple as hammering into the ground and dropping your 1""x2"" furring strips into. (furring strips are not included) then you simply staple your cardboard or targets directly to the strips. I have used mine many different ways, including putting string between the strips and using binder clips to hang paper plates or suspending exploding targets or plastic bottles. They can also be used for yard sale signs, tomato stakes or anything else you can think of. A bunch of these stands can be stored in a very small space. Keep your target stands in a box with a hammer, and your ready to go to the range at a moments notice. Please e-mail me with any questions and thanks for looking."

Selling to upgrade. A friend is getting rid of an optic I've been wanting for a long time, thats the only reason I'm selling this. There is nothing wrong with this scope and is in great condition.

Took a doe at 600 yards last deer season with the assistance of Bullet Flight on Ipod touch.

Also has ergo pistol grip and ambidextrous mag release all right from the factory. I have added a foregrip with built-in bi-pod and a surefire fury tactical light mounted on the rail. This light is 500 lumen, crazy bright. The tac light and mount was $200 by themselves. according to everything I have heard it is a 4-6 month wait to get this Bad boy if you were to order it new. I payed slightly higher than retail when I found this simply because of supply and demand.

The muzzleloader has exactly 9 rounds through it. It is in excellent condition. I'm just getting out of ML hunting altogether, so I figured I'd sell everything I have off in one package. This would make a great setup for that new hunter that needs everything and wants to save a bundle! Take a look at the reviews for both the gun itself and the scope. The reviews speak higher of them than I ever could. It's important to note that the scope in this package is much better than the bargain optics that come on many of the ""combo deals"" you find at the sporting goods stores. The Leupold see-thru rings allow you to use the Williams fiber optic iron sights for close shots.  

Altogether, I have well over $500 (before any taxes/shipping I paid) in the stuff listed here for sale. I'm asking only $400 - FTF only in the East Memphis area."
