History & Description:
First introduced in 1998, this compact pistol is a “cut-down” variant of the famous Sig Sauer P220 pistol. Intended mostly for the US market, this pistol is suitable for concealed carry and as a police backup weapon and now a collectors firearm as they are becoming hard to find! The P245 has traditional Sig-Sauer reliability. It offers very good recoil control and is manufactured in Germany by the J.P. Sauer & Sohn company, which is a part of the international SIGARMS corporation. The P245 is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses a typical Browning-style cam operated barrel, which locks into the ejection window in the slide. The slide is made from stamped steel and has a separate breechblock held within the slide by the cross-pin. The frame is made from aluminum. The trigger is double action with external hammer and a de-cocking lever on the left side of the frame. There’s no manual safety, but the P245 is provided with a automatic firing pin safety. The compact P245 is the perfect blend of both worlds, slip in the flat magazine and it makes a great single stack concealed carry piece. Put in the extended magazine and it’s comfortable to shoot at the range and is perfect for home defense.

Slide Difference:
The way the slide is made can affect both the overall weight of the pistol and its balance. The P245 has a folded slide, meaning that a flat piece of metal is formed into the slide. The P220 compact has a slide machined out of a solid piece of stainless steel. Folded slides tend to be lighter and possibly better balanced.
The above information was taken from the internet manual and internet resources and is therefore not guaranteed. I assembled this information to the best of my ability.
This P245 chambered in .45 ACP  and includes two 6-round magazines, as well as factory night sights, owners manual and original case from Sig-Sauer. This P245 is in excellent condition with approximately 350 rounds down range. Awesome fire-power!  Bore looks bright and shiny clean!  There are not many of these for sale so collectable value can only increase. 
The only reason I am selling is I have purchased 4 very expensive new firearms in the last 2 months and the wife is ready to divorce me, I must sell some!
Price $550 Firm This is a great price! Check out Gunsamerica.com & Gunbroker.com, there are only 6 of these guns for sale on the internet period with prices ranging from $600 to $795.  I prefer local Face-to-Face transaction but I will ship if you cover all expenses!
Also I do have a 8-round extended mag that is not included, I have only found 1 of these for sale on the internet, Ebay has one $75. So I will include that for an extra $25.

It comes with the original box, case, paperwork, one magazine with 2 baseplates and I will include a box of Hornady 9mm ammo. Also included is a technaclip belt clip as seen in the pictures. The gun has been fired no more than 3 clips worth....roughly 24 rounds. 

As you may or may not know, this gun came with several safety features and I personally have altered the gun to make it a better self defense gun. The magazine disconnect safety has been removed to allow the gun to fire with the magazine out. Also, the loaded chamber indicator has been altered to not rise up when there is a round in the chamber. There is a little viewing port that you can visibly see the gun is loaded. The slide safety is still intact and the gun operates flawlessly.

I will include the magazine disconnect parts as well as the rear frame pin that was replaced when the belt clip was installed

This is a great concealed carry gun and I am only selling it to fund something else. No trades on this one!!!

Factory Specs:
For fast target acquisition and accuracy in dim conditions, there’s nothing like a red dot, and no one makes them like Bushnell.® Our new Zoom Dot™ gives you the ability to tune the size of your aiming point down to one MOA for precision shooting and all the way up to 10 MOA for close quarters. We even make a model that conserves battery power with an auto shutoff based on position of your gun. Fact is, with red dot for every application from plinking to hunting to tactical, Bushnell is the only name you need to know for illuminated 1x sighting solutions."

It's never been opened or used in any way. I got this as a gift but I already have 2 other laser bore sighters. I didn't want to spoil anyone's day by telling them that I already had a few so I kept it and now it's for sale here. The cheapest price I can find online is $46.51 plus shipping and tax from WalMart.com so figure on saving at least $10 or $15 bucks here. This is good for .22 to .50 caliber barrels. 

Save time, money and ammunition with the new and improved LaserLyte Laser Boresight. Incorporating LaserLyte's patented one-piece design and caliber-fitting systems the new Laser Bore Sight is fifty percent smaller than the previous model. This easy-to-use product can get a shooter within three to four inches of the bull's eye at 100 yards in about three shots. Constructed from tough T6 aluminum, the Laser Boresighter comes in a sleek red finish and works great on any weapon with at least three inches of barrel length. The Laser Boresighter makes sight-in sessions a breeze for scopes, lasers or iron sights on any firearm from .22 to .50 caliber with included adapters. For maximum versatility the system also works with new accessories (sold separately), including a shotgun adapter for .50 to .75 caliber and improved scope leveler. The Laser Bore Sight activates with a roll switch and is powered by three ""377"" or equivalent LR626 batteries that provide one and a half hours of continuous use. This unit is also excellent for modern rifles and its modest design works great with most flash suppressors and muzzle breaks."

I'll throw in a free Blackhawk Holster with sale of the pistol. No trades.

S/N 326789, date of manufacture, June 1918. WW1 ended November 1918.
Winchester Model1917 Markings.
On the top of the barrel mouth; U.S. Model of 1917 Winchester, 326789. On the top of the barrel, just behind the front sight; is the Ordinance Bomb, with a “W” and the date of 6-18. This denotes the Mfg. as Winchester and the date it was Mfg. On the Bolt handle bottom [flat] is “W” and “SN” or NS depending how you look at it. On the top of the Bolt handle there is a small “Ordinance Bomb”. On the rear of firing pin assembly {Cap} is a small “W”. When the bolt handle is lifted there is a “W” or “B” stamp where the handle rests in the closed bolt position. The only part which is not Winchester is the Barrel Cap; the letter “R” is stamped, indicating the cap is likely Remington, although some say it denotes Remington as the stock Mfg.
Condition: The butt plate exhibits normal wear, dings from use on parade grounds. The butt plate has the cleaning rod reservoir, with the door. The stock has four professionally repair cartouches, 1.5mm X 1.0mm and 4.0mm X 1.0mm, on the left side, just to the rear of grip. The Bore is bright, no pitting with the bare eye and a bore light. There is a ding, 1/8” long, on the outside of the barrel near the crown. This ding has not damaged the crown, or the bore.
I believe this rifle falls between NRA GRADE.  Excellent and Fine
The following standards were set forth by the NRA for describing the condition of an antique firearm. The NRA officially calls these their ""Condition Standards for Antique Firearms"". This same grading system can be applied to modern firearms as well.
Excellent - all original parts; over 80% original finish; sharp lettering, numerals and design on metal and wood; unmarred wood; fine bore.

Fine - all original parts; 30% to 80% original finish; sharp lettering, numerals and design on metal and wood; minor marks in wood, good bore.

I purchased this Kahr for daily carry on 4-13-2012 from Scott's Ace Hardware in Scottsburg, IN. 
     I am very impressed with the pistol. I tried the Kel-Tec PF9 but was very disappointed with the quality of the gun. The Kel-Tec had a ton of recoil, was very uncomfortable to shoot/hold, and had a piss poor blued finish that would rust in it's daily use. I purchased the Kahr from Jeff at Ace Hardware after he told me he carried that gun and it was made from stainless so it would be much more durable.
     The pistol has had exactly 433 rounds through it since I purchased the pistol brand new. Kahr states that there is a 200 round break in period before the handgun can be reliable --- mine has never had any problems and is very enjoyable to shoot. 
     I also purchased two holsters for the CW9. I have a Desantis Sof-Tuck (right handed) and a Galco Kingtuk (Best holster ever made) model KT218B. I have the original packages for both holsters and all the paperwork that came with them.
     What you get:
- Kahr CW9 in ""like new"" condition
- Extra magazine (Factory made and purchased from MidwayUSA.com) with extension (8 rounds) 
- Desantis Sof-Tuck holster (right handed)
- Original box with all paperwork and original receipt from Scott's Ace Hardware

I purchased this Kahr for daily carry on 4-13-2012 from Scott's Ace Hardware in Scottsburg, IN. 
     I am very impressed with the pistol. I tried the Kel-Tec PF9 but was very disappointed with the quality of the gun. The Kel-Tec had a ton of recoil, was very uncomfortable to shoot/hold, and had a piss poor blued finish that would rust in it's daily use. I purchased the Kahr from Jeff at Ace Hardware after he told me he carried that gun and it was made from stainless so it would be much more durable.
     The pistol has had exactly 433 rounds through it since I purchased the pistol brand new. Kahr states that there is a 200 round break in period before the handgun can be reliable --- mine has never had any problems and is very enjoyable to shoot. 
     I also purchased two holsters for the CW9. I have a Desantis Sof-Tuck (right handed) and a Galco Kingtuk (Best holster ever made) model KT218B. I have the original packages for both holsters and all the paperwork that came with them.
     What you get:
- Kahr CW9 in ""like new"" condition
- Extra magazine (Factory made and purchased from MidwayUSA.com) with extension (8 rounds) 
- Desantis Sof-Tuck holster (right handed)
- Original box with all paperwork and original receipt from Scott's Ace Hardware
- Galco Kingtuk (add extra $30) - I can sell on Ebay if you don't want it!

The pistol is in great condition. If you can't tell, I have been very meticulous with it. I am only selling it to free up some money for college. I am not really interested in trades but you can always ask. I am located in Madison, Indiana and I do not want to drive farther then Columbus, Indiana."

OR, I could say it's a gun to get your James Bond on with (threaded suppressor, laser red dot scope mounted on the rails, and etcetera.).  

I could say all of that (and probably more) and be right on all counts.  But the worst thing I can say about this gun is that selling it is MY LOSS and your gain.  There's a reason that these guns are CONSISTENTLY out of stock online and everywhere else, especially the Hunter models.

Keep in mind that this Ruger MKIII is the HUNTER model, a different beast from the 22/45.  I've had two of the 22/45's before and thought they were great.  The HUNTERS, in my opinion however, are way better.  The Hunters are a SOLID STEEL FRAME gun and you can feel it.  The 22/45's are polymer, and (for me) just don't feel anything close to the Hunter models.  New, the Hunter models start at 480 bucks but more typically cost in the 560 range. That is, if you can find them as they're usually sold out/unavailable.

Luckily for you, however, I have just barely begun to break this gun in.  This one has been my cream-puff and I doubt there's more than just the requisite 1K break-in rounds through it (if that many).  It had some trigger work done right after I bought it and I love the way it fires.

I have everything the gun came with originally.  I paid 580 for this baby at the gun show when I bought it.  The gun in the photos is the actual gun I am selling.  It has adjustable rear sights, fiber optic replacement sights in both red and day-glo green, and the weaver style Ruger scope rails with original screws.  I have the original case, manual, and the two proprietary Ruger keys to lock the handgun when not in use.  Manual included as well.  It's got it all.

Here's your chance... a Ruger MKIII Hunter in stainless... going.... going... 

Wouldn't sell it if I didn't need the cash.  Best .22 pistol I ever owned. 

Call Douglas at REDACTED if interested.  Phone works better for me than emails, but will respond to all.

***********************************************************

A Tradition of Excellence, like No Other. Ruger Mark III Hunter pistols represent the evolution of Ruger .22 LR pistols, continuing the legacy created by the Ruger Standard, Mark I and Mark II pistols and yet incorporating many new engineering refinements. They are simple, rugged, and affordable, making them a great value for any sporting purpose - whether target shooting, plinking or small game hunting.

The Ruger Mark III Hunter includes rigid barrel/receiver connection; automatic bolt-hold-open latch; comfortable, rugged steel grip frame; contoured ejection port; easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears; and rigidly mounted sights for consistent accuracy. Simply stated, Mark III Pistols offer the most versatility and value of any rimfire pistol on the market today.

FEATURES:
- Patented loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded.
- Accurate sighting system features light-gathering HiViz fiber optic front sight (with six interchangeable LitePipes) , precision-adjustable rear sights and drilled and tapped receiver for Weaver-style scope base adapters (included FREE) for easy mounting of optics.
- Smoothly contoured, comfortable grip features natural pointing grip angle with checkered grip panels providing a non-slip hold. The manual safety and magazine release are conveniently located on the left side of the frame.
- Manual safety positively locks the sear when applied. Also features an unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in the “SAFE” position and allows you to safely secure the firearm when not in use.
- Magazine disconnect prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed.
- Internal cylindrical bolt construction: ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving-slide designs.
- Includes two magazines and hard plastic case.

The stamping on the gun has been colorfilled with white nail polish. I think it looks nice but it can easily be removed with non acetone nail polish remover. Also the front sight has been filled with orange, since the original white dot was faded.

I'm asking $425 cash money or trade for something like a Bersa Thunder or cheap Taurus plus cash. And I don't want to drive across the state for this one unless we make a deal for the full amount in cash. 2 forms of ID required. Thanks

I've got a Weatherby mk. V in excellent condition (based on the NRA condition standards), the only flaws are a few little chips on the stock and a tiny fleck of rust near the end of the muzzle. The chips on the stock are only cosmetic in nature. The gun is incredibly solid and shoots amazingly. It still has a very positive edge on the extractor and ejects very forcefully. It has a ported barrel to assist with recoil control. Less than 50 rounds have been put through it and the bore is nice and bright with sharp lands and grooves. The trigger pull is crisp, like breaking glass, and it’s got that nice, heavy Weatherby bolt. It comes with an approximately $600 Nikon brand scope. I do not recall the magnification on the scope and I wasn't able to get a good picture of the bore due to only having a cellular phone camera, but it's in excellent shape. I'm asking $1,400.00 for it or your best offer. It was over $2,000.00 when it was purchased (including the scope).

I'm also selling the scope and rifle separately, I'm asking $1,000.00 for the rifle and $500.00 for the scope.

This would make a fantastic hunting or target rifle as it is very accurate and very well made. The only reason I'm parting with it is because I'm in need of money and I know it's worth more than what I'm asking.

Please feel free to ask any questions if you interested in buying, but make sure to read my post before you do. If you decide you'd like to purchase it, please contact me by email and we can work out an appropriate time and place to meet."

The Inertia Driven system is the heart of the world’s most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt—the inertia spring, the bolt body, and the rotating locking head—for more reliable operation. The operating system is mostly contained in the receiver, giving the Model 2000 a trimmer fore-end with better balance.

The Stoeger Model 2000 fires everything from 1-1/8 ounce field and target loads to the heaviest 3” waterfowl loads without adjustments. Plus, with no propellant gas venting into the operating system, the Model 2000 stays cleaner. 
Reliability, versatility, and value make the Model 2000 the ideal semi-auto shotgun. No other in its price range even compares.
