They're US made Thermolds (NOT Ther""melts"" that were made in Canada, with the maple leaf). These were made in the US by D&D of North Carolina. Some are date stamped (90). They are definite preban because D&D went out of business before the ban ended, so all their magazines are preban or marked LEO only (which these are not).

They are a Zytel construction (fiberglass reinforced nylon polymer) and are very sturdy.





There's one caveat with these magazines. The topmost rib is designed to prevent the magazine from being inserted too far into the rifle to prevent damage to the feed lips. On some lowers this rib prevents the magazine from being inserted fully and locking. My Anvil Arms has no problems. I have these because someone with an Olympic said they didn't fit his receiver, nor his friend's Bushmaster. If you have a mil-spec receiver these should work no problem. But the rib can be sanded down slightly to fit. I can't offer returns, so that is the warning. I'm going to try them in a DPMS and see.

The real kicker is that it's never had a single smokeless round, nor a jacketed bullet down the barrel...EVER. I bought the rifle with the sole intention of nostalgia, and the pleasure of shooting cast lead bullets propelled by blackpowder. It is fully capable of firing all factory .45-70 ammunition including the high pressure Buffalo Bore rounds that were manufactured to duplicate the performace of the 450 marlin round. It's a stout action, and if you are a reloader, you can load this round with bullets as heavy as your shoulder will bear. It's got a 34'' barrel and a williams peep rear sight, case colored action and butt-plate. It's been well maintained, and mostly a safe queen. I've been selling off the rifles that I just don't shoot anymore which unfortunately includes this rifle. There is a minor ding on the underside of the stock that I have included a photo of, but that's it. The rest of the rifle is immaculate, and well maintained. I am including 25 rounds of Goex Black Dawge Black Powder cartridges that are 405gr RNL bullets. I recommend firing one at dusk when the light it low for a incredible fireball.

Dont pass this up. These Guns are Impossible to buy Right now! Most of the factories are backed up for YEARS on backorders. 

Unsure about the quality of OlyArms? DONT BE! Several Years back Olympic got a bad wrap for the quality of thier recievers. The Fault was that the specs were just a little tight and some mags didn't fit well and some had feeding Problems. That Problem Has been corrected in all manufacturing of their rifles and they are a excellent product! They are actually further known for their exteme quality of barrels and accuracy!

This Rifle is a Prime Example, producing groups tight enough to give a bench shooter a chubby! I have Fired everything from cheep reman ammo and Military surplus, to Matched and Blueprinted handloads and have never had a single malfunction. 

Still unsure? I'll put it in your hands and you can Shoot it yourself!

It provides a stable platform for the most comfortable, concealed carry possible. We anchor the weight around the hipbones, (not on the soft tissue of your waist). This distributes the weight of your weapon (and extra magazine) evenly around the hips at the center of gravity. The weapon is worn in the front, on the centerline. This way it will not interfere with normal or rigorous activity. When you sit down, the weapon fits down comfortably between your legs. ""Sensitive"" body parts are behind the bulk of the weapon. Worn on top of the underwear and shirt, but under the trousers. Be as active as you want. You'll never have to adjust your holster.

The Standard Model is made especially for the type of handgun you specify. It has a pocket on the opposite side to carry an extra Magazine. We will manufacture the Holster for a right or left handed shooter. Strap size does not matter since we make each Holster one at a time as per your specifications.

The Combination Holster is a 3 pocketed holster. The Holster can be used for right or left hand shooters. The 2 front pockets are the same size. The Combination Holster has a back pocket, directly behind the 2 front pockets. The back pocket can accommodate cash, badge, handcuffs or use your own imagination. The Combination Holster is for customers who require 1 holster for all their handguns. The Combination Holster comes in 3 sizes.

The Small Combination Holster will carry all small framed handguns. (i.e., Colt Pony, Mustang, Kel-tec P11, Walther PPK, Beretta Tomcat, Kahr-9, Sig 232 and all handguns of like size.)

The Medium Combination Holster will carry all small as mentioned of like size plus, Medium framed handguns. (i.e., All mini Glocks, Glock 23, 19, etc., Sig 239, 228, 229, All J frame Snub nose revolvers and like sized handguns.)

The Large Combination Holster (a.k.a. the ""Federal Model"") will carry all small, medium and Large framed handguns. (i.e., Full sized 45's, Baretta 92's, Glock 17, 21, 22, Combat Commander, Browning Hi Power and all like sized handguns.)

This gun is comfortable to conceal, is easy to fit a holster for if you want to open carry, and comes with two 14 round magazines (14+1) as well as the case, paperwork, and gun lock.

It has been cleaned after every fire and has been well maintained. It's DAO, and has a long trigger pull, but nothing worse than a typical revolver. Great gun overall, and I hate to see it go.

Who:  MOC and the Second Amendment March.

Contacts: Brian Jeffs, President of MOC---Skip Coryell, SA March founder and organizer.

Please set aside this date for a great gathering of friends and patriots.  Bring food to cook or a dish to pass.  Also bring your own tableware, beverages, and a few portable chairs if desired.  MOC staff will supply the charcoal, condiments, grills and some meats (hot-dogs, burgers, and brats).  This is a family friendly get together and you don't have to OC if you don't want to.  Come out and have some fun and learn more about OC and the March on DC. 

Dress for and bring things you need for a day at the beach.  Sun-Set Park is between the Holiday Inn on the west and the Great Lakes Maritime Academy on the east.  It's a great location for swimming and you can fish on the Maritime Pier.  There are plenty of picnic tables, but a lawn chair is more comfortable.  Parking is on the east side of the park.  

A March representative will speak at the picnic and talk about the March followed by some Q&A.

We will be contacting the media and most likely will get a spot on the Norm Jone's Show on AM radio in TC.  Norm has helped us in the past and he might even show up at the event."

It is in good condition, and shoots nice, tight groups.  Bore is bright and perfect.  It has the adjustable windage/elevation rear aperture sight.  It also comes with a picatinny rail scope mount and 1"" rings, three 15-round mags, a GI sling, a GI mag pouch for the stock, and a GI cleaning kit that goes in the stock for the sling to loop around.  It doesn't come with a scope... the one that was on it when i bought it was a big long hunting scope, and the lens came too far back over the stock to assume a proper shooting position.  This mount would work great with a shorter scope.  This rifle also comes with most of a 50 round box of FMJ ammo, and about 30 rounds of soft points.  Ammo is cheap for these things right now... you can get a 500 round case for $155 from CMP.  These things have nice low recoil, but still pack a punch.  Ballistics similar to a .357 mag out of a compact little carbine.  Great for everything -- plinking, hunting, personal defense, paper punching, whatever.  This thing has been really well taken care of too... not a spot of rust on it, and it hasn't been fired hardly at all in the past 15 years.  I recently bought it from a friend who needed money... he inherited it from his grandpa and its mostly been sitting in a closet.

I already have another AR, so I am looking to upgrade to something in a .308 by selling my Car-15.

This rifle has a 4 position stock, oversized forward assist and has the full length heavy barrel. The barrel is 11.5"" and has a 5.5"" flash suppressor. It has a Surefire M500A dedicated forend light which features a 9-volt shock-isolated incandescent lamp, dual low-output navigation lights, and three separate primary beam switches integrated into the forend: constant-on rocker switch (left side), a momentary-on pressure pad switch (right side), and a system disable rotary switch (rear of battery housing) to lock the light in the OFF position for covert operations or to eliminate accidental light activation during storage. The navigation lights are blue, and are activated by a smaller momentary-on pressure pad on the left side of the forend. I put the light on about a year ago and have never shot the gun with it on. It is a brand new light. 

I have about $1700.00 invested in the gun, but I am asking for only $1300.00. This gun will only go to a good home.
