It is a custom Sig so you don't see many of these, in fact, I have never met anyone yet that has an identical P229.

This gun was bought for my wife who wanted it but this P229 40 is just too big for her small hands.  She only fired it on two occasions at an indoor gun range and she didn’t get through a full clip on either occasion. It hurts her hand. 

The gun is in perfect condition - like brand new! Every original component that was in the box originally is still in the box ; original Sig trigger lock, two clips(one never used) orange bullet, original factory shell casings from testing, original factory testing tags, original plastic the handgun was wrapped in, manual, sticker, promo catalog, etc.. 

This P229 40 caliber has been stored in a climate controlled safe inside the original Sig Sauer box. She wouldn't even carry it. She carried it one time in the box below the back seat with the clip in her purse.... 

The Sig MSRP is almost $1100.00 then all applicable taxes when bought from a gun store but I will sell this one for $950.00 OBO.

In the interest of full disclosure, I seem to have misplaced the spare magazine base with the pinky extension that came with the gun. It is otherwise in excellent condition and has had approximately 300-400 rounds fired through it. 

I am mostly interested in selling at this time, but will consider trades as well if the deal is right, so feel free to offer. I am in the Steubenville (43952) area, but I am willing to drive a little, so again, toss me an email and we'll see what can be worked out.

The MP5 is high quality, massive firepower, battery operated with a HI CAP magazine. You have to hold this thing and play with it... just like the real MP5! This will make sure your opponent on the airsoft field feels it. ;) Great for distance, has hop up. Brand new last year! Only been in 3 matches. Battery still charges 100 percent. It's pretty much brand new. The M9 is great for close quarters, not sure of the manufacturer, got it back in 2006. Comes with Military U.S. Holster, case, manual and two 9mm magazine holders (Military issue). So if you need a kit that's ready to go, this is it. Only reason I am selling is my friends I was airsofting with last summer moved away. For 250 for a mint high quality MP5 by Echo 1 (Look at the reviews, it's heavy metal, metal gearbox, brass bore, composite stock like on a real one.) and for a sidearm with lots of accessories, this is a great deal. You can check them out yourself! They have orange tips because they are TOYS and in NO WAY can be modified to fire real bullets/rounds. Legal for sale here.

For summer fun, write me back for more info! 250 firm. You won't find a better deal.

Also, throwing in rail mount scope. I have no use for it... I did when I owned an M14. It's a real sharp good quality scope.

The following accessories are already installed on the shotgun and being sold all together at a real deal because I recently aquired a firearm collection of a good friend that passed away and this particular shotgun is one of the many firearms that I now have duplicates of because he and I had alot of the same type taste in guns and accessories and I have decided to sell my personal Marine Magnum and keep his because of the sentimental value that goes with his.
 The retail value of the Remington Marine Magnum by itself is in the range of my asking price with absolutely no add-ons and with the accessories and I feel someone would get an axcellent deal with all the goodies already included brings the value to the 12-15 hundred range and I want a quick sale so here it is at less than half the value. If you dont like the add ons simply remove and sale them and get the gun for free.
Includes the following.

One inch LED Flashlight and RED LAZER light Combo unit that allows the flashlight to be used for dark entry or night use and also the red dot lazor for quick target aquisition and reflex sighting.

The firearm itself has had less than 20 rounds fired and all the accessories listed here were purchased new and installed on the shotgun all at the same time as the gun itself was purchased. If purchased separately new you would spend in excess of eight hundred dollars for the accessories only and another seven hundred for the shotgun itself, Nice peice here fellas at a real deal and I personally spent over fifteen hundred on the gun and all the accessories and want less than half that and guarantee less than a box of shells have been fired with this weapon and its 95 percent and is the gun and accessories only as i do not have the original box.

The Koshirae features a black lacquer saya in very good condition. The tsuka is done in white silk ito under which lie two large black dragon menuki. The fuchi / kashira are a simple iron with a nice brown patina. The fuchi is plain, while the Kashira has a single row of small sakura or cherry blossoms inlaid in silver. The iron Tsuba depicts two dragons on the front and the flaming jewel and clouds on the back.

I've read extensively about FTE's in this model but I think they've worked out most of the kinks. I've never had a problem with it at all, has functioned great except with PMAG type magazines, doesn't seem to like those at all.

Would prefer to handle transaction in person, because mailing firearms is a tiny bit of a hassle.  To legally sell a handgun to you, if you're not ""personally known"" to me, you have to a) be a NH resident, and b) have a permit (concealed carry or whatever else).  Otherwise, we'll have to do the transfer through a FFL (I'll pay the fee if it's $20 or under).
