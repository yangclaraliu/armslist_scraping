If you're interested in a trade I have an H&K USP .40S&W V1. Has seen about 300 rounds through it and is in like new condition. I have added rubber decal grips that can easily be removed if desired. I have 3 13 round magazines to go along with it. All 3 mags I have added genuine H&K pinky extensions to the bottoms. I also have all the original documents and case to go along with it. This was purchased 10/29/2011 from Fin Feather & Fur and I have the receipt to prove it. I also have a few boxes of .40 ammo I can throw in to sweeten the deal if need be. I can send plenty of pictures if requested. I have no problems trading straight up (no cash involved) as long as your rifle + accessories equal the value of my firearm. I have no desire in trading if all your offering is a bone stock rifle. If you want to add cash to the deal that's fine as well. I may be willing to do a multiple gun trade if you have two your willing to sell. I can also add cash to the deal if the value of what you're offering exceeds the value of my USP."

I have two 870's. One is a wingmaster that has a Chester Greene 36 inch barrel built for shooting 2-2-10 Wagners. It is drilled and taped with a scope on it. Price is $600.00.

The other is a Express 870 with a Chester Greene 30 inch barrel that is a Vent Rib barrel. This one is built to shoot light 9's. This gun is built to pass for a legal.

Get some good light on it.  2.  place it on a solid (no patterns like checks or paisley) light colored background. 3. Avoid other clutter in the picture.

Bore is good,not counterbored like a lot of the Mosin Nagants out there. However, the bore is kind of dark (probably just need a really good cleaning, or need to shoot the gun to get the bore clean. I have not fire the gun). But has good lands and grooves. Stock is in good condition. No cracks, splits, or damages. Overall, this rifle is in good to very good condition. Comes with 200 or so rounds of surplus ammo in two sealed cans and stripper clips. Just email me for more informations/questions. Or, you can do a google (or yahoo) search on Finnish Mosin Nagants. There are plenty of informations on the internet on this particular gun. I apologize for the quality of the pictures. The rifle is much better looking in person than the pictures.

This is the better made Finnish Mosin Nagant M91 (not the common M91/30). The Model 91 is an older version of the M91/30, which has the longer barrel. This gun has matching numbers, or Finn match (matching numbers on the barrel shank and bolt knob). Made in 1940 by VKT (later known as Valmet). Bore is good,not counterbored like a lot of the Mosin Nagants out there. However, the bore is kind of dark (probably just need a really good cleaning, or need to shoot the gun to get the bore clean.I have not fire the gun). But has good lands and grooves. Stock is in good condition. No cracks, splits, or damages. Overall, this rifle is in good to very good condition. Comes with 200 or so rounds of surplus ammo in two tin cans and stripper clips. Just email me for more informations/questions. Or, you can do a google (or yahoo) search on Finnish Mosin Nagants. There are plenty of informations on the internet on this particular gun. I apologize for the quality of the pictures. The rifle is much better looking in person than the pictures. I used my cameraphone to take the pics. And it does not take really good pics.

The RWS Model 46 E is a well made rifle. Very well engineered with smooth parts operation. Solid and safe design and most importantly it's very accurate and smooth in operation. After operating some of the other underlever rifles I really appreciate the safety in the loading port - much easier to load than the Mag 460. It's well designed and thought out and most importantly it's accurate and no ""Droop."" This is one of the most accurate rifles I own with solid 1 hole touching the next in 5 shot groups.

Fit and finish
Diana has always had a good fit and finish, but it's never quite up to the standards of Weihrauch. Perhaps, it's more in the BSA class. Since the 46 was targeted to go after the British TX, they went out of their way to make as crisp a rifle as they could. The lines are very clean and the cheekpiece is quite stylish and well-shaped - an area where other Dianas perhaps fall short. The stock has the typical Diana angularity, compared to the more rounded TX. It also shaves off about a pound of weight, making the 46 the lighter rifle."

This firearm is very accurate and will >1 inch groups at fifty yards. If you are looking for an inexpensive, no-frills tack-driving rifle for defense or plinking, this is your baby. I entertained the idea of mounting a scope, which would not be difficult.

This rifle was purchased by me in the early 1990's, I am not sure of it production date. The 94-22 was discontinued from production in 2004. 

This rifle has roughly 500 rounds down range, never been wet, and not hunted with. Strictly a range rifle and learning rifle for my kids. 

It does have a few idiot scratches, not deep, but enough to take some bluing off of the receiver. It also has some bluing problems on the trigger guard on the ejection side. Not big, easy to fix, but there. I can email pictures in detail at your request. I also made the mistake of removing the front sight hood a number of years back and miss placed it. This part can be had for $12 from MidwayUSA and slides right in. 

Overall the gun is in fantastic condition and shoots very very well. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me for details and more pictures.

M952V
The M952V Millennium® Universal WeaponLight attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. It utilizes one sealed LED unit to produce both brilliant white light and invisible infrared radiation for use with night vision devices. The white beam is configured for close- to medium-range applications. Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode. The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Available in Black and Desert Sand.

874,http://www.armslist.com/posts/303874,"For Sale:  Brand New ""Cuda"" 1911 holster by Simply Rugged -- Right Handed","Carefree Circle, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 50,"Listed On: Sunday, February 12, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a brand new ""Cuda"" holster by Simply Rugged. This holster is for Right Handed draw.

This holster was originally intended for my Kimber Pro Shadow II 1911, however, I've decided to sell the Kimber to my father so I won't be needing this holster.

The holster is Oxblood in color and is very well made. The holster can be worn OWB strong side or crossdraw and can also be converted to IWB easily by adding IWS straps (not included) from Simply Rugged. For more details on the Cuda holster go to: http://www.simplyrugged.com/cuda/

I only holstered my Kimber with it once and it was very secure. I could easily hold the holster and gun upside down and shake it without the gun dislodging. I literally holstered the gun that one time and then sent it off to get the slide refinished. It is brand new and has never been worn.

I'm not a 1911 expert, but I believe this holster should work very well with most any Commander sized (4"" barrel) 1911 pistol, especially from the Kimber Pro series.

Asking $50 face-to-face or $60 shipped via USPS.

Please let me know if you are interested!"
