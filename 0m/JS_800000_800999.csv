The light is listed as a max output of 125+ lumens with an hour run time.  I have run it for alot longer than 1 hour and it is water proof to 20 meters.  I have money wrapped up in this so my price is firm at $500.  I accept paypal and will pay for the shipping so no one is traveling.  Once the payment is received it will be shipped.  I will also accept trades on tactical shotguns that are lightly used or a good hand gun of similar price.  I am open to most guns and if your looking to sell one and it is more than this and your looking for a good AR set up I can pay the difference.  If you want to trade we will work out shipment and FFL stuff as I am located in NC.

I'm willing to travel about 30 miles from the St Louis area to deal. These 2 guns are for TRADE only. Being prices are so high on everything and availability of firearms are limited at stores I'd just rather trade, thanks.
 (1) S&W 19-3, 4 inch blued 357 mag with original target grips. Has the pinned barrel and recessed chambers. The gun does have some wear on it but in decent shape for a 35+ year old gun, the wear will NOT show up in pics. Very sweet gun and the trigger is amazing as you'd expect from this type of revolver. 
 (2) mossberg 590 12 gauge with ghost ring sights.  Has the parkerized finish with black synthetic furniture. Holds 9 rounds of 12 gauge 2 3/4 shells. Has the bayonet lug which will fit a standard m-9 bayonet. The gun is in good shape with low round count (around 20). Has a little wear on the magazine tube from the pump from cycling the action, still looks awesome, it just happens on pumps!! 
 Ok I'm looking for trades only. Mostly looking to trade both for a Benelli M-2 tactical, a M-1 tactical will be considered as well.  Must have the pistol grip stock and much preferred mag extension. I will trade either of them for a mossberg 930 spx with the same things, I can trade both but would need money or something else added from you.  I will trade either of them for a S&W 66 2 1/2 inch 357 mag.

It was built by Red Jacket on a correct Nodak Krinkov lower receiver (thicker than standard AK). Comes with hard case. Short Yugo Correct flash horn hider and original M92 trigger group (Tapco G2 installed) 2x 30 round Yugo mags, Yugo cleaning kit, Yugo Military Sling, and mag/ammo pouch.
 This is an original Yugoslavian Military factory Short Barreled AK47 with a 10.5 inch barrel with a 5.5inch spot welded hollow horn style flash hider to make it 16inch legal rifle without having to obtain an SBR stamp first. It can be removed and the original short horn flash hider re-enstalled once you obtain your tax stamp for an SBR weapon. This is truely a collectors AK47 and the absolute rarest of the Yugo factory made Short Barreled AK47 and it's NEW. Look around you will not be able to find one like this anywhere! This is not a cheapo Romainian WASR 10/63 AK or Chineese Norinco made AK crap that people here are asking tripple price for...this is the absolute best AK47 made next to an original Russian made AK!! I had two of them...this is my last one!

*Note* The last picture only shows what it would look like as it was originally made from the factory as an SBR (Short Barreled Rilfe) If you were to buy one already as an SBR you would have to wait 8 months for the stamp before you could even take possession of it! with mine you can buy it now, take possession of it, shoot it, enjoy it, and at your leasure get you tax stamp to make it an SBR if you choose to!

I'll consider a few hundred off the price if buyer throws in an EOTech sight in the deal!

Relax, Rejuvenate, Invigorate
Increase circulation, relieve tension and increase energy with 460 square inches of air massage:

Arm & Palm Massage
Increase circulation and warmth, removes tension.

Shoulder Massage
Gently stimulates your lymphatic system to help cleanse the body.

Arm & Shoulder Stretch
Gradual stretching of shoulder muscles to remove tension & increase flexibility.

Leg Stretch
Works to alleviate stiffness in your lower back, hips and thighs. The air system in the ottoman squeezes the lower legs while it lowers and raises in 20° increments.

Seat & Hip Massage
Gently squeezes and soothes buttocks, outer thighs and waist. Soft adjustable hip acupoint nodule.

Calf Massage
Gently squeezes and loosens tightness, increases circulation.

A Tailored Massage
Using pressure sensor technology, the Ultra creates a virtual map of your back. The massage you receive is contoured to your height and your spine's curve. Real Pro Ultra™ scans your body and is able to identify you. The ""floating"" massage heads glide over your back and know where to massage -- and where not to. You create your own customizable program, which Ultra remembers for the next time you're ready for a massage. The air bags conform to your body, and the Air Ottoman System even extends to open/closed to accommodate any height.

The ""Junetsu"" Massage Technique: A Panasonic Exclusive

Junetsu, the Japanese word for ""ultra-fine kneading,"" is basedon the one-second circular thumb movements of professional massage therapists. Junetsu quickly loosens up tight muscles, and the spiral circular motion reverberates down through the muscles to invigorate you down to the surface of your bones.

Reflexology

For professional, personalized massage therapy on your feet, the Real Pro Ultra™ utilizes adjustable and removable plates to incorporate reflexology into the massage experience. This reflexology stimulates additional massage points on your feet, increasing blood and energy flow throughout your body.

Acupoints

You have approximately 350 acupoints on your body, with nearly 100 on your back and neck alone. From the soothing palm style of Swedish massage, to deep tissue kneading, to Shiatsu massage, the Real Pro Ultra™ has a variety of techniques for invigorating these energy acupoints.

Advanced Quad-Style Massage Technology

Massage heads that open and close -- these four massage styles can be chosen during a massage:
Shiatsu
Swedish
Fist Kneading
Grasping

The Winchester 1300 shotgun was first introduced in around 1981, when the US Repeating Arms Company (USRAC) took over production of the 'Winchester' brand guns from the Olin / Winchester corporation. In fact, the model 1300 was a slightly modified version of the previous Winchester model 1200 shotgun, which was manufactured by Olin /Winchester between 1964 and 1980. With recent (mid-2007) closure of the USRAC factory production of the Winchester model 1300 shotguns, along with other Winchester brand guns, was moved to Winchester Repeating Arms Co; new guns were manufactured by one of the FN Manufacturing Company's subsidaries located in the Morgan, Utah.

The Winchester 1300 shotguns are known as the ""Speed Pump"", because of the very fast cycling pump-action, which makes these guns popular among both hunters and sport shooters. 

Receiver is produced from a tough, lightweight aluminum alloy.  The bolt locks into the barrel extension using a rotary bolt head with four radial locking lugs. Rounds are fed from a tubular under-barrel magazine, which can be had in a variety of lengths / capacities. Barrels are quick-detachable and fitted with replaceable chokes and a sighting rib."

Bullpup is in great condition and is in the rare gray stock. This rifle has been well taken care of and has all the extras. Both mags store on board and you can even get a high capacity drum for these. I even saw a video where a guy had 2 drums attached to his, with the way the stock stores your mags for easy access you can swap them out quickly. The scope is the well respected BSA Sweet 22 line.($150) It has the 3 adj. turrets and screw in aluminum shades with screw in covers. It is well made. I was amazed that even with shooting this bullpup you do not need hearing protection in my opinion. This is the best shooting 22 I have owned and am only selling to fund another purchase. It is very accurate. Also comes in factory case and fold-able vertical foregrip. With scope and grip-525....obo,                  without 450...obo. No trades, funding another purchase.

REVIEW BY: Larry Saturday, December 08, 2012
I have this scope on my 10/22 and sweet it is! Easy to sight in and looks like a sight that costs a lot more. After I got it sighted in I put 10 in a circle the size of a silver dollar the first time and it was better and better each time after that. Can't be beat!
REVIEW BY: Jim Sunday, March 11, 2012
Purchased this scope for my Remington Model 550-1 (my father gave this rifle to me in 1956 and it still is my favorite .22 rim fire rifle). After getting everything aligned and zeroed, it was easy to sight in. Haven't had a chance to use it in the field yet but the optics are remarkably clear. I would recommend it to a friend.
REVIEW BY: Mike Saturday, January 15, 2011
I bought one of these for my Savage Mark II and I have to say it is by far to date the best 22 scope I have had. It is clear at all ranges and I set zero with 40gr Rem, then switched to the Fed 36gr hp and was right on from 0-100 yds and all in between. I have not had any turning or sighting in problems at all. If you go from 50 to 100 just go past 5 or so clicks then back to 100 and it is right on. I will be getting another sweet series soon!
REVIEW BY: Eddie T. Saturday, November 13, 2010
I just bought this scope. I`ll be putting it on a new Ruger 10/22 tactical. Seems to be the perfect scope for a .22 will write more later.
REVIEW BY: Jeff Wednesday, May 05, 2010
I have one of these mounted on a Henry lever action .22 with see through scope mounts. Zeroed really fast and has held it for over 2 years now. Clarity is good with no fuzziness at the edges. I havent messed with the different turrets for different bullet weights but the 36 grain one works really well. Very happy with performance and will definitley buy again for any other .22 I come across.
REVIEW BY: AK Grouse-a-matic Saturday, January 16, 2010
Great scope. I have it mounted on a S&W M&P15-22. Outstanding optics for small game hunting. Side parralax is on the money. Head shots on grouse out to 75 yards. Would recomend it to a friend.

I also have 4 steel AK47 mags for sale. 2 new in wrapper 40rd, and 2 used steel 30rd. All 4 mags for 150. I will ship them if needed (for $10, free tracking) and take paypal.

December 2012:

if it makes you feel any better, i went ahead and ordered the keltec rails and stock extension and while i was on the phone with keltec customer service, i asked about the sub 2000 availability. the guy told me that they added a second production shift this week and he did some OT in the shop. hopefully they will be pumping out sub 2k's as i have an order in as well. 

Here's what the Kel Tec rep had to say, call them and see for yourself:

 No, we’ve never stopped the Sub production, they’re just on a heavy backorder due to popularity.

There are no sights. There is a tiny crack on either side of the stock where the stock screws to the action. The bluing, bore, and action are in incredibly good shape, and don't really reflect it's age. I do believe that the stock has been refinished. I have no use for this, I bought it because I liked the way it looked, and would like to move on to something else. I am asking $150 for it, or would use this plus cash to trade up.

The Isis-1 was great, the Isis-2 (new for 2012) is even better!  Now rated for SUBSONIC .300 Blackout as well as centerfire pistol and rimfire calibers, the Isis-2 is truly among the quietest and most versatile 9mm pistol suppressors on the market.  Improvements to the old design include a threadless tube (both stronger and easier to disassemble), and improved suppression (that’s right, it’s even quieter!)  Until now, sacrifices had to be made when picking out a 9mm suppressor.  While the industry standard suppressors that accept multiple mounts are excellent performers, they cannot be  effectively cleaned or used with dirty rimfire ammunition due to the fact that they are sealed units.  Our Isis-2 accepts industry standard recoil booster, tri-lug, uzi,  and fixed thread mounts and disassembles easily for cleaning and user-service with our included billet disassembly tool.  That translates into you buying one suppressor and using it on everything from 9mm on down to .22lr.  Possibly, best of all, we didn’t raise the price 

As with all of our suppressors, we have utilized state-of-the-art mono-core technology to provide you with excellent suppression, minimum number of parts to juggle, (the entire suppressor disassembles into only three parts), minimum poi shift, and unmatched ease of cleaning and user maintenance.  Spend less, shoot more guns suppressed…Isis-2."

The gun is great shape mechanically, but it does show cosmetic signs of holster wear and use. There are rub marks on the slide, though the black nitron finish is intact, and there is significant rubbing on the exposed portion of the barrel where it makes contact with the slide (as any semi-auto is wont to do). The frame is blued, and has an inky look in the photos, but I find under most lighting conditions the gun is entirely black. This is not the SAS package, nor does the gun have night sights. 

The gun came with Hogue rubber grips with finger grooves. While comfortable at the range, they weren't great for carry, and bulked up the gun, so I bought some black Hogue aluminum grips, with pretty aggressive checkering, to slim things down (and make the entire gun metal). The aluminum grips are mint and fit together perfectly around the back of the gun. I also acquired a couple extra mags during my ownership of this gun, and all four will be included with it.

normal flash hider on the market today will 
fit and the suppressor will still work fine. 
The A1 flash hider in this picture shows the 
mounting scheme. Added length to the 
weapon is less than 6 inches since it 
telescopes over the flash hider.

Please note that this mounting device will 
only fit barrels .740"" and less in diameter.

if it is too large."
