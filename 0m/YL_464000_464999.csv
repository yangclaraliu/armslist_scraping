Browning Gold Fusion Shotgun in Factory Case cal. 12 gauge, with a 28"" vent ribbed barrel chambered for 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells, The Gold Fusion firearm is the most feature loaded Autoloader ever, this Gold Fusion includes the hard case, chokes Included: Full, Modified, Improved Cylinder, Invector-Plus/Imp. Mod. and Invector-Plus/Mod., it also features a shim adjustable comb system with over a 1/4"" adjustment range (1/8"" up, 1/8"" down) and a Hi-Viz (8 interchangeable beads)Tri-Comp sight system for a quick alignment, Standard features of the Browning Gold shotgun are: Action: In the 12 gauge 3"" chambering, the Gold's self-regulating gas system shoots all loads interchangeably-from 1 oz. target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. The Gold has a gas valve on the inside of the gas piston. Because the gas piston and valve operate independently less pressure is exerted on the piston resulting in greater longevity and more efficient operation than other gas-operated autoloaders. Additionally, the extremely short piston stroke of the Gold limits the amount of combustion gas that gets into the receiver. The shooter will benefit from the cleaner operation. Magazine Capacity: 4 in magazine, one in chamber. Recoil Pads: Standard Vented Rib: Solid ventilated rib with matte sighting plane. Safety: The oversized, cross-bolt safety is mounted on the trigger guard allowing quick operation while keeping an eye on the target, and it's easily reversed by a gunsmith for left-hand use. Safety Lock: all Gold shotguns are shipped with a free padlock (or equivalent device) to assist in the safe storage of your firearm. Sights: comes with Hi-Viz Tri-Comp fiber optic sights. This system consists of eight different interchangeable colored light pipes so the bead can be adjusted to match varied light conditions or shooting styles. Stock: Oil finished Turkish walnut stock and forearm. Speed Loading: With the action open, any load inserted into the magazine is sent directly to the chamber, ready to be fired. Trigger: Gold colored. The trigger guard is large and has carefully rounded edges to accommodate gloved fingers. Additionally, the Gold's trigger assembly can be removed in seconds for cleaning. Back-Bored Barrels: The Browning Gold was the first autoloader on the market with a back-bored barrel. A bore diameter increased to its maximum allowable specification reduces the friction of the shot charge against the barrel wall. Instead of trying to overcome friction, powder gases expend more energy on the wad base, resulting in an increase in shot velocity. Because there is less constriction or pressure from the forcing cones on a shot charge, there are fewer deformed shot pellets. A greater number of ballistically superior round pellets in a shot charge means more uniform patterns-delivering more shot pellets in the effective part of the pattern. Back-boring works hand-in-hand with Browning's Invector-Plus interchangeable choke tube system. The longer choke taper inside an Invector-Plus choke tube produces patterns with more uniform densities, this shotgun is in about new condition there is no rust on the metal and no scratches or cracks in the wood, it has the gold inlay as seen in the photo's and comes with lock, choke tubes and tool, stock spacers,"

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.

The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ's Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01 are completely interchangable with every other P-01, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. The P-01 is the only NATO-spec pistol on the market that is available to the public. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability:  The U.S. Army ""Mean Rounds Between Failure"" (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

Scope is a Cabelas Pine Ridge Tactical 17 6-18x40. Scope is real sweet and has the side parallax adjustment. This scope is crazy clear and super crisp, told by Cabela this model scope was manufactured by Nikon (if this is true is beyond me) but the scope is top notch for a $200 scope!

Bipod is a Caldwell and is included. Will also include 100 +/- rounds.

$600 cash or $650 trade for ak47/74 or other assault type rifle."

Burris uses lenses with a greater diameter than the competition
• “Signature Select” scopes lenses are 40% larger than the competition in 1” tubes
• “Fullfield II” lenses are 25% larger than the competition in 
1” tubes

MODEL TUBE DIAMETER LENSES DIAMETER
Black Diamond™	 30 mm	 15.4 mm
Euro Diamond™	 30 mm	 15.4 mm
Signature Select™	 25.4 mm	 15.4 mm
Fullfield® II	 25.4 mm	 13.8 mm
Others	 30 mm	 15 mm
Others	 25.4 mm	 11.0 mm



Unique Technical Features
The outer tubes & internal components are extremely robust.
The adjustment system is:
- repeatable
- steel on steel
- with audible clicks
Double internal spring force. Every Burris scope has it.



Posi-Lock
• Posi-Lock is a coil-spring assisted retractable steel post that firmly and & securely locks accuracy into place. 
• Once the reticle is zeroed, the covering tube (red) replaces the internal spring (green) & locks the inner tube in place. 
• All scopes have one spring that allows the adjustment of the reticle. 
Some of the competition competitors offer a double spring whereas the double spring is the STANDARD for all Burris products. 
• As an optional, it’s possible to have the special Posi-Lock system. 
Posi-Lock scopes remain perfectly zeroed year after year even during transportation.

In the closed position, the force of the spring is substituted by the force of the steel post on the internal tube of the scope.



On all rifle scopes:
• Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope
• Every scope is individually recoil, water and fogproof tested 
• Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage



Recoil Test
Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests
An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration.
This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Waterproof Test
All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof.
Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C.
The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. 


Fog Test
The nitrogen contained in the scope is:
• of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen)
• ultra pure
• ultra clean
To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of 
• pressurizing the scope
• subjecting it to a vacuum
The tests are both cost & time intensive

The scope and scope mount are like new condition without packaging or paperwork. I do have the tool for the scope.

Retail the scope is $300.00
Retail the mount is $100.00

The M600C Scout Light® attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. Its small size increases weapon maneuverability, increases rail space available for other accessories, and minimizes added weight. It uses a high-efficiency LED emitter, virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break, and a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to create a beam with good reach and significant peripheral light for close- to medium-range applications. Maximum output is 200 lumens, and it produces tactical-level light—more than enough to temporarily overwhelm the night-adapted vision of an aggressor—for over two hours per set of batteries. The M600C has two switch options: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600C is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-tested, built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black

MK II Browning Hi Power 9MM Made in 1985 by Fabrique Nationale in Belgium. All original, full-sized duty pistol. Spur Hammer, Parkerized, low profile fixed sights, improved ambidextrous safety levers, with two original parkerized 13 rd magazines, two aftermarket 13 rd, one 15 rd and one 20 rd.
Checkered walnut grips and a pair of wraparound Pacmeyers.
Two Leather belt holsters and owners manual.
Excellent condition mechanically, some nicks and holster wear on original finish. This is the current military and law enforcement configuration, and has a black barrel. This is not an Argentinian copy or other clone.
Buyer must have a state issued photo ID and sign a sales receipt. No felons, no out of state buyers.
The Browning Hi Power was designed by John M. Browning and he considered it an improvement over his 1911 design. It has been issued to more military forces than any other pistol in history and is still in service today. Many have argued the HP should have been the pistol we replaced the 1911 with, if we insisted on going to 9mm in the US armed forces. Controls and operation will be very familiar to the owner of a 1911 model pistol, although takedown is much simpler.
I'm sorry the Smartphone pictures are not very good, but the gun looks better in person. The glare is from oil and the camera flash. 
$475 firm. Will consider trade for a comparable single stack 9mm para. Not interested in Makerovs or anything like that, but would consider an all steel 9mm Ladysmith or similar."

• “Signature Select” scopes lenses are 40% larger than the competition in 1” tubes
• “Fullfield II” lenses are 25% larger than the competition in

Unique Technical Features
The outer tubes & internal components are extremely robust.
The adjustment system is:
- repeatable
- steel on steel
- with audible clicks
Double internal spring force. Every Burris scope has it.



Posi-Lock
• Posi-Lock is a coil-spring assisted retractable steel post that firmly and & securely locks accuracy into place. 
• Once the reticle is zeroed, the covering tube (red) replaces the internal spring (green) & locks the inner tube in place. 
• All scopes have one spring that allows the adjustment of the reticle. 
Some of the competition competitors offer a double spring whereas the double spring is the STANDARD for all Burris products. 
• As an optional, it’s possible to have the special Posi-Lock system. 
Posi-Lock scopes remain perfectly zeroed year after year even during transportation.

In the closed position, the force of the spring is substituted by the force of the steel post on the internal tube of the scope.



On all rifle scopes:
• Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope
• Every scope is individually recoil, water and fogproof tested 
• Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage



Recoil Test
Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests
An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration.
This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Waterproof Test
All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof.
Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C.
The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. 


Fog Test
The nitrogen contained in the scope is:
• of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen)
• ultra pure
• ultra clean
To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of 
• pressurizing the scope
• subjecting it to a vacuum
The tests are both cost & time intensive

The scope and scope mount are like new condition without packaging or paperwork. I do have the tool for the scope.

Retail the scope is $300.00
Retail the mount is $100.00

The M600C Scout Light® attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. Its small size increases weapon maneuverability, increases rail space available for other accessories, and minimizes added weight. It uses a high-efficiency LED emitter, virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break, and a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to create a beam with good reach and significant peripheral light for close- to medium-range applications. Maximum output is 200 lumens, and it produces tactical-level light—more than enough to temporarily overwhelm the night-adapted vision of an aggressor—for over two hours per set of batteries. The M600C has two switch options: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600C is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-tested, built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black

Includes: Hard case, 2 10 round magazines, and upper rail mount.

I feel bad letting this one go because it is likely the best .22LR pistol on the market for the price.  However, my fingers are a bit too long to shoot it as accurately as I want.  I have put about 700 rounds through this gun, and cleaned and oiled it after every outing.  In those 700 rounds of Federal bulk there was only one FTF due to a bad round.  This gun in NOT picky! And since it has been used, the breakdown and cleaning is easier as well.

Some of the things I'm interested in: 12 gauge shotgun, .22LR rifle, 9mm pistol, or .38/.357 revolver of equal value.  Again, I am open to any offer.

The sights feature two settings, one for up to 300 meters and a second for up to 500 meters. This versatility makes the DOA ideal for military, law enforcement and home defense applications. These advanced sights have been extensively field-tested and, like all Troy Industries products, are Battle Ready. Made in the U.S.A. *Lifetime limited warranty"

SIG Sauer German. 40 Cal Smith and Wesson semi auto pistol. It's excellent condition with less than 500 rounds fired. One of the sweetest trigger double and single action pulls I've seen on a factory pistol. Its never jammed and is quite accurate. It comes w 3 12 round cap factory mags and 1 10 cap magazine, factory case, manual. 1 box of 50 target ammo and the 3 12 round mags are loaded with Winchester Ranger hollow point self defense loads. It comes with a left handed inside the waist band leather holster. This is the same model that many us military and law enforcement agencies carry. Its a mid 90s model. If you know SIGs you know the older models are sought after as new production offerings have been known to have quality control issues, thanks to CEO Cohen emphasizing cosmetics over craftsmanship. New they go for $850. I'll accept $700 for everything to first responsible person who can legally own as handgun. I would consider 1 trade, for a like new third or fourth gen glock ""26 preferred"" and $300 cash or best offer."

The HK USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) is the first service pistol based on a modular concept. During development of the USP, the requirements of the Military and Security forces have consistently been taken into consideration. Thanks to the use of an improved Browning locking system with a patented buffer system, the USP recoil behaviour is unobtrusive even during the use of the highest powered ammunition. The buffer system reduces recoil forces and increases both service life of the pistol as well as improves recoil behaviour. The modular design of the USP enables an individual adaptation of safety and trigger mechanisms to any requirement.

This gun is in very good condition, and has been well-maintained. 

The XD subcompact has been described by many as one of the top handguns currently on the market for concealed carry. Its combination of big bore, small size, great accuracy, high reliability, proven durability, and surprisingly affordable price makes it a gun that people do not hesitate to buy.

The SA XD has one important feature that many other striker fired handguns (such as the Glock) do not have – a grip safety. The XD cannot fire unless the shooter’s hand compresses the rear grip safety, which is accomplished simply by gripping the handgun naturally. 

This gun includes:
•	Original box and owner’s manual
•	(2) 9-round magazines
•	(1) 12 round magazine with finger extension
•	Magazine loader tool
•	Factory polymer holster 
•	Factory dual magazine holder 

All for $450

I replaced the standard Glock factory sights with Glock factory adjustable sights. I also replaced the factory slide lock with a Glock factory extended slide lock, such as those found on their competition and tactical/practical models.

    I bought the pistol for use at the range during my time at the police academy and now that it's over, I just dont have a use for another full size pistol. I am a certified Glock Armourer and I have maintained the pistol meticulously. I will happily include the stock slide lock with the pistol. The original Glock factory sights, on the other hand, are thrown away when they are replaced with something else.

    The pistol has roughly a thousand rounds through it. It retails for 565.00 in most places. Getting one maintained properly, with modifications for ease of use and under a thousand rounds is a great deal for anyone who wants to get into a full size glock without paying the counter price.

BLACK FINISH  

The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom-most chamber, which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm, allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. 

This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat-sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. The Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

Burris Fulfield II
FULLFIELD II™ RIFLE SCOPES
With a legacy of high performance, modest prices and the backing of a Forever Warranty,™ choosing to purchase a Fullfield II ® riflescope isn’t difficult. But there are more than two dozen Fullfield II models, finishes, and reticle configurations to pick from, so choosing just which one is the hard part. 
Fullfield II’s are the smart choice when you know they are packed with the performance features that made Burris famous. Outstanding optical quality. Positive steel-on-steel adjustments. Extremely rugged outer tubes. No-slip grips on the integrated eyepiece and focus adjustment. To make a fair comparison with other brands, you’ll have to look at riflescopes costing hundreds of dollars more. 
With performance standards so high and their retail prices so reasonable, you may not have to limit yourself to just one.

If the gun comes with all of the bells and whistles, namely the bayonet, and the bore and finish are in good condition, I'm willing to pay more, but it must be almost flawless for it's age.
