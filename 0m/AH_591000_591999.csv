91,http://www.armslist.com/posts/591091,For Sale:  KIDD Single Stage Trigger Assembly Ruger 10/22,"South side, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 180,"Listed On: Monday, October 8, 2012",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Description:

 The KIDD single stage drop-in trigger unit. This design is adjustable from 1 1/2 pounds to 5 pounds with the turn of a plunger. It comes in silver or black anodized aluminum with a matching trigger blade. The redesigned bolt hold open and interchangeable magazine lever are standard. Our single stage trigger guard is CNC machined to Tony's specifications. The redesigned fit and closely held tolerances of the internal parts allow for the cleanest breaking single stage in the industry. An aftermarket auto bolt release is standard with our trigger.

How is this different from our two stage? This single stage more closely matched the traditional function of the Ruger trigger except with a refined feel and adjustability. Our two stage has a travel stage where the trigger blade moves rearward for about a 1/4 of an inch before it comes to the breaking stage. Because of this travel stage our two stage trigger is able to be reduced in weight to only 6 ounces versus the lowest weight for our single stage is 1 1/2 pounds.

More about this particular unit:

It is a used unit and does have some minor scratching.  The scratches are hidden when assembled and do not hinder performance of this unit.  It is the black model.  I still have all of the original paperwork that arrived with it if you are interested.  To contact me, call/text REDACTED.  Please leave a message if I do not answer and I will get back to you asap.

First off I must say this firearm has been great to me I carried it daily for over a year it has never let me down is a great shooter and is in overall great condition for a carry gun. So you may wonder what makes this gun so rare. well there are many first gen 247s out there it is fairly common for the full frame versions to have a built in decocking system it is far more uncommon for the compact versions to have such a feature this will allow you to decock it after loading a round in the chamber there for carrying it with a double action trigger for more peace of mind. very limited versions they put a titanium slide on the 247 now what makes this firearm rare is that it is the compact version with a titanium slide and decocker system. so what you have is a striker fired pistol capable of being decocked  in the compact lighter version with the titanium slide. Acording to taurus it looks like 2009 was the only year they made this guy with those 3 combinations in a very limited run of numbers. go ahead look for yourself will be very hard hard to find 1. in all the time I've had this gun I've only seen 1 with titanium and ds but it was a full frame. I know some people don't care for Taurus but i often carried this over my ruger sr9 or xd40sc I trust my life with this gun. comes with 1 13rd and 1 17rd magazines hardcase and manual. 350 firm. check out what other strikers fired pistols with decockers sell for p99s sw99s.

Action is silky smooth and timing is perfect. 
Lock up is tight with a light, smooth trigger pull.
Bore is bright and shiny. The cylindar has a faint turn line.
Includes original blue plastic factory carrying 
case, case numbered to gun, with owner's manual. 
The gun has a light holster rub on the front near the trigger 
guard that I'm sure would buff out, and an idiot scratch at the 
handle on the left side right at the grip. I did it although I don't 
know how. I always thought a nice set of wood grips would completely hide it.
Please see the pictures for a better look, I tried to take 
the best pictures I could and circled the places mentioned above.

One was my buddys service glock and the other (40 cal) was the first gun i ever bought so it has been used but def not more than 300 rounds through it.

Sig556 1000$ with electronic sight 4x30 round mags foregrip with push button release bipod This was bought used ata gunshow and has probably been fired quite a bit as it has the standard shell release markings like all 556's it is however a solid well taken care of rifle with no issues. comes with case

To produce bass, you need a sub, an enclosure, and an amplifier, and it can be little tricky to match them all up. A powered sub eliminates all the hassle, as the manufacturer designs the enclosure to house the sub and amp together. This all-in-one solution is especially useful in smaller vehicles, where there's no room to mount a separate amp, or in any vehicle where you need every bit of cargo space. 

The EL10A-HP 10"" amplified Bazooka lets you add ride-filling bass to your system with a minimum of hassle. It's an ideal solution if you want the thrill of powerful bass but don't want to make many modifications to your vehicle.

The EL10A-HP bass tube comes with a 10"" woofer and a built-in amp (100 watts max power)

Details: 
•10"" woofer with foam surround

You can depend on it! Lightning fast and reliable, shot after shot—in the world of single action revolvers Uberti's new hand-tuned Cattleman model is truly “the boss,” or El Patrón, as the Vaqueros of the old west would say. The gunsmiths at Uberti have fitted each El Patrón with high-grade, US-manufactured Wolff springs and each revolver has been carefully tested and certified for flawless fit and function. The result is a single-action that is reliable, lighter and faster with a smooth-tuned action.

You can read more specs at the website:  http://www.uberti.com/firearms/1873-cattleman-el-patron.php

Manufacture’s short video on this model: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRkjMv4cHPo

The MSRP on the gun is $589.  I have fired 12 rounds through the gun and it functioned perfectly.  

This gun is usually sold out and hard to come by.  They are selling them locally for about $500.  With tax, that would put you at $542.50.

I am asking $450 for it (which is a steal in my opinion if you can find one). I have the box, manual, and everything that came with it. It is a great deal at that price, essentially getting a custom tuned gun.  The case-hardening on it really looks nice.

Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing.

The LC9 won the 2011 Handgun of the year award by the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence.

Gun MSRP is $443 and comes with one magazine.  I bought a 2nd OEM Mag for this gun at $30.  I have put 100 rounds through the gun, testing 4 kinds of ammo and both mags.  It ran flawlessly.  

I won’t negotiate much, these guns are reliable and popular.  The cheapest around town is 349.99 for the gun and one mag.  The extra mag is $30.  With tax you’re looking at $412.29.  

I am asking $330 for the gun, including the extra mag and all the original accessories.  It comes in a box which includes a nice Ruger pistol zip-up pouch, two different bases for each magazine (one flat, one with finger extension), manual, lock, and warranty papers – so you will be able to fill out the warranty for yourself.

The only thing you must supply is your lower, or be able to purchase one as I am not an FFL.

I charge $75 per build. I guarantee my work and have done over 300 builds.

You supply me with a list of what you want, it can be as detailed or vague as you wish. I can guide you on parts or you may have exact parts you require.

I will put together a custom built list with prices for you. Custom builds can usually be completed in 2 to 4 weeks depending on parts and you will always get a better weapon and price than purchasing a factory assembled gun. 

A 20% deposit is required prior to build plus build fee, remainder due upon pick-up, no exceptions.

All I charge is cost of parts and my $75 fee. All weapons tested with target available upon pickup.

There are certain parts I will not use. Partial list includes composite lowers, non mil-spec items. I will build with used parts ONLY if you supply them.

The Model 37 Shotgun was one of Winchester's most popular guns of the last century, and remains today a very collectible, nostalgic, and sought after Winchester. These guns have a forged steel receiver and are of old fashioned quality. 
This is NOT the later '37a' Winchester and the only plastic part is the butt plate.
 This is the perfect gun for teaching the wife or a young gunner to hunt, and the longer barrel & full choke will reach out to small game or varmints. 
  I'd say it's about 70% finishwise, & a very solid shooter with strong ejection. With minimal care, it should last (another) lifetime.

I have a Like New Blaser Tactical 2 chambered in .338 Lapua that has had 20 rounds through it. Currently it just sits in the safe and doesn't get the use that it is meant for. If you're wanting to make a 1500 yard shot or further then THIS is the perfect rifle for you. Another great feature is the fact that you can change calibers on this rifle to other popular sniper rounds in under two minutes. The barrels and bolts needed are available online. Below is some good info about the rifle, and if you have ANY questions please feel free to ask.

***I'll consider a partial trade for top tier 1911 and/or AR***

The Tactical 2 is the most advanced version of the precision rifle developed by Blaser.
Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform
possible. Exceptional accuracy was one of the key principles during development, with
effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more, depending on caliber and
ammunition. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet
of design. The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull
action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking
groove in the barrel – the bolt head is auto-centering and self-headspacing. The straight
pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum
movement. The rifle can easily be converted for left or right hand shooters. Interchange
calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in under a minute, without special tools
and no change in accuracy. Barrels are cold hammer forged, fluted and plasma-nitrided to
provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is
fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting
systems. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake. The receiver is
machined from aircraft grade billet aluminum alloy and is the interface for the barrel, bolt

I purchased this light on a whim and have not used it except to play around with it. It has never been mounted on a gun. The batteries were charged only one time. This is an amazing light, super bright and lightweight. The specifications are below. Or you can check it out at the Kalrus website.

Comes with the box for the light, with all paperwork and accessories, the box for the charger and the case for the filter. The remote pressure switch and gun mount did not come with packaging.

Asking $100 (If you purchased everything new it would be about $175). Cash, FTF in the Littleton Area preferred. Not looking for any trades.

Specifically designed for military and self-defense applications, the Klarus XT11 outshines the competition with its extremely durable build, brilliant 600-lumen output, and stainless steel strike bezel that can be used to ward off attackers. Like its smaller cousin, the XT10, the XT11 uses Klarus's dual button tail switch that allows for one-handed control and easy access to its blinding strobe function. The strike bezel can also be unscrewed to attach other accessories like colored filters. If you want to weapon mount the XT11, it is fully compatible with the ED10 Remote Pressure Switch.

Just range, zoom and fire. Regardless of the distance—or the target’s size and shape—it’s like they’re standing right in front of you.


Accu-Ranger Reticle
As one of the first with bullet drop compensation, Redfield’s original Accu-Ranger pioneered the reticles we take for granted today. The new Accu-Ranger blends precise holdover points hunters need with a bold center that naturally leads the eye for fast shot placement at close quarters. 

The reticle comes with precise aiming points that work with most popular hunting loads. For many standard cartridges simply sight in at 200 yards with the center crosshair, and the remaining hold points are dialed in up to 500 yards. The bottom of the circle intersects the vertical crosshair at the 300-yard aim point, the dot is your hold for 400 yards, and the bottom post provides a 500-yard aiming point. For faster, magnum-caliber rifles shooting light bullets, you can sight in at 300 yards and have hold points for 400, 500, and 600 yards.

Action is silky smooth and timing is perfect. Lock up is tight with a light, smooth trigger pull. Bore is bright and shiny. The cylindar has a faint turn line.
Includes original blue plastic factory carrying case, case numbered to gun, with owner's manual. The gun has a light holster rub on the front near the trigger guard that I'm sure would buff out, and an idiot scratch at the 
handle on the left side right at the grip. I did it although I don't 
know how. I always thought a nice set of wood grips would completely hide it.
Please see the pictures for a better look, I tried to take 
the best pictures I could and circled the places mentioned above.

900,http://www.armslist.com/posts/591900,For Sale:  SOLD-Springfield Model 1873 Trapdoor Rifle  (1877),"Southport, Wilmington, North Carolina",$ 795,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 2, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Springfield US Model 1873 Rifle is in excellent condition
What I think I know about this Model 1873 Springfield Trapdoor rifle. 
I think the barrel and receiver are matching. On the barrel are the letters “F” above a “P” then further down on the receiver is a “P”. 
The ornate script ""P"" on the underside of the stock behind the butt-end of the trigger plate is the ""Firing Proof"" mark, often referred to as the ""Circled-P"" 
The ornate “ESA” cartouche on the stock means that Erskine S. Allin was the Master Armorer at the time of this rifles production. 
The serial number 74573 means that the weapon was made April-June of 1877. 
The initials “J.C ahead of the (P) are probably those of a worker in the stocking department. 
The price of $795.00 is to be paid in either cash or USPS money order only.
If I have to mail the rifle it will be $40 shipping. Normally the rifles ship for around $30 but every time mail a long rifle the cost is about $40"

Action is silky smooth and timing is perfect. Lock up is tight with a light, smooth trigger pull. Bore is bright and shiny. The cylindar has a faint turn line.
Includes original blue plastic factory carrying case, case numbered to gun, with owner's manual. The gun has a light holster rub on the front near the trigger guard that I'm sure would buff out, and an idiot scratch at the 
handle on the left side right at the grip. I did it although I don't

Nothing more, nothing less. For the price I'm offering, I could probably go to a gun store and buy a brand new one myself. But it's doubtful I'd be able to find the variety of guns in that store that I can find on ARMSLIST. Last time I checked, Vance's didn't carry a Beretta CX4 Storm semi-automatic rifle in their inventory. I was hoping to find a gun like that, too. Something special that has been well taken care of that is modern. Let's say, created and produced within the last ten years? Even if it's a remake of an old classic, as long as it's modern, accurate and something I can take to the shooting range and enjoy or even file for a concealed weapon license and use it as the gun I'll be holstering. My father has had several heart surgeries and most recently a tripler bypass, as far as I know, he's also looking for a gun that fits my description. So, I don't care if it's two matching guns or two separate guns, as long as they fall under the criteria of being worth what I'm asking, legally able to be registered as a concealed weapon and fairly high caliber. My Dad is unable to protect himself with his hands anymore and I work at his business.

So, here's what I'm after, two similar guns. Personally, I want a unique gun. My father just needs one for protection. I could stand to know more about guns, but I want something accurate for both guns. No one wants to ever have to fire a gun, but if you locate your business in a bad neighborhood, you never know what'll happen and that is what concerns me.

Thank you for your time."

Pix #1 In the late 1960's Israel ordered an unknown quantity of Armalite AR-7 22lr cal semi auto survival rifles. They made the various modifications pictured here, provided a canvas roll bag. The set was then strapped to the ejection seat in their fighter aircraft. A few years ago less than 200 of them were imported into the U.S.

Pix #2, Among the Israeli modifications was to shorten the barrel to 13 inches. Before the importer could re-sell the guns he had to attach the 3 inch simulated muzzle break to bring it back out to a legal minimum 16"".

Pix #3, Nearly all the changes made to the gun were done with pre-existing parts. Note the grip is for an FAL. Forward sling swivel is for an L1A1. I'm not sure what the canvas sling was used on but it is original to the gun.

Pix #4, Close up of the barrel just ahead of the chamber. Note the serial numbered on the barrel not done on factory Armalites. Also the importer's stamp under The Armalite address.(not shown)

Pix #5, Barrel removed & stock collapsed. Package length would have been 13"" had the 3"" barrel extension not been added for legality. Note the front sight, it's for a K98 Mauser!(not shown)

I purchased this pistol about 15 years ago to add to my 30 year collection of military firearms so as to have something representative of a German Luger. I have recently decided to get rid of everything that I don't actually use. This example was made by DWM, it has no chamber date. All serial numbers that I can see appear to be matching. Ser number 5**3. Grips appear original as does the blue which is very good. The magazine is a replacement. All toggle components are stamped 08. From what I've been able to learn this pistol has German Imperial military proof marks & as it is stamped on the left side ""Germany"" I believe it was imported after 1935. If there is any more information you can provide please do so.

I have decided tp liquidate everything from my 30+ year collection of military guns that I do not actually use.
