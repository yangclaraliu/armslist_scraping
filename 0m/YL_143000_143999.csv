The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters. From the very beginning of the design and development, computers have been used exclusively. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment.

The M22 brings you handling and performance that is closer to the modern defensive handgun than any other rimfire pistol. Designed for inexpensive high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern pistol practice.

The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a Lothar Walther match barrel, standard on all models, an extremely crisp, 4-lb single-action trigger and adjustable sights. The M22 is also the safest pistol on the market today with five safeties in every pistol.

All ISSC M22 pistols are finished with our proprietary Ti-clad, including the Two-Tone M22. The finish is comprised of the same chemical properties used by automobile manufacturers for exterior auto paint. This finish guarantees not only a very strong and even application, but protects your M22 pistol from all the elements that might otherwise harm the finish, including water, cleaning residues, gunpowders and other toxic chemicals. Our Two-Tone models are finished in a brilliant, titanium-white color, one of the newest and most advanced pigments on the market today.

 Barreled is marked CMP 5.56NATO 1/7, A2 Sights, Excellent Condition 
Lower is marked ""AR-15 A2"" ""GOV'T CARBINE"" 

Telescopic 3 position ""N"" marked stock 

C marked open carrier, MPC marked bolt. 

Magwell is very VERY nice. Hammer shows very light movement marks. Buffer assy is as-new.

Rifle has been fired, and based on years of AR use by me, Im saying very little. I will send detailed pictures of whatever areas you are concerned with.

I will not be held liable for whether or not the rifle is a preban, as Ive seen conflicting information. You need to verify this.

I would prefer a FTF transaction in or around the Dayton/Cincy/Springfield area. I will drive up to 1 hour to meet. If you want to meet me, I expect phone contact and you to be prompt.

FTF I accept only cash. Otherwise I accept check, USPS money order or cash if you are that daring. If you want the rifle shipped, I will use USPS, and charge whatever is fair, Im guessing $45.00 or so insured.

I am not a dealer, and do not wish to engage in semantics of Colt talk about this rifle. I realize the upper and lower are not a perfect match in color, and I realize I am unsure of roundcount.

I am semi-open to trades, but really want to just sell this. 

Just to be clear, I am not a dealer, and there will be no inspection period, no returns, and no Walmart mentality during our deal. I will photograph anything you want. I want you to be very happy with this rifle, like I am.

If you would like only the lower, $650 
Only the upper, no bolt/CH? $400 
Upper with bolt, complete? $500 
Only the lower, stripped? $595"

Wonderful collectors gun, and works great also even if you want to just have it as your gun to use.  Is a design similar to the 1911.
Must have a Nevada Drivers License and ""Mature"" purchasers ONLY.  No immature youth, gang bangers, etc.

Sorry the pictures are not clear, but the silver finish and pearl handles are clean and nice looking.  I took the pics with my digital camera, and tried twice and they both came out the same, so I don't know if it's some weird reflection of the silver plating that's blurring the pic or what.  Even made sure the camera was still.  Anyway, trust me, and you can look at it yourself if you want to come and see, it looks very nice.

BTW....  Yes, I know Star BM's can go from anywhere between $250-350 private party or retail.  But this is not a regular Star BM.  Silver plating is an over $100 job, as well as the addition of the Pearl Handles.  You simply aren't going to find this anywhere else.  You want the nice gun, you need to pay a little more for it.  I'm still not asking any more than a retail .22 or Highpoint 9 would cost, so people stop trying to take advantage."

I bought a Browning Silver Stalker 28"" Dura touch at JAX in Fort Collins back in February.  I've taken up competitive shooting and just bought a Citori so I need to sell this gun to help pay for that one.  I bought it for $1,100 so I am asking $900 but I will consider a reasonable offer.  It has not been shot very much and it includes 3 chokes (Full, IC, and MOD) and I also had a gunsmith install a HiViz comp sight so that's $60 for free right there.  If interested, I can also provide a breakdown case for $50."

It has the 14.5” chrome lined M4-type barrel with a permanently attached A3-style flash suppressor/compensator (unslotted on the bottom so that the gasses press down on the tip of the barrel and keep the muzzle from rising - it also helps keep the rifle from kicking up so much dust when the weapon is fired from the prone position) that yields a 16” overall length (BATF legal).

Barrel finish is mil-spec Manganese Phosphate for protection against corrosion and rust.

It comes with a MagPul handguard with internal aluminum shields to protect against heat build-up in rapid fire sequences.

The stock is a 6-position (not a cheap 4-position) collapsible with steel sling mount, and is fitted with a G.I. black nylon sling with metal hardware.

In addition, it comes with 3 black 30-round Thermold brand polymer magazines.

Purchased pistol 2 weeks ago, fired exactly 100 rounds through it and haven't been to the range since.  Fires fine, accurate even though it's not even close to broken in.  Will be a great pistol once it's been broken in properly.  Had plans to do light custom work and compete with it.  

Selling because my wonderful wife gave me a new Kimber as a wedding present.  Sadly, time to thin out the 1911's, and the one ""I'll get around to customizing some day"" is the one to get the axe.  

This pistol is basically brand new.  Have all original paperwork (of course) and box.  The only thing it needs is a swab ran down the barrel to be new again.  I didn't bother because it hasn't been fired enough.  

The only thing damaged is the Springfield special discount form, I had it filled out and ready to mail in when I received my gift.  My apologies if you had your heart set on a yellow piece of paper.

If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.""

""The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech® system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever.""

I paid $1650 for this shotgun and H&H gun range. The lowest you will ever find it on the internet is bud guns at $1353.00 plus $25 to transfer. This gun is practically brand new. Comes will 5 chokes, carrying case. I polished the barrel cause I like the look. Gun has less than 200 rounds through it. This gun functions perfectly with soft 1oz light loads!!! I am selling because I only shoot skeet with an over and under (too lazy to pick up shells). If you hunt then this is the gun to own!!!  Brady REDACTED"

I had originally posted this with a light/laser system, but sold that separately. 

The handgun is single or double action, compact, lightweight and comes with three high capacity magazines. It’s great for carrying concealed, and has been my personal carry piece for the last year. I recently picked up the same gun chambered in .357 Sig, so I'm selling this one. The P2000 is almost identical to the USP Compact, but with the added bonus of having a Glock style rail, ambidexterous slide release, and no manual safety. It uses the same magazine as the HK USP Compact 9mm (10 round standard capacity or 13 round high capacity).

This listing is for polishing of your barrel. After only 50 rounds the finish on your Glock barrel will begin to fade and look worn. It is simply a black coating that wears off. With this service you will eliminate this issue and only need to wipe off finger prints after your done at the range. Auction price is the same for all glock, XD, XDM, & 1911 barrels. I will remove all light scratches and leave it super bright. 

WILL MY BARREL RUST? NO


The Tenifer-treated slide and barrel
     Glock barrels and slides are made from quality steel which has been treated with a special ""Tenifer"" process.  This colorless carbo-nitrate formula enriches the steel with oxygen, sealing its pores.  Tenifer makes the steel extremely hard (as hard as industrial diamond on the Rockwell scale) and corrosion resistant.  The steel will not scratch or rust, period!  In fact, the slide is so hard you can use it to sharpen your knives.

     The barrel is treated both inside and out.  Because of this, Glock barrels do not show the normal wear associated with untreated barrels by other manufacturers.  Glock, Inc., has one barrel which has fired one million rounds and still works; another has fired 300,000 rounds and still shoots better than 1½"" groups!

     Glock also parkerizes the slide and barrel to give them a matte black color.  While the parkerizing might wear off showing ""bare"" steel beneath, the Tenifer is still there.  In fact, it penetrates the steel to a depth of three microns.  Even a Glock which has lost all of its matte black finish is still scratch- and rust-proof."

It also has the aluminum hand guard, swivels and a very nice leather target sling.  It does not have target sights but does have a 20 mOA scope base.  This rifle has proved to be extremely accurate over the 200-1000 yard range.  It can be used for NRA High Power ""Across the Course"" matches and for F-Class matches.  I have used Black Hills 175 grain target ammunition for this rifle and have been very pleased with its performance.

Gun was purchased on 25 May 2011 at Chaffee Outfitters for $515 out the door. 
Original purchase came with original box, 2 - 12 round magazines, 3 backstraps, and papers.

I purchased two extra 12 round magazines at $35 each = $70.
I only have this gun for about a week and I'm wanting a full size handgun.
I got a new Glock 23 Gen 4 as my new conceal carry handgun so there is no need for me to have another conceal carry gun.

I only fired 50 rounds since ownership and it is very accurate and reliable, shoots point of aim. Trigger is smooth 6.5 pound trigger pull, not gritty. 

I keep all of my firearms in prestine mint condition. 

In Summary:
M&P9C = $515
Extra 2 - 12 round mags = $70
Overall Total = $585

Asking Sell Price = $500
Trade Value = $550

I believe my cash price is fair since I am throwing in two extra magazines worth $35 each and I had only fired 50 rounds. Hardly any signs of use. Basically you're saving money on sales tax and extra mags. I will throw in a Tagua Leather Outside Waist Band Holster worth $35.

I put about 50 rounds through it at most, so it's in near new condition.  It has a Branch Custom Weaponry billet lower with GI trigger and Magpul trigger guard, Magpul MOE grip, Vltor Buffer tube and Magpul CTR stock.  The upper is a Vltor MUR-1 with a Youngs chrome BCG.  The barrel is the DPMS match 18 inch SPR barrel (very accurate) with a YHM 12 inch free floating rail.  The BUIS are Troy folding sights and there's a Smith Vortex flash hider.

Price it all out and you'll see that this is a pretty good deal for all of these premium parts.  The rifle is very accurate and shoots so smooth with it's rifle length gas system.

I may be interested in trades or partial trades for 1911's or other firearms (berettas, HK's, other AR stuff).  Just drop me a line and tell me what you got.  I have several hi-rez photos that I can email out, just let me know.

Built for pure performance and extreme use, the new Special Forces pistol from Ed Brown has everything you need for serious performance. All the engineering, precision manufacturing, and hand-fitting the Brown family is famous for is included, and we've added to that a new severe use coating for improved wear resistance and rust protection. A unique and highly durable Chainlink pattern provides a secure grip for severe applications.
The Special Forces features the following:

   * 5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy.
   * Weight: approximately 38 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.
   * Exclusive Chainlink treatment on forestrap and mainspring housing for the ultimate in durability, secure grip, and extreme use.
   * Slide coated with Gen III for low glare, superior rust protection, and improved wear resistance, with traditional ""square cut"" serrations on rear of slide only.
   * Fixed dovetail 3-dot night sights with high visibility white outlines.

This gun is in great condition and includes two magazines the bag and paperwork, it includes the factory grips and there are aftermarket grips on the gun.  I am the original owner of this firearm.  Safety is single side.  There is a small area where the finish came off due to a loose plunger tube - it is not very noticeable and pluger tube was properly re-staked (see pictures).  This gun has less than 700 rounds through the gun and is an excellent shooter.

959,http://www.armslist.com/posts/143959,"For Sale:  Rare,hard to find, 100 rd. metal drum for AK47/Mak90","Guthrie, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 225,"Listed On: Saturday, July 30, 2011",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Selling a pre ban one hundred rd. metal drum mag, fits AK 47 style rifles.
    New AK47 drum still in plastic wrap with instructions sheets. Holds 100 rounds of 7.62x39 ammo. This uncommon drum holds 25 more round of ammo than the popular 75 round drum. Since the quantity of 100 round drums imported before 1994 was much less than 75 round
drums, it is geting very hard to find these drums now (it
can be confirmed by checking local shows and different
related internet boards).This could be your last chance to own of 
these highly collectable drums.Sell it a few years from now for double or triple your money, since there are no more and wont be any more imported.Sold three, have one left.Cash sale only

The drum fits the majority AK 47 variants 7.62x39 caliber currently available on the market, including (might miss a few variants) all Norinco and Polytech, Romanian WUM1 and SAR1 (except 991, which is discontinued), all Bulgarian, Hungarian (except SA-2000), MADDI, and almost all current ""Preban Style"" pistol grip AK variants made with US parts and foreign parks. As a rule of thumb, if the rifle can accept any 30 round double stack magzine, it can accept this drum. If the instruction says it uses a ""SINGLE STACK magzine"", then it is not. The Norinco AK drum is very reliable (used in the military 7.62 light machine gun a Chinese version of Russian RPK light machine gun) and convenient to load as experienced by many AK rifle and Norinco drum users/owners. It differes from and has advantages over the Russian/East German 75 round drum in 2 ways: 1) for Russian/E. German 75 round drum, one round is loaded every time from the feed lip top (need to load 75 times) just like a 30 round magzine, for the Norinco drum the back cover of the drum can be opened, 100 rd ammo can be quickly directly loaded and the cover then closed; 2) When loaded,the drum spring is under tension, as suggested by many, the spring may get weaken after loaded for extended period of time. For this  drum, it can be fully loaded withoud winding the spring. Right before use, quickly wind the drum key about 5 turns and it is ready to go. With this mechanism, the drum can be fully loaded and ready for use, but the spring tension is only applied right before use, no worry about drum spring fatigue. Function wise, the Norinco drum is superior than the Russian/E.G. drum, not to mention there is no 100 round Russian/E.G. drums (only 75 round drum). Drum is still sealed in plastic wrap in grease.
With the current climate, it is for sure NO more drums will be imported and can not be manufactured, that is why it is getting harder to have, its value appreciates fast, and be more expensive in the future.  $225 is cheap!!

Benelli’s SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun sight. At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova Tactical isn’t just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums.

The SuperNova Tactical comes with either rifle sights or newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights. The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation. Optional three-dot tritium inserts can be easily installed. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. Butt stock options include a tactical pistol grip stock, or the ComforTech® stock. The top of the SuperNova’s receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics.

Asking $600.  Not pressed to sell, so please be serious about purchase.  Free case of ammo if I get my asking price.  Have valid id and be willing to sign a bill of sale."
