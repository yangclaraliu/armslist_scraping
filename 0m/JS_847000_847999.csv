This has been a great truck that can do anything. Tires are a little over a year old and they are Hankook Dynapro 285/75/R16 with lots of tread left. The bumpers are Rand Hand and the rear bumper is the heavy duty one with the pipe in it, not the smaller sport bumper. It has a bed-liner, step up rail running boards, and added fenders, wind deflectors on the windows, and tint. There is a 10 disc CD changer too. I also added a 2 chamber flowmaster muffler and K&N air filter.With the smaller engine and 5-speed you get great gas mileage!!! 30 gallon tank and it still has that grunt sound when you step on the gas. The truck does show signs of use...it is a 1997. The tint on the back window is peeling off, the radio does not work, the steering wheel needs a new cover, the right window deflector has a piece missing, there is a small dent in front of the rear right side wheel well. The driver seat has a small tear on the side. Behind the seats is a nice compartment area with shelves and netting. The paint is scratched in spots from being used, but over all this is a great truck that has never failed me. I am the original owner and bought it new from a dealer in Georgia. If you are looking for a great work truck, Hunting truck, etc.. this is perfect. I have used this as my everyday driving vehicle."

Tow/Ski Pylon on the back of the boat for water-skiing/wakeboarding/watertubing (adjustable trim so not to roostertail your kids/friends/family New Rebuilt Jetovater Jet Pump Cost $3000.00 New Bassett Pressure T-Valve to operates H2O to Bassett Twistie Racing Headers (Wet). On/Off T-Valve with Bassett Pressure T-Valve for Bassett Twistie Racing Headers New Carpet - I think one of the sides needs to be sealed again I will fix this if I get sometime. New Battery (2 Months Old) (This is a 1976' Sanger Bubble Deck Super - Jet. These go-fast boats were no equipped with any running lights or night running lights, however you can equip the boat with them if you want.) Removable Plug for Water Outlet.

Boat WILL put up a 150ft - 200ft + Rooster-Tail and truly IS FAST. I have GPS clocked the boat at Lake El Capitan at 95 MPH without pushing the boat and I also ran out of lake room. I am very certain that the boat WILL go 100+ MPH. I have never been able to max out the boat to truly see how fast it will run or pushed it to its max.

Boat has NO Fading of the fiberglass, the hull does have normal scrapes, and faults from trailering remember this is a 1976 boat. The boat is burgundy red and white with brown leather interior. This boat is a 75' Sanger Bubble Deck Super - Jet. The boat is GREAT condition overall. I would keep the boat however I hardly get the time to use the boat. I am selling because it is time for another toy. Whenever I trailer or have this boat out on the water I get comments from gas stations to chilling on the water open day. This boat is loud and lopes heavy. The only thing is boat needs is to have passenger co-captain seat cushion re-upholstered (If I get time, I will get this done, however my job keeps me very busy) and the boat could use a wash/buff. This boat is a flat - bottom 1976' Sanger Bubble Deck Super - Jet and it CAN and WILL turn on a DIME if you want.

The boat runs and operates strong is truly is a turn key boat with NO problems whatsoever besides the minor co-captain cushion needing re-upholstered.

The buyer/new owner will be extremely happy.

I am asking $16,000 for the boat. I have invested $16,000+ in the block alone, $5,000 in the Bassett Wet Headers, $3000 in re-built Jetovater Jet Pump, and $3000 recent maintenance and performance parts, $500+ in 4 new tires, re-packed hubs with lots of things that I'm leaving out when the motor was built. Also has new custom chrome motor mounts. $27,500+ invested in this boat so far. If you want a truly FAST Super-Jet flat bottom this IS your boat, or maybe you don't always want to fly across the lake, perfect for a 5 - 6 person family boat.. with the performance to stomp on any and all boats on the water. (Unless your at a river rat race) My loss is someone ease's gain and I truly hope that this boat will see more water time than I can give it. These boats average sell price for my setup between $18-38K online there are many river rat racing super - jets flat bottom boats online. Buyer MUST pick-up locally in San Diego, CA will NOT ship under all circumstances sorry. Winner will have a amazing boat setup for fly across the water tow water tubes, wakeboards, waterski, or fish. This boat can operate in 6"" inches of water, seats 5 or 6 people, captain, co-captain, and bench seat 3 or 4 people in the back. I am the second owner of this boat. The boat was from Corona, CA. It is now located in San Diego, CA. I just spent $3000 having the boat updated and ready for the water. I had block and boat professional looked at, at TheBoatGrotto here in San Diego where I had the fly wheel replaced, starter, professional racing Mercuriser racing full-synthetic motor oil put in and a Mercruiser racing oil filer, new racing spark plugs. The boat is for sale locally, and I reserve the right to end the auction early. Winner bidder MUST pick up the boat locally. I have both Certificate Of Ownership Titles for boat and trailer in hand: State of California: Boat: (528080703AC) Trailer: (528080703AC)"

I just recently got the Kimber Super carry Pro and it is very nice. Maybe around 300-500 rds through it. The Desert Eagle was bought from a retired Cop and has had around 200-300 rds through it. Looking to trade for a Gen 4 Glock 19/23 and 1950.00 to boot. A very nice set of guns and the price and trade is what I really want to get out of them. Shoot an offer and we can go from there. I would really like to get another Gen 4 Glock back. I would sell the D/E for 1100.00 and the Kimber for 1275.00 Thanks.

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.



The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).


 The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. 

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. 

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. 

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs. 

The Bushmaster A2/A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are shipped complete with 30 round magazine, safety and operational manual, and carry sling.

I purchased this gun around 1990. Fired 100 rounds at the time and then put it in the safe until this month. Took it to the range and fired 50 rounds and cleaned it for sale. I'd rather someone owns it who wants to either shoot it more or add to their collection. It's a fine weapon. It did not come with a case or manual, so I don't have these to include.

Prefer the sale to complete at the Oak Tree Gun Club FFL in Santa Clarita, but I am willing to go to your FFL if it's within a reasonable distance. Buyer to pay the FFL and DROC fees.

The AR platform guns are available at regular prices at Walmart, fleet farm and local sporting or gun stores. Just be vigilant and have cash in hand. You will find one.

Only other trade that would be considered would be a semi-auto pistol but a shotgun would be ideal.

It has been filled to capacity and fired twice which means 200 rounds have been through it. although KCI states that this particular model CAN be stored loaded I prefer not to so I store it unloaded.

It works great and has not had an issue yet. Please don't contact me if your unable to own firearms legally, if your unstable, or if you are about to commit a crime with it. Pick  this up now before Obama passes a law making new manufacture of them illegal and drives the price up even further.

Matching Luger P08 from the last year of the Great War for sale or trade! This luger has markings from WWI, the Weimer republic and the barrel is a factory replacement during WWII and eagle mark/forced stamped to match. No import mark anywhere or rebluing and the barrel is in very good condition.

Looking to trade for high end guns and i can add cash/guns to even the trade. Please, keep your DPMS and Olympic and Delton AR15 to yourself. Im sick of seeing these ridiculous prices on ARs, how long do you think it will be before the bubble burst on the AR market? As soon as the manufacturers ramps up their production post SHOT-Show the supply will catch up to demand and prices will plummet

off my soap box now, this is an honest, matching luger with almost 95 years of history, i will add more pics as they came along but you will have to see/hold the pistol to appreciate what it has gone through"

Just shoot me an email with what you've got and preferably a phone number to contact you back at thank you. I would like to stay around $300.00 or so. thanks and God bless

I WILL TRADE THEM FOR 25 (TWENTY FIVE)- 30 RND PMAGS, NEW, BLACK PREFERRED, WITH OR WITHOUT WINDOWS.

IF YOU WANT THE 1900 WITH THE 50 CAL CAN THEN I WANT 42 OF YOUR PMAGS. 30 ROUNDERS ONLY!!!!!

WE ALL KNOW A DOLLAR A ROUND IS COMMON ON GUN BROKER, LGS, ETC. WE ALSO KNOW PMAGS ARE PUSHING $40 A PIECE.

YOU LIKE THE 50 CALIBUR TALL BOY CAN IN THE BOX?, WELL IT IS CRAMMED FULL WITH 1900 ROUNDS (95 BOXES), BRING ME 50 OF YOUR PMAGS AND YOU CAN TAKE IT ALL! THE AMMO, THE CAN AND THE DESSICANT.

I CAN MEET IN THE CHARLOTTE AREA, 15 MILE RADIUS FROM INDIAN TRAIL NC, ANYTIME TODAY FROM 9AM-5PM. MY WIFE ISN'T AS PASSIONATE ABOUT MY HOBBY SO PAST 5PM IS A NO GO.

REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU VALUE YOUR PMAGS AT, RETAIL OR WHOLESALE, IF YOU VALUE THE AMMO THE SAME WAY YOU WILL SEE THIS IS ACTUALLY A FAIR AND NORMAL DEAL.

NO  NEGOTIATION, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. NOT TRYING TO BE A DICK BUT JUST NOT WANTING TO WASTE ANYONE'S TIME.

The P239 is well suited for concealed carry or use as a backup gun.  It is a Single Action/Double Action with a de-cocking lever.  The SAS Gen 2 designation means that this weapon was upgraded by the Sig custom shop.  The changes made involve rounding the square/sharp edges (dehorning) of the P239 so that the pistol won’t catch on clothing, etc when used for concealed carry.  This gun is chambered for 357 Sig, which makes it an excellent bad-guy stopper.  It is equipped with factory night sights and they still glow bright.  In addition to the 2-7 round mags included with the pistol I purchased and am including 3-8 round extended mags.  I also purchased a snappy leather holster for it that is included as well.  The gun is barely used and in excellent condition.  No ammunition is included.  Any reasonable offer considered.

I purchased this gun as my ultimate concealed carry piece after doing a lot of research.  I haven’t been able to put it to use for this purpose because I’ve invested so much time and energy into training with a different weapon system that it would be pointless to try and master both.

I like guns - I put them in a safe and shoot them from time to time.  UPDATE:  Posted a picture of the bike today - don't be fooled by my stellar photography skills - there is plenty of rust on the chrome that needs to be blasted off or replaced and there is a little bit of paint scraped off the tail light but other than that it is cosmetically and mechanically sound (minus the new starter-gear and obligatory carb tuning).

The Upper came as one piece from Palmetto State Armory (PSA).  The Lower also came from PSA in a kit.  The stripped lower receiver was purchased from PSA, but is a ATI Omni.  Only thing they had when I bought it.  Works great, every part fit together like a charm.   The rear sight and the 30 round mag are from Magpul.  The H2 buffer was purchased from Bravo Company.  The standard buffer is not strong enough for a 16"" carbine.

 Copied from an online vendor:

 Old game, new tactics. The internal focusing Yukon NVRS Tactical 2.5x50 mm Gen 1 Night Vision Riflescope 26014T will make sure your game doesn't play games with you. This Night Vision Riflescope is equipped with a dual focus that is controlled by an internal focusing knob located near the 50 mm front objective lens with flip-up cap so you can adjust the clarity and focus on short range objects while still having long range capability. The internal focusing mechanism, combined with fully multicoated optics, give increased clarity right to the edges of the 15 degree field of view and make bore sighting easier. So now, target acquisition at multiple distances is not just a roll of the dice; it's more a roll of the internal focusing knob. The rubber eye cup's oblique shape is not only comfortable, but acts as a shield to keep the green glow of the Generation 1 Night Vision unit hidden from animal and observers and to protect the lens from dirt and dust. Your target will come out and play because he won't know you're there. 

A black, military grade titanium body houses the Yukon Certified, hand-selected, high-res image intensifier tube. The Yukon NVRS Tactical 2.5x50 Generation 1 Night Vision Rifle Scope 26014T also features a weaver rail mount system, making it perfect for your AR-15.

 Yukon's exclusive PULSE IR illuminator extends viewing range 2 to 3 times farther than standard IR illuminators and increases viewing ability on nights when no ambient light is available. The unique pulsating frequency of the PULSE IR prolongs battery life an incredible 30-50 hours using only 2 - AA Batteries while the infrared light will reflect off the pupils of your target up to 75 yards away, making it easier to spot game at night. Perfect for low-light or no-light situations, when using the Tactical 2.5x50 by Yukon yours will not be a trivial pursuit.

 The illuminated red-on-green reticle has an adjustable brightness control that can be dimmed for a clear view while scanning for your next opponent or lit for extra brightness when there is little or no ambient light available; be sure to put your game face on.

 All switches are designed to be easily used while wearing gloves and to reduce hand cramps, and a remote ""on/off"" switch can easily be placed on your rifle stock for the least movement before shooting or nearby for easy access. 

Covered by Yukon Limited Lifetime Warranty, the reliability of this Riflescope is so incredible you will never have to rely on the luck of the draw. See Warranty Information for details.

Here is basically a new Painball Marker. I bought this earlier this year and we played one time and that was in February. Othere than that this gun has not been used. It has had less than 1000 paintballs through it. I gave $230.00 plus bought 2 extra CO canisters for it at $30.00 each. This has the e-grip which shoots either single shot rounds, 3 round burst or you can set it to Fully Auto or Fully Auto Fast. The fully auto difference is approx. 12-15 balls a second or 15-17 balls a second on the fully auto settings. This gun is very accurate and gives no problems. I am sure if you see it you will like it. 

In the photo I did not include the mask but the mask is also included.

My objective is to turn it into a Bullpup with a conversion kit.  That being said, the barrel cannot be ribbed, and the price has to be reasonable.  Barrel length doesn't matter, but prefer 18.5.

If you have an 870 already converted, I may consider that as well.

I have 3 guns that I will use for trade interest... 1 - Remington Model 11 Sportsman 20 gauge / 2 - Winchester 22 LR (rare tubular magazine) / 3 - Savage (blot action) 22 LR.

Details on Upper:
Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system.   The A2 lighter weight profile barrel allows for better balance and portability over the standard A2 profile and is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.  This is not a ""pencil"" barrel.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring T-marks, but no logo, these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.
Each upper is assembled to order with US-made parts, and test fired to check gas function.

No jams at all. I could just imagine attaching my 75 round AK mag through this. I am not being opportunistic with the price unlike others. I am selling it for what I paid for it. This is the shortest AK made bar none. The muzzle nut is spot welded to the threaded barrel. All I have done besides clean it is purchase but not install a sling swivel that I will sell for $25, what I paid for it. Comes with 2 thirty round magazines and a issue tool kit. No trades! Currently for sale at a local gun shop on consignment so I'd hate to see what my FFL buddy is asking for it. These dealers get under my skin sometimes. Florida drivers license and CCW needed. Also, you may be asked to have your name run through a criminal name check because I'd rather not sell it then sell it to a nut job with mayhem on their mind!"

It was produced by the historic Suhl factory which fell into Russian hands after the ""iron curtain"" came down. East German firearms are unheard of except for a few VOPO (People's Police) Lugers and this standardized 9mm Makarov. The finish is excellent dark blue with extra magazine and original holster. This was made in a country that does not exist any more. After the Wall came down a small amount of these trickled in until surplus EG weapons were given to the variou sides in the Balkan Civil War. These pistols are amazingly accurate and I hope I don't have to sell it.
No trades. Florida DL and CCW holders only. Perfect pocket pistol. 500."

I wonder about the rationale here. A nut job whose dimwitted overprivileged mother takes this creep kid of hers and teached him to shoot and play violent video games? Legal guns, a mother's love extinguished in a few seconds and this deranged sicko goes on a killing spree. Gee, violent video games, probably movies too, and law abiding citizens pay the piper because the Commander in chief sheds some crocodile tears to get his anti gun legislation passed...Doesn't he realize that the second amendment was partly written so politicians like him couldn't run roughshod over our rights? Try muzzling the 1st amendment; the press would foam at the mouth. Resist the government! It is our duty! Sorry, just had to get that off my chest. Anyway, this pistol is like new and small.
