No marks that I can find on it.  Very, very low round count...less than one box!
I do not have the original box, but if a buyer wants a box for the rifle, I will include a Colt LE6920 box.

Based on the legendary original Colt M4, this .22 Long Rifle carbine sports German quality & craftsmanship.

The Colt M4 .22 looks and feels like an actual M4, creating one of the most exciting .22 caliber firearms available.  Engineered from the ground up as a dedicated .22 rimfire, this AR style Colt features a 16.2-inch barrel, collapsible stock, flat-top receiver with detachable carry handle, CAR handguards, flash hider, A2 pistol grip, and 30-round magazine.

A tactical .22 rifle like this Colt is ideal for new shooters who are learning handling and operation. A gun like this Colt .22 M4, M4 Ops, as well as the Colt M16 .22 can have many uses-plinking, target practice and small-game hunting where allowed....all of which offer an economical shooting option.

Local Only FTF with valid FOID Card...No Shipping Please.
I have been asked several times for a selling price and since these are getting kind of scarce, I have decided to offer this for sale or trade.
Cash price is $600
I also have a few hundred new and unopen 5.56 and 9mm round for the perfect trade.
Again...FTF with FOID only

Assembled just before Thanksgiving is complete as shown with an A2 upper and fore-stock and a collapsible rear/butt stock. It has an M4 style Shaw .300 cal. barrel threaded end with flash suppressor. Comes with one PMAG magazine. These are a really nice caliber weapon in that they can fire supersonic or subsonic rounds and can be successfully silenced with qualified ATF legal suppressors. (Google/U-tube.) It is a much more substantial impacting round that carries well and flat with penetration at distance. It is a round that is currently under research by our military to give our troops the needed fire power that the .223 caliber lacks and to stand up to the AK fire power. Google the AAC .300 Blackout and read up on the pro's and con's, the more I learn and the longer the search goes on for a better round than the .223 the .300 Blackout is most likely going to get the nod and be a staple in our military and cost will come down. 
Another nice thing about this caliber is that nothing else on this rifle needs to be changed to allow it fire the 5.56 ammo other than the barrel. Everything else is the same including the magazines. So nothing other than the barrel needs to be changed and you would have the equivalent of 2 rifles. One (.300) that has stopping power and penetration while the other (5.56) would have the ability to fire the cheaper ammo. If you wanted to make it truly a quick change rifle you would need another upper with 5.56 barrel then to change from calibers it would literally only take seconds to change out the upper assembly with barrel using the 2 push pins that secure it to the lower. That quick and easy.
This is a nice quality Del-Ton lower with DPMS trigger kit and DPMS bolt carrier group and a  Shaw brand barrel.

Sold as shown with one 30rd magazine.

Or you can buy it with the other barrel included. That barrel is a USA made  (GRG mfg.) Carbine  16"" Stainless Steel 5.56 Nato (.223 also ) with M4 ramps it is .750 dia. and it is a fluted barrel. This barrel, as is the entire rifle, is BRAND NEW NEVER FIRED.

I will include the barrel with the complete rifle  for
                                                                $2200.00
You will now have the best of both worlds with the .300 Blackout barrel for deer hunting or just more stopping power AND the more popular AR15 ammo the .223/5.56 Nato barrel. That caliber ammo is much more common and cheaper to fire. Great for target plinking and all around caliber.

Really want a great package buy another upper receiver and parts kit attach the 5.56 Barrel and now you can quick change from the .300 blackout to the 5.56 in just a few seconds. Pull the 2 take down pins and swap out the completed uppers and away you go. That simple, that quick.

Buy it now before it gets away and any ban goes into effect. Before any background checks and further registration laws go into effect as I'm certain it will cost more to buy and sell guns from this day forward.
Cash Sale.

CAMPANION is constructed from the same 0170-6C carbon steel at RC58-59, which gives you a knife that is easy to sharpen and still holds a good edge.

I write this knowing full well that there are plenty of good, intelligent and logical men and women out there that are looking to buy, sell or trade their weapons on this wonderful website. To those people I truly wish you the best in your search for the perfect weapon, whatever that may be. As soon as I can find two pistols duct taped to a rifle duct taped to a flame thrower, I will count myself among those that have found the perfect gun. Unfortunately there are some real dumbasses out there. Maybe calling these people dumbasses is a little much but overkill is under rated. And the people that post some of the bullshit that goes up on this site deserve to be called that. A spade is a spade after all. 

Why the hell is everyone so damn vague with their postings? I swear that some of these seem like you started a post, made a ham sandwich, ate said sandwich and then came back to the post but couldn't quite remember what you were thinking in the first place. If your posting title says you want a 9mm, 40, 45 or 380, please remember that when you write that you only want a high caliber shooting handgun and don't want anything less than a 9mm. Last I checked a 380 was smaller than a 9 so take the additional two seconds it takes to do some damn proof reading. And don't get all over zealous with what you want because a 9mm isn't exactly a high caliber round there genius. 

What deserves to be described with the word ""custom"". If you put a few things that you picked up at your local gun store on your rifle or pistol and it did not require a professional in any way, or you are not a professional gunsmith yourself, then you do not have an item that should be called custom. A fucking glock with a high cap magazine or a piece of shit NC Star laser does not qualify your gun as something that is, or probably ever will be, custom. Just because it's custom to you does not mean it's custom to the rest of the gun community. ""One of a kind"", ""decked out"", ""tricked out"" and countless other descriptive terms should be stricken as well. Unless you know for a fact that your gun is in fact one of a kind, don't say that shit. Do some research before you go all out over-exaggerating what you've got.  God only knows how many ""one of a kind"" straight from the factory rifles there are out there but I'm willing to bet that there are way more than your taking credit for.

Sniper scopes. Jesus Christ, there is no such thing as a sniper scope. Only when a scope is mounted to a weapon that is in the hands of an actual trained sniper could your scope be considered a sniper scope. We get it, your really great at sniping digital terrorists in call of duty or you hit a target that was really far away that one time, but if your not a sniper then you don't have a sniper scope. Just say what you've got and let that be that. Not need to try to make what you have sound cooler than what it is. Most of the people reading your ad have a google search page opened up to see what it is anyway so chances are they will figure it out. If your not a sniper do not use sniper as a description for your gun or optics.

To go along with ""sniper rifles"" and ""sniper scopes"", the word ""tactical"" is getting a little fucking ridiculous. Just because you saw it in a movie being used by a military bad ass, your weapon is just a weapon. How it is employed makes it tactical. The other day I read an ad for a ""tactical"" airsoft gun and wanted to punch through my living room windows for that genius display of dumb ass adjective word association. If your not using your gun to clear rooms, breach doorways or any other activity that would need a tactical approach, then drop the word tactical from the description. 

Over pricing. Seriously, I understand wanting to make money, but come the fuck on. I saw a guy post a Sig rifle that retails brand new almost 1000 less than what he initially posted it for. This website is intended to help people network to find guns they want, not to pad your wallet. Just because there's some idiot out there that will pay too much for something doesn't mean they should. It's borderline unethical to take advantage of the people out there that either don't know any better or don't care about spending more money than they should. 

While the world is riddled with all sorts of problems, this site usually offers far more solutions than problems. If I offended you, well, I don't apologize because you probably fit into one of the previously mentioned categories and you need to learn how to post an ad on this site. That or you need to stop over compensating for what you have. To anyone that I've enlightened or anyone that expresses the same feelings as I do then I hope this benefits each and everyone of you. Even the people that want to talk up their ""one of a kind, tricked out, tactical custom AR15 sniper rifle"" because every sniper in the world knows that something that shoots .223 is a real game changer in the sniper community. 

If you are offended by any of this then you probably posted some dumb shit up here at one point or another and this just makes you realize how dumb it was in the first place and for that I do not apologize. I apologize to everyone that had to read it in the first place. Please everyone, help make a change. Thanks"

Look if you want it great, if your still unsure or your waiting to talk to your wife let me know when you have decided. If this listing is active then yes I have it. No I'm not looking for trades, specially if they are worth less, I'm not desperate to sell or get rid of it. I get so many emails and text messages to see if I have it then nothing?? So I hope this sums it all up for those confused if its for sale or what my ""best price is"". Not trying to be a dick, just gets old. Thanks"

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 AAC Blackout comes in two different configurations no sights or fixed front/rear sights.

The 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-suppressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions.  The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-suppressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.  Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-suppressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

I write this knowing full well that there are plenty of good, intelligent and logical men and women out there that are looking to buy, sell or trade their weapons on this wonderful website. To those people I truly wish you the best in your search for the perfect weapon, whatever that may be. As soon as I can find two pistols duct taped to a rifle duct taped to a flame thrower, I will count myself among those that have found the perfect gun. Unfortunately there are some real dumbasses out there. Maybe calling these people dumbasses is a little much but overkill is under rated. And the people that post some of the bullshit that goes up on this site deserve to be called that. A spade is a spade after all. 

Why the hell is everyone so damn vague with their postings? I swear that some of these seem like you started a post, made a ham sandwich, ate said sandwich and then came back to the post but couldn't quite remember what you were thinking in the first place. If your posting title says you want a 9mm, 40, 45 or 380, please remember that when you write that you only want a high caliber shooting handgun and don't want anything less than a 9mm. Last I checked a 380 was smaller than a 9 so take the additional two seconds it takes to do some damn proof reading. And don't get all over zealous with what you want because a 9mm isn't exactly a high caliber round there genius. 

What deserves to be described with the word ""custom"". If you put a few things that you picked up at your local gun store on your rifle or pistol and it did not require a professional in any way, or you are not a professional gunsmith yourself, then you do not have an item that should be called custom. A fucking glock with a high cap magazine or a piece of shit NC Star laser does not qualify your gun as something that is, or probably ever will be, custom. Just because it's custom to you does not mean it's custom to the rest of the gun community. ""One of a kind"", ""decked out"", ""tricked out"" and countless other descriptive terms should be stricken as well. Unless you know for a fact that your gun is in fact one of a kind, don't say that shit. Do some research before you go all out over-exaggerating what you've got.  God only knows how many ""one of a kind"" straight from the factory rifles there are out there but I'm willing to bet that there are way more than your taking credit for.

Sniper scopes. Jesus Christ, there is no such thing as a sniper scope. Only when a scope is mounted to a weapon that is in the hands of an actual trained sniper could your scope be considered a sniper scope. We get it, your really great at sniping digital terrorists in call of duty or you hit a target that was really far away that one time, but if your not a sniper then you don't have a sniper scope. Just say what you've got and let that be that. Not need to try to make what you have sound cooler than what it is. Most of the people reading your ad have a google search page opened up to see what it is anyway so chances are they will figure it out. If your not a sniper do not use sniper as a description for your gun or optics.

To go along with ""sniper rifles"" and ""sniper scopes"", the word ""tactical"" is getting a little fucking ridiculous. Just because you saw it in a movie being used by a military bad ass, your weapon is just a weapon. How it is employed makes it tactical. The other day I read an ad for a ""tactical"" airsoft gun and wanted to punch through my living room windows for that genius display of dumb ass adjective word association. If your not using your gun to clear rooms, breach doorways or any other activity that would need a tactical approach, then drop the word tactical from the description. 

Over pricing. Seriously, I understand wanting to make money, but come the fuck on. I saw a guy post a Sig rifle that retails brand new almost 1000 less than what he initially posted it for. This website is intended to help people network to find guns they want, not to pad your wallet. Just because there's some idiot out there that will pay too much for something doesn't mean they should. It's borderline unethical to take advantage of the people out there that either don't know any better or don't care about spending more money than they should. 

While the world is riddled with all sorts of problems, this site usually offers far more solutions than problems. If I offended you, well, I don't apologize because you probably fit into one of the previously mentioned categories and you need to learn how to post an ad on this site. That or you need to stop over compensating for what you have. To anyone that I've enlightened or anyone that expresses the same feelings as I do then I hope this benefits each and everyone of you. Even the people that want to talk up their ""one of a kind, tricked out, tactical custom AR15 sniper rifle"" because every sniper in the world knows that something that shoots .223 is a real game changer in the sniper community. 

If you are offended by any of this then you probably posted some dumb shit up here at one point or another and this just makes you realize how dumb it was in the first place and for that I do not apologize. I apologize to everyone that had to read it in the first place. Please everyone, help make a change. Thanks"

It is a Mongoose Pro Massif. I bought it used, but put A LOT of time and parts into her. The decals are showing some wear, and at one point I was planning on removing them to give the bike a clean silver look. Has a Rock Shox SID racing front fork (going for close to $700 online, even used), which is air, not spring. I love the bike, but I just never find myself riding it. It is a hardtail as well. Has Avid brakes on it that seem to have more stopping power than most discs I have used, including hydraulics, and I am hard to stop at about 230 pounds. Haha and last time I weighed it she came in to the 24 pound mark if I remember right. Which can be leightened even more by lighter tubes/tires, and a better wheelset. 

Some things I added/upgraded by a profession Shimano mechanic in Seattle:
Brand new XT Shifters front and rear ($150)
Brand new XT cassette ($95)
Brand new XTR front derailler ($80)
Brand new Ritchey Pro Stem ($50)
Brand new Ritchey Pro Bars ($50)
Brand new Ritchey Pro seatpost ($70)
New WTB seat ($50)
New brake pads all around ($10)
99% Tread on some Kenda Nevegal Tires ($80)
Brand new XTR chain ($40)

I also have a water bottle cage ($5), shock pump ($10), and a set of Forte Tsali tires ($40) for it too. A New Sigma cyclocomputer is installed on it too, forget the model #, but it ran me about $90 if I remember right. I will include my $180 shimano clip-in shoes if they fit you too. 

I put $820 into it, on top of what I paid for it when I bought it. I will also throw in all the spare parts I have for it including brake pads, the old cassette, tire wrenches, etc. I'd be looking to cut my losses in the $1200 range. Let me know if you have any questions! I can send photos upon request as well!"

$28.00 per box is the listed retail price for a box of this ammo. The price listed is $10.00 below retail for two cases and $5.00 below retail for one case. No discount for a single box. But, if you were to buy both cases at Cabela's, the tax would be $50.00 above what I am charging.

All the low light blinding, hot gases blowing in your face when you fire it, etc. etc.. Honestly, I didn't experience any of it and I shot it in a very low-light setting a few times.

514,http://www.armslist.com/posts/834514,For Sale:  30 rds 5.56 NATO .223 AR15 AR-15  M-193 Ammo Lake City Federal 55 gr brass,"Aliante, Las Vegas, Nevada",$ 120,"Listed On: Saturday, January 12, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"30 rds 5.56x45 XM-193 55 gr. Lake City Federal ammo manufacture date of Oct 2012. That is exactly one 30 rd magazine worth of the best ammo you could feed an AR15! These are the exact same rounds the US ARMY usesI  Except, in most cases they use the 62 gr. M-855 which has the steel penetrator. That's because they are in a fight where the enemy might have body armor. But most people aren't looking for something to penetrate armor - they are looking for something that will kill a badguy. The M-193 is the best round for that task. I just happened to buy a few thousand rounds a couple of months before this whole thing kicked off. But now, there's a whole lot of guys who have new rifles, new magazines, but no ammo. I will sell you some of my stockpile. It's going to be (pre freak out) expensive. But since you can't get any 5.56/.223 ammo anywhere, this is a bargain. I just want to see EVERYONE able to load up now. No sense owning a rifle and not having any ammo. I will not sell my entire stash. BTW, you should have prepared earlier. But then again, isn't that always the case...

Just in case you are new to owning AR15s, check your barrel and make sure it is stamped either 5.56 or 5.56/.223. If all you see is .223 - Then do not buy this ammo. Although it probably won't kill you, you should not shoot 5.56 through a .223 only barrel."

It comes with 2 barrels.  Both barrels are marked ""Special Steel"" and have 3 inch chambers.  The choked barrel is is marked 32 inches, but was cut down to 24 inches.  The re-threading on the barrel was poorly done, but seems functional if you want to use a choke.  It currently has one in it, but I don't know what size it is.  The other barrel is a 28 inch non-choked barrel and is currently on the gun.  It also has a spray can camo job on it that comes off easily if you want to strip it down to the original wood and blue."

We have here two hard to find and rarer Mosins that I am going to part with simply because I need the room!

Avoid the long lines and crowds.

These are only available for FTF sale in the Richmond, Henrico, Mechanicsville and Hopewell areas at this time.

I would like $250.00 each. No shipping charges or other fees.

The Spanish Civil War dragoon rifle is dated 1924 and the ""Finn"" is dated 1927.

The ""Finn"" has a real low serial number with a matching bolt.

The SCW is not matching but is much harder to find and has the SCW wire hangers and will be sold with the (PPSH style?) sling that it came to me with.

Here's several pic.s of the SCW.

Chambered in 5.45x39.

This is one of the best AK’s ever sold in the United States. These rifles were factory built by “Arsenal of Bulgaria” on Russian tooling in Bulgaria as original AK-74 (not as a single stock sportier-carbine like Saiga or Vepr). They required minimal modification (not to be completely converted as Saiga) by “Arsenal of USA” in Las Vegas, to be compliant with 922 (r). These rifles are meet criteria to be considered “Made in the USA.” The USA manufactured parts are counted towards compliance of 922 (r), allowing the sale and possession of the original, un-importable configuration. They include: the stock, pistol grip, upper handguard, lower handguard, trigger, forged hammer, disconnector and double stage trigger. The USA made disconnector and double stage trigger eliminated any feeling of “trigger slap” common in many AK’s. Barrel is chrome lined.  

This rifle has black Tapco polymer furniture, the side optic rail and 10.5 inches NATO length stock (can be easily replaced by a shorter ""Warsaw Pact"" standard stock). The stock has a spring-loaded trap door in the rear to accommodate a cleaning kit. The correct - 74 style break was properly installed (pinned and welded) in accordance to CT AWB by a professional gunsmith.

I bought this rifle several years ago. The gun was hardly used before me. I've fired only 90 trouble free rounds through the rifle and took great care of it. This is a very clean rifle in an excellent condition. 

This rifle comes with sling, butt stock cleaning kit and one 30rd mag with 60 rounds, Please note that new circle10’s mags are still available on-line for $39.99.

5.45x39 is a very effective round. It is still (and will be) a LOT cheaper than .223 or 7.62x39

This is a rare ORIGINAL AK-74 rifle. My price is $2000. Please, do not contact me if you feel that that price is very unreasonable. I do not care if you decided not to pay “panic price”. I paid for that rifle more then for Colt M-4 carbine. I am sure that upcoming ban will change your opinion. I will respond to serious offers. Please, e-mail your phone number.

I will sell FTF in Hartford or close by to a CT resident. MUST BE OVER 21 YEARS OLD with a VALID CT DL (prefer CT Pistol Permit) and be willing to sign a BILL OF SALE. Out of state to your FFL ONLY. They must provide a copy of a FFL. They must accept firearm shipment from a private party.

AS OF 1/22/2013. Cash offer of $3500.00. Open to counter offers until buyer picks up this week. 

RIFLE COST ME $4410.00 to create. Send me an offer relative to that price only. No lowballing as this is a sellers market and these rifles are in insane demand. See below for full component list and pricing to justify my price. 

Due to recent circumstances sales on AR15s have been skyrocketing as politics once again is on the threshold of a new assault weapons ban. This of course will make service series AR15's a rare commodity. 

ADDITIONAL PICTURES CAN BE SEEN HERE:
http://smg.beta.photobucket.com/user/candybarjesus/library/AR15

This rifle was professionally constructed by me some 3 years ago and has been a service rifle since. I have a background as a TSA and Customs affiliated security corespondent at DHL CVG Hub where we maintained compound security, as well as handled presidential escorts for air force one. Needless to say this has been my go to rifle for my 2 years of service. Some 400 round have been fired and bolt carrier group, barrel, chamber, and pin have been well maintained. 

This is a piston augmented weapon which makes it among the rarest of AR-15's as any other plinker or sub par AR will be direct impingement. An Adams Arms gas piston system has been installed and ran through a UTG quad rail. This system operates on the familer Kalishnokov mechanism by which hot gases and carbon strike a piston which operates the action rather than venting the dirty gas into the chamber and fouling the mechanism. Gun stays cooler, and cleaner for longer increasing the longevity of the rifle.

As far as components the Adams arms system utilizes a special bolt carrier group to work in tandem with the piston rod. BCG will fire absolutely anything and has never had a failure to feed or misfire. Will even fire steel cased ammunition with ease. 

This is an CMMG lower, ATI upper, with standard delta ring. A lightweight UTG quad rail is fitted and a 16 very rare ported barrel is utilized. Standard ping pong paddle action release catch and claw type charging handle, and forward assist. The buffer tube is a milspec series and will work with any AR15 stock. I have included the CMMG M4 stock as well as a Magpul CTR stock and a Vltor modstock. The quad rail is protected with wishbone and rubber rail covers and features a very expensive and super bright Surefire recon rifle sight with pressure switch. Ontop of the rails sit the aim point red dot scope and a very expensive eotech flip to side 3x magnifier for quick transitions from close quarters to mid range shooting without an optics change. I am also including a police surplus issue Eotech 552 unbranded with hard shell protector. This rifle is also dressed in various magpul furniture including Magpul MOE foregrip, MOE pistol grip, PTS trigger guard, RSA side rail sling attachment, single point sling adapter,  MS2 mult sling, Mbus rear flip up sight.

Rifle also comes in a bulldog case with 7 steel mags, and 2 Magpul P mags, 1 magpul snap on mag cover, and a rubber wraparound magazine collar.

I will also throw in 100 rounds of .223 to get you started since .223 and 5.56 are scarce. 

As you can see this rifle is a monster and sure to delight any owner in the unforeseen future of AR15's. I am listing this rifle well below what I paid to create along with every expensive AR15 toys on the market. Whoever does purchase this rifle is getting it at a discount of $700 despite its value having actually appreciated considering the demand for these rifles in the past weeks
Tally up the number of components you are getting and it is more than a fair price which is why I will entertain only serious offers, no low balling in a sellers market. I am just as inclined to keep this rifle and will only part with it if satisfied. Serious offers only, cash on hand sale. YOU MUST BE AN OHIO RESIDENT to purchase this rifle from me. If you are out of state KY, or IN resident you can arrange an FFL transfer after the sale. I am in no hurry to sell this rifle considering its demand but since I am no longer in the security field I have little need for it. Any questions or request for additional pictures please email me.

I am selling this gun on consignment. It is out of an old Indian Trading Post from Gallup, New Mexico where it has been stored in a vault for over 25 years. This gun is in superb (museum quality) condition. The gun is silver plated and fully engraved by Gustave Young who was Colt's premier engraver from the 1850s through the 1870s. He is often referred to as the Picasso of engravers. His ""signature"" mark is the dog/wolf head show here in. The gun's grips are ivory and it has all matching serial numbers. This gun was obviously a custom order gun made as a presentation piece. The back of the back strap was left blank where a persons name would have been engraved . I have been told the Confederacy ordered a small number of these Navy models at the beginning of the civil war to be used as presentation pieces. Because the serial number fits in that same time period it has been suggested that this could very well be one of those pieces? While we know very little about the history of this gun we do know it is extremely rare to find a silver plated Gustave Young engraved presentation gun for sale in this kind of condition.  It can be shipped registered mail but only after , approval and payment has been made.. Email me with any questions."

This is a miniature model 1911 style handgun that makes a fantastic concealed carry weapon. It is small enough and light enough to carry in your front pocket. Perfect for a man or woman.  These are not like the cheap double action only model .380s that have heavy trigger pulls and nasty recoil. The double/single action trigger on the Sig P238 is extremely smooth and it has a thumb safety and hold open lever just like the big guns. Women have no trouble pulling back the slide on this little gem.  The light recoil makes these handguns fun to shoot and they are also easily cleaned. It comes with one chromed six round magazine plus one round in the chamber that gives the shooter a total capacity of seven rounds. If that's not enough fire power, seven round mags with an extra finger extension are readily available for a reasonable price. The longer mag is nice for shooters with large hands. The 3 dot tritium night sights work great in the dark or you can always purchase a matching laser from Sig or Crimson Trace for this little baby. This is a new gun that has only been factory test fired. Price is $595 FIRM and only Colt snake guns will be considered for trade. This will not last long, so don't wait or you may miss out on this little jewel!"

Excellent condition with some wear on the folder. 

This is not a Century or Golani build. Instead, the rifle was rebuilt last summer by Jeff Miller of Hillbilly Firearms with a new barrel because the original build had excessive headspace. Jeff also replaced the bolt and feedramp, and put an excellent uniform parkerized finish on the exterior components except for the folding stock which shows some wear. I've put only four rounds through it since then to check functionality. The receiver was milled by Ohio Rapid Fire (ORF), serial RFG002xx.
