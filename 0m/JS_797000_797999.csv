I ask because over the past several weeks I have kept my mouth shut in regards to the absolutely mind blowing amount of garbage or overpriced crap that people post on here. WTF?

First things first, please learn how to type. This does not go for everyone so if you can utilize proper grammar then disregard. For those of you that cannot, do a quick spell check and go from there. It's freaking simple to do and takes two seconds.

Next lets go over what deserves to be described with the word ""custom"". If you put a few things that you picked up at your local gun store on your rifle or pistol and it did not require a professional in any way, or you are not a professional gunsmith yourself, then you do not have an item that should be called custom. A fucking glock with an high cap magazine or a piece of shit NC Star laser does not qualify your gun as something that is, or probably ever will be, custom. Just because it's custom to you does not mean it's custom to the rest of the gun community. ""One of a kind"", ""decked out"", ""tricked out"" and countless other descriptive terms should be stricken as well. Unless you know for a fact that your gun is in fact one of a kind, don't say that shit. Do some research before you go all out over-exaggerating what you've got.  God only knows how many ""one of a kind"" straight from the factory rifles there are out there but I'm willing to bet that there are way more than your taking credit for.

Sniper scopes. Jesus Christ, there is no such thing as a sniper scope. Only when a scope is mounted to a weapon that is in the hands of an actual trained sniper could your scope be considered a sniper scope. We get it, your really great at sniping digital terrorists in call of duty or you hit a target that was really far away that one time, but if your not a sniper then you don't have a sniper scope. Just say what you've got and let that be that. Not need to try to make what you have sound cooler than what it is. Most of the people reading your ad have a google search page opened up to see what it is anyway so chances are they will figure it out. If your not a sniper do not use sniper as a description for your gun or optics.

To go along with ""sniper rifles"" and ""sniper scopes"", the word ""tactical"" is getting a little fucking ridiculous. Just because you saw it in a movie being used by a military bad ass, your weapon is just a weapon. How it is employed makes it tactical. The other day I read an ad for a ""tactical"" airsoft gun and wanted to punch through my living room windows for that genius display of dumb ass adjective word association. If your not using your gun to clear rooms, breach doorways or any other activity that would need a tactical approach, then drop the word tactical from the description. 

Over pricing. Seriously, I understand wanting to make money, but come the fuck on. I saw a guy post a Sig rifle that retails brand new almost 1000 less than what he initially posted it for. This website is intended to help people network to find guns they want, not to pad your wallet. Just because there's some idiot out there that will pay too much for something doesn't mean they should. It's borderline unethical to take advantage of the people out there that either don't know any better or don't care about spending more money than they should. 

While the world is riddled with all sorts of problems, this site usually offers far more solutions than problems. If I offended you, well, I don't apologize because you probably fit into one of the previously mentioned categories and you need to learn how to post an ad on this site. That or you need to stop over compensating for what you have. To anyone that I've enlightened or anyone that expresses the same feelings as I do then I hope this benefits each and everyone of you. Even the people that want to talk up their ""one of a kind, tricked out, tactical custom AR15 sniper rifle"" because every sniper in the world knows that something that shoots .223 is a real game changer in the sniper community. 

I'm probably going to get flagged or receive some hate mail but I don't really give a shit. If this little rant prevents even one over embellished ad from being posted ad from going up then it was worth the five minutes it took to write this."

The gun has been shot less than 30 times. It has a great double action trigger, also the finish is in 99% condition (if not better) This is an awesome carry weapon for male or female and for a while was one of the favorite weapons of plain clothes officers. It is in the box and comes with an extra magazine. The weapon will carry 8 in the mag and 1 in the pipe for 9 rounds. If you need more information google it. It is relatively light and an easy carry piece. Also, it has become somewhat of a collectible gun since they are all but impossible to find on the secondary market. Get it while you can!

Price is $2,500 OBO, im willing to accept trades+cash, and im willing to negotiate as long as you aren't a low baller (this site is KNOWN for you low ballers!!)

I've seen a completely stock Saiga sell that had ZERO upgrades for $2,000...so you're getting a hell of a deal here..

LEGAL ""FULLY AUTOMATIC"" 12 GAUGE SHOTGUN!!!
The gun is unconverted, but still has a pistol grip on it. It was left unconverted because a converted Saiga is 4 inches shorter than the one with the bolt-on pistol grip/stock combo. I can convert it for you for an extra $200.

Mod List:
-Pistol Grip/6-Position Adjustable Buttstock      -$150
-Custom Bumpfire Stock  -$400
-ALL Polished Internals     -$175
-Custom Made Aircraft Grade Aluminum CNC Barrel shroud/Muzzle brake/Door Breach..it helps cool the barrel, reduce recoil by A LOT and suppress the flash    -$350
-S12 Custom Quad Rail    -$325
-Custom Bolt Handle       -$50
-Red Dot Sight(Not Pictured)  -$50

Again, I can convert the Saiga if you prefer for an additional $200 (which is cheap, that includes parts/labor)

That's $1500 JUST in accessories! not including the gun itself!! This gun will go quick, especially with the impending assault rifle ban, this is at the top of the list..so get it now before you will never be able to have one.."

What is unique is that this revolver is from 1981, back when Charter was at their zenith and at the top of their game early on. This revolver has a gorgeous nickle plating that looks brand new. It is the second Bulldog I have owned from this time period, back when the Bulldog was a quality built weapon. If you like to shoot and carry the big .44 special bullet then this gun is for you! This Bulldog has a 3 inch barrel.
It is in absolute pristine condition and has only been shot 5 times since i've had it. It has been a safe queen for a long time and I have just decided to sell it since I never carry it or shoot it. The pictures were made with my I phone and do not do the finish justice. If you see anything that looks like a scratch it is dust, i assure you! This one doesnt have one blemish of any kind on it. The single action trigger pull is very sweet and is probably not even 2 pounds. 
This is a highly collectible weapon, especially if your into the history of the ""Bulldog"".  The grips look like they were made yesterday and are also in pristine, mint condition. This would be a great gun to carry or just collect and look at every now and then! Comes with original box and paperwork. Thanks for looking and if you need anymore pictures please contact me and I will email them to you."

Used Vulcan V15 (AR15) Lower Receiver with DMPS Parts kit and complete DPMS commercial buffer kit installed. No pistol grip or buttstock, all you have to do is install your own grip/stock and upper. This was originally a California legal lower with a DOJ letter and a magazine had been epoxied in palce, but it has been removed since traveling to Colorado and has functioned flawlessly for over 1,000 rounds. 

You will need to tighten the lock ring for the buffer tube, it's loose since I replaced my custom sling latch plate with the standard DMPS one.

There are minor cosmetic issues that are hardly noticeable from installation of the parts kit and removal of the fixed magazine; I was not concerned with looks when I built this lower and de-californicated it...

I'm trying to keep only those firearms that can fill multiple roles.  The LCP is awesome for concealment/ease of carry, but for me it doesn't serve the dual purpose as a range/plinking gun.  For this reason I'm hanging onto my Beretta Nano and Bersa Thunder .380 (better trigger/better sights for plinking, still plenty compact for carrying).  

Having said all that, here's what you get (no picture - you know what the LCP looks like):
- Ruger LCP - excellent condition
- Only shot it enough to be comfortable with it and confident if wouldn't fail - less than 100 flawless rounds fired (brass and steel FMJ, brass JHP)
- The only visible wear is on chamber housing where the slide contacts when racked/fired
- One magazine with pinky extension (also have the original baseplate)
- Original box/manual and Ruger softcase (everything you get from the factory)
- Pocket holster (I think it's Uncle Mike's)

What I'd like:
- Cash ($300 price is firm)
- .357 revolver w/ 3-4"" barrel (prefer straight trade for nickel 4"" EAA Windicator)
- Glock 17 or 19 (prefer 17 Gen 3)
- For Glock or higher value revolvers I have the following I can include with trade 
  - 250 rounds of .40 ammo (165 grain Blazer Brass)
  - ~375 rounds of 7.62x54r (surplus, corrosive, majority is 148 grain but I have a handful of 50 grain)
  - Not willing to add cash on top at this time
- Let me know what you have that may work with what I've described above

Terms:
- Prefer to meet in Port Orchard - I'm willing to travel w/in ~20 min. (along WA-16/3 between Gig Harbor, Belfair, and Silverdale)
- Must be WA resident with driver license and CPL
- A WADOL Firearms Transfer form must be completed (I will do same for you if trade includes a firearm)"

SPRINGFIELD (Stevens) ARMS MODEL 83

This is an old and hard to come by .22 cal. bolt action, single shot.  You must pull the knob on the bolt back to set the trigger after you load the round into the chamber.  This rifle is complete and very functional.  It shoots flawlessly and is very clean.  The bore is shiney and bright.  The bolt and firing pin appear in great shape.  The front & rear sight are intact and functional.  The wooden stock is complete and has a few small cracks, but nothing that would inhibit the function of this rifle.  It looks good for its age.

From the Ruger website:
THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

I'm selling my 4"" stainless Ruger GP100 along with all it's accessories that I bought almost two years ago. I am open to trades. The handgun comes with 4 HKS speed loaders, 4 Safariland speed loaders, 4 Bianchi speed strips, trigger and hammer spring kit, Hi Viz front sight with the included different fiber insert colors, wood Hogue grip, universal 4"" revolver holster, 2 HKS speed loader pouches that hold 2 speed loaders each, laser bore sight for .38 and .357, and the factory front sight, factory rubber Hogue grip, factory trigger return spring, and factory hammer spring. The handgun's action has been polished for a butter smooth DA/SA pull.

Currently, the handgun is set up with a 10lb trigger return spring and 10lb hammer spring with so far 100% ignition on all the ammunition I've encountered. Included in the spring kit is a 8lb trigger return spring and 9lb hammer spring for an even lighter trigger pull but I opted to keep the 10lb trigger return and hammer spring for ignition reliability and crisp trigger return. The factory is set up with 14lb hammer spring and 12lb trigger return. The grip on the handgun is currently on the rubber grip to keep the wood grip looking new. The front sight equipped is the Hi Viz fiber sight with the green insert but included, as stated earlier, is the factory front sight. This is an amazing handgun that still looks new and was meticulously cleaned after each range visit with about 2000 rounds fired through it."

WASR 10/63 for $750. Comes with 4 30rd metal mags, one of the mags is a Yugo BHO (Bolt Hold Open) magazine. Crome-lined barrel, 74 style tapco muzzle brake, yugo grenade launcher, yugo matching #'s bayonet, romanian furniture set, 3 East German (EG) pistol grips, cai pistol grip, EG sling, EG lower handguard, 2 EG upper handguards, extra gastube, EG buttstock, EG 90%(?) complete buttock. Also comes with a UAG Quick Detach mount with a Sight Mark Sure Shot Red Dot Sight.

I have fired around 600ish rounds, not sure of the count for its previous owner. I haven't really sighted in the red dot so adjustments will need to be made. When I got it the gas tube lever is broke from its previous owner. The whole bolt number matches to the trunnion and so does the gas-tube. I've never had any problems at all with it and is one of the better rifles from the bunch. The bayonet lugs were grinded to a degree, which I found strange since it was probably meant for a ban state and not MI.

Other then that I will do $750 OBO so if you have any other questions just email me, and please no low-ball offers if you do a best offer."

This rifle has had the trigger group and pistol grip moved forward towards the traditional AK profile. The trigger group is a Tapco G2 polished and customized by Dinzag Arms. The pistol grip is Hogue. It has a chrome lined 16"" barrel. The rifle performs flawlessly with no FTE or FTFs. I am including 4 25 round polymer high capacity magazines that have worked perfectly. The rifle includes everything you see: aluminum (US made) fore grip (with hollow compartment), bi pod, quick detach side picatinny scope rail with 4-16X Mil Dot Illuminated scope, Folding telescoping collapsible stock.

This is not an AR-15, this is a piston driven semi automatic shooting the larger .308 Winchester cartridge. This is a big rifle that is loud and throws a 2-3 foot fireball with each shot. You will get someone's attention quickly; I have had many people approach me at the range wanting to look this rifle over. the AK piston system is famous for it's reliability and ease of use, cleaning and repair. It drives a bullet that is up to 5 times heavier than the AR-15 and has up to 1500 more foot/pounds of energy with each shot. This is a big boy rifle, but the simplicity of the AK system is great for newer semi automatic rifle owners. This is a rare rifle, especially with the conversion already completed. 

It will only be listed until Tuesday, if no one has purchased it or made a legitimate offer by then, I will list it on a gun auction site. I will meet FTF with TN residents, and I can work through an FFL to ship it anywhere in the country ( except CA, IL and other cities/states/etc... with laws preventing such a rifle. Know your laws.) 

I am not desperate to sell or needing cash now, I just do not shoot this rifle often and will use the funds to upgrade a long range bolt project I am working on. I feel bad this rifle is so under used, they are made to shoot. Please email me with any questions or offers."

The 6.5-284 Cartridge by Jason Baney, Asst. Editor The versatile, ultra-accurate 6.5-284 cartridge has exploded in popularity in recent years. From 600- and 1000-yard benchrest, to the tactical and F-class shooting disciplines, this round has made its grand entrance and is here to stay. The 6.5-284, originally a wildcat version of the .284 Winchester, is now more popular than its parent. The .284 Win case was created, as a 7mm hunting round, to deliver 30-06 performance in a shorter case, but it never caught on as a competition cartridge. Today, the 6.5mm version is one of the most successful long-range match rounds ever invented. The 6.5-284 has far eclipsed its parent case--at least for the time being. (The new, high-BC 7mm bullets have inspired some shooters to revive the straight .284, using necked-up 6.5-284 brass.)"

Targeted premium domains help to reduce advertising costs on a long-term basis. By having a keyword-rich address your domain name acts like sweet search engine bait. The right domain address can often put your business at the top of the search results. Unlike costly web marketing expenses that are a constant financial burden, your targeted premium domains go on to serve you long after the initial investment is behind you. In fact, the more mature your domains get, the more attractive they become to search engines. Higher natural (free) search engine placements are what every biz is after. 

When a potential buyer enters one of your keywords in their web search, your targeted keyword domain can then direct them to your current domain. You don't have to be a needle in a haystack. When all roads lead to Rome (your domain) potential buyers will have an easier time ending up on your web site.

4.5 XDM 40S&W W/ Black Finish
The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

Winchester barrel. Inland trigger group. Haven't checked the maker of the rest of the parts. In a very nice repro paratrooper stock set that would cost over $250 if bought new. The stock does have a few marks, the worst being a groove in the bottom of the pistol grip made by folding and unfolding the butt (typical), but is very nice nevertheless. Metal is very nice as well with some scattered marks. Very tight muzzle. The bore is in very good condition with either some light crud or some light pitting in a few places. Still has quite a bit of shine and strong rifling. Should make a great shooter.

The gun is Hong Kong police marked on the triggerguard and bayonet lug. Rack numbers match as they should. Hong Kong did not get that many M1 carbines, so this is a somewhat scarce variant for anyone who cares about such things. For anyone else, it is still a nice example of a Winchester in a very handy configuration.

Comes with 1 15 round mag. I have additional mags and over 850 rounds of ammo the buyer of the gun will have first option on.

$800 firm face to face in Hickory, NC. No trades desired. May be able to meet in the Winston area, as I get there fairly regularly.  Thanks for looking!"

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.
