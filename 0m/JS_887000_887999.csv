I bought it awhile back thinking I was going to mount it, but then never got around to buying a rifle to mount it on. The lights hasn't been used. It mounts to any Picitanny rail system. It comes with a pressure pad switch for operating, but you can also use the push button on the back. This light also comes with the IR filter for use with night vision. Normal retail on this light is $380 for the version without the IR filter. I'm asking $200. Serious inquiries only please. I've included a picture, but my camera skills aren't the best. Just let me know if you want any other photos from different angles or closer up shots on certain areas. 

I would also be willing to entertain the thought of a trade for a Bersa Thunder .380 or a similar .380 for concealed carry. 

This is the site link for other information on the light. Again, please note that the listing is for the light without the IR filter.

I can include the shown colt manufactured carry handle for an additional 50 dollars. It is well used, but still serves it's function very well, and these things are priced crazy these days.

THIS IS A NO RESERVE PENNY AUCTION. ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR 1953 COLT COMMANDER LIGHT WEIGHT SUPER .38 AUTOMATIC PISTOL IN 97% CONDITION. FANTASTIC DEEP COLT BLUE WITH PERFECT GRIPS. SERIAL NUMBER 31152-LW. MADE FROM 1949 TO 1979. C&R OK. I’ve sold a number of these beautiful pistols over the years but this is definitely the finest of them all. Descended from the famed original World War I Colt U.S. Army Colt 1911 but with significant improvements, this is one of the most collectable members of the 1911 family. Produced between 1949 and 1979. The frame is made of lightweight alloy and the slide is steel. The frame is a rather deep dullish non-glare black and the frame is a really fantastic very high luster blue. The top edges of the slide have just the very slightest whisper of holster wear and the frame has a couple of miniscule scratches not even through the finish. I would easily rate this as a 97% gun. The brown composition grips with Colt medallions are perfect, as is the bore. Original “Colt .38 Super Auto” marked barrel. The pistol is extremely tight and has obviously been fired very little. It weighs only 1 pound 10 ounces. The .38 Super offers higher bullet velocities than the 9mm Parabellum including +P and +P+ in factory cartridges. The greater case capacity allows for more powder and results in higher muzzle velocities at approximately similar pressure levels. It is generally regarded as a well-balanced cartridge with a flat trajectory, good accuracy and relatively high muzzle energy. If you’ve been seeking a fantastic example of this famed and highly collectable pistol, here’s the one you’ve been waiting for."

Description: Ultra-high capacity magazines keep your rifle running longer between mag changes during competition or tactical operations. These magazines meet NATO STANAG 4179 specifications and are compatible with all rifles that accept AR-15/M16/M4 magazines. Less than two standard magazines wide, so they’re easy to hold and handle with one hand. 60-round model fits most dual-mag pouches for 30-round magazines. Weight is centered under the weapon to help you maintain a normal shooting grip and stance. Seats fully loaded on a closed bolt. “Nesting” nylon followers require no lubrication and fully support the round stack to aid in reliable feeding. Cadmium coating on springs reduces friction and resists corrosion."

I will include the riser mount and mounting rings as well.
BDC Carbine Reticle

Developed specifically for the trajectory of the .223 Rem/5.56 NATO round with 55-grain polymer tip bullet, the new BDC Carbine reticle provides a 200 yard crosshair with ""hash marks"" at 400 yards and 600 yards.
Generous, Consistent Eye Relief

Keeps your brow safe—even with the heaviest recoiling cartridges, lightweight rifles, and severe shooting angles.
Precise, 1/2 Inch @ 100 Yards Hand-turn Tactical-Style Turrets

Positive click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting—even with repeated recoil.
Zero-Reset Turret Feature

To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated this feature into all new riflescopes. Just sight-in as usual, then lift the spring-loaded adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and reengage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges.
Waterproof/Fogproof

Model BTA 90. Italian Made. Tanfoglio. Had for 2 yrs about 4 boxes 200 rounds through it, no hiccups. Just sits in safe. Looking to trade for something different (like 9mm, 40 cal and 45's - Let me know what you want to get rid of…). I'm simply considering another handgun OR tactical shotgun. No rush to sell. 
I'd like $375 cash (or) equal trade. Can throw in CASH for right deal...ALSO, I live in NORTH PINELLAS (Tarpon Springs) so, consider that.

These KTM 950 Adventure cycles win off road races and are very popular in Europe winning in their HP class and consistently beat the BMW's.

I've had this cycle inside the N.Carolina logging trails where you can enter from Hendersonville, N.C., also very neat to go along the curving paved highways along those same Allegheny  mountains (stretches about 450 miles of paved road with nearly one 25MPH curve after the other it seems.  Great ride with max speed of 45MPH so you can really enjoy the woods.   If that sounds like your kind of adventure,  then you do need this Like Brand New KTM 950 on/off road motorcycle to get you there....  Don't miss this today only opportunity.

Spring is around the corner and you only live once plus the price is right here. Make the best of it as life is short.
