The 'Suomi KP/-31' (Suomi-konepistooli or ""Submachine-gun Finland"") was a submachine gun (SMG) of Finnish design that was in service during World War II. It was a descendant of the M-22 prototype and the KP/-26 production model, which was revealed to the public in 1925. The Suomi-konepistooli KP/-31 is often abbreviated to Suomi KP.

The Suomi KP/-31 is regarded by many as one of the most successful submachine guns of World War II and it was so successful that many of its features (including the soon developed 71-round drum magazine) were later copied and adopted by the Soviets for their PPD-40 and PPSh-41 submachine guns.[3] The accuracy compared to the mass-produced PPSh-41 was superior however, thanks in part to a noticeably longer barrel, with the same rate of fire and the equally large magazine capacity. The major disadvantage of the Suomi-KP was its high production costs.

The Suomi KP/-31 also incorporated a few new design features, including an arrangement whereby the spring was mounted inside the bolt in order to make the gun shorter. Its 50-round quad-column ""Casket"" box magazine was more reliable than the early 50-round ""bullets loaded nose down"" drum magazine, and similar applications were used on the Argentine C-4 submachine gun and present-day 60-round 5.45x39mm AK-74 compatible magazines.

The M-22 and KP/-26 were made by Konepistooli Oy, founded by Master Armorer Aimo Lahti, Captain V. Korpela, Lieutenant Y. Koskinen and Lieutenant L. Boyer-Spoof. The Suomi KP/-31 was designed by Koskinen and Lahti.

The Suomi KP/-31 went into serial production in 1931 by Tikkakoski Oy and most of these weapons were bought by the Finnish Defence Forces. The Finnish Defence Forces were equipped with about 4000 Suomi KP/-31 submachine guns when the Winter War started. During the course of the war, the design was altered with the addition of a muzzle brake, which increased the submachine gun's overall length by 55 mm. The revised version was designated KP/-31 SJR (suujarru, or ""muzzle brake""). Aimo Lahti was displeased with this revision, believing that it reduced the weapon's reliability. Ultimately, roughly half of the KP/-31s in Finnish service were of the SJR version. Initially the KP/-31 was issued as a substitute for a light machine gun, and proved inadequate in this role. Instead, soldiers learned by trial and error how to use submachine guns to the best effect. By the time of the Continuation War, Finnish doctrine had been altered to include both a KP/-31 and a light machine gun (usually a captured Degtyaryov DP) in every infantry squad, and by 1943 this had been expanded to two KP/-31s per squad. KP/-31 production continued with the intention of adding a third submachine gun to each squad, but this plan was shelved in 1944 when the Continuation War ended.

A specialized bunker version was also produced in very small numbers (a total of 500 built) in 1941, with a thinner barrel shroud to allow firing through the narrow ports of defensive bunkers. This version lacked a shoulder stock and was equipped with a pistol grip. An even rarer version was produced for use as a secondary gun in the firing ports of Vickers Alt B Type E 6-Ton tanks, but only a few dozen were built before production was canceled due to the outbreak of the Winter War. Production never resumed, as captured Degtyaryov DP machine guns proved far superior in this role. Like the bunker version, the tank version had a pistol grip and no buttstock, and it could be quickly removed from the tank and fitted with a standard barrel shroud for infantry use if needed. The tank version remained in the Finnish Army's inventory through the 1980s, despite the tank it was designed for being retired in 1959, possibly because the Army forgot that they existed.

  The Suomi KP was also manufactured under license in Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland, where it was known as the Hispano-Suiza MP43/44. Tank and pillbox variants were also developed and produced in Finland.

In 2009, a semi-automatic version of the Suomi KP was produced for civilian sale in the United States[citation needed], replacing the receiver and lengthening barrel to meet the standards of the National Firearms Act.

There will be classes held on Friday, January 7 from 6:30-10:30pm and on Saturday, January 8 from 9am-1pm just off 395 in the Arlington/Pentagon City area. You only need to attend ONE of the 4hr classes to become certified and there is no test or range fire required. (We do have classes in other locations such as Woodbridge and Fredricksburg so please ask if interested)

This class is required for the Utah permit (valid in more than 32 states around the country), but also qualifies participants for the Virginia, West Virginia, and Florida permits if desired. Included in the course fee is all required instruction, the application packets, fingerprinting, passport photos, a certificate of completion, and other training material needed to get your CCW permit. I even provide abundant and
delicious snacks and drinks!

Our course normally runs $150, but are offering a $25 discount to those who sign-up through this site for the Utah and Virginia permit. (If you didn’t do so well in math that means that you only pay $125!) I guarantee that you will not find a better offer anywhere nearby.

 Even better, for groups of 3+ people you will receive an additional $25 discount bringing the costs of the course to $100 a person. (Coming in a group of 3+ will bring each member of your group $50 savings!)

For those who have inquired...
you *do not need to be resident of Utah* to qualify, it does not matter what state your driver license is from or if it matches your current address, you do need to be* 21 yrs old* with a fairly clean criminal
record, and you *do not* need to own/provide a weapon.

The only two things that you need to bring to class is a govt. issued photo ID (any state will do) and a positive attitude. Please call or email me if you have any questions about obtaining a concealed carry permit or to get registered for the class.

For sale or trade is my Stoeger Condor Over and Under with matching set of 12 gauge and 20 gauge barrels. They each have a modified and an improved cylinder choke in the barrels. Here is the story. A guy I met to sell this gun to the other night told me he would offer me $260 then he went up to $280 after telling me it had rust on it. He looked at the gun with a flashlight in a dark parking lot after he showed up late. So I took this set to a gunshop the next day to have it looked at. The owner came out and looked at it I told him I wanted to trade it in or see what I could get for selling it. He asked why I was selling it and told him why and what I went through the previous night. I told him I was selling it for $325. He looked at me funny and said I'll give you $325 cash right now for it. That coming from a gun dealer tells me my asking price is too low. He said I would be stupid to take anything less than $400 for it and if he got it for $325 he could resell it for $450 the next day no problem. He checked the gun over and it indeed has no rust on it at all. There was residue that he wiped off with his finger where the shell sits in the chamber. He ran a bore snake down the barrells and said it looks new to him. He said he could still sell it for $450 even with the small nicks on the bottom of the stock. So with said story above the gun shop owner said the guy I met with is either a dealer or a low baller trying to make a quick $100 on me. So new price is $400 and if I don't get that I will just keep it. He said it could be a safe queen and would never lose value the way it is. There is NO rust on this gun anywhere per the gun shop owner. This combo has had a total of 58 rounds through the 12 gauge barrels and 25 rounds through the 20 gauge barrels. I will meet face to face for a deal in a well lit area. I might consider some trades. Shoot me a deal and we can go from there.

Because of this I reluctantly am selling the rifle I spent the past year building.  Rifle is Built on a Savage action, and with the modern barrel is able to be loaded to full 6.5x55 spec, not the watered down US/SAMMI specs.  This puts the rifle into the class with 6.5x284 with longer barrel life and milder recoil.  Head to toe built for long range accuricy.  I was printing 1/2"" groups at 100yrds with cheap factory rounds, should be under a 1/4 MOA rifle with reloads.  The rifle weights right around 14lbs with glass, but most of that is in the stock.  With a lighter (Duramax) stock you would be easily able to haul it in the hills out west for Elk.  With the hotter European-Spec loads, the rifle has about the same recoil as my wife's .243win Rem 700, but much more power at much longer ranges.

The Benelli M2 tactical shotgun. 

Here is the official description from Benelli:

The M2 Tactical is a no-nonsense 12-gauge shotgun that police and military the world over reach for when the going gets tough. The M2 Tactical, like all Benelli semiautomatic shotguns is Inertia Driven®, which uses recoil energy to cycle the action. This eliminates all the problems associated with gas-operated systems, such as the necessity of frequent cleaning and the tendency gas-operated systems have for malfunctioning during adverse weather conditions. The M2 Tactical fires all 1 oz. or heavier 2¾"" and 3"" loads.The M2 Tactical features a fully adjustable ghost-ring aperture rear sight and military-style fixed-blade front sight. In addition the M2 Tactical comes with either a matte black synthetic stock with tactical pistol grip, or with a ComforTech® stock that reduces felt recoil by as much as 48%. The M2 Tactical is a shotgun you can bet your life 

I purchased the gun in May last year and I have fired about 100-150 shells of buckshot and slugs through it. The gun is in perfect condition except for a very light scratch on one spot of the finish of the barrel. I have all original parts including the following:
-3 different chokes with choke key for switching chokes
-stock charging handle
-stock magazine tube( holds 5 +1 in chamber of 2.75 in shells, 4 +1 in chamber of 3 in magnum shells
-18.5 in smooth bore barrel

Now on to what makes mine unique. I have a Nordic Components extended magazine tube adds an extra 3 shells bringing the total to 7 +1 in chamber of 2.75 in shells or 6 +1 in chamber of 3 in magnum shells. I also have a Nordic Components barrel clamp with a picatinny rail mount. I have a Mesa Tactical picatinny rail mount with an 8 shell holder mounted onto the receiver. I have an after market charging handle, but unfortunately I can't remember the brand or where I ordered it. 

All of it together retails new at over $1550. That's before the $100 in taxes and $40 in shipping for the parts. This is a deal that you won't find anywhere else. The gun is insanely fun to shoot and even with a smooth bore barrel is pretty accurate with slugs. I took a deer down last fall from about 45 yards with a 3 in slug and dropped her with one hit right were I wanted to hit her. 

I will have pictures up hopefully by this weekend. Email me if you're interested and I can send some pictures of it, too."

This gun is so old that Wild West gunfighter Bat Masterson endorsed it with ""10 shots quick!"" my price is lowest you could pay on other websites and there is no rust or pits and it comes with the original mag. If you want an interesting early auto pistol for cheap and don't want to worry about shooting it, this is the one, it would also make a great candidate for any sort of creative refinishing job this odd-looking gun would inspire since it has no finish on it but a nice pewter patina that somehow fits. I had thought about a simple polish and clearcote for an industrial look, or how about shiny nickel with blued barrel and wood grips or matte nickel with blue barrel etc.

whats the catch? a tiny hairline crack on a grip panel that is hard to notice and is stable. repro grips available. shoots great. Photo is from the net since I dont have a digital camera."

Everyone has a right to ask what they want--free country, yes I know.  But all thats being said is there are sooo many guns that are just listed too high and the guy selling won't budge on the price.  So either the seller hasn't got a clue about the value of his gun, or is trying to rip someone off.  Maybe its time the SELLER does their homework??  Yeah thats the ticket! Those defending the prices or calling people whiners are the guys listing stuff too high and looking for the suckers who aren't smart enough to do their homework.

The gun cost me 1300 to build. I had it shotting clover leaf groups at 175m Its only had 450 rounds down barrel. its a great cyote/varnmit gun or with nosler/polymer tip it would be good for larger game. it is an absolute tack driver. I would keep it but it is Impractical for the use I intended it for so i figured it would be best if some one else were to use it instead of it just collecting dust in my safe.I would like an AR or AK to begin a build for camp perry next year and compete. As well was working toward my ultimate goal of becoming an Armorer in the police force and in the Marine reserves

I enjoy delton but i would trade for almost any AR or other firearm
also An AK47 or some other unussual firearm (prefferably semi auto) im starting a collection

I bought this scope for my AR15 but I want to get an Eotech. I really like this scope but I need to cut back on my rifles weight hence why I am selling this scope to put the money towards an Eotech or Aimpoint.

It has a red illuminated doughnut reticule which also acts as a range finder once you memorize the MOA of each line and circle (which is covered in the included manual). It is adjustable from 1X to 4X power. The glass is great and it also has a cross-hair focus adjustment ring. It takes 1 CR2032 batter to power the illumination although you DO NOT need the illumination on to use the scope.

I have only shot 60 rounds with this scope. It has held a zero perfectly and I have been pleased with its accuracy. I have a little over $260 in the whole setup, but I will sell it for $200. Of course if you are not able to meet me to pick it up then you will have to pay an extra $10 for shipping. I will deal face to face cash transaction or paypal. I am able to meet within reasonable distances.


I will sell outright or trade plus cash for Eotech or Aimpoint or .22 bolt action rifle.

This is a Century International Arms M70 Fixed Stock AK-47 (M70B1) in very near mint condition. 99% of the M70s out there are under-folders and the fixed stock version is hard to find as very few of these were made. The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds of Ammo,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

It was evaluated by Tucson Guns and Western Artifacts last year, who found that “the shotgun is in excellent mechanical condition but the barrels are corroded”; however, the lockwork is very tight.  The furniture is in good condition with scratches one would expect from 110+ year old piece, and the checkering is original and has not been re-cut.  The buttplate is the original hard rubber with the Remington Arms logo and all fasteners are original.  I would not consider firing this weapon without a thorough functional evaluation by a professional gunsmith.  However, it is a very attractive and unique piece.  $850.00."

This is a high quality Norinco AK47 with proper wood furniture and bakalite handle - A classic icon of Russian weaponry!

These are not the cheap Romanian versions you see flooding the market today. Therefore, they hold their value and are of very high quality (hence the reason Norinco has several contracts with western governments to provide firearms).

What an amazing gun. Fires like a dream. I was able to achieve a 3 in. spread at 150m (which is superb for an AK47). In great condition, fired <200 rounds total.
