I have a 1911 that I spent way too much damn money on. Now I'm tired of it and want to see what I can get in trade for it because I realize that either I am not very good at competition shooting and no amount of money spent on my 1911 will ever make be better...or because I realized that I could probably have two or three quality guns for the amount of money I spent on this one gun. 

I don't mean to sound rude, but I demand that you give me more than my gun is worth in trade or trade + cash, because I don't want to lose out on all the money I foolishly sunk into my 1911, and I don't give a rat's butt if you like that or not. So don't offer me anything that isn't as expensive as what I claim to have in my gun. 

Yes, I should have bought an ACTUAL Wilson Combat or maybe even a Les Baer if I wanted so many competition-ready parts. But so what? I shouldn't have to live with that. You should. 

So make me an offer.

Yes, this is a joke. 

Unfortunately, there is a post very similar to this (among others) that is NOT a joke."

I'm not sure what the rifle caliber is so a chamber casting should be done. Fluid steel with no dents or dings in the barrels. Fairly solid bluing with some case colors left on the receiver. There are a few minor problems with the gun. It has the sling studs but is missing the swivels. There is a crack in the hand guard that I have tried my best to show. The rear sight is missing which is the only reason I am selling this. I have a little bag that has parts that the previous owner tried to fabricate. He made a western style rear sight that is pretty ghastly but with a little fitting or grinding it should work.

The drilling does have a very nice horn buttplate and grip cab with no cracks in either. All of the screws look original to the gun. It has a bullet trap in the comb of the stock which is a nice touch. The whole gun locks up solid also. I'll post a few pictures here then link to my photobucket album which will have quite a few more pictures. The first few pages and more around page 10 from when I bought it last year.

I'm looking for $1000 which makes it pretty cheap for a drilling. I'm open to offers and trades though. I just bought a cabin so cash is preferred. Maybe something like a basic full size A2 AR or AR180. Maybe an AUG clone too.
I'm open to shipping for an extra $25 to an FFL.

        ATN NVSG1 is a poweful night vision system for target aimining in the low light conditions.
        The ATN NVSG1 Gen 1+ tube features ABC (Automatic Brightness Control) and tube recoil-protection which are intrinsic to Gen 2 technology.
        The 1/6 MOA precision electronic reticle with ""red-on-green"" illumination allows the user to select the most optimal aiming mark of 5 available patterns (Dot, Post, Post with Dot, Open Crosshair and Crosshair) for each individual sighting situation.
        The model incorporates the ATN proprietary ""smart"" technology that provides for safer battery consumption (due to the ""smart"" sleep mode the power is inactivated when the unit keeps untouched for long) and for proximity sensor that activates the unit only when the user puts it close to his/her eyes.
        Each unit of ATN NVSG1 comes with a 100m-covering focusable infra-red (IR) illuminator located on the top for convenience.
        ATN NVSG1 has digital controls to use in the adjustment of the IIT brightness, reticle illumination and IR intensity. For the user's survivability, unlike many other products, the ATN NVSG1 packing includes a remote wire with a three-button control panel that duplicates the digital controls from the body of the system.
        The ATN NVSG1 weapon sight is supplied with a standard North American Weaver mounting system compatible to the Picatinny weapon bases.
        All in all, the ATN NVSG1 Gen 1+ night vision weapon sight is an exclusively powerful though still price-friendly option to meet the needs of the professional users demanding a reasonable quality-to-price correlation.

""the red dot has never been used"" Comes with one 20 round drum, 10 round magazine and one 5 round magazine. Selling it because its just not my thing. Just acquired a compact double barrel couch 12 gauge shotgun and that's the only shotgun I need. The quad rail is cool because it sits up high enough off the receiver so that you can still use your iron sights. From my understanding these Saiga shotguns will soon not be allowed to be imported into the United States, so get one while you can! The value of them will only go up. I had to take the 20 round promag drum to a gun smith and have him file literally a hair off the side of the magazine lip it fit to tight before, it now fits perfect. Just took it out to the range and tested out the promag 20 round drum and it fed and fired all 20 rounds that i fired with out issue, this thing rocks. Buyer must be a Illinois resident and have a valid Illinois FOID card and sign bill of sale. NO TRADES. Best offer takes it home. I'm in no rush to sell this thing so low ballers, low ball someone else. Ridiculous offers will be ignored.

I researched it thoroughly before purchasing this. It is more reliable than a Saiga and more durable than a Mossberg. Short 18"" barrel with a 6+1 capacity, and you can reload between shots without needing to change magazines. This is a very well thought out design.

The prior owner purchased it new and had some custom work done to it to make it even better:
*Mesa Tactical Urbano stock with adjustable cheek riser and Limbsaver recoil pad.
*Mesa Tactical 6-round side saddle with Picatinny rail if you want to mount an optic.
*Nordic Components charging handle.
*Nordic Components mag clamp (a mini-rail can be ordered for $17 to mount a flashlight on said clamp).
*Oversized safety installed by Bowers Tactical, who also polished the bolt release.
*Condor Tactical shotgun scabbard with gear pouch.
*Assorted small parts & cleaning kit.
*Manual & warranty card.

I've only owned this shotgun for a few weeks and have not fired it. This is an outstanding shotgun, but just not the right choice for me. Before I bought it I was convinced it would be perfect, but it is a bit heavy and doesn't seem like a good fit.

I was going to order the mini-tac rail for the mag clamp (part # TRL-BCT-150) and a Tru-Glo fiberoptic front sight, but never got around to it. I highly recommend these items to the new owner.

I did, however, purchase a lot of buckshot. 6 unopened boxes of Winchester #1 Buck, 6 unopened boxes of Winchester Mil-Spec 00 Buck, and a pair of A-Zoom snap caps. That is 60 rounds of the BEST buckshot available, plus a pair of training rounds to practice reloads and dry fire.

The prior owner fired only 300 rounds through this, mostly Federal birdshot, without any issues.  I am selling it for less than I have into it, in hope of funding another purchase.  Asking $800 CASH and not particularly interested in trades.  Local sale only, will not ship, will not travel too far out of the greater Denver area.  Aside from a few minor scuffs on the barrel from sliding in and out of the scabbard this custom tactical shotgun is practically new.  Serious buyers only.  No thugs.  Thanks."

Price is $500 and is 100% absolutely firm.
If you want to pay less, there are plenty of people selling that cheap copy that Taurus makes, and trust me, the quality is not there holding the guns side by side, which is why I bought the Beretta in the first place.

It comes with 3-30 round magazines (2 HK OEM and 1 that came with it originally). It is not regiesterd as a SBR , but I'll throw in a stock & VFG and a carry bag( I'll even throw in a box Federal LE Tactical 165gr). I was going to SBR it, but I decided to go a different route ( Remington 700).

I've fired 100 rounds thru it using new commercial & reloads, CCI Aluminum and Federal ammo without a single glitch. These babies are hard to find and alot more expensive $1500+. 

Price is $1350 (obo, nego.) shipped to you FFL or FTF in central Indiana. (I've seen these going for $1500+). 

I'd consider a trade just ask.
I have some other pics upon request."

The majority of people in the market for this will most likely know what it is, but I'll describe it in brief.

A 9mm carbine that uses the exact same magazines as the Glock 17, including the extended 30+ ones, and the 10 rounders.
It can fold in half, for easy storage, making it a decent fit in a car, or a range bag. Or just someplace in a house.
For those who've never fired one, it's more accurate, and easier to shoot than a pistol. But the buffer spring is in the stock, and it's fairly light, so recoil is a little odd, but easy to get used to. 

It shoots well, still have yet to fully break it in with the 50 rounds I've fired. I cleaned it after, and haven't shot it since. With the other guns I have, I really have little need for it, and would like to try other firearms.

The $340 is with the weapon, the 10 round mag it came with, and the $40 dollar 31 round factory Glock magazine I bought for it. Non negotiable with the cash price. 
But with trades, a decent bit of wiggle room is allowed. I'd prefer a trade, with cash on one end or the other. I'm in the market for many things, so please, let me know what you'd like to trade for."

You can weld thicker metal if you bevel it and perform multi-pass welds.

These are still available commercially, but here's a relatively rare one. While they are now well over the 20,000-range in serial numbers, this one is in the #3800 range - a four-digit number and a very desirable piece. Also, these early ones had a much more subdued blade etching that made for a more professional looking package. Has the original nylon sheath with black leather strap. 

Like new.

Price firm / no trades

Thanks


Here's some text from today's offerings . . .
Boker's reissue of the Applegate-Fairbairn Fighting Knife uses fiberglass-reinforced Delrin handle, thickened in the center for a sure grip. A lanyard hole adds convenience. The handle meets a short, forward-bending cross guard that protects the fingers. Boker achieved the knife's preferred rearward balance by inserting steel weights into the handle - a beautifully ergonomic design. The 6"" blade on this 10 3/4"" knife has effective reach, with a 1"" wide blade that's beefy all the way to the tip. Struck of Solingen 440C stainless steel hardened to a Rockwell of 58, the blade has the signatures of Rex Applegate and W.E. Fairbairn etched into the bead-blasted finish. Made in Solingen, Germany."

The weapon has been cleaned after every range trip. It's a great gun, but I just don't make it to the range enough to justify shooting it vs. my other 9mm guns. 

Included in deal on my end:
-M&P22 pistol
-Original box, manuals, lock, plastic, magazine, brass, etc.
-Remaining Federal ammo (about half a box)
-Unused .22 cleaning kit (originally purchased from Wal-Mart)

The condition is really nice. I've never carried the weapon holstered so the only wear will be from cycling the weapon during it's range trips. It's really very ""new"" looking. Valued at $300 or so. While I'll certainly sell, I MIGHT be interested in trading for a 9mm semi-auto pistol. I love firing new types of guns so hit me up with what you have! I'm especially interested in a Bersa Thunder UC 9mm or Walther PPS 9mm.   But please, NO LOW BALL OFFERS!

All transactions will be FTF, follow applicable NC laws, and will be located in the Raleigh/Garner area of the state. I have no intention of 'giving this away' and have no need to rid myself of this gun. I'm just interested in sticking with one caliber and trying some new firearms!"

I had a 10rd SGM and a 5rd OEM magazine which were amazing, tight in the magwell and with no issues at all. Sold em both to get this PROMAG drum. I guess I didnt fit the drum correctly to the mag well because it wobbles a little. However, I took it to the range and didnt have any problems once I set the gas plug. All the supplies and labor put into this shotgun equals roughly $1300. I would like to try and sell it for $1000 shipped to your FFL from my FFL. OR BEST OFFER. You can pick it up locally and I will pay the transfer fee. Please make sure your local laws allow you to possess this firearm before transaction occurs.

A drag handle is attached to the vest.

(2) One Triple Mag Pouch for pistol magazines. It will hold three mags. It is Coyote tan, or something like that.

(3) One 1911 Holster with single mag or flashlight pouch. It is OD green.

This is a Weatherby PA-459 12 guage pump action shotgun. I've taken one trip to the range and fired a box of Federal game load- so the shell count is 20 and you can rest assured that the shotgun is fully functional and ready for action. It is in as good condition as you would expect a shotgun to be that has sat in the safe for all but one half day of its life.

Im posting the shogun here only because i've decided to move back to semi-auto shotguns, as that is where the bulk of my experience lies. Therefore, trades I will consider are for semi-automatic shotguns in good condition, though I prefer something magazine fed such as a Saiga 12. I would add cash of course to such a deal.

I've provided a link to the product page of the manufacturer's web site to provide you with the finer details and a video. Please dont hesitate to e-mail me with any questions you might have. Thanks for looking!

The aluminum shell is a sleeper from a semi truck, which has the factory interior removed. Depending on the size of the sleeper up to 4 people can fit inside of one stand, and they are wide enough to lay down in and take a nap if you wanted to. The interior is completely customizable to however you wanted, with gun rests on the windows, or racks, stools, chairs or benches, with the capability to have shelves for storage. 

Depending on the model of sleeper there are multiple opening/closing windows that can be secured and sunshades/ awnings can be put on to block rain or sun. 

The stand is angle iron and can be made to any height, or the sleeper can be set on the ground.

Each sleeper has a lockable door to keep out trespassers.

These photos are the only ones I have so far, but during this season I sill get some nice photos of the interiors.

Im putting this ad out to see if or how much interest there is. We don’t have a price set on them because there are too many variables depending on what you want, but if your interested drop me an email with what you want and Ill get a quote back to you.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy."
