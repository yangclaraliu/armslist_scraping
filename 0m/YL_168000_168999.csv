Now if you previously emailed me about this feel free to do it again as I thought it was sold.

Here I have a very nice H&R Young America Kids 22 Rimfire Pistol. Now the Young America series spanned from a black powder version in the 1890’s into the last version of 1942. Unfortunately H&R has a bad track record of keeping exact production date lists for serial numbers as it was not a high priority. There is generally considered to be two main versions and the 1st one is the black powder version. Now there is the 2nd version which was the modern smokeless powder cartridges, however there is a few sub versions in the 2nd version. There is a few key differences in the 2nd version and the 1st the name itself as the original name was the Young America as later in the production life of the revolver it changed slightly to Young American which they just added the N to the end of the name. Then there is the fact that this one is Blued as the majority of them were Nickel finish and it is estimated that less than 5% were Blued which causes a Blued version to bring a minimum premium of 15% or more over the normal value. As seen the condition of my Young America is very good! I am including 3 photos of this beauty but have many more so email me for more. I was offered $200 from the owner of a local gun shop. So I figure I will start at $250 and see what I can get. I realize that H&R is not generally considered collectible but there is a few H&R firearms that are collectible like this kids pistol that dates from somewhere in the 1920’s to 1930’s. You can see that this is tiny by the $20 used to scale the size, this is truly unique. Also this is chambered in 22 Short, it says 22 Rimfire but will not chamber 22LR but could possibly chamber 22 Long. I have fired this many times and it shoots good considering it’s such a small revolver, I have personally fired 150 rds of 22 Short through this pistol. As I sated, this shoots quite well but with its small size and my large hands it can be a little uncomfortable but then again it is designed for a child’s hand."

This one is an all black R9 that has been shot about 125 times, and never holstered. I bought to carry but just never have. All the paperwork, extra magazine and unused Desantis pocket holster come with it. It's a great gun.

The stock has been sporterized and this rifle has exceptional accuracy with a nice bore. Stock is clean and has only minor (3) flaws while the rest of the rifle is of excellent quality. Bluing is great with exception of the crest-removal area (Treaty of Versailles). All parts match with matching numbers U3747 (if I'm not mistaken, the pictures can show you if I am). Over-all this rifle is great for both target shooting, sport, collecting, AND Deer/Elk season. 

My reason for selling is simply that my tastes have changed. I have only fired this rifle once (10 rounds with a 1.25 inch grouping) and see it being a shame to have it sit around without someone taking more  pleasure in it. I have moved more towards rifles of WWI and beyond and am slowly selling the rest of what I had. 

I had bought this rifle off of a guy who didn't know anything about it (came upon it by a deceased grandfather) and am not looking to make a fortune off of it. My price is low simply because I cannot afford to just have it take up space.

Also willing to throw in a case of 20 FREE 7.62x54R rounds I found laying around the house!

E-Mail me or call/text me for more pictures and serious inquires. My cell number is REDACTED. I am NOT opposed to anyone making an offer if they see fit.

Looking for about $450 (obo), which isn't bad considering that you will save the money from sales tax, FFL fees, overnight shipping, background check, etc.

Would love to trade for another pistol, especially from the XD line. Looking for larger rounds, preferably 40 S&W. Any possible trades considered, just let me know what you've got. Willing to trade up or down for the right item, too. (Either you have something less expensive and include cash, or your item is more expensive and I kick in some cash on my end)

Fister13f gave me another 12 rounder without the extension, but you can pick those up for about $10 or so. It doesn't affect function, only aesthetics and grip dimension.

The stiple job on the grip I did myself, and it makes a world of difference if you do any shooting outdoors in warm weather. I also put Trijicon night sights on it, green front yellow rear.

Don't know the round count, although I believe it's less than 1,000. I bought it from someone on the forum here awhile back and I've only put about 250 rounds through it since. IIRC, they said they only put about 500 through it.

I've have the gun for about five months now and absolutely love it. It's incredibly accurate for a combat spec gun (you'd almost think it's a target pistol but for the small 3-dot sights) and has had zero failures of any kind with several hundred rounds down the pipe. The coat is beautiful and shows no signs of wear at all.

I'm selling the gun with four magazines (two Mec-Gar 17 rounders, one CZ 10 rounder, and one CZ 15 rounder), the original box, manual, a speed loader, and the original plastic anatomic grips - currently the gun has factory rubber grips installed (they're extremely comfortable).

I'd consider trading for a Sig 2022 or 226 in .40 S&W (plus another gun or cash on my end), but am mostly looking to sell straight up.

The Museum of the Confederacy Tribute Revolver combines the classic design of the fabled LeMat revolver with striking 24-karat gold and nickel artwork honoring the legacy of the Confederate soldiers and their leaders who valiantly fought for the cause of the Confederacy.

The LeMat's unique nine-shot cylinder holds the portraits of three of the Confederacy's favorite sons. Right side features revered Confederate General Robert E. Lee, and the left side features the gallant Cavalry Major General J.E.B. Stuart. 

Both are surrounded by flowing scrollwork and crossed rifles of the Confederate Infantry. Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America, is featured on top of the cylinder.

The frame of the Tribute is adorned on both sides with a Confederate flag displayed within a field of scrollwork. The ""CS"", or Confederate States, belt buckle is featured on the breech of the barrel. The official seal of the Museum of the Confederacy is also featured on the smoothbore shotgun barrel, surrounded by matching scrollwork.

Along the right side of the barrel, the issue is identified as ""The Museum of the Confederacy Tribute"" in a classic banner tipped in matching scrollwork. Each Tribute's individual edition number is featured on top of the barrel near the sight."

 I purchased this for my girlfriend but never did mount it or even install batteries because the night I took it too her house I forgot to take the drill and never got around to mounting it or installing batteries and programming the combo and she and I are no longer and I came home recently and found it sitting on the front porch.
Again its brand new and includes all books and manuals for changing the combination, warranty papers, keys,mounting hardware etc.
 I have one in the livingroom mounted under the coffee table for quick access but safe from the hands of my kid and his friends and one in the bedroom and one in my jeep which I never have the top on so it gives me a safe place to keep the pistol or spare keys (And wallet from the old lady) yet gives the quickest access Ive found by just laying your hand on top of and pressing. The following website will show all the details. I will ship it for actual shipping cost to anywhere you choose or meet you in the knoxville area anytime or anyday as Im retired.
Id trade it for something of equal value(Retail cost was 159.00 and I think I paid right at 180 with the tax ) but Ive seen them as cheap as 119.00. I think 80 bucks is more than fair especially since brand new. Check out all the details and pictures here

The stock is in excellent shape with the normal amount of wear and marks of a 50+ year old rifle that has been used and loved.



The rifle comes with the high-top scope mount and scope. This mount allows use of the iron sights or scope. It's a standard 4x32mm scope. It also had a tapco 20rd composite magazine.

I am also including the original receiver and internal 10rd magazine along with 60rd of Wolf 7.62x39 ammo.

I'm not really looking for any trades.
