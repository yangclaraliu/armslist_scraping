Brass is Silver State Armory with some Hornady, all small primer pockets. Rifle comes with 4 rail covers and a few ladder covers as well. Rail has a few dings and scratches, the rest of the rifle shows some rub marks and light marks, nothing major at all.

Look at the reviews online, and you'll see two sides.  The first side (the snobs who wouldn't get caught dead with a gun under $500 and has never owned them) say they are junk because they are so inexpensive.  

The other side (the folks who own one) swear by the reliability, function, and awesome lifetime service of Hi-Point.  Having owned several, I'm a big fan (look online and read for yourself).  I've never had a misfire or failure to feed (except once when breaking in a 45 with HP ammo... but only during break-in, and it only hung up once)

I came across this and already have one, but couldn't pass on the deal.  

I'm passing the deal on to you.  I am not negotiable on the price, sorry.  I know, and you know, that $100 for a brand new 9mm pistol is a deal.  This will not last long at all.  First $100 bill takes it.

Comes with an additional magazine, and an additional ""ghost ring"" back site.  (these extras don't usually come stock with a new gun)


Must be an Ohio resident with a drivers license...and an upstanding citizen.

Again, price is firm... please don't tell me you have $70 cash in hand, right now...  It will sell, and pretty quickly for $100, depending on who can meet me where I want first.

G23.FTS



The 3X magnifier is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting. 



This is the 2nd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers a half inch more eye relief, positions the windage and elevation adjustments inside of the optic rather than in the mount, less moving parts in the mount which makes the mount even more stable, and has a quick release throw lever on the bottom of the mount which allows the quick removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.



 3x magnifier with Flip-To-Side mount and quick detach. Works with all existing HWS units.

Mount

 Length: 1.6"" (40.6mm)

 Height: 1.64"" (41.65mm) Clears common low profile flip up rear iron sights

 Weight: 4.5oz (128 grams)

 Color/Finish: Non reflective black with hard coat finish

 Flip Orientation: Ambidextrous mount to allow left or right flip

 Rail Interface: Fixed Picatinny with single mounting bolt.

Magnifier Interface: Retained by ARMS® throw

 Optical Axis Adjustment: Horizontal and vertical adjustments within mount

 Works with either 3x magnifier

With the gun I am throwing in a free third magazine, from the factory in Daytona, that costs $25. (The gun only comes with 2 magazines stock).

Please note: I also had the factory in Daytona modify the gun per their standards to disable the safety, which is very easy to flip up while firing the gun otherwise. It can be changed back to the original settings yourself or by shipping the gun to the factory in Daytona.

Gun has a LIFETIME warranty from SCCY independent of the owner.

This pistol is the new upgraded version of the P99 that was released earlier this year. It is very hard to find and many people want it because of the excellent ergonomics, accuracy and reliability. It is often compared to a HK P30 as you can see from the pictures. They retail for over $600 new and this one only has a magazine through it. Looks perfect! $550 takes her and the ammo home. Comes complete with box, manual, interchangeable grips, and two factory 12rd magazines. FTF in Colorado Springs area, must be 21 and be able to legally own a handgun.

I did not keep count but there is less than 200 rounds through it, possibly less than 100.  It looks brand new (minus the normal external finish wear on the barrel from firing it). Not a single nick or blemish.  Only issue is that I started to stipple the large grip insert as a test case as the small and medium fit my hand better.  Can complete the stippling if desired. 

Comes with everything that came with it from the factory, including:

Ruger M77 in 308, great condition. The scope and rings are no longer included with  the rifle. Minor wear. Rubber stop on buttstock shows wear. Overall in good condition. This is a great rifle. You wont find another one for less than $450. Especially in .308. The only reason I decided to sell it is to make room for a new rifle. 

First come first serve. It'll go fast so dont wait. Need it gone yesterday

Parting with it isn't easy however I want a new project. It is a late 90's model stainless steel mini 14 in perfect shape and clean as a whistle. Mini 14's are one of the most reliable 223. on the market and my bullet count speaks for itself.		
   I have put aprox. 350-400rds down range (broken in) smooth as silk never a stovepipe nor a jam with the Ruger clips at least. The off brand ones I can’t say the same. You can only load 29 out of 30rds or you will get a stovepipe on the last round. With the bullpup stock I have had 2in groupings at 50yrds and 3½in at 75yrds.  This is perfect for home defense with it only being 26½ inches long it is very light and maneuverable. The red dot clone sight has a green setting for night vision they are both very bright and both have 10x brightness settings.  The only real difference between this and an Eotech is the dots for droppage are nonexistent but you can guestimate for range. Anyone who says otherwise is just sore because they over paid. The UTG flashlight is bright as hell! It would blind a burglar in a flash. Everything I have changed on this gun was done with no gunsmithing and is completely reversible should you want to switch back to the original hardware. I will include all original furniture with purchase which includes a rugged rubber black Houge stock and the original rear sight. The bayonet lug/front sight I sold to a friend but they run around 25 bucks. 				
   This is a great starter gun for people who want to tinker or modify as it is so easy to disassemble and clean and there are lots of accessories. It is also a good rifle for people who are new to firearms as the kick is low and the sound is mild. I have modified this gun into a bullpup and added a few home defense base accessories great for any survival situation or just plinking at the range. It is painted using local flora and Krylon camouflage paint.

There is slight holster wear on the slide but it is very light and doesn't effect the function at all. I'm only selling to move up to a G17, it just fits my hands better. I have approx. 400 rounds through it at best.

Gun is in great shape, with just a few small spots on the front of the barrel that needs to be touched up, it is not rust.

Price is 230, I am not making any money on this gun. 
Losing $20, but need the money.
Will meet anywhere within Clarksville to Rivergate.

XD45 compact – 4” barrel. black on black. I had tru glo fiber optic night sights put on it last year, nice and bright. I’ve put maybe 100 rounds through this gun, iv’e shot it twice and it’s lived in the safe. Never been carried. Comes with original case/papers/XD gear (holsters, mag holsters etc).

Includes two original 10 round mags. I will also throw in one 13 rounds hi-cap mag as the XD’s will take higher cap magazines in the same caliber in the compact guns. I will also include 2 factory XD “sleeves” or “spacers” so that you can use the hi-cap 13 rnd mags and slip these sleeves over them to take up the space between the grip and the floor plate. first pic shws the gun with the high cap mag and spacer, 2nd picture is gun itself no mag. 10 rounders fit flush. Pretty awesome stuff.

Asking $450.

This is a used Sig Sauer P6 9mm pistol. The P6 is the West German Police version of the commercial Sig P225. The P6 has a heavier double action pull (12lbs) and a different hammer, but is essentially the same pistol. This pistol shows very little holster wear, and very little wear on the internal parts. The bore is bright and clean. This is a great shooter, light and slim, easy for any size hands, great for teaching new shooters or keeping costs down with 9mm ammunition. This is a ""numbers matching"" P6, meaning the barrel, slide and frame are all factory original. This P6 will come with two factory Sig Sauer magazines (8 rounds), factory box and 200+ rounds of ammo. Sig Sauer pistols have that to hell and back reliability and this pistol is no different. Read the P6 and P225 reviews and see for yourself. I am selling because I'm just ready for a change.

I am asking $500 firm cash or trades listed above. Email with any questions or possible trades, lemme know what you've got.
