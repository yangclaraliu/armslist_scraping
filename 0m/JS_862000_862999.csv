Im tired of this state. All of us law abiding gun owners have to suffer with the new laws. We follow the laws of this land. We think and act responsible so we can have these rights and they keep taking more right from us. While the non law abiding scumbags get to do what they want. All these laws will only do one thing drive up the black market and put more guns in non abiding hands.   This state treats us like criminals when you apply for your carry permit or buy a rifle and now even ammo. Whats next ? Take away your shotgun because its considered a item of massdestuction or your bolt action because it gets labeled a sniper rifle and we dont need a firearm that can shoot distance. Maybe even take away bb guns? Dont say it cant happen you give up a little and they want it all. We work with them and they tell us thats not enough, that it is going to be there way. They take away the  2nd amendment next when our kids are older they take away freedom of speech. Then our grandchildren are told what they can do and where they can do it. 
The sheeple need to wake up. Our elected officals will not be getting my vote next time. And NYS will not be getting anymore money from me for hunting licences. Let them figure out how they are going to come up with the loss of revenue from people boycotting this and I hope out of staters refuse to buy out of state licences. Calling and emailing our elected officals did nothing they made there own choices not what the people want. 

I hope fellow law abiding citizens That belive in the 2nd amendment stand with me and hurt there pockets.Its the only way to do it. They dont care that remington will lose jobs, but if NY elected officals dont  have enough money to add jobs for there friends and family or to pay for the added pork in the laws. Then they will open there eyes.  
NYS GETS OVER $18,500,000 IN CONSERVATION GROSS REVENUE FROM US. LETS TAKE IT AWAY. If you belive in your rights stand with me and boycott if we dont need our rights then they dont need our money.
Its the only way! 99% can get meat from the store and skip a year hunting maybe a few years until they listen.

the bottom rifle is a winchester x-150 blackpowder. the barrel on it is a .50 cal, and it also comes with a .45 cal barrel. the stock is the original winchester camo stock. the .45 barrel is all ready for you to throw your scope on it. both of these barrels are fluted and in good shape.  both barrels are a 1:28 twist.

also have an AR 15 with 11 PMAGS. it's the full size with the 20"" barrel. it's a damn fine gun. really don't wanna get rid of it. but if the offer is right for it, i may let it go.

Only put a few hundred rounds through it.  Not even fully broken in.  Has a cheap 4x20 scope on it but I also have a rear pop-up iron sight that I can include instead.  

Fun to build but now looking for something a little different.  Actually looking for newer generation (580 etc) Mini-14 or Mini-30.  Would prefer a tactical version but will listen to other offers.  

Not trying to gouge anyone but I know how the market is right now.  My main goal is to trade this.  If I have to put a price on it, it will be $1200 so I can cover the cost of actually buying a Mini in this market.

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about
function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged
Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a
thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the
shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a
similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for
faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package
of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2)
magazines and a holster.

SIG556® SWAT Like the SIG556, the SIG556 SWAT features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by SIG’s sister company Swiss Arms and marries it to a trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle’s weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines. The SIG556 SWAT features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The high performance flash suppressor provides enhanced flash reduction and features an ACME type thread for compatibility with select industry sound suppression devices. The flash suppressor retains a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The vented tactical quad rail forearm is machined from aircraft grade aluminum alloy and hard coat anodized for durability. The quad rail features four integrated steel Picatinny rails for mounting a wide range of accessories. The Picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength carbon steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® finish. The rifle comes standard with the flip up combat front and rear sight system. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines. A 30-round magazine is supplied with each rifle. The rifle features the MAGPUL CTR Carbine Buttstock. This buttstock is adjustable for length of pull and features a unique locking mechanism that friction locks the stock to the receiver extension for zero movement. The ergonomically designed pistol grip features an integrated storage compartment. The rifle also includes the Grip-Light vertical forend grip which features a removable tactical LED flashlight and mounts directly to the quad rail forend.

SIG 556 Rifle Wins NRA Tactical Gun of the Year 

Few semi-automatic rifles have captured the imagination of the shooting public like the SG 550 series. For years this legendary Swiss-made rifle has been restricted to law enforcement and military sales, where it has acquired a reputation for reliability, durability and accuracy. Now, SIG Sauer has developed a U.S. made version called the SIG 556 ... .” So stated Shooting Editor Glenn Gilbert in “Like a Swiss Watch” (December 2007, p. 46).

Both 556 SWAT and full-length versions feature the quality shooters have come to expect from SIG, including steel Picatinny rails fixed to the tops of their receivers and military-grade cold-hammer-forged barrels. But these are fully updated designs. Significant changes have been made to the lower receiver and the stock. The cast aluminum lower receiver retains the ambidextrous safety lever of the original 550, but the magazine well has been modified to take commercial and surplus AR-15/M16-style magazines. Further, given the crisp break and limited overtravel of its trigger, the SIG 556’s accuracy was commendable.

“The bottom line, simply stated,” wrote Gilbert, “is that the SIG 556 is an exceptionally accurate and reliable semi-automatic rifle whose performance is more than enough to justify its existence.” That shared sentiment among staffers resulted in the SIG Sauer 556 being named the first-ever American Rifleman Tactical Gun of the Year."

I bought it this summer and it is in pretty good condition and comes with the box, lock, paperwork, and a speedloader.   These guns are surprisingly accurate for a 2inch snub and this one is no exception.  Absolutely nothing wrong with it, however I'm looking to see if I could find something lighter for concealed carry.  I like to ankle carry but this thing feels like a brick strapped to my leg and has been making me sore lately.  WOuld probably be better as an IWB gun, but I haven't bothered to try.  People keep asking, it IS a .357, the marking is right under the .38 special marking, if you zoom in on the picture you can see it.  I've also fired .357's out of it as well with no issues.

So, I'm wondering if someone would be willing to trade for something lighter weight that would be a bit more comfortable for carry.  I'm looking for another snub nosed .38 (It's a .357 but I never use them).  I prefer ones with an exposed hammer for single action use, but doesnt have to be.  Would really like an LCR .38, but I'm open to other options as well.  Would be a great choice if you're wanting to ""upgrade"" to a .357 magnum.  No Charter arms please.  Ftf only

I might also trade for a full sized (4-8in barrel) .357 for range use and hunting and so I can work on my handloads.
Might also be willing to trade for something in .45, but again, primarily looking for a wheelgun.  NO HI POINTS, already have one that I dont use."

This is a Mosin-Nagant rifle (1943 Izhevsk) that was converted into a sniper. The scope, mount and the rifle are in excellent condition. Sure, it ain't an original sniper it is the closest you can get to one without buying the real thing. 

Includes over 60 rounds of 7.62x54R ammo (24 soft point hunting rounds and 40+ FMJ) and a bayonet

Looking to sell for cash but I might take trades if i'm interested in what you have. 

Email if you want more pictures, have questions, or if you want to buy it. 

Thanks for looking! 

questions that have been asked:

Q: Is the scope and mount original? 
A: I know it is Russian made and has all the features of a genuine PU scope (steel construction, german post reticle that moves in the field of view when adjusted, etc). However, it is in very good shape. Almost too good to have been from the  WWII era. There is no date stamped on it so I have no way of telling when it was made. One of my pictures shows the marking on the scope. I wish I could tell you more but that's all I really know about it. 

Q: Will you ship it to me? 
A: If you cover all the expenses and keep it legal yes. I'll need your FFL's contact info when you email me if you would like it shipped. After i discuss it with them I'll get back to you with the total price including the shipping and their fees. If it is shipped I'll accept postal money order only (no checks). The rifle will ship as soon as I recieve payment. 

Q: will you sell the scope and mount seperate?
A: yes if you make me a good enough offer for it. Keep in mind that is the most expensive part of this rifle so you'll have to offer the majority of my asking price for me to even consider it. 

Q: will you sell for cash or trade locally? 
A: yes. I will meet you in the Titusville, PA (16354) area. Only arrange to meet if you are serious and definitely going to buy the rifle. If you have questions not answered here fell free to email and ask. I won't waste time and gas to meet with you if you are not buying."

Been using it for concealed but time for something new. Great conceal pistol with great reviews. Comes with original box and 1 mag. Also including 1 box (50 rounds) of Magtech FMJ and 28 rounds of Federal Hydra Shock HP. Will also throw in a nice IWB leather holster for it. PRICE IS FIRM.
