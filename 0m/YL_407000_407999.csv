Super low hours total 194!  Brand new wheels and brand new Maxxis tires on front and back – over $600.  Battery less than a year old.  Has Honda GPScape so you’ll never get lost in the woods/on the trails.  Never been mudded or submerged in water.  Fuel gauge and all lights/mechanical items are in 100% working order. Needs absolutely nothing.  

Only “issue” is a small crack in the front plastic, under the front rack…cosmetic issue only and can’t even see it with the crates that are zip tied to the rack. Has both automatic drive and manual push button shift. Can be driven as 4X4 or 2 wheel drive with the push of a button. Has both original keys and the owner’s manual. Comes with 2 brand new oil filters as well as the camo saddle bags on the gas tank. Sorry, the ammo can is not included but the crates that are zip tied on the racks are.

Above average condition and hours on this machine and the new wheels/tires make this a great buy.  You will not be disappointed.  I’ll give it a good wash as it’s a bit dusty from sweeping the garage.  Started at least once per week and ridden around the yard/neighborhood at least once per month to keep everything fresh.  Had this for our land and it just does not get used so it’s ready for a new owner!  No other reason I am selling it except that it’s been a garage queen for the most part.

For sale is a very eye-catching, 2000 Chevy Camaro Z28 with a SS clone appearance. Beautiful Red exterior with charcoal gray cloth interior. Power everything, Monsoon audio system, T-tops, cruise control, automatic. This has been my baby and everyday driver during the summer (has never been drove in the winter!).

This is not your run of the mill car, a lot has been done to this car to make it stand out like it does. It has over $6500 worth of upgrades, not including paint or labor!

When I had time during my summers, this was my show car. It placed 3rd at Dropfest (one of the largest custom car shows in the midwest), it also has a 1st and 2nd place trophy's from other local car shows. Pictures are of the actual car for sale!

It has just under 100k miles. Has been taken well care of and has had proper oil changes done by the local Chevy dealer. I also have only run premium gas through it.

Believe it or not, this car gets an amazing 27mpg on the highway!! Yes it wasn't a typo, a 300+hp car can get 27mpg on the highway. This is possible, because the engine turns at a very low rpm on the highway because of the power it has, so your able to get this great gas mileage without sacrificing power. City driving averages around 20mpg.

This car was dyno'd and was making close to 300hp at the wheels and will run low 13's high 12's in the quarter mile.

While it is an amazing car it could use a new front tire (rears were recently replaced) and it does have a couple normal nicks and dings. You must see this car to believe it.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 5.65 lb - ideal for tactical use.

The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.

Bolt-receiver-floorplate-trigger guard-stock are numbers matching.  Receiver top final acceptance stamp #135 MO stamped over #26 MB.  All other stamps are MO #135, except bolt root is subcontractor #140 FN yet also matching serial number to receiver, so the bolt was made in Nazi occupied Belgium then shipped back to Germany.  A knowledgeable K98 collector sent me this recent information. A 1944 dated barrel could not be on a rifle made in 1943, and Mauser Oberndorf did not supply ordnance spares in 1944. It is an MB (ar) receiver, but it was final assembled at MO (byf), the stock final and the top final of the receiver show that it was made in 1944 at MO (byf), the barrel means it was not assembled in 1943. It is not uncommon to find component sharing between MO & MB, or for that matter MO (byf) sub-contracting to other firms.  The bolt body was actually an FN part, also part of MO parent company (DWM) at the time. You can find FN bolts in both MO (byf) and MB (ar) rifles.  The bolt body was made in occupied Belgium under Nazi supervision at FN, then shipped back to Germany to be used in this run of rifles- yet the bolt is serial number matching, stamped with receiver s/n when assembled at Oberndorf.  It is unusual as this type of make up is not seen usually on an AR/43 stamped rifle, but almost all AR/44 are just like this rifle. They are hard rifles to find matching & original. This is almost certainly an early 1944 BYF assembled gun, due to the manner in which the trigger guard and stock are marked - an AR/43 wouldn't mark the floorplate like this. Code deciphers to AR 43 1943 Mauser AG Borsigwalde. This was a battlefield pickup brought home by a GI and later sporterized.  the stock was cut back to lower band, and the top handguard removed.  Otherwise it is NUMBERS MATCHING including the stock, bolt, floorplate, trigger guard, firing pin, bolt shroud, cocking piece, rear sight base and ladder.  This gun is a perfect candidate for a restoration.  The stock has been burned on the left side in the wrist area and below the thumb notch.  The gun functions 100% and is very accurate.  The story is the gun was picked up from a burned up dead Wehrmacht German soldier.  The bore is nearly perfect and would be mirror if cleaned.  I have not cleaned the barrel thoroughly with a brush and solvent.  Add a complete stock and handguard and upper band, and you have a high dollar numbers matching K98.  This is a scarce gun with these stamps on it and numbers matching.  PRICE $600 plus $35 s/h east coast, $45 west coast, California $50, Alaska and Hawaii $75 shipping."

I have a short attention span, I have to get rid of some that don't get any action.

Here's what we have:

Saiga .308: Converted trigger group, (3) Surefire 20 round mags ($40 each).  Dragunov style stock, optic rail and mount (made in Belarus, I think), 22 inch barrel. About 200 rounds fired, surprisingly accurately.  SOLD.

Tikka T3 Lite .30-06: tack driver, like all Tikkas.  Super light, bolt and trigger are smooth as glass.  Added cheek riser just for fun, bipod - I have to verify manufacturer on that, and scope.  Rifle has about 150 rounds fired.  Scope is over sized for the rifle, so I'm happy to sell it separately.  It is a Burris Signature Select, 8-32x44mm, US made.  Do your research, it's a nice optic for the money.  SPF SPF

Last but not least is the Galil Golani Sporter .223:  This will be a shame to lose.  CAI milled receiver (best work they've ever done), UTG quad rail, (4) 35 round mags, all steel side fold stock - not the ATI junk, flip up night sights (no tritium but they glow, tritium inserts are available).  I have original forend as well, but I'll have to go digging for it.  Rifle has about 500 rounds through it, so maybe another 30,000 or 40,000 left in its lifespan.  SOLD

If you have any questions, let me know.  All rifles work 100%, never a single malfunction with any of them.  

I am open to trades, but prefer cash.  As for trades, quality over quantity please.  Socoms, eotech, aimpoint,  I've been looking for a Luger, Sig pistols, HK pistols, a Mare's Leg in .357 or .44 mag, XD-M .45 to name a few.

No criminals.  No felons.  Must show valid ID, FTF sales only.  No shipping please.

I have four rifles for sale. I want some new camera gear and was told I need to part with some of my toys. :(

I have an Olympic Arms AR-15 rifle 


Century Arms AK-47 type underfolder Model: M70AB2 I bought this new and it has not been fired to my knowledge.

You can see what the exact same model (M70AB2) is going for: http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=287541164


Century Arms AK-47 type, standard stock. Model M70B1

The AK's are not the cheaper Romanian or Chinese but are Yugoslavian.


Cetme Sporter 308 (copy of the HK91)

FOR AN ADDITIONAL $200 ($2,600 total) I will throw in the following:

1. a 9mm AR Upper with one magazine. This allows your AR to covert from 5.56/.223 to 9mm! It's pretty cool! See picture of what your AR will look like with the 9mm upper attached

2. 4 standard AR 15 30rd mags

3. 4 twenty round 308 mags for CETME

4. 6 AK 7.62 mags for the two AK rifles

5. APPROXIMATELY 350 rounds or so of ammunition to get you started.

Selling all together. This is a great way to jump start your collection and get a great deal.

I will not break up the collection. They are priced to move. If there a gun you don't want then you can sell it and maybe make a bit on on it.

I will also not go lower as I have an offer from a dealer for the package at $2,100 (without 9mm upper, mags and ammo) who then has to turn around, sell and make a profit. So these rifles are priced very well. If they don't sell here then I will just take his offer and not have to deal with the hassle of selling them myself.

If you get these at a dealer you will pay more AND pay sales tax. If you buy online you will have to pay $30-40 shipping and the inbound dealer transfer fee of about $25-$35 on EACH gun.

Its a super nice gun just wasnt really what I was wanting it turns out, its a bit heavy. Shoots good, it does have FTF on the second round out of the mag for some reason on occasion but Im thinking its due the gun not being used much. The gun has less than 200rds through it. It uses CCI mini mag the best. Does have an Extended charging handle to help with charging when you have a scope on the rifle. does have the the ipc factory scope rail. Also installed a small piece of metal and painted to match in the mag release to aid in relasing the mag. It can be removed if the buyer does not really like it it just screws in and out (can been seen in one of the pics). Includes 1 factory 10rd mag.

Now there is PRVI AMMO and it is only 98gr which is the latest ammo found for this pistol on line, this ammo makes a popping sound when used, but it is OK for plunking.

This is a real fine piece of history, there will come a day when this pistol will be a rare collectors item, especially in the excellent condition as this one is. There are pistols like mine for sale on line the only problem is they have the name of the suppler stamped across the frame, makes it look ugly. 

The Nagant Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire.

The Nagant was chambered for a proprietary cartridge 7.62, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile to be suppressed at 1000fps (an unusual ability for a revolver). 

If you would like to take a closer look and buy this Russian 1895 7.62 Nagant Pistol, call REDACTED or reply by e-mail.

The two pictures are stock photos just to see what it looks like. The pistol you will receive is in 50% better condition.

Remington Model 51 pistol chambered in .380 ACP and manufactured in 1922. Excellent ergonomics.

This pistol was designed by John D. Pedersen of Pedersen device fame. The model 51 is considered by many to be one of the best pocket pistols ever made. This is due in large part to the amount of research that went into the development of the grip shape and angle. It is said that John Pedersen tried out over 70 grip designs before choosing the one to be used on the model 51.
