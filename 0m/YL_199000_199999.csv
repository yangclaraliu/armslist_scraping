This is the Mil-Spec version with some upgrades.  Wilson combat match trigger, Wilson combat skeletonized hammer, Wilson combat extended beavertail grip safety. It's also got match style sights equipped, adjustable elevation and windage, but I'm unsure of the make.  I've also added some great wrap-around Hogue grips. The mainsrping housing has been swapped out as well, to an arched from a flat. This was a Wilson combat MSH. The 3 mags included are a factory 7 round mag, Chip McCormick 8 round mag, and a stainless Mec-Gar (great mags IMO) 7 round mag. Also as seen in the pics, included is the double mag pouch that came factory from Springfield. This particular 1911 doesn't not have a full length guide rod installed, but does have a newer 18lb recoil spring in place.

I've put approximately 500 rounds through this firearm, the previous owner had a similar low round count.  2008 manuf. date on this firearm.  I would rate the condition of this 1911 in 90-95%.  As you can see from the pictures, I did at one time NOT have an idiot scratch, but as this was my first 1911, it was unavoidable.  Nonetheless, it still looks great.  And since then, have learned a few tricks of how to avoid further scratching the finish.

Trade Interests-

Looking to trade straight up for a Gen 3 and up (RTF and RTF2 models included, hoping for a fish gill serrations model) Glock 36 or Glock 30.  Preferably with night sights (Meprolights). Also, interested in an FNX-45 (stainless or black). I would be interested in all types of firearms chambered in .45 ACP, so don't hesitate to offer what you have if interested. Would also prefer some type of IWB holster included on your end, as I'm including an OWB (came with the 1911) and an IWB (Galco TR212, great holster IMO) in my trade.  Now for some pics.

After shooting many different guns at the range (not an M&P), my wife said that she liked the Springfield XDM the best. So after a little more research, I went with my own choice of the S&W M&P 9mm. After two trips to the range and exactly 216 rounds, she wanted the XDM instead. So, we now own an XDM and the M&P needs a new home. The pistol has the ambi thumb safety and no magazine disconnect. It's just like new, except the white dot on the front sight popped out about round 180 ( a common problem, I'm told). If you have any questions, let me know.

Reflecting the best of its Finnish heritage, the Finn Bear is an extremely affordable version of our popular Sisu. It's ideal for hunting, fishing or camping trips, and makes an efficient utility knife as well! The 4116 Krupp Stainless blade is hollow ground and given an Rc hardness of 56-57, so it will hold a good edge and is easy to re-sharpen. Its blade shape is centuries old and practical because of its good sturdy point for piercing and long belly for skinning, cutting and carving. It's big and strong enough to skin a Moose, yet thin and delicate enough to slice a tomato or cut up an apple. The Finn Bear has a straight handle with a slightly ribbed texture for traction. Its modified diamond cross section will fit your hand like a glove and accommodate a wide variety of gripping methods. It's made of Zytel, one of the strongest glass reinforced plastics available, so it will last for many years and never rot, crack, warp or mildew. For safety and convenience, the Finn Bear comes with a deep pouch style Cordura sheath and generously sized belt loop so it can be worn on the waist, slung around the neck or tossed into a duffle bag or tackle box.

229,http://www.armslist.com/posts/199229,For Sale:  'Cold Steel' Kudu folder Brand New in Box,"old town, Fort Collins, Colorado",$ 9,"Listed On: Monday, November 28, 2011",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a brand new knife in the original packaging.

In South Africa, an inexpensive ring lock folder is sold everywhere. It's a good design, but it's constructed from sub-standard materials, is poorly made, and is horribly overpriced. And yet, millions of these knives are sold there each year. Well, we thought we could do better, in the quality of materials, cutting performance, and in price.

The Cold Steel Kudu, takes some cues from its South African competition, but our version is vastly superior. Ours has a Krupp 4116 Stainless steel flat ground blade, heat treated to Rc 56-57 for better edge holding ability and ease of re-sharpening, and a thin razor sharp edge.

For safety, we have thoroughly tested the locking mechanism and are well satisfied it will hold the blade rigidly open until you decide to close it by pulling up on the ring attached to the back spring.

The handle of the Kudu also reflects our dedication to making an effective and affordable folder. It's made of 43% glass reinforced ZytelÂ®. This material has proven to be extremely strong, and is stiff enough to complement the blade and spring when locked open. Plus, the gripping surface has a wood grain texture for traction and features an attractive polished steel Kudu horn emblem for a little extra flair! We think the Kudu represents an unbelievable value. It's ready for anything and makes a wonderful work knife, utility knife, bait knife, or hunting knife.

REVIEWS
Best all around ! 

These are great !!! with a little tweaking on the lock these knifes can be opened and closed with a flick of the wrist....I.m a diver,this knife is a good replacement 
for any underwater cutter ....even in salt water this knife can hang with the high dollar brands.

Great Value in a Folder 

Sure there are better quality folders, but for what you have to pay, the Kudu is one great value! The blade can be taken to razor sharp and it performs a wide range of tasks without complaint. While a little large, I've carried this in my back pocket, both at work and at play. It has sliced snacks, carved pumpkins for Halloween, helped build models, prepared meals, cut bait and rope all with equal ease. The knife's good looks always draw comments as well.

It is the pride and joy of my collection but bills need to be paid. This is a true GUN.

The gun is stainless steel and says ""SW 1911"" in large letters on one side. It has had a trigger job done, incredibly smooth. An extended guide rod has been placed into the slide for much better accuracy for anyone shooting it. Rubberized grips have been installed for greater control and comfort. Fiber optic (not night sights) have been installed for better aiming, a red one in the front and two green on the back. And finally an extended magazine drop button has been added for easier and more tactical use.

The gun comes with 2 magazines and about 60 rounds of tactical and range ammo (about 20/40).

Has only been fired 5 times since  finished it. This is a very nice gun. I need to sell to make some room for our new baby thats on the way. This would make someone a nice bird hunting gun. Asking $325.00 firm This gun is listed for sale elsewhere, first come first serve. Dennis REDACTED"

It hardly needs an introduction. It has been fired very little, an estimated 50 rounds.  It has a polished feed ramp and I have not had any issues with jamming or any problems with Magtech 240 gr semijacketed ammo.  The scope I believe is a leupold FX II 2x20mm valued at 350 new with weaver scope rings. It comes with the original adjustable sights as well, one magazine, a silicon treated gun sock and a pistol case. I believe it is the Mark VII made in Israel. In this condition, the gun without the scope sells for about 1050 so you will be getting a free top notch scope included. This gun is extremely accurate.  Here is a quick review along with some consistent 230 yard shooting http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1xj_3RvP2E.
I am in need of a good long distance rifle for target shooting and hunting however.  I am most interested in trading for long barreled semi auto ""battle"" rifles with preferably a 20 inch or longer barrel, mainly AR 10s, FALs, ptr 91s. I am also interested in precision snipers equal to around 900 or so dollar value. Preferably in 308 caliber.
I do love pretty much any firearm, so shoot me an offer with about 900 dollar value and my gun fever will kick in and ill be interested in pretty much anything. Will most definitely take cash as well, but it will probably go into another firearm. Will need to see CO ID and all that."

There are a few minor spots of corrosion on the blueing and woodwork, and at some point a small portion of the butt stock broke off and was reattached.  Not the most attractive job but it’s solid; I assume the furniture was refinished at that point because when I removed it from the soft case it still smelled of lacquer.  It was purchased new by my grandfather sometime between 20 and 40 years ago (my best estimate), and to my knowledge has never been fired; the bores are perfect.  Mechanically it’s essentially new, but has some minor cosmetic flaws, most of which look like they could be easily remedied if that’s important to you.  I don’t use a 20 gauge anymore so it needs a new owner.  I’ve taken the best photos I can, but they never really show up well unless you’re a professional.  So, I’m happy to try and take more detailed photos if requested, but you’re better off looking at it in person.  $375.00 obo, cash only, no trades.  I’m certainly open to offers, but please be reasonable, I don’t need to sell.  Valid Arizona drivers license and signature of sale required.  Thanks for looking."

$1,100 CASH. May be interested in full or partial trades, let me know what you've got... 

This has been my tow rig for many years. Haven't really used it much in the last few years, it's in my way now more than anything, so time to let it go. 

Doesn't look pretty, but it has been extremely dependable. NEVER let me down on may long haul road trips. 

Actual mileage is 95,087 Originally had a 454, but that was nuts when time to fill it up. So built a 305 for it at 87,225, so have less than 10K miles on that rebuild. Stock 305 from a '85 Monte Carlo, rebuilt heads, everything. New carb, fuel pump, radiator, all belts and hoses, HEI dist, headers and full exhaust, all that stuff... Trans is still the stock T400. Carb is running an adapter to fit the stock intake, but I have a correct flanged Holley intake to go with that matches the carb. 

New front coils and main springs out back a few years ago. Does have a 5-wheel hitch setup in the bed in addition to the 2"" receiver hitch. Originally equipped with factory A/C. I still have the compressor and other bits to go with the truck. 

Good tires, bed liner and bed tool box. Two fuel tanks, stock tank and additional 25Gal tank. 

Originally purchased in Washington state, brought to Missouri shortly after where it spent most of it's life. Was one solid vehicle when I got it, but over the last eight Ohio Winters or so it's starting to let go. Worst is the door bottoms they are gone, skin has separated, etc... Fender bottoms rotted. 

Clean/Clear Ohio title in my name. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

The wood is in great condition, especially the forend, it shows no wear. The only ""but"" to this gun is the butt. Pops sawed about 3 inches off the stock to fit our shoulders as kids.

Product Details & Specifications
HENRY REPEATING ARMS CO Big Boy Deluxe Rifles 
First Edition Henry 10 + 1 45 LC Deluxe Engraved Cowboy/20"" Octagon Barrel/Walnut Stock  

The graceful, elegant design immediately lets you know that they paid attention to detail. The craftsmen were instructed to take the elaborate and intricately executed Nimschke style scrollwork of the engraved Henry Golden Boy and execute a similar pattern on the solid brass receiver of the Henry Big Boy. The result is an awe-inspiring companion piece to the engraved Golden boy or one that can certainly stand on it's own. The Henry big Boy Deluxe Engraved also features an engraved brass barrel band and high grade deluxe fancy American walnut stock. An oval shape has been left blank on both sides of the receiver for personalization. Production is limited to 1000 units. If you wish to purchase the Henry Big Boy Deluxe Engraved .44 Magnum, they suggest that you visit a Henry Dealer in your area and special order one by placing a deposit with the dealer.

The Walker revolver is one of the most famous revolvers made by Colt. It consists of a one piece grip and European walnut stock. The frame is steel, color casehardened. Barrel is a .44 caliber, blue 9"" octagon to round. Six shot. Features a blued steel backstrap, brass triggerguard, color casehardened loading lever & hammer. ""Fighting Dragoons"" scene engraved on cylinder. Manufactured by Uberti/Italy.

I have shot this gun, fun!! and was cleaned properly afterwards

FYI: The Colt Walker holds a powder charge of 60 grains (3.9 g) in each chamber, more than twice what a typical black powder revolver holds.
The Colt Walker was quite powerful, with modern replicas firing modern FFFg black powder producing energy levels in excess of 500 foot pounds with both picket bullets and 0.454-inch-diameter (11.5 mm), 141-grain (9.1 g) round ball bullets. The black powder Colt Walker is regarded as the most powerful commercially manufactured repeating handgun from 1847 until the introduction of the .357 Magnum in 1935, and has a muzzle energy nearly exactly the same as a 4-inch-barreled handgun firing a .357 Magnum.  1000-1200+ feet per second, effective range 100 Yards.

Dixie Gun Works are selling the Uberti 1847 for $375.00 plus shipping, just for reference
