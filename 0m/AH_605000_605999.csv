$950 OBO. Cash sale and must be a wash res. and prefer Concealed weapon permit holder.
  If you just want the 9mm then its $750.

She moved into a pretty crummy neighborhood, and requires a firearm in the house. She is familiar with handling a high powered firearm, no worries. I know this is the kind of bait someone would put out if they were looking to get that 410 pump for 25 bucks, but I'm actually looking for a beat off, crummy shotgun that is going to get shot and cleaned once a year. I really stress that it doesn't have to be pretty, I'm working on a budget here, so I'm not expecting people falling all over themselves with new guns. That said, non-functional, or nearly busted isn't going to fly either. Pump or semi preferred, side by side or over and under is fine. No single shots, and no goose barrels please. Drop me a line, I work the night shift so I return mails at oddball times. Thanks for taking the time to read my ad, sorry that it was a long'n.

This is a parkarized Remington 870 Police purchased brand new last year, in excellent condition, selling for a great value. Less than 50 rounds have been fired from this gun. There is over $400 worth of modifications not counting professional labor cost. I am selling it to help finance a new car. Please email me with any questions and I will respond ASAP. Feel free to ask for additional photos detailing the parts I described, etc. This shotgun has been maintained faithfully, carefully, and functions as if brand new. The extra quality control the 870 police models get really shows, and there are no plastic parts like on the regular 870 models. This weapon will not only provide excellent protection, but it will put food on the table. Don't go without one.

Cash only. 800 FIRM for everything described here. Take a close look at what you are getting and you will realize this is money well spent, and a great value. Thanks and take care."

Colt's popular 6920 M4 carbine, proven to be effectively mobile during tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Fully retracting 4 position butt stock. This carbine measures only 30.5 inches and weighs in at only 6.8 pounds. Tried and true, this carbine boasts proven advantages like a safe, semi-automatic rate of fire for potent firepower capability and speed of target acquisition.

The advantage of the LE6920MP-R is the Troy Rail and Magpul's American-made accessories as standard equipment. The Magpul additions are cost effective products engineered to enhance weapon performance and usability.

This is a used item available now with less than 200 rounds fired. The trigger spring has been replaced and trigger assembly polished for a smooth 3 to 4 pound trigger break. I have removed the standard front site and replaced it with a low profile gas block and matching Magpul flip up front site.

I have all the original equipment to include box and manual.

Transfer to be made at a FFL dealer. I will accept credit cards at the addition of 2.75% of the sale price. I will cover the cost of the transfer as long as it does not exceed $20.00

Mounted on this rifle is a IOR Valdada 4-16X50 ILL with rings. Everything on this rifle has been duracoated in a very cool winter/snow camo. Only the buy it now price gets you the scope and rings. Development: The .204 Ruger was the second Ruger-named cartridge produced by a partnership between Ruger and Hornady, the first being the big bore .480 Ruger revolver cartridge, introduced in 2003 for the Super Redhawk. With the backing of a major gunmaker and a major ammunition company, the round was an instant success, with other ammunition makers and firearms makers quickly producing offerings in the new caliber. Ruger's initial offerings included the bolt action Model 77 MKII, and the single shot Ruger No. 1, and Hornady offered loadings with 30-and-40-grain (1.9 and 2.6 g) bullets. The .204 Ruger has proven to be a very accurate and efficient cartridge: an early tester reported 1/2 MOA groups at 100 yards (91 m) with the Hornady loads and a Ruger #1 Varmint rifle."

This frame fits Glock uppers for models 17, 17L, 34, 22, 35. I know it fits generation 2 & 3 Glock uppers, I don't know about Gen 1 and I'm pretty sure it doesn't work with Gen 4.

Some of the advantages of the raceframe are increased weight for more recoil control, the magwell is slightly flared for faster mag changes, and a high, extended beaver tail for a solid, high grip without fear of slide bite.

The frame comes with the CCF RaceFrames locking block, and I'm including the Glock factory extended magazine release which is installed. I ran this with a Glock 34 Gen 3 upper, I took a photo of the slide on the fram to give an idea of what it looks like. The upper is not included in the sale and I am not interested in selling it.

I am in the process of building an AR-15 rifle, so I may consider trades for certain parts that I still need. The big parts are my primary need including a good barrel, preferably 14.5"", I want a mid-length gas system, a good upper receiver, 12-13 inch hand guard with a full-length rail along the top.

The length is just slightly shorter than Gen 2 and later mags, so it will not lock into them. I imagine it would lock into the models 19 and 26 models since they have shorter grips.

I discovered the big benefit of the Gen 1 mags is that they were made before the assault arms ban that prohibits magazines with capacities higher than 10 rounds in some states, so this 17 round mag can be used in those places.

The only trades I would consider are AR platform parts, specifically a good, adjustable stock like a Magpul CTR or STR, or some good flip-up back up iron sights.

Excellent shape ... have shot about 150 rounds through it.  

I'm selling it because I have a Ruger P95 and I'm so used to shooting it that I prefer it.  I believe that the SR9 is a better gun, I just like my P95 better. 

I bought this in August or September, of THIS year. 

You can buy this from online places for about $390, pay shipping, FFL fee of about $30 (unless you're an FFL).  

So, at $350, it's still a good deal. 

I will post specific pictures later. 

Btw, I won't knowingly sell to someone who can NOT legally buy a gun.  That includes underage people.  You must be 21 .

The length is just slightly shorter than Gen 2 and later mags, so it will not lock into them. I imagine it would lock into the models 19 and 26 models since they have shorter grips.

I discovered the big benefit of the Gen 1 mags is that they were made before the assault arms ban that prohibits magazines with capacities higher than 10 rounds in some states, so this 17 round mag can be used in those places.

The only trades I would consider are AR platform parts, specifically a good, adjustable stock like a Magpul CTR or STR, or some good flip-up back up iron sights.

23 karat gold-plated Ocean Ghost II diving watch with automatic movement, which provides water resistance up to 200 meters (660 feet). It features a round, shock-resistant gold-tone stainless steel case with embossed unidirectional rotating bezel. The silver dial background is accented by gold triangular dial markers and Tritnite luminous hands (with gold seconds hand). The gold-tone stainless steel bracelet band mixes brushed and polished pieces. Other features include an antireflective mineral crystal with magnifier, Cabochon crown, see-through case back, and date function at 3 o'clock.


Automatic watches donot operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.


Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement.

It is a 2007 Martin Jaguar 35-50# currently set at 48#(will actually make 52# with limbs fully seated). It has an 80% let off. Great for youth and plenty powerful enough for deer.
It is in very good condition, has a 3 pin fiber optic sight, whisker biscuit rest, peep w/new alignment tube, D notch, trigger release, counter balance weight, wrist strap, and quick release mount for a quiver. It comes in a Plano Camouflaged hard-shell case w/7 arrows all with 100gr practice tips. 5 arrows are Easton Axis ST400, 1 is Easton Epic ST400 and the last one is as Trophy Ridge Wrath ST400. All have matching orange and white 2"" Blazer vanes.

Now, as for it being RH or LH, it is a RH bow. BUT, for you left handed people. I am left handed(right eye dominant) and shoot this bow left handed. The fact that the grip is straight on both sides with no thumb rest is an advantage for me and makes it somewhat an ambidextrous bow. I have a large back yard and will shoot it to show you what I mean if that will help. If I can get it pulled back that is.

I can diagnose your AR15 (something doesn't work for whatever reason, and you don't know why)

I can give counseling on enhancing your AR15

I can build you an upper receiver, and/or a lower receiver

I can change/replace AR parts


Please note that I am a full time college student so my spare time is limited. However, I can, and will ensure that such spare time is used for your benefit and your AR15.

My fee depends on what you want or need done, and I can give my most accurate price after finding out what it is you need done.
Ex. if you need me to replace a part, such as a detent spring, roll pin, etc. then I would base the fee around how much that part costs. It's best to contact me as I have no set fee. The $10 on this advertisement is there to abide to armslist.com's policy.

The best way to contact me is via email, which is: REDACTED. I make a point to check my email daily, so my response should be within 24 hours.


Everything I do as an AR15 Armorer is done within local, state, and federal law. The legal consequences are not worth breaking the law!"

He said he purchased this as a custom order back in 1974 while he was working for Smith and Wesson. This is the model 10-6 nickel finish with the heavy barrel and target/presentation grips. This model did not ship standard with these grips and he had it built with silver medallions instead of gold and NO clear coat finish on the grips. Just to be clear for the peole who cannot figure things out without being told. The rare part would be the grips being on this gun from the factory. I have seen the grips alone sell for 160 to 220 alone on Ebay but it would be a dumb idea to seperate tham from this  pistol  in my opinion. 

He claims he never fired this paticular gun as he only enjoyed collecting nickel plated S&W guns. I cannot verify this but there looks to be almost no sign of drag marks on the cylider and no residue above the barrel. The box is not present as he claimed he misplaced it over a decade ago.

Looking for 500 cash but may entertain trades. Guns only please no acc or other items. 

I am NOT interested in any bolt actions, shotgun other than saigas or cheap carry pistols. Other than that I will entertain most anything.

Item Description
This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition(2-3/4""shells). The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.
