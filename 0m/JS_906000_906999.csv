Up for sale is a AR15 in 5.56 that I assembled custom.  I had a few key goals in mind with this build.  Mid length gas system, lightweight, free floated, no pencil thin barrels, as short as legally possibly without the hassle of a pinned flash hider, fixed sights.  I am selling because it is an extra AR and the market is demanding these right now.  I have put somewhere between 40-50 rounds through the gun.  I followed a barrel break-in procedure for the first 15 or so rounds and the rest of the shooting was spent on finding a hand-load that shot well (see photos for details on this).

On to the components.  Where it matters I tried to give potential buyers a link to the original manufacturer site so that you can research the specifications for yourself.

Off the bench in about 17 degree weather I was able to shoot some impressive groups with the finer reticle using the DD sights that are on this gun.  While I would not guarantee it without testing, I have no doubt this is a sub-MOA weapon given some optics on the rifle.  Photos of my shooting results along with some chicken scratch notes on the powder/bullet combination are provided below.

A few extras that will be tossed in include a new in factory wrapping 30 round PMAG, Black.  I will also include a A1 and A2 sight adjustment tool for the front and rear sights and finally a Delron punch for assisting out the takedown pins, they are a nice tight fit.

I built this from a parts kit that had a factory barrel still installed when it was imported. Kit assembly year is 1978 and the kit was a hand select kit, was likely new when I got it. I finished the rifle about 4 years ago and have shot it very little. This was the third kit that I have built up and have found no problems with it. Never really planned on selling it, but with the price they are bringing, better to move onto other project guns. It includes a side folding stock and a 30rd magazine. The gun is built on a NodakSpud number 3 reciever and is a screw build. Open to trades, just see if I am interested. Probably going to use the money from this gun to buy some Krinkov parts kits, so if you have an M85 or an M92, or other AK parts kits, let me know. Can setup to shoot gun, but that will be the last step before money changes hands. Email works best, but if you must call, don't call to low ball me, I'm not hard up for money.

IF YOU'RE A ONE OF THE MANY GOUGERS CURRENTLY OUT THERE, DONT BOTHER CONTACTING ME, because all of you charging $1/round for .223, $.50/round for 9mm, and $40+ for PMags disgust me. I am dealing on what the normal price system is, not this artificially inflated one created by gougers and other people capitalizing on peoples fears.

Non-panic prices for 9mm should be about $.22/round, and non-panic .223 should be about $.32/round (for brass-cased, much less for steel). I will trade 1000 9mm rounds for 600-650 .223 rounds. You can choose which 9mm brand you would like from what I have:

I AM NOT SELLING ANY OF THIS, IT IS ONLY FOR TRADE FOR .223 OR 5.56 AMMO. DO NOT CONTACT ME LOOKING TO PURCHASE.

And on a side note to all of you honest gun owners out there, who the gougers are trying to take advantage of, don't give in to them and their ridiculous prices. Check for ammo deals all around the web and in your local gun stores, because there are still honest people out there. I personally have come across quite a few deals recently, like $15 PMags, $24/100 round 9mm boxes, and $800 ARs. Just look around, and dont get taken advantage of."

Obama hopes to enact new gun-control measures in 2013
By Meghashyam Mali - 12/30/12 09:49 AM ET 


President Obama on Sunday said he would make gun control a priority in his new term, pledging to put his ""full weight"" behind passing new restrictions on firearms in 2013.

""I'm going to be putting forward a package and I'm going to be putting my full weight behind it,"" Obama said in an interview aired on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I'm going to be making an argument to the American people about why this is important and why we have to do everything we can to make sure that something like what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary does not happen again.""


In the wake of the Dec. 14 mass shooting at a Newtown, Conn., school, the president has launched a White House task force led by Vice President Biden to present proposals in January to help stem gun violence. Obama has said that he would seek a broad approach to the problem addressing the role of violence in entertainment and measures to improve mental healthcare.

But he has also called on Congress to move quickly to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban and a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines.

Obama on Sunday repeated those calls and said he would meet with lawmakers on both sides of the aisles to see action. 

""I've been very clear that an assault-rifle ban, banning these high capacity clips, background checks, that there are a set of issues that I have historically supported and will continue to support,"" the president said."

Here is a description from Milt Sparks website:
First introduced in our catalog in the spring of 96 the #1H or Heritage model has quickly become one of our most popular holsters.

  The idea  was to create an all leather IWB holster that would offer the holstered weapon  protection from body perspiration in a hot humid environment.  To provide the moisture protection, a waterproof liner is placed on the body side of the holster between the thin leather, inner and outer shell.


 Like our other IWB holsters, The mouth of the Heritage is metal reinforced. Because the body of the Heritage is of two layer construction, the metal can be placed between the layers eliminating the need for a separate top band piece. This also allows for a smooth finish inside the holster as well as out. Overall thickness of the two layers is no greater than the single thickness leather we normally use in our other IWB holsters.

Stitched in sight rails, a protective leather shirt guard that extends up the back, to the top of the slide and detailed hand molding make the #1H one of our best offerings for IWB carry.    

I don't carry my 1911 any longer so I'm selling the holster."

Swivels also attached for a sling.
These Spanish Mausers are known world-wide as some of the most accurate and finely crafted Mauser actions.  This ""OT"" version was imported in the early 60's in quanity of less than 60,000.  It is noted for being a ""scrubbed"" version, and the barrel is marked 308 Win but is also more than capable of firing the 7.62x51 Nato round.  More information about these Mausers is available here:  http://masterton.us/Unmarked1916
This conversion is not a museum-piece, it is a very capable hunting rifle, with a world-class Mauser action perfectly suited for target or hunting.  This rifle was assembled using the best of several rifles, and tuned together to build a first-class rifle.  The numbers match on the barrel and receiver, with different parts used for the bolt, and fixed magazine floorplate.  The closed internal magazine will hold 5 rounds.  The Mauser action is tight, and silky smooth.

The gun has night sights, and 2 magazines (worth about $60+ each!).  New price was about $1100 and most with these options are 800- 850+ on gunbroker, so I think this is a fantastic deal.  This one is in great shape! There are some minor wear marks from holster at the corners of the front of the barrel and on the slide latch. Looks and operates fantastically.  I now have posted actual pic of the gun. (previous pic was a generic google pic)"

Used this a few times with my XD 45 until I sold it.  Keeps the weapon close to your body so it makes concealing full size frames easy.  It's easy to take on and off unlike some other holster where the belt has to be looped through.  This just snaps on and off.  
I have one for my Glock 30 and it's my favorite.

Sells new for $32.95 plus shipping.  I'll take $30 or best offer.  Only used a few times before I sold the XD for the Glock.  

Description from the Galco website:
The M7X Matrix™ is a durable thermoplastic holster that is lightweight, comfortable, and nearly maintenance free! The M7X is also fast, very concealable, and easy on the budget. 

Setting it apart from other thermoplastic belt holsters, the patent-pending snap-on belt loops of the M7X – similar to those found on our deluxe Side Snap Scabbard – make it fast and easy to attach and remove from the belt. 

The M7X is a strong side belt holster that uses a butt-forward cant to enhance concealability. The open top makes the draw quick and easy, while the lateral tension when worn does an amazing job of retaining the pistol securely. Unlike so many other harsh, mechanical-looking plastic holsters, the Matrix resembles a hand-molded Galco leather holster. 

The M7X features easy on/off belt loops that fit belts up to 1 1/2""."

The original handguard is also included in case you prefer the classic Spanish CETME/FAL/G3 look or don't need the added bulk of the rail.

I've taken this gun out a few times, less than 500 rounds through it. There's very minimal surface rust in some small crevice areas near the sling mount, and the rear sight is missing the aperture, spring, pin, and ball bearing - this can be purchased for a total of $21 at https://www.buymilsurp.com/rifle-parts-accessories-cetme-rifle-parts-accessories-c-3548_368.html?page=2&sort=20a. It's a simple installation, I just lost mine after a recent disassembly and don't want to deal with it. I've knocked $40 off my intended price to cover your time and expense.

Beyond that, this rifle is in great condition and you'll be getting 80 rounds of Brown Bear .308 and 60 rounds of Silver Bear 140 Grain SP as well.

Priced below many comparable semi-auto .308's, this is a solid ""battle rifle"" package. The weight of the rifle helps keep the .308 recoil manageable. Even out of the 16"" barrel, the .308 round still provides a great advantage over 5.56/.223 in many ways. The flash hider works well, and you'll find it's relatively easy stay on target with your follow up shots.

If you're on the fence about getting a larger caliber than the average semi-auto rifle, this is a very manageable .308 for well below the currently inflated price of an AR-15 and you'll have plenty left for ammo and range time.

I have some trade possibilities in mind, you can see those listed. Local face to face transfers only."

398,http://www.armslist.com/posts/906398,For Sale:  .38 special 823 rounds of brass & brass/nickle plated wadcutter reloads. Satisfaction guaranteed!,"Sugarcreek Township, Dayton, Ohio",$ 200,"Listed On: Monday, January 28, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Most of these are once fired reloads. There are a total of 823 rounds of .38 special brass or brass/nickle plated reloads. There are 744 rounds of brass/nickle plated wad cutters and79 rounds of brass flat nosed bullets for $200. These wadcutters are very accurate target loads that help save unnecessary wear on your bore. They make perfect round holes in the target and recoil is better than full metal jacketed loads.  Wadcutters have been used for decades by most expert shooters. Give them a try and if you are not 100% satisfied, I will refund your money for any unused portion.  

For those of you who have never seen or used wadcutters (WC), they are the most popular reloaded ammunition for target shooting. They may look a little weird, since most of the bullet is seated nearly all the way into the shell casing, but they weigh as much as FMJs and have comparable ballistics. Advantages: (1) conserve lead (2) conserve powder (3) create light loads which provide less recoil allowing for enjoyable extended practice sessions (which improves your accuracy) (4) punch nice holes in paper and lead is not as destructive to barrels compared to FMJs.  Any lead deposits left in the barrel can be easily removed with a brass brush. The last photo shows a box of wadcutters so you can see these are full size bullets."

Due to slight oversight in New York’s new gun law, both police and private citizens will be banned from carrying high-capacity magazines.

According to TV station WABC, the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, which bans magazines that carry more than seven rounds, does not provide an exemption for law enforcement officers, who typically carry handguns with a 15-round capacity.

The New York Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch said in a press release Thursday that they are ""actively working to enact changes to this law that will provide the appropriate exemptions from the law for active and retired law enforcement officers.""

""As with many pieces of new legislation, there is a period shortly after enactment where omissions and unforeseen impacts become apparent that prompt a revision to the law,"" he said.

From the manufacturer:
The XL H1 HD camcorder offers a broad range of capabilities, emulating those of cameras that are significantly more expensive.

The XL H1 has everything you want to fine tune the images you capture to fit your situation and production needs. It's the flexibility you need for work in broadcast, studio, the field, events and more.

A LWRCI M6A2 piston driven AR-15 chambered in .223/.556.  These are without a doubt, the best AR-15's on the market.l
    The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

This Stainless Steel 454 Cassul is in like new condition. It has a brand new but relatively inexpensive NCStar scope ($50) on a Taurus Rail ($45). This gun has a really low round count. It was a safe queen taken to the range and shot just a few times for kicks. These guns are hand cannons but suprisingly shootable. The porting makes the gun very manageable and very accurate. Also there is a secondary rubber (red) in the spine of the grip that helps absorb recoil. You can also shoot .45 Long colt with this gun and it is a little cheaper to do so. I have a holster ($25) for it and I will include 15 rounds of Magtek ammo ($21). Come out to the Beach and we may be able to strike a deal on the addition of 1 Full Box of 20 Winchester Partition Gold 260 gr. Hollow Points ($50.00)
Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

There were three variations: with adjustable sights, standard fixed sights and Novak fixed sights...somewhere around 3,000 are believed to of been made, with the Novak sighted examples being the scarcest. Luckily, S&W made parts interchangeable throughout much of it's 3rd Gen line, so parts & mags are still available...even factory direct. This 3906 is DA/SA, all stainless, full size and single stack. It weighs approximately 35oz and has a 4"" barrel.

This gun came about right when the ""wondernine"" craze was really starting to spread, and is the reason for such a short life in the lineup. Sales of this 9+1 pistol couldn't compare to sales of S&W's 15+1 Model 5906...along with the other higher capacity 9's hitting the market. Both the 3906 and 5906 are known for their extreme reliability and ruggedness. 

Fast forward to today and many people are starting to appreciate flatter and lighter carry guns. Perhaps 10 rounds of 9mm really aren't that inadequate! Many people, even like myself with large hands, appreciate the ergonomics of this slim single stack gun compared to it's fatter 5906 doublestack  brother. S&W's 3rd Gen line as a whole is starting to gain more respect, as they were made to a higher standard and with better materials than the mass produced guns common today. 

These are great guns, but it just seems like I can't find too much love for the semi-automatic pistol :/ It came to me with some dried on super glue on the dust cover that I removed (previous owner glued on a laser sight, completely ridiculous), so there is a little evidence of where I polished it off, but it's not too noticeable as seen in the photos...other than that, this pistol appears close to new. I'd guess whoever owned it before me only fired a magazine or two and never carried it. Extremely clean, inside and out. Gun would come with (2) 9 round magazines and a  nwot Bianchi Model 6 IWB holster.

Not in a huge rush to sell, more interested in a trade really. I'm interested in older (1950-1996) S&W revolvers in .38, .357 & .22...blued or stainless. Sale price would be six hundred. I'm also passively looking for a Calico Liberty III pistol. I don't have to get rid of this gun and it took me quite a while to find, so I don't have any issue holding onto it.
