I am looking to trade/sell a 1941 Enfield No.4 MK1 sporter.

Many of the arsenal markings on this rifle have been scrubbed. Of what inspection/factory marks remain, it appears to be an early Maltby. The serial number on this rifle is R17xxx. There are no visible import marks.

The bore is very bright and rifling looks fantastic. The barrel on this gun has not been cut/shortened. The original front sight is intact. The forend wood was cut and the top wood was removed.

The rear peep sight off of the back end of the MKII ladder but the rear sight mount is intact. The ladder has a peep sight for 200m and up. It could be easily replaced if you wanted it back to original military configuration or one of those scope rails that replaces the the rear sight.

This is a good candidate for returning back to original military configuration.

I am including 6 full stripper clips of Greek surplus ammo and 4 more stripper clips.

Top of the line build

SPECS


OPERATING SYSTEM: 
Gas trap/piston operation, rotating bolt (short stroke system), reversible gas piston for suppressed or non-suppressed operation. 
Unlike some other ""op-rod"" systems, on the HOGAN gun, op-rod springs have been eliminated due to possible damage and system failure during sustained firing of the gun. The HOGAN gun system has been designed and manufactured to greatly decrease/eliminate heat, carbon build-up, gas leaks, fouling and wear/tear on operating parts which can have an adverse effect on an operating system. 

UPPER RECEIVER: 
Billet machined from 7075 aluminum forgings, (aircraft alumimun alloy), into an A3 flattop upper receiver to fit varied handrails or a 1-piece upper receiver to fit our Free Floating Monolithic rail system
Electro-less silicone Nickel on the interior

HANDGUARDS/RAILS: 
Aircraft aluminum alloy precision machined from 6061 T-6 extrusion Free Floating Monolithic Tactical and Hunter hand guards or Monolithic top rail 

BOLT and CARRIER: 
223 bolt: machined from 9310 steel bar stock, phosphate heat treated to Mil-Spec .223 and mag particle inspected, hard chrome plated.
Carrier: billet machined from single piece of 8620 steel - integral keyed steel bolt carrier (machined as one piece to leave key in place). Heat treated per Mil-Spec, Nickel Teflon plated.

Barrel
Medium contour, hand lapped button twisted rifled, 6 fluted to improve rigidity and heat dissipation, reduce weight, improve accuracy by reducing barrel vibration when firing. 4150 Mil-B-11595 chrome moly vanadium alloy (machine gun rated).
70 Rockwell case hardened heat treated “5R” polygonal barrels are 2 times harder than Mil-Spec and hammer forged barrels. 

Hogan X-Brake 5 prong muzzle brake and collar nut, which is remarkably effective in recoil reduction but it does not suppress the flash. Made by Hogan Guns.

LOWER RECEIVER
Billet machined from 7075-T6 aircraft aluminum alloy with integral oversized trigger guard for use with heavy gloves. 
Wire E.D.M.’d flared Magwell, ambidextrous bolt release lever machined into the lower receiver. 

ERGO™ pistol grip, VLTOR™ 6-position retractable buttstock with Mil-Spec tube. 
Non slip special compound rubber butt pad. Reversible for right or left handed shooters. 
Finished in black, O.D. Green, Tan or Clear anodize, NP3™ or Cerakote™ Dark Earth or O.D. Green colors.

HOGAN “Gold Standard”™ trigger system, 4.5 lb. non-adjustable pull, (for zero failure) single stage competition trigger. 
Trigger, hammer & disconnector E.D.M.’d from A2 tool steel. Melonite heat treated for long life. 
Pin tubes are black oxide coated 8620 steel. Housing precision machined from 6061 billet aluminum. Deep gold anodize finish. High temp silicone cord base cushions. 

Complete with KNS™ precision non-rotating pins.

NP3™ plating: combination of a nickel alloy plating combined with Polytetrafluoethylene (Teflon). NP3™ metal finish offers many benefits. 
NP3 permits firing for longer periods of time between cleaning, dirt and powder residue have no wet or oily surface to cling to. 
When cleaning is required, the effort needed is minimal - usually requiring only a soft cloth. 

A Like new EOTECH 512 in FDE (box and papers included)

Magpul BUIS Gen 2

Box papers and extras

Weapon has been cleaned with the Otis Elite system and Weapon Shield Advanced CLP.  

This firearm is very accurate and a smooth shooter.  With practice FMJ ammo, I was able to shoot 2 1/2"" groups at 10 yards, and with the good stuff, even tighter groups were achieved.   Recoil is about the same as .40 caliber pistol.   It is also very easy to conceal in a pocket holster or good IWB holster, and very comfortable to carry. 

I have spent more than my budget allows with gun purchases, so I need to sell this to make up the deficit.  My loss is your gain!

1 x Springfield XD-s .45ACP pistol (http://xdspistol.com) 220 rounds through it.  In pristine visual and operating condition.

714,http://www.armslist.com/posts/621714,For Sale:  300 Blackout brass 95$ per 500,"Muncie, Indiana, United States",$ 95,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 8, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This, in my honest opinion, is the one of the best options of brass for blackout. This brass is 100% WCC made from once fired 5.56 with a single 2011 headstamp. It has a stronger primer pocket compared to the other brass I run and I seem to get more reloadings from it comparatively. Primer pockets are swagged, not reemed, just enough that t5he primers go in while still giving it a snug fit for long life. I trim the brass to 1.355 which is closer to the lower tolerance so your brass should last longer between trimmings. The way these are trimmed some might have a slight burr on the inside of the case. These can be removed with a deburring chamfer or running them through a resizing die. I dont think it necessarily needs removed and I dont when I reload them. Shipping is not included but flat rate is pretty reasonable. I take PayPal (gift or +3.5%) or postal mo. PayPal however will get you the fastest shipping. I have up to 10k pieces but its going quick."

 The top half is Ciener's top of the line Platinum Cup conversion, with fully adjustable sights.
 The bottom half is an all steel 1911 frame that could be converted to .45 ACP with just another slide and barrel.
 Make no mistake, this is not one of the current 1911 .22 pistols imported from Germany. The internet is full of people that have had countless problems with the ""pot metal "" parts breaking in them...their words, not mine.
 This is inexpensive shooting, that can be converted to  a power pistol in 2 minutes !  Please feel free to ask questions.

Springfield Armory SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.
