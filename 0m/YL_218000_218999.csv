This model has a 4 speed tranny plus hi/low option. I am 260+ lbs and this thing carries me with zero issues. In low, this bike is like a billygoat. I can stop on a 45 degree incline and it will start back up and start climbing with me on it! I have enjoyed it on the streets and have not had any problems keeping up with traffic.

This bike has a title, which is quite rare for these bikes! This is important if you plan on registering the bike for road use.

These are rare bikes, and fun to ride. I have never seen another.

Bike was running last season, however, I believe the carb may need to be cleaned. It turns over, but wont start currently. The issue could also be as simple as a low battery. I have a new battery for it, but dont have a 6volt charger to test it out. I just don't have the time this winter to tinker with it to get it going.

Shoot me cash or trade offers. I'd like to get this bike out of my garage by winter time."

A hand-held kit is also available for non-weapons-mounted deployment. When a suspect individual approaches a restricted or controlled area, the GLARE MOUT is able to hail and warn that person before shots have to be fired. Its shockingly bright beam sends an irrefutable, multi-lingual, cross-cultural message that “you mean business”. Reports confirm that the GLARE MOUT has saved numerous lives of both soldiers and non-combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The GLARE MOUT has the best reliability rate of any laser system; only 1 per 6000 (0.00017%) has ever shown reduced performance... and that's after two years of in-theater abuse. It is the smallest and most versatile green laser dazzler in existence, and is already approved for use by all branches of the Armed Services. When only the best will do, BE Meyers’ line of green laser dazzlers have you covered.  **It has probably been used 2 times. Great Cosmetic condition!

First up is a mini-14 this is the target model with laminated stock. Thumb hole with adjustable recoil pad for length of pull. Its the one with the adjustable barrel dampener. This is a very accurate rifle. Guaranteed to shoot SUB MOA with no problem. My self and another member have both shot clover leaf groups with this rifle. Im shooting hand loaded ammo with a 50gr silver ballistic tip. Rifle has low round count right at a 100 rounds or less. The rifle has not been rapid fired or nothing like that. Bore is excellent just a solid super accurate 223. Comes with a 20rd ruger mag. Ruger rings a harris Bipod and the harris bipod adapter for the mini. Its not pictured but its also like new. From what i understand ruger has stoped making the target or they are getting ready to stop making it. Scope is not included but could be for the right trade/price. Its a leupold vx-111 4.5-14x40AO 850.00 OBO no scope.

2. ruger 10/22 it was also the target model. But the barrel has been changed as well as the stock. Has a i belive 18inch match green mountain fluted bull barrel. Laminated thumb hole stock. Trigger has been worked she is light and breaks clean. has a bipod on it. comes with a dednutz mount and a nikon 3-9x40 scope. comes with a 30rd mag and 2 ten round factory mags. Low round count as well rifle is a shooter. Great shape. 650.00 OBO 

3. Older remington wingmaster 12ga gun is a hunter. Shes not in bad shape at all. Has a small scratch here or there. No cracks in the wood. It has some pretty wood on it. Blueing is about 75% plus needs a good cleaning. I will get pics of it tomorrow. Would make for a great hunting shotty. 275.00 OBO.

Face-to-face transaction, CCW permit holders preferred and your valid Missouri ID is required.  Buyer must be willing to sign a private bill of sale with a CCW.  Military members with a valid Missouri CCW will need to present their military ID as well as that Mo CCW card; a private bill of sale is mandatory for military members to protect you from your COC.  If you do not have a valid CCW then the transfer must go through a local FFL holder at the buyer's expense."

I have not disassembled the weapon but everything seems to function and move smoothly. The only defect I've discovered is a small scratch on the stock visible in pics.

I'll trade for a CZ75, or maybe other DA/SA 9mm metal frame, 45 ACP, or wheelguns. I might trade to 308 or 223 bolt actions as well. If the trades aren't dead even I might give a little or take a little boot if need be.

I have had it for a number of years and have only fired it from the bench. It is in like-new condition with some minor work done. It has been consistently cleaned after every session at the range, and I also have every shot accounted for in a reloading journal. It has 473 total shots fired through it. The action and barrel have had no gunsmithing work done, but the barrel has been free floated. It currently has a Tasco 8-32x50 scope in Burris PosAllign rings mounted, and also has a Timney trigger installed. This rifle will shoot MOA or better with just about anything, with the best groups being handloads of 40 gr Nosler Ballistic Tips and Benchmark powder at around 3500 fps. I will include with the sale the reloading journal and any fireformed Winchester brass that I have. 

Price is $600 and is negotiable. 

E-mail me and I will reply with answers to questions.

The picture of the rifle is a little darker than it actually is.  The color is consisted from front to back.  I can send updated pics if necessary."

Bolt action works better than some newer rifles I have had. It is still a bit “stiff” but works extremely well.

“Last Ditch Rifle”
As the war progressed, Japan quickly began to run short of raw materials. Indeed one of their primary motivations in starting the war was the need for ready supplies of raw materials to support domestic industry. What’s worse, war with America necessitated an increase in rifle production. Therefore, by 1942 many simplifications began to appear on Type 99 rifles. By 1943, so many simplifications had been introduced, that the rifle was re-designated the “Substitute Type 99”. In the collector world, the Substitute Type 99 is the “Last Ditch” Arisaka. So contrary to popular myth, the “last ditch” rifle was actually produced for the last three years of World War II (representing almost the entire duration of the War with the United States), and not just “in the desperate days of 1945”.

I got this as a partial trade and am offering it up for sale as I probably will never go shoot it and it is nice (all things considered) and would be appreciated more by a collector than me.
Problems I noticed
Bayonet Lug is loose and the attachment lug has been removed (I have it but it was taken off.
Bottom front of stock is missing
That’s all I noticed, but keep in mind I am not a collector and it may have other things missing that I am not aware of.

Most of these that I have seen for sale are missing the “Mum” (ground off) or have mismatched bolt. This has the “Mum” and bolt numbers Match the receiver. Ones that are matching go for $500 and up

The receiver, barrel (chrome lined) gas tube, bolt and carrier and pretty much all major parts are original. The only thing changed is the fire control group which is a tapco G2 and i believe the trigger guard. So this makes a solid ak which is basically un-monkeyed with since it left hungary.

In 2001, DPMS expanded from its share of the .223/5.56mm market, and exploded onto the .308 rifle scene. The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.
With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist and free floating handguard and a flat top receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since.
This rifle features several factory installed modifications including replacing the slick side high rise upper receiver with an A3 upper receiver with forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover. Installing a JP adjustable trigger in place of the standard trigger, replacing the vented free float tube for the standard free float tube and giving the bull barrel a bead blasted finish.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide, to its Hogue® custom G-10 grips and black accents. This is one mean machine. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights.

862,http://www.armslist.com/posts/218862,"For Sale/Trade:  NFA Class III Gun Trust, (additional Estate Planning Package, see inside)","Statewide, Florida, United States",$ 300,"Listed On: Saturday, November 5, 2011",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If you live in Seminole or Orange County, feel free to contact me for a free face-to-face consultation. I also do Personal Injury as well. I prefer money but having known lots of people who have plenty of nice guns that they no longer shoot, and no longer wish to own, but wish to have NFA Trusts as well as other estate planning documents, I figured this would be a good idea. I will do private sales, and sales using an FFL dealer for trades. Trades don't necessarily have to be matching value but should be reasonably close, we can haggle if you want when it comes to trades, not cash. I will consider handguns (semi-automatics and revolvers) and rifles, and ammo in addition for said trades.

Whatever I get will sit in my collection for a number of years so as not be in the business of buying and selling, be used for my enjoyment, or later sold via an FFL dealer(I like to buy privately but I don't like to sell privately but for the rare exception something has sat in my possession for a few years), or used when I do my First Steps Pistol classes (I'm also an NRA Certified Pistol Instructor). I will consider trades for all or some of the value. If you have to the send me the firearm via an FFL transferor then you will have to cover shipping and also send me money via Paypal(list it as legal advice, this will document the transaction) to cover the cost of using an FFL transferor on my end.

If you would like an NFA Trust and you feel your firearm is worth more than the Trust I also have other estate planning documents with which to barter, as well as I will also draft documents for your family and friends (yes I have drafted Living Wills, and Healthcare Surrogacy forms for up to five people at a time in exchange for a S&W Model 10-8 4""). So feel free to call me or e-mail me(I prefer if you email because I am typically busy working during the day as a Lawyer).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private ownership of Class III firearms and items requires the local chief of police or sheriff's signature, fingerprints and photos, and when you are not present leaves your loved ones with constructive possession issues. 

Also the local chief of police or sheriff is not required to provide their signature and they may deny you your right own Class III items by simply ""losing"" the paperwork. With a proper Trust, that is avoided. Also my Trusts can be used in conjunction with a wide array of other estate planning documents.

An LLC requires annual fees and state filings or the LLC defaults leaving both you and your loved ones in possession of a restricted item. A Trust allows for people other than yourself(acting as Trustees) to use and enjoy the firearms as part of their duties in ensuring their proper protection, function, maintenance, and value.

A trust is an BATFE approved method of Class III item ownership that protects you, protects your friends and family from constructive possession issues and give you the control over when and where your items will be transferred after your death. Who will inherit them, who can inherit them, and if you would like, for the Trust to keep going on after your death so that your inheritors are still protected by the Trust. 

Generic and fill-in-the-blank asset or estate trusts from the internet or your buddy down the street who is not a lawyer, are not good enough. It may be enough for the application, but it might not be good enough should BATFE ever have a reason to look closer. Do it right the first time with a Trust that not only protects your Class III items, but can also protect your other assets. 

My Trusts are not slapped together Trusts, I can only finish them after I have spoken to you personally and consulted you about your needs, they are painstakingly assembled to work with Florida's laws and the NFA. The Trust can be used later in the future to acquire more Class III items as well, or as a larger part of your estate planning needs and desires.

For a total of $700 you can also get the Trust and:

Simple Will: for dispensation of personal effects and determination of burial. Not for the dispensation of your house. May be used to determine you takes your cars when you pass.

Memorandum of Trust: necessary for creating bank accounts in the name of the Trust.

Pour-Over Last Will & Testament: for having what assets you have not put in the Trust, added to the Trust. Also for having the proceeds from life insurance policies go to the Trust. Also I can prepare and mail letters to your life insurance carrier so that they put your Trust down as the beneficiary.

General Durable Power of Attorney: typically for when or if you become legally or medically incapacitated.

Specific Durable Limited Power of Attorney: can be used to take care of specific measures like selling or buying a car or house.

Appointment of Healthcare Surrogate

Alternative Appointment of Healtchare Surrogate

Codicil/Amendments: for when you may want to add things to your Will such as personal possessions.

Living Will: to have your desires be known in case you become afflicted so as to be in a vegetative state. I.E. be kept on life support, have the feeding tube remain in place, or prevent heroic medical measures.

Pet Trust: In the State of Florida it is no recognized how one can create a Trust for the care of their pets should they pass.

1st, made a correction to the price error. The rifle is for 1300, but throw an offer out at me!

This is a ""Loaded"" M1a and the information can be found at Springfield Armory's website. I have only put 20 rounds through it from the time I purchased it brand new, this was going to be a competition rifle and I only pulled it out for zeroing four times and never got a chance to get out of work to compete. Included is the original 10 rnd magazine and I will also include 4 20 rnd magazines. I frequent between Northern Nevada and Las Vegas if that helps anyone.

I have a lot more photos showing the detail of the rifle and the excellent condition it is in (for the most part, still brand new).

For any questions please contact me at:

Exactly the same as a brand new pistol, only this one has been tried, without malfunctions, to do what it's supposed to do.

$550.00 - Retail Price: New
$450.00 - Asking Price: Almost New

Price Includes:
Barretta PX4 Sub-Compact (9mm)
Two 13+1 Magazines
Two interchangeable backstraps allowing the pistol to adapt to many different hand sizes
Cable Lock
User Manual and additional documents
Storage Case
- Also has a standard Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) below the barrel and forward of the trigger guard to allow for attachment of aftermarket accessories 

The reason for selling this pistol is nothing more than a shift in personal tastes and preferences.  I'm in the process of choosing my first concealed carry and still discovering my own individual needs so that I can find what's right for me.  With that said, this is still an excellent well rounded firearm in exemplary, out of the box, condition that might fit your preferences in a concealed carry perfectly.

I live in Lake Jackson and will be off for the rest of today and all of this weekend.  I'll be a little busy during this time but would be more than happy to carve out some time for any serious and genuine inquiries.  Please feel free to call me anytime of the day.  Take care and good one!

For this transfer, you must be willing to come to Lake Jackson as I don't have enough free time for a road trip……unfortunately.  You MUST have and bring a currently valid drivers license, state issued ID card or, more preferably, a current and valid Concealed Handgun License.
