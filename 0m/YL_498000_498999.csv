You could spend $800-$900 on a match gun like this or buy this one and shoot with the big boys. It has won a alot of rounds with 12 shooters competing per round. Last year I filled my freezer with turkeys and then started giving away hams and turkeys to needy familys and friends with what this gun won and  I kept some of the pennies that fell from the sky when I won,  for operating cost. Only reason for selling is that I have invested $900 in a 870 and don't need both.  The barrel alone cost more than asking price for the complete gun.  I have shells and a 50 yard shooting range behind my house that you can try her out on.Negotiable if needed.

I also have a Remington Model 742 Woodsmaster 30-06 semi-automatic (seriel # B6950840) in pretty good shape. This has been used several times deer hunting and shows some wear and tear but really not that bad.

I searched several auction websites for approximate values and figured low based on what I saw
 for current bids and they were ranging in the $200 - $250 range for either model

The 1918 model is actually in much nicer shape than the 1942 model and may have been refinished at some point

 This gun was made between 60-68. Colt commisioned Astra to make thier
 Colt Junior .25acp pistols before the 68 import ban.
 This is a copy between the 1908 style Colts and the then new Juniors. 
Its made of all steel, its in VERY good condition with somewhere between 200-300 rounds through it.
 The blueing is near perfect some lightening but no metal showing at all, and NO rust what so ever.
 I just had it serviced and everything is working to 100%. 
It is hammerless and has 3 safetys on it. 
1: regular safety above trigger
 2: backstrap safety like the early Colt hammerless 1908's
 3: with magazine out it wont fire

In the past few years I've only seen a handfull of these up for auction or being sold. They are just that good of pocket pistol and go BANG everytime.

You will get the gun, 1-6 round clip, Bianchi thick leather holster, and 30 rounds of FMJ ammo. ATTENTION I JUST PUT A SET OF NOS JAY SCOTT GRIPS ON! VERY HARD TO FIND AND IT GIVES IT A MUCH BETTER GRIP AND MAKES IT LOOK NICER. THEY WHERE $45 SHIPPED.

I'm asking $250 FIRM for it cause its well worth it when you see it. Pictures
 just dont do it justice.

You can contact me through this ad then I will give you my #. 
I will also trade for other firearms. If you have a trade please send pictures and tell me what it is.

The grenade launcher system is still on the muzzle end and I have a grenade adaptor that goes over the end. This SKS has a valve that can divert the gas from a blank fired round and direct it all out the muzzle end, which is how you would launch a grenade.

For those of you not familiar with these, its a Clone of the Beretta 92 series. This gun is identical almost every way to a Beretta 92 except it has a frame mounted Saftey/Decocker. If you like 1911's its set up the same way except the safty also acts as the decocker if depressed to its second notch. You can run this gun cocked and locked like a 1911 or in double action only like a Beretta. Its been totally reliable for me with anything its been fed and is more accurate than im able to shoot it. The only reason im trading it is that i just purchased a Beretta 92fs.

This is common with the Rugers and money says you'll do it too. I touched it up with a Cabellas gun finish pen and I think it looks pretty good. I would have left it alone but little things like that kinda bug me. 

I'm selling to buy some Volquartsen goodies for my 10/22.

These are getting hard to find and only become more rare every year since you cant get them anymore. So you have the chance to not only own a rare collectible but also a very well built and authentic Romanian AK built in Romanian arsenal it is stamped on the left side of the receiver. This gun is beautiful with real Romanian receiver, Romanian trigger group,Everything is Romanian on this rifle no Tapco anywhere, threaded barrel, Dragunov laminated stock, the only after market piece on the rifle is the scope with a red dot sight which i can hit a tennis balls at 120 yards using it and also a bipod a must have for those long range shots when you want to lay down and use the red dot, but both of these come right off no problem. I am asking 700 for it and that may seem high but you prob will not find another and if you do it will not be cheaper than this or if it is it will be beat up and rusty unlike this one. Only thing I would be interested in trade for is AR. You can reach me at REDACTED and I can send you pictures of it. Also unlike most wasr's were they mix and match parts to make 1 AK this one has all matching numbers throughout it. Also comes with a few extras. Text or call for fastest response. You can reach me at anytime. Thanks 
P.S. I went into a anonymous gun shop this week and couldnt believe i saw my exact gun hanging on the wall with the dragunov stock and everything just didnt have red dot. This was also a REAL 100% Romanian AK price was 963 before tax and all the other fees they charge. I have pics of it on the wall if you want to see also"

The wood has some small scratches and such from general use.  The blue is still in good shape, but does show some wear.
The bolt had some work done to it and prior to being done properly, the previous owner did remove some of the wood on the stock where the bolt closes down.  Instead of being nicely squared off, it has a rounded look.  The bolt was gone through and repaired by the gunsmith I took it to.  Because of the repair and the damage to the stock, I have lowered the price.  Still a great gun to use, just not a collectible

I just shot this gun today for the first time and all i can say is they do NOT make them like this anymore. I havent shot pistol in a few years and went to a buddys house and set up a target at 15-20 yards and this gun is incredibly accurate. Can send pics of target if you wanted for some reason. This gun is in immaculate condition. All the metal is nickel and i have looked at these alot on the internet and have seen alot with wood grips but not like these.It truly is a awesome gun. Would make a great carry. Shot 100 rounds through it today and nothing failed. Fits in the hand just like you would want it to (well for me at least, unless you have very large or small hands maybe) This gun was issued to the navy when they were introduced and took the place of the model 39.

I am firm on $450 these guns were only manufactured from 1970-1988 on the slide it even says pat pending lol. But for the age of this gun its worth it. Looks brand new.

It has a set of custom pau ferro wood grips w/Taurus medallion. One factory 15rd mag and one 18rd MecGar teflon coated Mag. No Box.

For those of you not familiar with these, its a Clone of the Beretta 92 series. This gun is identical almost every way to a Beretta 92 except it has a frame mounted Saftey/Decocker. If you like 1911's its set up the same way except the safty also acts as the decocker if depressed to its second notch. You can run this gun cocked and locked like a 1911 or in double action only like a Beretta. Its been totally reliable for me with anything its been fed and is more accurate than im able to shoot it. The only reason im trading it is that i just purchased a Beretta 92fs.

I'd prefer to do straight trade for a entry level 1911 (ATI, Rock Island, Auto ordnance) I'm also interested in other handguns....glocks...xd.....S&W...colt. I'm in the market for a Keltec Sub 2000. I have cash to add if needed. I may be interested in long guns but it just depends on what you have....so just let me know what you have?"

V2)

I have for sale a Smith & Wesson M&P40c in excellent condition.  This gun is chambered for .40 S&W and is the compact version of Smith & Wesson's very popular M&P line of polymer pistols.  I am including a LaserLyte S.C. V2, a high quality rail-mounted laser that fits the short rail of the M&P40c.

The Smith & Wesson M&P40c is in excellent condition.  There have only been about 100 rounds fired through the pistol; all quality, factory ammunition.  The gun was purchased new by me and hasn't had any previous owners.  The gun has been kept cleaned and oiled per the factory recommendations.  The gun was only used at the range and therefore has no holster wear, rust, or other problems.  It functions flawlessly.  The gun comes with two factory 10-round magazines: one that is flush with the pistol (allowing for two fingers on the grip) and one that has a small extension (allowing for three fingers on the grip), just as all M&P compact pistols.  Also included is the original manual and original lockable gun case.  This specific model is configured with a thumb safety, no magazine safety, and no internal lock.  The gun is factory stock with no modifications or aftermarket parts.

The LaserLyte S.C. V2 rail-mounted laser is a quality laser with a factory MSRP of $99.95.  The laser is built specifically for subcompact pistols with a short rail.  The batteries (three 393-style batteries) will need to be replaced; included are batteries that still function, but are running low.  Included with the laser are the original two hex wrenches (for adjusting the laser and removing the batteries), an optional Picatinny rail mount (that can be added to the bottom to allow another accessory to be mounted underneath the laser, such as a light), and the original two mounting screws (to mount the optional Picatinny rail mount).  Original instructions are not included; however, printed copies from the official website are included.

Asking price is $500 OBO.  I am looking primarily for cash; however, I will consider trading if it involves a GLOCK 22 Gen4, GLOCK 23 Gen4, or GLOCK 35 Gen4.   Preferred method of sale is face to face in person.  I am located in Winter Garden, near Ocoee.  If shipping is required, the cost must be covered by the buyer.

A firearms bill of sale is required; no exceptions.  Florida ID is also required (driver's  license, state ID, and/or concealed weapon license).

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.  I am available to reply quickly at almost all times.

I bought this nice little Pistol new in 1989. This is the lightest gun you will ever hold. It's as close to box new as you will get. I'm sad I don't have the box. I've looked everywhere nd I always keep those. This is the early first year model with the 10 round clip. Comes with both factory clips.  You know how hard this pistol is to find. I have not shot more than a 100 rounds through it. This Pistol is no disappointment.

And, again, I really hate to say it - but don't tell me something about your gun that's not true - I recently wasted a lot of mileage because the seller has mis-described his gun.  I'll do pictures for/to anybody that sends me a picture of what they wish for a trade, just include a phone number that I can text a photo to.  I have no real motivation to sell this gun, I dont need the money.  If there are any discrepancies between price we can do cash one way or the other to make it up.  Ideally you're someone looking to build this into a class three (SOT-FFL) and would have something to trade me."

L@@K!!!,"North Bend, Oregon Coast, Oregon",$ 265,"Listed On: Friday, August 3, 2012",Handguns,Walther                                                                                ,9mm Makarov                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"FS: 1  Bulgarian Makarov semiautomatic pistol chambered in 9x18 Mak.  This pistol will only fire 9 x18  MAKAROV ammo. Using any other ammo caliber in this pistol such as .380acp, or 9x18 police ultra can cause serious injury to the user!  This pistol is a police surplus pistol before it was imported and therefore has some minor holster wear but is in perfect functioning order and is in good cosmetic condition as well. The Makarov  model pistol was  once the standard sidearm for the Soviet military and police as well as used by the KGB, East German Stasi and military forces in Eastern Europe and around the world.  During the cold war the Makarov was produced in East Germany, Bulgaria, and Russia.  Sometimes called the ""AK-47"" of pistols, this pistol is known for superb reliability and simplicity that is the hallmark of Soviet era gun design.  During the war between the Soviets and the CIA backed Mujahideen in Afghanistan during the 1980s the Makarov was prized much as an iPHONE is today.  If you had one, you were one of the ""cool"" guys.  With the fall of the Soviet Union large numbers of these pistols made there way to US shores through importers of surplus arms.   Once rare war trophy bring backs from war zones like Vietnam and Afghanistan, these days  any legal gun owner can purchase a piece of history!  The Mak. is similar to the Walther PPK in size and power, with a  simpler design and fewer parts. This blued, solid  steel, fixxed barrel, blowback pistol is FUN to shoot!  Very accurate within 20 or 30 yards.  It will shoot any brand of ammo I have tried from expensive brass cased Hornady to cheaper stuff like Brown Bear and I have never had a jam or misfired once after shooting at least 7 kinds of ammo from brass to steel case HP and FMJ. Take down and cleaning is easy and replacement parts are plentiful and cheap! The Makarov can be converted to fire more readily available .380ACP by changing the barrel.  If you change the barrel to .380ACP you can use the same magazine due to .380 an 9x18 being similar size.  Those looking for a suitable gun for concealed carry should consider buying this pistol.   The  Makarov  makes a great concealed carry pistol due to its small size and thin profile thanks in part to using a sing stack magazine, keeping the width of the pistol down.   Once used for plain clothes police work in Eastern Europe   The Mak lends itself well to concealed carry.  The pistol, carried in a pants, or jacket pocket does not 'print' very much and is easy to draw.  When firing,  the all steel construction makes felt recoil  low for a small pocket sized semi auto.  The trigger guard is large enough to fit a gloved finger, a nice feature on a small framed pistol. The safety system consists of a decocker that blocks the firing pin from striking the bullet.  Some people do not use the decocker at all and simply carry the pistol with a round chambered, safety off like a DAO style pistol or revolver.  The decocker doubles as the safety.  When the safety is in the up position, it  decocks the hammer if it is cocked, the firing pin is blocked and the trigger cannot be pulled.  Push the safety lever down and you can now actuate the trigger and fire the weapon.  When you go to shoot the pistol the first shot is double action, with each subsequent shot  being single action.  The double action pull for the first round can be avoided by simply  cocking the exposed hammer prior to firing.  The double action trigger pull is long but not bad for a stock trigger.  The single action trigger pull is pretty good as well. After firing the last round the slide is held open by the slide lock and magazines are changed with a european style heel mag release. Mags drop free easily, making reloading in a hostile situation easier.  Mag release is somewhat small, but adding a split ring or a short lanyard can make changing mags faster. Most surplus single stack Makarov pistols for sale online come with 1 or perhaps 2 magazines included at the MOST (if they even offer the option of a second magazine at all)....  The pistol I am selling will include 3 single stack magazines, with 2 mags in excellent condition ( Single stack Makarov mags are  somewhat hard to find for sale and cost about 30 bucks a piece when they can be found).  Also included in the sale will be 3 50 round box of HP and FMJ Brown and Silver Bear ammunition, as well as a genuine leather Makarov tactical retaining lanyard.  The pistol comes with two sets of grips.  The standard issue red grips as well as black wraparound grips.  To purchase the gun from a dealer with all these accessories  you would spend well  over 300 dollars!  The firearm itself has minor holster wear as well as some minimal wear around the slide catch.  If you are a collector of Comm Blocc weaponry buy this pistol.  If you are a CCW holder looking for a reliable DA/SA pistol that will go bang when you pull the trigger EVERY single time but don't want to carry a plastic gun buy this pistol.  If you are a female shooter who doesn't want a gun with a lot of recoil and muzzle flip but still want the stopping power of a medium sized round buy this pistol.  If you already own a Makarov and want a spare Makarov for parts and spare magazines buy this pistol.  If you own a CZ-82 or a PA-63 and want to add a ""REAL"" Makarov to your collection this is the pistol for you.  Whether used for concealed carry or just looking for a low priced gun with a lot of features this is a great pistol for just about anyone looking for a low priced gun with all the features of an expensive Walther PPK costing over 500."

Sadly, the majority of law-abiding citizens who have been charged with a crime after using self-defense may not have been charged at all had they understood the laws. 

While acting in ""self-defense"" many CCH Permit holders have been convicted because their actions were based on incorrect information about the laws.

These are definitely NOT a mass produced “assembly line” rifle! We simply use the finest, GUN-KOTE™ premium metal coating & finish, for maximum protection of the rifle’s metal surfaces. It was first specified by the U.S. Military for use on SOCOM Special Sniper Weapons (SPR’s) in 2003. GUN-KOTE™ is superior to parkerized, blued, or air dry finishes in both durability and performance. GUN-KOTE™ satin matte black finish protects metal parts from rustcorrosion, & scratches and will not break down, peel or dissolve. In fact, once applied and heat-cured, the only way to remove it is through abrasive blasting. GUN-KOTE™ is resistant to all known gun solvents, oils, and thinners. GUN-KOTE™ is a highly specialized, hard, abrasion resistant coating that meets all military specifications for protective coatings. GUN-KOTE™ is formulated to provide excellent impact resistance, lubricity (meets military dry firing specs), heat dissipation, chemical resistance, corrosion protection, durability, and scratch resistance. It is specially formulated for salt corrosion protection and meets US Military requirements for ""Resistant to Chemicals"". GUN-KOTE™ has outstanding heat dissipating qualities, outstanding temperature variation durability (+800 degrees F to -300 degrees F), and outstanding lubrication qualities. The M4 six-position collapsible stock is manufactured in the USA with military grade polymer and a super strong machined aluminum tube. We include a custom machined steel side-rail installed on the left side of the receiver to provide you the option to mount variable power scopes. The double hook USA mfg. G2 trigger group delivers a crisp 3-4 lb. trigger pull. The original CHROME LINED barrel has a bayonet lug and includes mil-spec 14:1 left hand metric threads to attach any muzzle device. The slotted RPK style muzzle break has both slots and ports to help control the muzzle during rapid fire. The UTG® PRO quad-rail system is made in the USA from aircraft grade aluminum. The four mil-spec picatinny rails have integrated QD-swivel housings on left/right rails for accessories. Protective snap on black rubber rail guards are included. The Israeli pistol grip has ergonomic finger groves with a hinged bottom plate and a battery storage tube
that holds two CR123A batteries.

This rifle is not grooved for  scope, but can be drilled and tapped.
A fine, collectible rifle. These are getting a little harder to find and will only increase in value. Asking $300 or possibly trade for another gun. Not interested in trades for old military rifles or electronics.

The ND5 Long Distance Laser Illuminator is the first high powered, hand held laser light built for civilian use. The patented design integrates a state of the art micro Green Laser Pump with a hand controlled Linear Optical Collimator to create the ultimate lighting instrument. One hand, thumb control quickly adjusts laser beam diameter and illumination intensity. 

The high power laser beam may be collimated down and concentrated to cast an intense, highly visible beam of light able to be seen at distances up to 3 miles for signaling or search and rescue operations. Adjusting the ND5’s collimator more open increases the diameter of the beam to fully illuminate objects up to 400 yards.
