What more can you ask for?

1985 Ford F150 4X4 with the reliable straight six (inline six), 4.9L, 300. 4-speed manual transmission with granny gear. Great gas mileage. Drives through the snow with ease. Long-bed. The interior looks GREAT! I have the title in hand.

Issues:
1) It drives great (much better than most trucks of these years), but will eventually need either a new clutch or the synchronizers tuned.
2) Can be a little hard to start at times -- needs a simple carb adjustment for fuel delivery.

Price is $1800 or best offer. Looking to sell quickly. I'm also open to partial trades. I am not interested in any other vehicles as I have enough already; however, let me know if you have something you would like to trade in addition to cash. I must get at least $1,000 cash plus trade."

20,http://www.armslist.com/posts/441020,For Sale:  SAR-1 AK with scope,"Mt.

The rifle came with a side scope mount, and is equipped with a POSP 4x24 scope.
This is a no-zero scope mount. Dial it in once and you can remove it from the rifle for close in work or if you just wish a lighter package, and slide it back on as needed and it will be on target.
The scope is the good version made in Belarus, with a red LED instead of a bulb to illuminate the reticle and it takes a standard American AA battery. Some of these scopes use small bulbs instead of LEDs and take odd-ball Soviet batteries.
This scope was designed just for the 7.62 x 39 and the AK, and has a choke range finder for out to 400 meters, and three aiming chevrons, for 100 meters, 200 meters and 300 meters. Zero it at 100 meters and your good to go out to 300 meters!
The illuminated reticle allows one to engage targets in low light conditions where one would normally be unable to see the rifle sights. Even in total darkness you can engage your target if it is at all illuminated, such as sitting around a camp fire, inside an illuminated building or car while you are concealed safely in total darkness, and even without e battery it is still a fully useful telescopic sight.
http://kalinkaoptics.com/posp-4x24-r...k-version.html

The length of pull was too short for comfortable use with the scope, and so rather than scrunch up uncomfortably every time it was used the stock was lengthened.
Now the rifle shoulders comfortably and the scope comes on target fast every time.
The butt was extended by inserting an oak spacer, secured with epoxy and screws. The mil-spec metal butt plate was retained as well as the butt trap to store the tool kit. This butt is as strong as ever.
The rear sling swivel was also moved to the side of the butt which carries the rifle much more comfortably and contently, either across the back or in front of the chest. 

This is a great combo and you won't be disappointed.  Mor pix available, just reply to email."

I assume this was imported by CAI. The American made parts are pistol grip (by Ronin Grips), receciver, FCG, and muzzle brake. Matching numbers kit with original Yugo barrel. This is the original barrel, it has a dark bore with strong rifiling.  Barrel passes bullet test. This rifle looks to have the original finish, but the receiver is a different shade of blue. These rifles are hard to come by especially with matching parts and fixed stock. I have fired 200 or so flawless rounds out of this rifle. It is suprisingly accurate. Rifle comes with mag pictured. I am willing to take pictures of whatever you want to see, but first come, first served.

This is not the same as the current Zastava PAP single stacks that are being imported. From what I have read with the new rifles the magwell is milled out as well as the front trunnion. Also the bolt is not the same.

It has a receiver that was ACTUALLY made prior to 1899, the cut off date for antique firearms. This is different than curio/relic status. As an exempt antique, this gun requires no FFL to ship it directly to or from your door or to anyone else in nearly any other state. This gun has never been on the books and never will be (unless an act of Congress changes the current law). In fact, an FFL can actually get into paperwork trouble with the ATF should they log it in their bound books. (For more information, please see http://www.rawles.to/Pre-1899_FAQ.html)

This is an 1891 Argentine contract Mauser, manufactured by Ludwig Loewe in Berlin. The rifle is chambered in a powerful 7.65 x 53 ARG caliber (also known as 7.65 Argentine). The rifle has an interesting history, based on certain clues the rifle bears. The rifle has an engraved steel butt plate, with the initials ""RLT"" and the date 27, 8, '42 (August 27th 1942) in the European date format, indicating the rifle was likely brought into the US some time after the US entrance into WWII (it has no import marks). Secondly, the rifle was converted from its original configuration to its present state in the late 30's to early 40's as evidenced by the type of resin used to fill the cleaning rod hole in the stock. The rifle was professionally customized by a skilled gunsmith, who cut down the barrel and re-crowned it, added a new front sight, turned down the bolt, shortened the stock and re-blued and re-finished the gun. Some time later, the rear sight was removed and the receiver drilled and tapped for a scope mount. The rifle has a 5-round internal magazine and the bolt cocks on closing. The bore and chamber are excellent. This is not some modern hack-job garage project sporter conversion. 

The gun will come as pictured, including a camo rifle bag, sling, 1930's vintage shell holder, a 1942 Swiss ammo pouch and 45 rounds of military surplus non-corrosive ammo (Hornady loads modern production 7.65 ARG high performance ammo). 

Cash price is $450. I will trade flat across for an EOTech holographic weapons sight model 512, 517 or 552 in the traditional black housing. Other firearm trades considered as well.

 Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg
 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a
 pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are
 desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while
 firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around
 chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip,
 this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously
 maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to
 the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can
 be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.

I bought this at a gun show, stuck it in the safe, and never shot it; I'm not much of a  revolver guy, and i'm selling my items i never shoot.
This has the six inch ported barrel and fires a 45 ACP round: don't confuse this with the ""judge"" which shoots .45 long colt.
the profile is smaller, because the cylinder only holds five rounds, which require the rounds to be placed in the 5 round ""moon"" clips shown in the photo. Because .45 ACP rounds do not have a rim, they need the rings to hold the rounds in the cylinder.
because it holds an odd number of rounds, there is no ""half moon"" clips avaialble the way 6 round revolvers might have.
I have all the original packaging for this firearm. Includes everything you see in the picture: 5 moon clips, the original keys, and all packaging materials.
When reviewing the Taurus web site, you don't seem to be able to order this in a 6"" barrel any more.

I purchased this new, and I've shot a couple hundred rounds through it in total, but you cannot tell by looking at it. It looks great.
I prefer something a little larger that fits in my hand better, and I really lean towards the 9mm caliber anyway.
Included are a total of three magazines for it; two standard mags with the finger groove on it, and an additional mag that i bought that extends the grip area a little bit. It adds one or two rounds of capacity, but provided the vertical real estate my hands needed to get a better grip.
I do not have any box or other materials related to this firearm.
Looking for 275.00 dollars or best offer.

The Wilson Combat Advanced Design Pistol (ADP) is purposely designed for concealed carry or as a back up pistol for law enforcement. It is compact, nothing on the outside to get hung up on (ie slide release, safety etc. all is internal) when being pulled out like most pistols and makes use of an advanced design striker mechanism together with a gas retard system to allow for a low profile and a fixed barrel for enhanced accuracy. 

Safeties include a manual ambidextrous safety, drop safety which blocks the trigger mechanism, and a 2 position firing pin block. Pistol has an internal slide lock, so on the last round it does lock back, and to relase it you just pull back on the slide. 

The trigger is striker-fired, double-action only with a pre-cocking (this means second strike on misfired round is impossible without at least a partial slide retraction). 

The Sights are a set of fixed night Tritium night sights (Tritium makes them glow with no light needed... ever..)

This gun is what I consider very good shape. The gun has no surface rust and the grips are in good shape. The gun has bluing wear from what I think is holster wear. The one side of barrel, and top of receiver has the bluing removed. It is not rusty. The gun came with a holster that was in horrible shape (looked like it was as old as the gun is) and I threw it away, that is why I am certain it is holster wear. The worst side is in picture. The barrel on the other side is 95% better or maybe even more. I just took the picture of the worst side of the barrel. The gun functions well. The bore is in excellent shape. The cylinder is tight and the grips are in what I consider very good shape for the age of the gun. The gun doesn't have any large dings or nothing to make the gun inoperable. The gun has a few really small dings if you look really close and that is being really detailed. The gun is in very good condition. The grips do have dings and on bottom flat part has some scratches. The sights are in good shape. For about a 100 year old gun this gun is in good shape and to the best of my knowledge all original. I am not a gunsmith nor do I know anything about collectible guns I deal newer low end guns is my specialty but I think this gun is original. Going by what the person that traded it to me and take it as that, he said it was 98 years old and original. I can't verify that however. I do know it is a model 1905 and a 32-20 caliber with a 5"" barrel in very good condition. Layaway is available for 5 months. Shipping is free. Payment is by certified check. Shipping to Alaska, California, or Hawaii is extra. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to email and ask. I can take any picture you want and send it to you. I have many more pictures already taken and will send you if you would like. Shipping is the cheapest way. If you want faster shipping the buyer pays the difference."

Now...  1993 Izhmash /Izmach SVD Dragunov - Tigr (tiger) variant.
exactly 1001 of these are in the USA and 100 more of a complete military variant (which go for about $30K if they ever come up for sale).  this is not a PSL or AK - this is a machined (nothing stamped that matters) weaponry.
Rifle was babied and only non-corrosive ammo shot.  
Original 4x PSO (illuminated), I upgraded to 1.5LED with AA battery cover, since Russian batteries are too rich for me.  However, original set of 2.5v replacement lamps and battery cover is included.  Also, has a retractable original sunshade, sun filter and rubber eye piece.
(3) three - 5rd magazines
(2) two - 10rd magazines (these are actually unissued, brand new and still in the grease paper from Russia, I have not shot em yet)
original scope cover
original grey field/soft bag/case
Russian SVD bayonet
(2) two Belarus made scope rails - low and midium profile - will allow you to use your regular pictanny rings + own scope(s).  All PSO scopes during soviet times were made in Belarus, just an FYI
(1) one original cleaning bottle
(1) one orignal cleaning kit - complete
original Tigr buttstock and handguards (wood buttstock/black non-vented handguards)
real Russian Military issue wood handuards
Current military issue polymer stock with cheek pad and vented black polymer handguards (this set is not pictured, as of right now, but is currently installed on the rifle.  other handguards and original buttstock will be included).
(2) two Russian Military issue canvas magazine pouches/carriers (4-magazine kind) -  NEW.
(1) SVD sling (installed), different than a typical AK sling

rifle shoots EXCELLENT.  no issues PERIOD.  taken care of and always cleaned after each shooting session (despite only non-corrosive ammo shot).

I have a barely used(I went to the range once and shot about 30 rounds through it) bought just before Christmas 2011 Taurus Model 66 .357 6"" barrel 7 Round Capacity with stainless steel matte finish. 3 grips for it including the original Taurus grip, Hogue grip, and a Pachmayr grip. Includes 3 fit holsters. Two are side holsters a Pro-Tech Outdoors, a Blackhawk Holster, and an Uncle Mike's Shoulder Holster. Two H K .357 7 round Speed-loaders also included that work perfectly with it as well. A Basket Weave style Double Speed-Loader pouch to carry them, that will fit on a belt or the shoulder holster. I will include a box of Hornady XTP .357 rounds with the deal. The gun and accessories work perfectly and are in excellent condition having barely been used. It will come with original box and paperwork on the gun.
This is a package deal. I'm not going to take items out to lower price in other words.

Asking price is $500 OBO for everything.

I may take some off the price for a partial trade of a functional smaller backup pistol that is of lesser value depending on the gun. All potential buyers must be legally capable of purchasing a firearm of course. You must be local or willing to travel as well(Nashville/Middle Tennessee Area) as I'm located in Rutherford County and I do not ship guns.

This is a great dependable gun I just don't require it anymore. Currently has the Pachmayr grip installed. I can provide pictures if desired. Everything is in great shape, however as none of it has been used barely at all.

Contact me at REDACTED in the afternoons(4-6pm or later). If I'm not available leave a message and I will get back to you. All potential buyers must be legally capable of purchasing a firearm of course.

ARMALITE INC                 50BMG    

This rifle is the incarnation of the wildly popular AR-50 chambered for the
powerful 50 BMG Cartridge. A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a
unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V shaped stock. Designed to be
an economical answer for the challenge of long range shooting, the AR-50A1
is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a
very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark
and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its
competition.

It shoots like no .45 you've ever fired due to its compensator and custom custom work, and the trigger is phenomenal. It would easily cost $2000-$2500 to build this gun.

These medium frame pistols deliver .380 (9mm short) power in a personal-size package and maintain the reliability, safety and performance features of Beretta's legendary 92FS. The 85F pistols feature an open slide design that increases the reliability of the firearm. The frame is made from an aluminum alloy that delivers the strength and durability of steel, but with 65% less weight. The automatic firing pin block (FS models) prevents the gun from firing in case of inadvertent drops or strikes against hard surfaces. Features such as these, and the built-in reliability and quality, make the 85F a natural for personal defense and an ideal back-up pistol for law enforcement professionals.

I'm looking for a used pair of Colt Cobra .38 Special original walnut hand grips. The hand grips pictured are custom made, I couldn't find a picture of the original walnut hand grips.

I have the newer hard rubber hand grips, perhaps we can trade if you would like the newer hard rubber hand grips, they give you the feeling of security when shooting your .38 Special because they gives you more grip to hold. 

As you already know, the original grips are smaller and harder to get a good grip, it makes it easier to drop your gun when shooting. 

Please e-mail the location, I need to find them here in Denver.
If you have a pair or know any place here in Denver who sells them, please let me know.

Thank you.

I have owned this rig since January of 1990, but it has not been used since 1992. In 1992, I graduated from high school, moved to college, and my dad boxed it up and put it away in a closet. Over the years, the power supply was lost, so this is the radio only. I don't have an antenna (or a mike), so I have not tested it. I did power it up, and it powered up fine. You are welcome to test if you want.

this is a 8+1 cz-50. ill go ahead and start with the bad news first. the slide, side plate, barrel, hammer and frame have light pitting in various places. the inside of the barrel dosent look too bad, and most of the rifling (80-85 ish %) is still there. while there are lots of spots where pitting is present its not that deep in any of the spots. honestly i feel like someone could buff this away. a new coat of bluing would also go a long way. all the internals look clean, otherwise this can be a very like-able pistol. 

this gun shares some of the same characteristics as the cz-52, but keep in mind none of the parts are interchangeable. the general look, trigger, some fire control parts, firing pin, hammer and safety look very close to the cz-52. in hand it feels more like a ppk than a cz-52 

this is a direct blowback weapon and takes down like a makarov or something similar. there is a 3 position safety top-fire down-safe down one more = de-cock. there is a typical left side push button mag release vs the euro style heel release. the mag ( at least this one) dose not drop free. oh i almost forgot this is a double action pistol as well. all matching numbers and no import marks. ill also include 25 rounds of .32acp assuming i dont shoot them.

These current SR-25's are the most accurate semi-auto 308's anyone has ever made. The factory targets show group sizes that are amazing, espically considering thats factory ammo and not handloads. But thats one of the reason's these cost the big bucks and the military snipers chose them for their Semi Automatic Sniper System or SASS trial's. Here are some highlights: 

Free Floating Rail System removes pressure off of the barrel for extreme Accuracy
Very Cool folding sights. The front sight is a rail piece that extends.
Match Grade Trigger
URX rail system developed just for the M110

Here is what their website says:

Knight's Armament has 21 years of experience in 7.62mm development, refinement, and service. The production of the earliest model SR-25's started in 1989. The SR-25 was first conceptualized with its primary function being a sniper rifle. It delivers remarkable shooting accuracy with .5 MOA being attainable in a multiple targer enviroment. The MK11 MOD0 and the M110 have embodied this experience and helped drive our company's renowned pursuit of perfection ultimately leading to the Enhanced Match Series of SR-25's.

The new Enhanced Combat Rifle (E.C.R.) Rifle combines some of the best characteristics from the combat proven MK11 MOD0 and the M110 military rifles. The E.C.R. Rifle's Free-Floating barral is a clone of the legendary MK11 MOD0's, but its Upper Receiver Extending The E.C.R. Rifle's ambidextrous magazine release was also a noteworthy.

All 3 are asking over 700, 750 for used NHM-91s. not including brand new EXPENSIVE tactical equipment.

 - 1.5 mm thick receiver
 - Chrome-lined barrel 
- All internal nickel plated parts

 - DEBANNED (working muzzle threads)
 - Arsenal sling
