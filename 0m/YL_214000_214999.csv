Comes with box, 2 -16rd mags as new. This is a great gun for home defense or concealed carry(same size as glock 19/23) but gives you the added security of carrying with one in the pipe due to its longer DAO trigger( about 8 lbs). You wont shoot yourself in the leg like carrying a glock like that(cough plaxico burress LOL) Has front tritium night sight which in my opinion is better than trying to line up 3 glowing dots in the dark, have you ever tried to do this? (you go crosseyed at times). Price is firm at $365, sells for over $400 at most gun shops plus you don't pay tax. I havent registered it with S&W on their website so you will get full lifetime warranty as if you are original owner. FTF transactions only and prefer CWP holders. Thanks for looking

If you want to shoot the gun double action, the decocker is really odd on this gun. To decock it, you set the safety on safe and pull the trigger. Yep, that's not a misprint...you pull the trigger to safely drop the hammer. The best route is to not bother with double action shooting with this gun. The single action shooting is easy and fun.The Walther P22 comes in two sizes: one with a 5"" barrel (mine shown) which also has a compensator that probably doesn't actually accomplish anything. It just makes the gun look cooler. It also comes in a model with a 3.4 "" barrel with no compensator.

The gun features interchangeable backstraps to better fit a shooters hand, ambidextrous controls, magazine disconnect, hammer safety and firing pin safety, fixed (read more accurate) barrel, and interchangeable barrel. The gun is only 18.7 oz, comes with two 10 round magazines, rear sight adjustable for windage, 3 interchangeable front sights for elevation, sights of the 3 dot configuration.The gun is plenty accurate with the fixed barrel contributing to that aspect of the gun. With it being super light, it is easy to maneuver and the sights come in line quickly on the 5"" model. People who shot it initially loved it and could hit anything they shot at with little time to get used to the gun.
When I purchased the Walther P22, I thought it to be a little pricey at around $360 plus tax new. But considering the weight and size, ability of people of all sizes to shoot it, accuracy, and exceptional dependability, I now consider it to be a good value. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an acceptable .22 pistol for the whole family.

         Currently accepting and considering all offer 
 --Beretta msrp $3500--I have for sale a Sako TRG 42 in 300 win mag w/ the mil spec green stock phosphate finish. It was properly broken in and cared for. It has just under 320 rds through it. 

All the accessories on it except for the scope are all factory Sako.
--Ber msrp $450-- Sako 30mm 30moa 3 ring tactical low scope mount (you can get no better mount for this rifle)
--Ber msrp $199-- Sako factory muzzle break - very effective there is very little recoil to this rifle and hundreds of rounds could be shot through it a day with no issue 
--Ber msrp $548-- Sako factory bi pod - this bi pod really makes this rifle. The bi pods hinge point is above the barrel allowing for the rifle to sit in a channel making it extremely stable
--Ber msrp $250-- 1 extra for a total of 2 double stack single feed 7rd sako factory mag
--Trij msrp $1275-- Trijicon 5x20x50 accupoint mildot green very clear scope and the thing that really got me on this scope was its ability to cut through fog. There was a little wildlife area between my house and the next line of houses that ranged out to 485 yards strait across and at 105 yards out there is a little creek with a tree line. One foggy night i took the rifle out and with teh naked eye the tree line could just barley be made out get down on the scope and the houses out at 485 were as clear as day i was amazed.
-- I have the original box for the scope and the rifle and i believe i have the Sako sling for it
-- You will get any once fired/ twice fired brass i have for it and i also have probably 50 rds i loaded with 200gr smk 68.5g reloader 22
-- RCBS 3 die set and a neck die. 

-- package msrp NOT including die sets, brass, loaded ammo, tax and or shipping = $6,222.00


   This was my long range rifle and has been shot at a 1000 yards. I had never shot past 300 yards befor and the first time i took it out i was making 600 yard head shots and hits on a man sized target with a 3 direction wind at 1000 yards. If you have any abillity to pull a trigger the gun shoots itself i was very impressed and will build another Sako TRG when i can afford to. 

  The rifle is insanely adjustable. The butt pad can move up, down, in, out, and can also be rotated to angle in or angle out. The trigger is the same can be moved forward or rearward in the trigger guard, it can also move left or right in the trigger gaurd or even out of the trigger guard to where it is almost 90 degrees to the action, it to can be rotated either in towards your finger or away from it. The check piece is the same up,down,left,right, and can be slightly angled. I know of no other rifle that is as adjustable and i love that the trigger can be turned. The trigger is also fully adjustable for weight down to about 2lbs and the first stage take up can also be adjusted for weight.

For high volume, dirt cheap practice or plinking with a centerfire pistol, few accessories are as useful or cost effective as a 22 rimfire conversion kit. This Tactical Solutions kit is a finely crafted, drop-in slide replacement for America's favorite sidearm, the Model 1911. Engineered to fit Government or Commander sized frames, these machined steel units come complete with a 4.5"" barrel, firing pin overtravel stop, adjustable sights, integral full-length optic rail and 10-round aluminum magazine. Installed on the pistol's frame, this conversion kit maintains the feel and profile of its centerfire counterpart, providing the user with a familiar grip angle and operating controls for economical, yet useful and realistic practice. The kit is compatible with single-stack or STI wide-body frame designs with the appropriate magazine inserted. The 10-round magazines lock the slide to the rear when depleted, a unique attribute that is often overlooked on rimfire conversions."

Price is $400, shipping is $25.00. I am in Asheboro and willing to travel some to make a deal. All laws apply so I need a permit, or CHP and ID plus we will complete a bill of sale."

Skorpion pistol in .32 ACP, comes with all the original factory goodies - hard case with form-fitting foam, nylon holster and mag pouch, CD-ROM, two 20-round magazines and one 10-round magazine.  Will also come with 50 rounds of Fiocchi 73gr. FMJ ammo, loaded into the magazines. 

Gun is incredibly fun to shoot and very accurate, I was surprised when I shot it.  It has had no more than 300 rounds through it, and that is estimating high (I don't get out to the range nearly as often as I'd like to).

Only trades I will consider are for a 6"" Colt Anaconda or Leupold 4x pistol scope."

These where made in the late 40's but most popular in the 50's From what little research i did they stop making them in the 70's not sure the date of this one, but looks to be one of the 50's model's I took pictures of the emblems you need to find out. This is a rare gun because there is only  a couple guns today that can shoot a S,L and LR in the same slide. the condition is really good for this old of a gun. there is nothing major wrong with it. All the pieces are here and shoot's beautifully. It has some nicks and scratches on the stock. but no cracks the only thing that need fixing is it need a spring for the safety button. the safety works but if you shake the gun you can knock the safety off by accident. so put a spring on it and it's good as new. I have seen these go for alot more but i don't use it anymore so would like 200.00 for it and to see someone take it that would take care of it and appreciate the good old made in U.S.A quality that comes with it.

Anybody educated on this revolver understands it is a ""forever gun"" it will out last you your children and most likely their children. It is the much smaller version of the very popular Ruger GP100. Since I am the orginal owner I will require you sign a bill of sale and provide your drivers license #, if this is a problem, I don't want to do business with you. I am willing to provide all my info at point of sale or trade as well.

I don't really need to sell or trade, just have to many .357, so please spare me the low ball offers( if you can help it)

The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, Novak® night sights, integral accessory rail, ambedextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. Two finishes are available; Two-tone and corrosion resistant Nitron®. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Kansas CCH Class June 30, 2012 (Saturday)
Taught by active, full time Police Officer
Teaching CCH since 2007

I have real-world experience and teach from that perspective. I add to the basic curriculum to help better prepare students for the challenges of concealed carry and the
potential use of deadly force.

We cover CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Armed Response / Self Defense, Interaction with Law Enforcement and much more.

This is an excellent class taught by a knowledgeable instructor with a bit more than the AG CCH Instructor certification.

Full Time Police Officer
Certified CCH Instructor
NRA Instructor
Self Defense / Armed Response Instructor
Taser Instructor
30 years of experience

Many instructors base there classes on things learned in books and pseudo tactical as seen on TV
My instruction is based on proven and experienced technique and instruction

If you are considering a CCH class just ask yourself: Do you want to learn from someone with true experience in armed conflict, or a used car salesman who decided to teach CCH?

I have the opportunity to interact with many CCH holders and have found that many times the information they received was inaccurate and sometimes dangerous.

I believe in CCH and that is why I teach. IF you are wanting to carry a firearm, just be sure you ask questions of your instructor; their philosophy and true credentials. It is easy to become a CCH instructor, but it takes experience in armed conflict to offer what is really required.

Contact me via email with questions or check my website (partially under construction); www.tacticalcch.com

I am a CCH Instructor (since 2007) and a full time police officer. In teaching CCH classes, I have seen the need for a more advanced curriculum that goes beyond the CCH law and teaches how to apply CCH to your life - meaning how to effectively carry a handgun (types of carry, options, choices), types of handguns available and why you would choose a particular type, how to deploy a handgun under stress and how to make that choice.

I touch on these topics in my CCH classes, but this curriculum is designed to offer much more detail and hands-on exercises to help you as a CCH holder.

It's not enough to get your license and go to the target range. To be effective in armed defense, you need to skills and knowledge to be effective without being a liability.

I have created this course based on training and experience as both an instructor and law enforcement officer.

In this 4-hour course, you will learn:

Weapon and Holster Selection
Ammunition Choices and Philosophy
The Stages of the Draw
The Importance of Trigger Control and Fundamentals
The Adrenaline Effect
Use of Cover and Movement
Less Lethal Options
Threat Detection, Avoidance and Confrontation
Use of Force - Legal and Moral Issues
The After Effect of combative encounters

This class consists of presentations as well as hands-on exercises. I use the SIRT training pistol as well as simulated non-firing replicas as part of this training regime.
I consider this information to be a 'must have' for anyone carrying or considering carrying a handgun. The state CCH course only goes so far. This is the additional training and information that you need.

Classes forming now, with the next scheduled to be December 10, 2011 (one week after my next CCH class).

I have a unique offering. Here is a beautiful condition Gen 2 Glock 19 compact 9mm. In my opinion, these are the best shooting, best looking Glocks ever produced.

In case you aren't familiar with Glocks, these Gen 2 models without finger grooves are highly desirable. Personally, they fit my hand much better than the newer models with the finger grooves. Guys spend hundreds of dollars sending their newer model 19s off to have grip reductions in order to mimic the look and feel of Gen 2 Glocks.

This gun in particular was produced on June 28, 1994, and I believe it to have 500 or fewer rounds down the pipe. I have NEVER experienced any type of malfunction in the 300+/- rounds I have sent down range.

I do not have to sell this gun, I am just looking to shuffle up the safe a bit. With that being said, don't bother with low-ball offers or silly trades such as Jennings, Lorcin, or Hi-Point.

A bill of sale will be required, and I am happy to complete one for you on a trade. Proof of OH residency and age in the form of a drivers license or CHL will also be required. CHL holders will be given preference on this gun.

Included in sale is original Glock Tupperware, pistol, and original 10 rd Magazine. I have a 15 rounder available also if the price/trade is right."

In the medical field you could say that I do ""transplants"" to patients needing a new heart, lung or such. Your old Winchester will live again but in another body. Go now, to the fartherest corner of your shop and dig out that old, tired soldier and send it to me. I'll prepare it for surgery. I'll wear a mask and everything!
 You'll be surprised how much I'll pay for it!!

There are also mil-dots for windage.  I got this from the first owner, who bought it in 2007.  I have only shot it once in the last year I have had it.  The whole set up is painted in a camaflauge that has some scratches in the paint (not the gun), since the prior owner took in hunting for Elk and got one soon before I purchased this rifle.  Also comes with a case and some ammo.  The prior owner worked up a maximum accuracy load for this.  There are 50 rounds of this handload and the load data go with the rifle (a real time saver if you reload).  I shoot mostly handgun and do not use this excellent rifle enough to keep it.

The Browning BDM pistol is an interesting development, that first appeared in 1991 and was in production until late 1990s 

BDM stands for the Browning Double Mode (or Dual Mode), and it's mean that the pistol can be had in either traditional Double Action mode or in Double Action Only Mode ... in the same gun, and the change of mode can take a split a second, not more. It is done via the small slotted switch in the left side of the slide. The switch has two positions, marked ""P"" and ""R"". P stands for Pistol, or DA mode, R stands for revolver, or DAO mode. The switch can be turned from one position to another by any sharp-tipped tool such a knife, skrewdriver or even a coin. BDM is equipped with ambidextrous, frame-mounted safety / decocker levers. To engage safety (and decock the hammer in DA mode) one must pull the lever down, and the lever will stay in this position. To disengage safety the lever must be pulled up, so a red dot will show on the frame.

While being quite similar to the Browning BDA pistol, the BDM differs from it in the number of ways. First, being a recoil operated, locked breech pistol with Browning High-Power type (surprise, surprise) tipping barrel, the BDM has SIG-Sauer-like locking system, when barrel engages with single large lug into the ejection port on the slide. Another change from traditional ""Browning"" style is a disassembly lever on the left side of the frame, that must be turned down for removal of the slide and barrel, instead of the traditional HiPower method where you remove the slide catch lever. The slide stop is also of different pattern, without the usual Browning-ish long lever, and with only small lip protruding from inside the frame. Sights and grip panels are similar to Browning BDA or Browning High Power Mark III.

The BDM is one of the thinnest full-size, high capacity combat pistols. It is also reported as reliable and comfortable to carry and shoot, but unusual safety operations require some shooters' adaptation."

Firearm is Like New in Box (LNIB) with less than 50 rounds. It comes with original box including paperwork and original 7-round magazine. I will also include a new in package Kimber 7-round magazine. As you can see from the pictures this firearm is a beautiful example of a Kimber Custom II 1911. 

The Custom II is a full sized model 1911, with a five inch barrel and utilizes a single full-length guide rod. Kimber has had some issues over the years with external extractors, however this firearm has the more traditional (earlier version) internal extractor and functions flawlessly. As Kimber's base model it includes a number of excellent features including lowered ejection port, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety, beavertail grip safety, and internal firing pin safety. 

Compare a Kimber Custom II with any other brand of 1911 or any other type of semi-automatic pistol. See for yourself why Kimber continues to be the number one brand in the hearts and minds of firearms enthusiasts.

• Match grade barrels are machined from solid steel forgings for accuracy and long life. 
• Enlarged firing pin stop locks the extractor in position for absolute reliability. 
• Slightly extended slide release buttons on all pistols speed operation. 
• Beveled magazine wells on each pistol ensure quick magazine loading. 
• Kimber pistols feature a polished breech face for flawless feeding and extraction.

It is absolutely mint. It comes with original case, 3 mags and all paperwork.

he 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.

. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.

. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.

. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.

. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.

. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.
