Alexander Arms® is the originator of the large-caliber, .50 Beowulf®, AR-15 style weapon concept. As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. We have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead. The .50 Beowulf® was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results. Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf® has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry. The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf® rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal."

Here is information about #41 primers from CCI: 
Military-style semi-auto rifles seldom have firing pin retraction springs. If care is not used in assembling ammunition, a ""slam-fire"" can occur before the bolt locks. The military arsenals prevent this using different techniques and components - including different primer sensitivity specifications - from their commercial counterparts. CCI makes rifle primers for commercial sale that matches military sensitivity specifications that reduce the chance of a ""slam-fire"" when other factors go out of control*. If you're reloading for a military semi-auto, Look to CCI military primers. 
* Effective slam-fire prevention requires more than special primers. Headspace, chamber condition, firing pin shape and protrusion, bolt velocity, cartridge case condition, and other factors can affect slam-fire potential. 
Use the same data as CCI magnum primers"

I have taken the rifle apart and cleaned it of cosmoline.  I have fired about 200 rounds through it; the rifle shoots 2-3"" to the right at 50 yards with 203 grain bullets.  This windage error can easily be fixed by drifting the front sight (which is dovetailed to the barrel) with a brass punch.  Again, the rifle shoots good groups at that range, it is just that the sights are a little off center at the moment.

Get one before they are BANNED!
This may be your last chance. I was in a local firearms retailer this week. There backlog of AR orders is 38. Yes 38 and that was 1 out of 5 or 6 local stores. So imagine how many are on backorder across this great country? They said before the last 2 months they were receiving and selling 10 or so AR style rifles per week and now they are only receiving 1-2 per week, if any. So getting on a backorder list is far from a guarantee as they could be BANNED before you would receive one."

What The rifle must be.
Condition is everything!
Must be Functional! All parts shall work as intended and be free of defect.
The Bore should be in very good to excellent condition. ( i.e. NO rust, Pitting\Frost. It should have well defined lands and grooves, and be clean)
Metal finish should be free of rust and Pitting.  (Very Minor spotty Surface rust that will wipe off is ok.)
Wood Shall be free of Cracks and major dents, gouges,  (light finish wear and dings acceptable) 
(Note:) I realize the gas system on these were often neglected and were not cleaned as much as the bore. With that said a small amount of wear\ pitting in the system parts is expectable so long as operation is not hindered. 

What I prefer but not a deal breaker.
Matching numbers.  Stamped preferred but penciled ok 
Early style muzzle break with the rails on the receiver.
Has Cleaning Rod


What I don’t care about.
Plant of manufacture. Tula, Ishevec , etc

The Better the Condition the more I am willing to offer spend. Lower the condition\preferably the less I will offer.

The 380 caliber is the rarest of the already rare RPB series of pistols made in 1982

LITTLE HISTORY
RPB was on the verge of going under from finical problems. In the late 1970s Wayne Daniel purchased a large majority of the companies stock and started to produce semi-auto versions of the M11-A1. By removing the collapsible stock and the ability to fire Full-Auto, the open bolt SM11-A1 became a Title 1 pistol and could be purchased by anyone.

These new semi versions of the M11 sold like hot cakes until the BATF intervened in 1982 because they felt these open bolt semi-auto copies could be converted to Full-Auto to easily. Because of this all open-bolt pistol produced after 1982 are considered Machine Guns and this is why we don’t see semi-auto open bolt guns any more.

Luckily for owners of these semi-auto pistols all guns not modified on or produced before the ruling were grand fathered and not considered machine guns.

Unfortunately this ruling by the BATF hurt RPB financially and brought unwanted legal attention so Wayne Daniel dissolved the company in April 1982.

The RPB SM11-A1 is chambered in .380 ACP & uses steel magazines in either 16 or 32 round capacities. Unlike most M-11s it has no collapsible stock that extends from the butt of the weapon and only fires in semi-auto. It does use the open bolt method of operation & the end of the barrel is threaded to accept a silencer or other barrel accessory. Compared to other M-11s the RPB guns are generally of a higher quality.

The RPB SM11-A1s is rare because they are the last of the legal open-bolt semi-auto pistols. Because of this they command a good deal for a Title 1 pistol on the open market because MAC collectors are always on the look out for them.

The Henry Lever Action is a classic Western-style lever action rifle, and one of the most popular .22's on the market today. The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition.

The Henry Lever Action features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight, and a grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter.

The barrel length is 18.25"", overall length is 36.25"", and it weighs in at a very comfortable 5.25 pounds.

I was a grunt in the Marines (0311 Golf 2/2) and got transferred to work in my companies armory. When I was in the corps we stopped using these hand guards and went to knights armament quad rails that were designed to take the bottom rail off and mount an M203 40mm under it, or if the Marine was not issued an M203 we simply left the bottom rail on.. anyway. I walked into battalion armory one day and they had a huge pile of crap that was being dermoed. All kinds of old crap we didn't use anymore and in it was three of the old school M203 handgurds. Of course I did what Marines do best and ""tactically acquired"" all three of them! I only have one now which is the one you see in the picture but theres the story. I didn't buy this anywhere or make one or modify in any way shape or form. 100% original USMC. Ive never seen any website sell these I am not even sure if there allowed to or maybe I never looked hard enough but here they are. I have the original handguards as well. lower is a standard Stag Arms, Upper is a Delton with 18"" barrel. Full BCG. I am more interested in trades that anything else. I want to do a one for one swap. No adding cash or any of that bs it make it ""even"". Thank you for looking and SEMPER FI to all my devil dogs. eerr.

If you are interested in adding to this rifle here is a site where you can buy a 37mm flare launcher to go underneath it. Looks just like an m203.

American Tactical FX45 Thunderbolt 1911 .45ACP, 5 Inch Barrel, Matte Black Finish, Adjustable Sights, Picatinny Rail, 7 Round Mag
American Tactical FX45 Thunderbolt 1911 features: 

Single action, steel frame, Strike Force Black G10 grips with Wilson Combat hex screws,  ambidextrous manual safety, adjustable white dot LPA Bo Mar Sights, full length guid rod, skeletonized hammer and trigger, extended slide stop, flared beveled magazine well, and Picatinny rail.
Handgun is clean and comes with 2 magazines, it's original box and paperwork. 

This pistol has seen less than 200 rounds total and has been a tack driver.  It eats everything, FMJ and all types of defensive ammo.  It rivals any higher end 1911 in my collection be it Kimber, Springfield, or Sig Sauer.   These handguns are manufactured by S.A.M. Inc Philippines for ATI Rochester, NY.    These Filipino guns can shoot!   They offer amazing features for a fraction of the price of a higher priced 1911.  

Price is $625 which extremely fair as these run right at $700 new out the door at a smaller FFL shop.   If you desire a 1911 with all the features of one like a Springfield TRP Operator without breaking the bank then this is your baby.  

I am located in the south metro area of Minneapolis/St. Paul and would meet in that area i.e. Rosemount, Apple Valley, South St Paul, IGH, and Cottage Grove.  
This is a cash only sale and will only sell face to face.   PTC/PTP and Valid MN DL needed (I show you mine and you show me yours) a bill of sale can be provided at the buyers request.
