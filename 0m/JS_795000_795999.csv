Now one bill is trying to go through the house but that only pertains to hi cap mags and there are no mentions of any kind of gun ban. Anyone who is trying to buy a 223 platform just wait it out don't give these guys your hard earned money once the dust settles and everyone gets the stores stocked they will be availible for purchase. If you buy these over priced guns new in the box all their gonna do is take all the money extra and go clear out the shelves again don't give them the satisfaction or your hard earned money and perpetuating this cycle of craziness. If there is anyone out there who has an ar platform for a reasonable used price then I'm interested. If we refuse to pay these prices which are bs the assholes who bought ten guns at once are going to be stuck with them or take the right price for them I can't stress enough that all gun factories are working overtime to fill shelves again with their products and when they do the prices will not be any different then they were last year meaning two months ago don't fall for the hype while yes the 30rd mags may be unavailable inthe near future there are no bills, laws, or bans on rifles or any other weapons so go get a job and stop stealing people's hard earned money find another way to try and rip people off."

Heckler & Koch & Umarex have combined forces to create a 416 in .22LR. The highly-anticipated HK 416 style rifle are officially-licensed by HK and fire the inexpensive and affordable .22LR ammunition. Specifications: Action: Semi-Automatic Barrel: 16.1 inches Caliber: .22 LR Magazine Capacity: 20 round Grips/Stock: Collapsible Sights: Dipoter Style / Adjustable The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense. Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416's pistol grip and butt stock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries. The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient."

I'd also be interested in a .308 ""battle"" rifle like the Sig 716 Patrol, or something similar.  I would also consider certain AK-47 variants, but no SKS's.  I will also consider reasonable cash offers for the 870 and the M77.

The Remington 870 has an 18"" barrel, an ATI folding stock, synthetic foregrip/pump, an additional standard barrel, and the original wooden foregrip/pump.

The M77 has had fewer than 100 rounds through it, but it does have minor damage to the stock where the front sling swivel snapped off and chipped it (pictured).  The swivel end is still in there, so you may want to extract that.  Other than that, the gun is in great condition, and it shoots like a dream.  Depending on the trade/deal I may also include a brand new, never mounted, set of Ruger scope rings (no longer in the box, but new nonetheless).
Thanks!"

Its getting harder by the day to find any quantities of ammo in stock and its possible that it will become either regulated or taxed very heavily very soon - or both. Get it while you can.
No taxes no shipping no waiting and no wondering if or when your order might ever get filled or even cancelled.

From the manufacturer:
ECONOMIC RELIABILITY. Blazer¬Æ Brass brings shooters the reliability and quality of ammunition built to SAAMI standards, and is backed by stringent ISO certified quality systems. Blazer Brass is loaded in reloadable brass cases for added value. Standard Boxer-type primers and primer pockets mean you can reload Blazer Brass cases just like any other case. Blazer Brass is loaded with a protected-base FMJ bullet. CCI¬Æ primers insure reliable ignition, and we load clean-burning propellants. Blazer Brass loads are very similar to Speer Lawman ammunition. It is produced in CCI's production facility in Lewiston, Idaho along the banks of the Snake river.

First of All:

PLEASE.

1. If the ad is still posted the rifles are still available. Please.
2. This is a package deal....All or None. Please.

Yes. They are AR15 rifles. 
Yes. They are standard .223/5.56 caliber.
Yes. They are black. 
Yes. They are semiautomatic.
Yes. You can paint them any color you want.
Yes. They are absolutely legal to own in the states that matter. :)
Yes. AR15s are very fun to shoot and have very little recoil to them.
No. These are A2 uppers....mounting glass is tough....you want an A4 upper for that.
No. These are NOT MACHINE GUNS.
No. I DO NOT SHIP OVERSEAS.
No. I DO NOT SHIP TO NY/MA/CA/IL or any other anti 2nd amendment state. Sorry.
No. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE - FFL REQUIRED TO SHIP THESE GUNS ANYWHERE.

LOL....I know...I apologize for my Captain Obvious routine....but you wouldn't believe some of the queries I've fielded.

Now that is out of the way.

2 x Superior Arms AR lower receivers - Brand New

2 x Delton LPK including standard grip and trigger kit - Brand New

1 x Standard A2 Round Handguards Assembled Upper - Used but good condition
No visible mfg marks.

I Don't Have a round count for these uppers..... but the feedramps and muzzles have no signs of extreme usage.

2 x Standard A1/A2 buttstocks - Very Used (ie not pretty) but absolutely functional
YES -  YOU CAN PAINT THEM - :)

WHAT IS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THESE 2 x AR15 SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES???
2 x butt tube/spring/retaining nut assembly - Not real tough to find online.
You could go with entire buttstock kit for a bit more money.

1 x Bolt/Carrier/Charging handle assembly - Yes....Getting much tougher to find but I know one website that says they still have in stock for $155 each. I didn't try to order so I didn't verify their in-stock claim.

Bottom line....I don't see it costing any more than $300-$350 at the most to finish and end up with 2 rifles....thats if you have to buy everything brand new.....and paint them any color you want!

Colt M4 Upper with Colt 11.5"" SOCOM heavy barrel upper, F marked front sight base, A2 Compensator.  Like new condidtion.  Only had about 500 milspec blanks run thru it.  Used as a blank gun upper on one tv show for two days.  No live rounds ever fired through it.  Comes with a new Colt charging handle and standard hand guards (not pictured)  These are designed for sustained rate full auto, but of course work great in semi auto.  You'd go broke trying to heat this barrel up to enough to destroy it, especially with today's ammo prices.  Also included is a MATECH Military issue backup iron sight (also not pictured)

I can ship, but would prefer local.  No trades please, I'm thinning the herd a bit.  Unless you've got some bulk .308 of decent quality.

This is an NFA Upper, so you cannot stick in your rifle lower without registring the lower with the ATF.  You can however use as a pistol upper.  I can explain the legal details further if need be, or you can look up the NFA regulations on the BATFE website.  Don't take any stupid risks just to have something cool.

I thought this should be read by law abiding NC gun owners, but did not know where to post it. Feel free to spread this letter and post anywhere you feel it will do some good.

Thank you for contacting me regarding the recent mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.  I share your profound sadness at this senseless act of violence, which has taken an unimaginable toll on the families of the victims, the Newtown community, and the nation as a whole.  I also appreciate your sharing your ideas for gun reform.

This is a time of national mourning, as well as a time for serious soul-searching and reflection.  The Newtown tragedy is just the most recent reminder that our current laws are failing to keep guns out of the hands of those intent on doing harm.  The time has come for a renewed focus on gun violence in this country, one that acknowledges that common-sense precautions can help prevent these terrible tragedies while still allowing law-abiding citizens to own and use guns.  I refuse to believe that this issue is too complicated or politically divisive to be addressed comprehensively and conclusively.  Surely the horror of Sandy Hook should be sufficient to spur us to action.

To that end, I strongly support legislation that would keep assault weapons and high-capacity magazines--which have no legitimate self-defense or recreational purpose--off of our streets.  I have also co-sponsored a measure that would close the ""gun show loophole,"" which allows as many as 40 percent of all guns sold in the United States to change hands without criminal background checks.  As we look ahead to the new Congress, I am actively considering other reforms that could help prevent another Sandy Hook, Aurora, Oak Creek, Tuscon, or Virginia Tech.

This tragedy is also a reminder that we must address the way in which we treat mental illness in this country.  For too long those suffering from these disorders have been stigmatized and isolated from society.  The support and treatment we need to offer are currently being compromised, in North Carolina and elsewhere, by misguided budget priorities.  We must do better, especially in reaching out to troubled young people.

You may wish to read my recent statement on the Sandy Hook tragedy at http://go.usa.gov/gGfH.  Again, thank you for contacting me, and please continue to keep in touch on issues of concern.

The silencer is fake but i have converted the rifle to an SBR although i kept the overall length and 26.5"" to avoid having to pay the tax stamp on it which an Official SBR is overall length of 26"" or shorter. i was gonna attach a flash suppressor to give it a more low profile look. It comes with a 22 Rd magazine and gun lock. the picture is of course with the suppressor attached so overall length is 33.5"" and no modifications are visible. its great for running down small game.  will sell only FTF and WILL NEED a valid OH ID and sign a bill of sale. will meet about halfway for an additional cost depending on distance."

These pieces of legislature would not only ban AR-15 style rifles, but ban ALL guns that are CAPABLE of receiving over 10 round magazines, which include most hunting rifles, handguns, and even quite a few shotguns. Also magazines over 10 rounds will be outlawed for all guns, certain features such as extendable stocks, pistol grips, and flash suppressors will also be banned. Even further, all current guns will have to be YEARLY registered IN PERSON by the ATF.
 This is not only a direct encroachment on American rights, but an endangerment to our future and our country. I do not know if any who read this will listen, but I would. Even if you do not have an ‚Äúassault‚Äù style rifle, your hunting rifle is in danger as well. Enough is enough of being silent; it is time to stand up as an American, a god dang Patriot, like Thomas Jefferson, George Washington or Samuel Adams. Not just watch this all happen while sitting on your pile of ammo. Stand the hell up. Make the frickin call.
Following is Congressman Jim Bridenstine‚Äôs number and others. Bridenstine is newly incoming and ""seems"" to be supportive while our SENATORS: Coburn and Inhofe are more suspect. ALL you have to do is say; I am a member of your district and would appreciate it you vote down ALL 2nd Amendment infringing legislature. That is ALL it takes, WE ARE A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. People seem to forget this. Without OUR input OUR leaders cannot represent us. In case you have not noticed, the ‚ÄúPro-Gun‚Äù Republicans have been pretty weak kneed lately, maybe it‚Äôs time we remind them we are still here.

I got 2,000 rounds left of WPA .223 55gr FMJ for sale. Sold 8k this morning and 5k within the last few days. It sell quick in this market so text REDACTED if you're interested. 

You can back order this ammo for .45-.55 per round (after shipping costs) but if a tax is put on .223 ammo, which is very likely, all orders are VOID. Govt. says .223 serves no legitimate sport or hunting purpose. Same goes for ordering mags and guns. 

My price is .60 per round and you get to pick it up the same day you pay. No waiting 4-6 weeks to get it in the mail risking that you wont even be allowed to receive it!

Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ¬±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control.
