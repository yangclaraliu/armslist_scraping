Up for sale is a Springfield Armory .40 S&W 3.8 in. Compact Bi-Tone.
Purchased in November 2011 at Tanner.  Only 400 flawless rounds down the pipe (not a single FTF or FTE).  Shows zero wear other than a little on barrel from cycling.  

Includes all XD gear (carry case with all paperwork, paddle holster, dual mag holster, 3 back straps, 3 mag sleeves for use with full size mags, speed loader, cable lock, cleaning brush), 2 magazines (one 16 round full size and one 12 round flush fit). Replaced original compact magazine floor plate with Pearce grip extension (just the pinky rest, NOT +1 magazine extension) but still have original flush fitting floor plate if you need/want it.  Will also throw in a nylon holster with built in mag pouch.

Included in the price is 400 rounds of Federal 180 gr fmj ammo as well as 20 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 160 gr FTX personal defense ammo (ammo worth $140 by itself).  

Asking $715 pretty firm but feel free to throw me an offer, worst I can say is no.  Not really interested in trades right now but you may surprise me with something cool.  Not hurting for cash so if the right deal can’t be reached I will just hold on to the pistol and let my wife use it.  As stated, only 400 rounds through her.  Cleaned after each trip to the range and stored in my safe. This is a package deal and will not be split up.

As usual, must be 21 and legal to own (NO FELONS or bad guys).  Face to face, cash only.  Happy to meet you halfway within reason (that can be worked out if we get that far) Will need to see CCW or CO DL and must be willing to sign bill of sale (just to cover my rear)."

I bought these for my P01 a few years back, but I like the way the rubber grips  feel.
Most people prefer wood grips for concealed carry and say that the rubber ones hang on their shirts when drawing from iwb. That's pretty much why I bought these. (plus, they looked way better!)

Not an uncommon piece, but it is uncommon being fully functional and in this good of condition.

This John Brown design was so named the WIDOW MAKER as there was no operating lever on the bolt.  To chamber a round, the operator had to place the butt on a flat surface.  Then a knurdled portion of the barrel is gripped to push the barrel down into the shotgun about four inches and released, usually with the muzzle pointed at the opertor's head.  What amazes me the most, by 1912 Winchester recognized the design flaw and would give a new Model 12 to each person who turned in the 11, but continued to sell the 11 until 1925.

Asking price for this odd ball is $350.

I have a Romanian AK 74 in 5.45x39. It is from the Cugir factory, imported by D.I.G. It has the thumbhole stock with cleaning kit, side rail for scope mount, sling, 1 10 rnd mag, dust cover with rail, cheap tasco 3x9 scope, and 120 rounds to go with it. That's mostly all I know about it, but if you have any other questions feel free to ask and I'll try and answer the best I can. Looks and shoots great, just wanted to see what else was out there.
Also have a Rock Island Armory fullsize 1911 with hogue grip and a rotating blackhawk paddle holster. Gun is in great shape, I haven't shot it much but it has never ftf or any other malfunctions on me. Next is a Mossberg 500 with wood furnitureand vent rib barrel. Not a safe queen, receiver has a couple scratches from being carried but wood is in good condition and gun functions great. Also have an extra top folding stock and rougher condition barrel if you wanted one to cut down for home defense or something. Also have some other odds and ends to sweeten a deal like AK dust cover with pic rail, Ak 70 rnd banana clip (I know, it's a sight) and who knows what else.  Can combine all for another package, and trade with boot either way depending on value.
Things I am interested in:
Only glock models are model 20 or 35, thats about it
Lever action guns (44 mag, 22, 12 ga, and most any mares leg)
Older 22 pump rifles (esp ones with octagon barrel or from arcade)
10mm pistols
preban ak47s
left handed rifles, bolt action or AR
45 lc six shooter (bisley, stampede, and such)
quality FAL clones
Quality hk91 clones
old military guns, foreign or domestic (everything from mosins, enfields, mausers, you get the idea)
simple bolt action 22 mag or tube fed
old pepperbox pistols
PSL or dragunov, even better with russian scope
lcr ([prefer 357 but not against 38)
Old beater 12 gauge double barrel, can be a little rusty and broken stock as long as it functions fine($150 value max)
*Also if you have something from the list above you just outright want to sell for a good price, you can email me too.
I live north of Nashville, but can drive to meet for the right deal. This means we can meet each other halfway for the right deal, or I can possibly come to you and spend my time and fuel for a deal that justifies it. Looking for a deal where we both walk away happy, not trying to burn anyone nor get burned."

It has 3 24 inch barrels that can be switched in less than 5 minutes. There is a 30-06; 243; & 22-250. All three are very accurate. It has Leupold Quick removal bases on it - Scope & rings NOT included. The wood is 99.5%. It is missing the rear sling stud. I doubt that it has ever been in the woods. The 243 barrel does have some wrench marks on the receiver end. When the rings were install one screw was too long & previous owner did not realize why barrel would not come off with his hand as usual & wrenched it. There is no operational damage to it & marks are cover by the locking collar. The locking collar is tightened with the spanner wrench that has left minor marks on the collar. I use a cloth type wrench that stopped leaving marks & can be used on the barrel as well if needed. I would consider a short action rifle as part of deal.

Caliber .30-06 springfield. Capacity 5 rounds. Year of manufacture is 1943 according to stamp on barrel or 1942 according to a serial number lookup.

The stock on this rilfe appears to have been replaced with an aftermarket one. It is a pretty, grained walnut stock with a clear satin type finish. There are no cartouches or markings on the stock.

The rifle itself is remington manufacture and appears to be in very good conditon. There is no apparent wear on any parts. The muzzle crown is perfect. Likewise, the sights appear to be perfect with no dents or dings.
It appears that the bolt has been replaced, probably in an armory refurbishment at some point. All parts I can see are marked R.

The rifle is fitted with a new condition leather sling of soft leather, which is nicer to handle.

I expect this rifle will be an excellent shooter and it appears to be in top mechanical condition. I have not shot it, as I am selling this for a friend, who is unable to sell it himself, due to health reasons.

This is a GREAT gun and in VERY GOOD condition but I really would rather a smaller revolver (38 or 357) or a semi auto carry gun. So I am putting it up for sale. I would say this is in 90-98% depending on how you judge. The only real flaw is the very small spec where bluing is worn off at the end of barrel (can see it in pic, yes that small spec that looks like light reflection is it and it looks better in person). 

Asking $450 obo

Consider all trades (partial with cash or straight even trades considered). Really would like semi auto, 1911, Taurus 357 or 38 revovler, AK47 (even cheap WASR), or partial trade for an AR upper (must be flat top with A2 fixed front sight)"

Has had a round trunnion bullet guide from dinzag arms installed. The mag latch has been filed down to accept standard AK-47 magazines. It's still a bit tight with some magazines, and could be filed down more, but I decided to let it wear naturally with mag changes. The stock is an Arsenal polymer NATO length stock. Barrel has not been threaded and still has the factory shroud covering it. Only 150 rounds have been shot through the rifle.

Not looking for cash offers. All cash offers will be ignored. I'm only looking to trade. If I can't find a deal, I have no problem with hanging onto this rifle for a good while longer."

And remember when using any lock tight ""a dab will do"". It is important for me to note that there was a small locking nut on the bottom of the free float tube that I striped out the first time I tried to install it.

711,http://www.armslist.com/posts/290711,"For Sale/Trade:  Leupold HAMR, Ballistic Plates, Eagle Plate Carrier","Northish, Omaha, Nebraska",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 6, 2012",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"First up for sale or trade is a Leupold Mark 4 4x24.  You can see it mounted here:

http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/431193_REDACTED94_193308475_37177460_317882615_n.jpg

Actually, it is the Leupold HAMR without the reflex sight on top.  A red dot can still be mounted.  I was thinking about putting a Trijicon RMR on it, but never got around to it.  As far as the details of this scope, this is pretty much Leupold's answer to the ACOG.  It is a fixed power 4x magnification with illuminated horse shoe with 1 MOA dot (uses batteries, but etched glass means you can still see it when it is off unlike aimpoints and eotechs) and an unlit BDC.  The glass is extremely clear, and the ocular lense (the one you look into) is HUGE compared to ACOG's.  Great field of view and more eye relief than an ACOG making it easier and faster to get sight pucture.  It is also very streamlined.  It looks great and functions even better.  Sadly though it has only ever been mounted and sighted in.  Still essentially brand new.  The picatinny mount comes off so that it can mount on a carry handle.  Comes in original box with all papers, including the warranty card for you to turn in.  New these go for about $1350 but since it is technically used, I am looking at $1150 OBO.

I have one set of level IV stand alone ceramic plates.  They are both triple curve with the front being shooter's cut and the back recantgular.  They weigh 7.5 and 8 lbs respectively.  They will stop an armor piercing 30-06 round.  In brand new condition, pictured on left, asking $400 OBO.

I have another set of level III stand alone polyethylene/ceramic composite plates.  They are both single curve with shooter's cut.  They weigh 3.5 lbs each and are pretty much identical.  At level III they will stop a .308, but when used with IIIA soft armor they make a level IV system.  They show some wear from the vest rubbing against them (pictured on right), but no cracks, chips, etc.  Nice thing about these is while they haven't been dropped, doing so will not cause them to crack or shatter like ceramic.  Can be found online for about $600 a set, I'm asking $450 OBO.

Last is an Eagle Industries Universal Tactical Vest.  This vest is designed to take the non-standard sized body armor that many law enforcement use.  It has a system of straps and velcro to properly position the kevlar panels for maximum protection and comfort.  It also holds standard SAPI plates with a top opening velcro closure for easy installation and removal of ballistic plates.  This means if you happen to have some heavy ceramics, you can leave them out for low risk stuff where you need speed more than protection like foot pursuits, and then drop them in for the high risk stuff like active shooters and barricaded gunmen where greater protection is desired.  Vest is in ""like new"" condition, no rips, tears, cuts, abrasions, stains, smells, or even dirt.  Does not come with patches or any ballistic protection.  Sells for $200 on Eagle's site, asking $150 OBO.

Now the part where I tell you not to send me stupid offers.  If you do I may respond, but it will only be to make fun of you.  However, if you do have something cheaper but are willing to pay the difference, that is fine.  I will ship to anywhere in the lower 48, but you pay shipping.  If you trade a firearm, we pay each others shipping, and I cover my transfer fees on this end (seems obvious, but just making sure).  If you want more information or pictures feel free to e-mail me with questions.  You can also call or text me at (4O2) 6l2-eight nine two nine"

Reduced power: trigger spring, sear spring, striker safety spring and striker spring, to lower the pull weight. Our trigger is made of tough light weight polymer that helps speed up the reset. It also has an integral over travel stop on the back of the trigger. Using this method of over travel stop removes added stress on the trigger bar that are present with any of the other over travel stop methods. This trigger is a Springfield Armory OEM part available on production XD and XDM pistols from the factory (see APPENDIX D4 — 21.6 Production Division Rules). When installed correctly, the kit will give you a short crisp trigger pull (about 3.5-4.5lbs) with a fast reset and shorten the total trigger pull length. Fits all XDMs.""  [url]http://shop.powderriverprecision.net/product.sc?productId=73&categoryId=3[/url]

From the Pistol Gear website about the Patriot Magwell:
""PistolGear is proud to offer the first IDPA legal magwell to the XDm marketplace. Tweaking our design for the benefit of an affective product that will fit the IDPA box, this magwell will make your ESP machine rock! The PistolGear ""Operator"" magwell for the XDm doubles the width of the frame funnel for the benefit of smoother tactical reloads. The magwells locks onto the frame in two locations making it rigid. The magwell is held in place by a threaded pin that replaces the factory grip insert pin, making installation easy and non-permanent. YOU DO NOT EPOXY THIS PRODUCT TO YOUR FRAME. 

This set up new would cost you as follows:
Springfield XDm 5.25 out the door price from SSP (pistol, shipping, sales tax) - $754
PRP Drop in Trigger Kit - $125
Patriot Magwell - $85
Total Out The Door would be $954 if buying new, I don't expect that at all.

As for what I am looking for, I would like to trade a nice stainless (would consider other than stainless) 1911 in the ""Commander"" size.  i.e. Colt Commander, Kimber Pro, Springfield Champion, Sig Sauer, etc... I would also be interested if somebody just happens to have an upper chambered in 300 AAC Blackout but I doubt that will happen. See list below.  I might consider other offers so just let me know what you have.

I traded this to have a smaller caliber pistol for my wife. But since she doesn't practice with it anyway, she might as well keep her .40cal.

Included is the Glock 17, 2 factory mags (one mag has a small chew mark on the baseplate, but it still functions fine), 1 extended aftermarket magazine (I believe 30-33 round) which works for a few rounds, but could use polished because the nose of the round sometimes binds on the front of the magazine, a factory case (one corner chewed by a puppy), and about 83 rounds of 9mm.
