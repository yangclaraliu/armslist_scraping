I just got a Gen 4 G22, and I am looking to trade my Gen 3 for a nice 1911/342pd/glock 19/etc. It was used for a training program and has had about 1200 rounds put through it. There is tiny rust spots that developed on the grooves of the slide that I can't get rid of. I tried to get a picture, but its still hard to see. It doesn't affect the gun at all, I planned on getting it refinished but I decided not to since I got a Gen 4. The front sight is slightly worn down from being holstered.  I only shot factory ammo through it. I have 500 rounds of range ammo, and 4 magazines.

You can pick up two guns for one price or I will entertain trades for the deal. Just let me know what you have and we can talk about it.  The price listed is for both guns and I am selling them together.

First gun is a Mossberg 195-KA 12ga., bolt action and mag fed shotgun. All original except for the Pachmayr Grind-to-Fit recoil pad. In decent shape and shoots great. Has functioning Mossberg Accu-Choke system that allows the shooter to change the choke by turning the attachment at the muzzle. You can shoot birdshot and slugs through the same barrel by using this system. Comes with the original 2 round mag to make this a 2+1 gun.  

Second gun is a Westernfield Model 40 that has been completely restored. All metal work has been professionally re-blued by Jerry at East Coast Bluing and the furniture was refinished by me. Needs slight adjustment to the mag-tube feed angle to get it perfect. I just am too busy with projects that pay and do not have time right now. This gun does fire and eject perfectly outside of the feeding issue. 15 round capacity.

I will ship after payment cleared to your FFL or C&R for additional fee of $40.  Any questions, just ask. IL sales require bill of sale and valid FOID card."

Returning from hunting pheasants with my best friend one day, we stopped in a gun shop which had a couple of new Browning over-and-under's for sale, and I bought them.  The twelve-gauge for my son and the beautiful Citori Grade III Lightning twenty-gauge for me.  Twenty-six inch barrels.  I bought a case of Remington RXP's as well, and I still have a couple of the boxes remaining.  Seemingly, no time.  No inclination.  No talent.  

The serial number tells us the gun was manufactured in 1990.  The gun, the box, the chokes are still as new.  

The manager of the new big box sporting store here appraised the gun at $2,600 -- conveniently the same as The Blue Book of Gun Values -- $2,600.  His assessment is the gun is: pristine, untouched, as new.

Burris 3-9X40 Fullfield II Scope 200162With a legacy of high performance, modest prices and the backing of a Forever Warranty, choosing to purchase a Fullfield II riflescope isnt difficult. But there are more than two dozen Fullfield II models, finishes, and reticle configurations to pick from, so choosing just which one is the hard part. Fullfield IIs are the smart choice when you know they are packed with the performance features that made Burris famous. Outstanding optical quality. Positive steel-on-steel adjustments. Extremely rugged outer tubes. No-slip grips on the integrated eyepiece and focus adjustment. To make a fair comparison with other brands, youll have to look at riflescopes costing hundreds of dollars more. With performance standards so high and their retail prices so reasonable, you may not have to limit yourself to just one.Features Reticle: Ballistic Plex Finish: Matte Features: LRS.

All of them have been liars that were no shows or backed out.  Where I come from your word is your bond. If you find it cheaper somewhere else.. BE A MAN and say ""Hey im backing out because its cheaper"" dont string me along with ""My taxi broke down"" ""A volcano errupted in durham"" ""The wizard of oz monkies came and stole my wallet"" Excuses are a waste of my time. Id rather be told ""no I dont want it"" than be strung along.
Because of these fine few that have wasted my time, I am not holding these for even a day. If you want them, you buy them today. I know I sound like an ***hole but im tired of being ""promised"" and ""please hold for me""."

282,http://www.armslist.com/posts/881282,For Sale:  The Beretta Px4 Storm Type-C 40cal (constant action),"HAMPTON ROADS VIRGINIA, Hampton Roads, Virginia",$ 490,"Listed On: Saturday, January 19, 2013",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and
interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol."

It will NOT work with the EXPS2 or EXPS3, it also will NOT work with 516, 553 or 557 models (because they have a built-in riser). 

It gives the sight a great quick detach function, and returns to zero when mounting/unmounting.  Also it has a raised section for a magnifier.  The really nice feature is that it lifts the EOTech off your rail just enough to clear the front handguard/quad rail, and gives it a lower 1/3rd co-witness with iron sights.  --$100

$925 cash firm no trades. Do not e-mail with offers.

This price is a few pennies above melt value(feel free to do the math yourself). None of this is beat up junk---nothing is bent or has holes in it. Some is brilliant uncirculated in coin shop wrappers. These are very clean items and some may have collectors value above melt value--I did not check carefully.

All responses are to include a real name and phone number. I will not respond to e-mails that don't tell me exactly who I'm dealing with.

I've checked the fish and game laws, and there is no closed season in Indiana on armed robbers and thieves. We can shoot them anytime they threaten us, and there's no bag limit.

I will not consider meeting in a gas station parking lot halfway to Richmond to sell this. Buyers will come to my safe suburban home to transact business. 

Serious buyers will encounter a cheerful, friendly seller, a stress-free environment, and will be treated with total respect. 

Thieves/robbers will be riddled with 165 grain Hydra Shoks, and will be casually dumped in the street in front of my house.

It comes with a Simmon Red Dot Scope (with 12 adjustments), a picatini adaptor so the scope is a bit higher, a high capacity 30 round magazine, box, and all of the documentation.

Additionally I have cleaned and lubricated everything, so its ready to fire and have some fun!

 Do you need anymore excuses to act now before you no longer have the chance? I'm not meaning to scare you, I think we are a better society when we are responsible and armed! So if you don't have your weapon yet, this one is a good choice. Just don't be the guy in the end with a vagina looking for someone else to help him.

It does have some upgraded internal trigger parts that make it a bit more smooth and slightly lighter than your standard AR trigger.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."
