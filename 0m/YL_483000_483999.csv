(You will find this scope at www.weaveroptics.com in the tactical line up, part number 800360. The junk at optics planet and Amazon are cheap chinese copies). MSRP is $1247 IF you can find one. I travelled quite a distance to get mine.

This rifle has seen almost no use. I shoot ONLY Federal Gold Medal Match 168grn Sierra Boat Tail Hollow Points out of it, other than when I shot it at the 1000 yard plates.  It has seen less than 3 boxes. The rifle is currently zeroed at 150yards. It will shoot quarter size holes at this distance. I have shot it 600 at 4 inch plates and 1000 at 8 inch plates with heavier ammo for sight in. I can ring the bell at 600 and 1000 with 177grn match grade hollow points.

Contact Kevin at REDACTED for pictures. I am asking 1750 or best offer, but I do not need to sell it so I will not give it away. Trades are possible, but don't offer me any of your hi-point garbage. This is not a junk rifle.

I stayed with the standard stock because it made for a great length of pull, and good platform to get a great cheek weld.  The barrel is 20"" free floated with a 1 in 8 twist.  The scope is a leapers 4-16x50 mil dot with an illuminated reticle (not the best glass however it has held zero very well and has a lifetime warranty).

As anyone reading this ad realizes, these 3rd Generation (1985/1986) 250R's are the holy grail of 3-wheelers and are very hard to come by now in nice, original condition. With the exception of an old FMF exhaust system (expansion pipe & silencer) and an aftermarket rear grab bar, this 250R is completely stock down to the gold wheels. The seat and plastic fenders are original without any cracks, rips or repairs. (The headlight housing does have a small crack in it, however that's it.) In the past year, I have replaced the handlebars with aluminum Renthal bars and replaced the grips. All of the bearing are tight and in good shape. It starts, runs, stops and rides great.

I do have the registration card for it as well.

My real hobby/passion includes firearms, so I'd sell the 250R outright, or would consider firearms as partial or full trade.

It is in great shape and is the 187 series, which has integral scope bases. The serial number checks out to be built in 1987. This is a really nice rifle, but I dont need a duplicate to another rifle I already have. The previous owner installed a Butler Creek SS side folder, SS flash hider, and SS barrel shroud. Included is a 40rd steel magazine, and 240 rounds of FMJ 55gr ammo (60 are red tracers) on stripper clips. I got this rifle and ammo in a trade for some outdoor power equipment and would like to get $625.00 for it and $75.00 for the ammo (31 cents each ) After the election, pre-ban arms are bound to go up in value, this could be a great short term investment for you. A few keeper trades I would consider are 62 gr 5.56 ammo (brass case only), a Mossberg 590, a Ruger 10/22 takedown model, a Henry AR7, Marlin Guide gun 45-70, Marlin Camp 9 or 45 rifle, 357 ammo, stripped lowers, complete AR-15 upper, Pelican cases, and silver quarters. I'm not really looking for a trade other than the above, unless it has a better value as I intend to sell it to get my cash out anyway."

Length	 175 mm

Magazine capacity	 7 rounds
The FEG PA-63 pistol was developed during early 1960s at the Hungarian FEG arms factory as a compact military sidearm, chambered for the Warsaw pact standard 9x18 Makarov ammunition of Soviet origin. The basic design of the FEG PA-63 pistol was heavily based on the German Walther PP pistol, a copy of which was produced by FEG shortly after the WW2. FEG also produced a number of derivatives of the PA-63, such as 'export commercial' model AP-63, chambered for widely available 9x17 Browning / .380 ACP and 7.65 Browning / .32ACP ammunition. Both PA-63 and AP-63 pistols were similar in design, and differed only in ammunition used and in frame finish - military-issue PA-63 pistols had their aluminum frames left 'in the white', while commercial AP-63 pistols have their aluminum frames finished in same black color as the rest of the gun.
The FEG PA-63 pistol is a simple blowback operated weapon. The return spring is located around the barrel, the trigger is of traditional double-action type with exposed hammer. Manual safety lever, which doubles as a decocker, is located at the left side of the slide. Gun is fed from single stack box magazines, magazine release button is located on the left side of the frame, above and behind the trigger."

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1‚Äù overall length and an 18.5‚Äù cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3‚Äù rounds in total (6 per tube).

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Rifles and shotguns only, NO HANGUNS. 

First off I have a .22LR Soverign Model 64. Semi auto, synthetic. Ten round mag. Completely folds up into a flat concealable case. Exact copy of Anshultz 525 but breaks down to be the perfect backpack rifle for camping etc. Only issue is that my Grandpa broke the trigger guard, which to me looks unrepairable but maybe somebody can. You would have to order the new part from Anshultz, not Soverign since I believe they aren't around anymore. Disregard the white card taped on the stock in the picture. Would also trade this for a barrel for a winchester 1300 20 gauge barrel.

Second up I have a Small Block Chevy 350, std bore, L98 from a 1985 Corvette. Forged pistons, Tuned Port Injection. Long block is in good condition. Has chrome valve covers. Comes with all accesories minus AC condensor. Brand new oil pan for f body, along with brand new oil pump and pump filter. comes with original pan as well, exhaust manifolds, and distributor. Does not come with wiring harness or ecm. Blew a lot of money on this before changing my mind about what to use on my project. I will try to post pics soon.

I spent a lot of money on both of these, and my expenses and the actual value far exceed this but I'm will to take around $550 worth of firearms for both since I just don't want them anymore. However... ALL OFFERS CONSIDERED! Thanks for looking"

In regard to questions about this scopes features; So that I don't have to repeat myself, It is basically the identical scope that is used by our military's snipers. The only difference is they (military) have a fixed 10 x power Mark-4 with M-3 turrets (1 MOA)adjustments, which is also much lower in price. This scope is a variable magnification power with front focal Mill Dot reticle, so you can mill your targets at any of the scopes magnification settings. The M-1 turrets have more precise adjustments with .25 MOA per click. I do long range silhouette shooting at 18'' inch steel gongs up to 1,000 yards and more. This scope can get u out to 700 yards with only the first revolution. Or it can be used for hunting at extended ranges. Hope that answers most of the asked questions. Otherwise, do your self some research, cause you might not even need it.

Model 950 W/2 spare and 1 Magazine in the pistol. 3 Magazines total. Made by Beretta, this is a high-quality .25 caliber semi-auto pistol with an innovative and unique ‚Äútip-up‚Äù barrel that makes cleaning the bore, and topping off the gun a breeze! No need to rack the slide to chamber a round, just push a lever and barrel tips up: load a round, snap it shut, cock the hammer and fire away! 8 rounds in the magazine plus one in the chamber. The pistol is finished in a matte black with black plastic factory grips with the Beretta logo. The pistol is in very good condition, it has some use marks and light scratches on the finish, and extremely minor wear to the grips, overall condition is 90+%. The bore is crisp with good rifling, and trigger pull is smooth. 

While .25 ACP is a somewhat anemic caliber, I don‚Äôt think anybody will volunteer to get shot with it, and this little Beretta is better than carrying nothing, especially in hot weather clothing, and a .25 is definitely a good back-up to your regular concealed carry handgun. Due to it being a center fire round, it is inherently more reliable than any .22 rim fire. I have fired at least 500 rounds thru this gun and never had a jam, or failure of any kind. It is remarkably accurate out to 15 yards, maybe longer, but I have not tried farther than 15 yards.

Located in Spartanburg, text for questions, must be legally able to purchase in South Carolina: I will require a State issued ID to insure that I meet the legal requirements for selling this gun. $200 gets the gun with one magazine, $250 with all 3 Beretta factory magazines (Mags are pushing $25 each for aftermarket, $40 for Factory)...

Comes with everything in the box that it came from the factory with.   A deal for someone at $350 FIRM. I am a Ruger fan but I am funding another purchase.   Anything less than $350 and I KNOW I would regret selling it, so I will just put it away.

I'll throw in the mag if I can, but it's in pretty rough shape and is a pain in the ass to get out. You can, however buy aftermarket ones. According to the serial number it was made in the 1980's, in the later models they fixed all the problems that the earlier ones had, but they also stopped selling them in the 80's. Pretty accurate.

Now, let's talk money. I would LIKE about $350.

What I would really like as a trade would be a complete AR lower receiver and maybe some cash on your end depending on the lower (I prefer a collapseable stock but I'll take a fixed if I have to)

Here it is.... The ULTIMATE Competition Revolver.

S&W 625 JM 4"" model revolver, N Frame, chambered in .45 ACP with competition upgrade and aftermarket grips.

This isn't your ordinary JM model S&W. This has every upgrade in the book sans optics, and really.... Who would put optics on a competition revovler......

In addition to this being one of the most sought after compeitions rigs on the market, this revolver has had a complete trigger job, the cylinder has been chamfered for ease of reloading, the hammer has been bobbed to reduce lockup time and it has an upgraded high performance spring kit. It also features the gold dot front sight.

The result? A competition revolver (double action only), chambered in .45 ACP that has a silky smooth 5lb trigger pull.... yes, a 5lb double action pull... and is easier to reload than most autos out there. The grip is made much more stable as a result of the aftermarket Hogue grip with the wooden pinky kick. This truly is one of the finest shooting revolvers I have ever seen.

The drawback? You will need to use rounds loaded with Federal 150 primers for consistent ignition. This can easily be brought back to setting off factory ammo, but you will sarifice the unbelievable trigger pull that I believe One person who shot it called ""Awesome Sauce"".  I do have the factory springs (included), and a new hammer is inexpensive if one were to want to bring it back to the original setup.

Anyone who has shot this will want it. Those that can't afford it will tell you I'm insane for selling it. Which begs the question.... Why? WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD I SELL THIS GEM???

Easy. I have two.  I prefer the 5"" model, and don't see the need to have both of them when I'm trying to make room in the safe.

What is included with this? The revolver, the kick ass custom competition upgrade,a brick of Federal 150 primers (1,000 count to get you started) a CR Speed belt (adjustable up to 42"") and a fabulous kydex competition holster. I can't remember the make, but I bought it New 2 years ago for around $70. It is fully adjustable for retention and cant, and is in perfect condition. I also have a bundle of moon clips for this, since they are necessary.

Full disclosure..... there is minor holster wear on this gun, and it has over a thousand rounds through it. The rounds have all been lead round nose, and loaded right at the Major power floor, so no wear from that. Anyone who knows S&W revolvers will tell you that a few thousand rounds isn't even enough to break this thing in.  

THIS IS NOT A SELF DEFENSE GUN. Please don't buy this with the intent of wearing it as a personal potection gun. It is meant for competition and range work, and should only be used on the range. It has been exceptionally reliable for me when used properly, but you do not want to trust your life to this thing.

Now on the the money.... Will not ship, will not travel too far, FTF only, PTP or PTC only, valid DL required. NO exceptions.

I'm asking $1000 for the package, which really is a steal. I would consider trades, but cash is king. Trades considered.... Old military rifles +cash, (rare variant Mosins, stock Enfields, Field grade Garand, etc.) Kahr CW45 + cash, Deer rig in .243 + cash and ???? I don't know.... run it by me!  Worst I can say is no.

No lowball offers, $1k is fair for the package as it sits. 

Since I can't seem to get images to link here, and Armslist won't let me post a link to my Flickr account or post images over 4mb total, email me for a batch of High resolution, high quality pictures of this revolver."

Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection.
