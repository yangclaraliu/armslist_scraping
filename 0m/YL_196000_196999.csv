From BassPro:

Built around Beretta's latest PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm 9mm Sub-Compact Pistol delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. The Px4 Storm Sub-Compact utilizes Beretta's reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system for a more compact and lighter package. Direct barrel-slide locking system design delivers a low barrel axis that reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise. Its stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance, a great choice for a concealed gun kept close to active, perspiring bodies. The PX4 Storm's durable frame includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating provides superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. White 3-dot sights provide quick acquisition of the target. Weight: 26.1 oz. Capacity: 13+1 rounds.

Diamondback DB380
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380, a micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magaine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. 

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime

I'm looking to trade it for a USP Compact chambered in .45 like mine or a P2000 in 9mm. I may also trade for a new or like new stainless or inox Beretta 92fs. No 96's, I don't like .40 S&W... Only 9mms and .45's in my house. .40 is too expensive for not being any better than a 9mm. I'm not too much into rifles at the moment but there are a few on my list so if you have an AK I would consider trading if it is nice with an under-folding paratrooper stock with extras chambered in 7.62x39 with ammo. Another rifle I would definitely consider is an M1 Garand in good shape. If you have other assault rifles then let me know but it needs to match my trade value of about $800. I would consider trading for an M4 style AR with a flat top and some sort of sights on it. Nothing fancy. You can keep your tacti-cool magnifier and surefire flashlight. If anything just throw ammo and an extra mag or two. Like I said ABOUT $800. I will consider all reasonable offers and probably ask for pictures even if it's something I did not list above. I'm not rich so no low balls, wasting time, and if you have something worth more than my gun I'm sorry but I can't throw cash in the deal. I do have other guns however if it's something I really like and the USP doesn't match your value. I may throw one in. Thanks for your time, God bless"

Looks like and has many of the same features of a Colt 1911 
Itailian made Imported by Stoegar Arms.
I took this pistol in on trade and have shot a few clips through it and it functions flawlessly. Its very accurate as well. It has a few small wear marks on it from being carried in a holster as a concealed carry weapon. Ive seen them priced as high as 350.00 and in used prices as cheap as 250.00 but seen none as cheap as 200 so Im firm on the price. Plus thats what I allowed on the trade so Ive got to get 200 out of it. Comes with one magazine. Nice pistol especially for the money. Has adjustable sights and almost the same as a colt 1911 as far as functions and features. Just smaller making it a perfect carry weapon.
Im including a picture of one exactly like this one but this is not the actual picture but I can send pics by text or email. Please call me or text me if interested or any questions. Numbers were run through NCIC and it comes back as a clean firearm never reported stolen or used in any crimes.

Asking $450 PRICE IS FIRM. If you can find it cheaper elsewhere please don't email and tell me about it. I'm aware or what the gun cost new, online etc... this seems to be a big issue every time i post on armslist. I buy/sell/trade all the time i know how this works but I'm not gonna give my guns away because someone thinks they know of a better deal elsewhere. Thanks in advance.

This is a good, accurate rifle with a very nice trigger.  Not sure of round count, but maybe around 150.  There is nothing wrong with it, I just never take it out to shoot and have no use for a .17 HMR 
The scope is calibrated for the trajectory of .17 HMR, so all you need to do is zero it at 100 yards, and adjusting the elevation will automatically compensate for the bullets trajectory.

The DPMS LR-308 Semi Auto Sniper System (SASS) was born of military necessity. US Military Snipers and marksmen overseas found themselves rapidly switching from scenarios involving precision long range shooting one moment, to close, violent encounters where they were at a disadvantage due to the low ammunition capacity and slow rate of fire of their bolt action rifles. The Government sought a solution to this problem...The DPMS SASS is the answer.

With an 18” fluted bull barrel, free floating 4 rail hand-guards, and JP adjustable Trigger, it is capable of sub-MOA accuracy at long range, fulfilling its role as a precision rifle. The 19 + 1 ammunition capacity and semi auto fire control group ensure the shooter is never outgunned, and allows for faster follow up shots. The Magpul PRS stock (new for 2008, previous models feature a VLTOR modstock), Panther Flash hider, DPMS Mangonel back up iron sights, and A3 receiver, complete the package.

The SIG SAUER P232 is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Stainless is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.
This version of the P232 stainless with SIGLITE Night Sights comes with Hogue finger groove rubber grips.

The Glock Tenifer finish is still on the gun, only the black covering is slightly removed (which I think looks cool). The 10 round magazine that comes with the gun is pretty worn out so you will have to get it replaced. However, it still feeds and shoots just fine with the 10 round magazine.

Not interested in rifles really. No shotguns. No revolvers. I like semi automatic pistols. Preferably .45 Auto, .40 S&W, or 9mm. 

I thought the gun would recoil in my hand very much but it is not bad at all. Actually it is quite comfortable and very fun to shoot.

699,http://www.armslist.com/posts/196699,For Sale:  FNP 45 & AAC Ti-Rant/Silencerco Osprey silencer package,"Searcy, Arkansas, United States","$ 1,800","Listed On: Thursday, June 7, 2012",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"FNH FNP45 45 Tactical 3 Magazines 15 Round Black 

New In The Box, Black, Single / Double action 45 ACP. Barrel Length of 5.3"", Mag capacity of 15, thumb grip safety,	Fixed Night Sights & weights just 33.6 oz.

The Ti-RANT .45 is the world’s first silencer for .45 ACP pistols that is truly stealthy when fired dry. The average dry sound signature of the Ti-RANT .45 is 133 dB when fired on a FN-USA FNP45 Tactical .45 with Remington 230 grain ammunition. This puts the dry performance of the Ti-RANT .45 squarely in the ballpark of most competitor's 9mm pistol silencers. With a wet charge of 5cc’s of water, the sound signature drops to 125 dB. To put it another way, our .45 silencer is quieter than some company’s .22 silencers. The Ti-RANT .45 does not stand out among a sea of posers just because of its jaw-dropping performance. Intelligent material selection gives the Ti-RANT .45 unequalled durability in a deceptively light-weight package. The Ti-RANT .45 incorporates AAC’s new A.S.A.P.™ CLUTCH. This highly evolved Nielsen device enables flawless semi-automatic operation on all relevant host pistols, and can be fully disassembled for cleaning or piston replacement with no tools in seconds. The Ti-RANT .45 can be outfitted with pistons threaded .578-28.

With the modern combat handgun in mind, Silencerco set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. Silencerco went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP.

Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun.
The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length.

Kel-Tec P32 Like new (100 rounds through) - $240 
HK USP .45 Full Size - $800 
Ruger Vaquero .45 Colt - $900 

Not really selling but these are the trade values. They are negotiable but don't waste my time. I will not trade all the guns for one rifle unless you have a SCAR or STG 556 or something around there. 

 The Vaquero has had a LOT of custom work to it. It has a case hardened frame, original black grips, and blued barrel. The custom work is: Extra cylinder chambered in .45 ACP for plinking and cheaper shooting, stainless ejector housing (and I've got another one somewhere), stainless trigger guard and backstrap, and a diamond pattern polished into the trigger and hammer. This is the most accurate pistol I've ever shot.   

The USP is an HK. It's that simple. It's broken in, smooth as can be, and is the most accurate Auto pistol I've ever shot. It comes with trijicon night sights, hogue grip, three 12 round mags, and a handmade leather IWB holster that is a super tuck style. The holster is new and the leather is still stiff.  

The Kel-Tec is brand new in my book with only two boxes of ammo breaking it in. But it still has 300 rounds to go before it's broken in. It's accurate for a pocket pistol at 25 yards once you get the hang of the trigger. Comes with the factory mag, factory floor plate, pinky extension, belt clip installed, and pocket holster.  

Now what I want to trade for is pretty much a good assault rifle that I haven't owned yet. I made a post earlier for an M1 Carbine which I will take over all other rifles right now, but just let me know what you have. No SKS's... Had one when I was 17. They suck. I've also already had an AK-47 but would consider trading for the right AK. No 5.45mm's unless it is very unique. I don't have cash right now so I can only trade. If you give an AK-47 plus $300 for my USP then that's fine but I have no cash right now. I can go as far as Jacksonville, Morehead, and New Bern in my gas guzzling machine. MAYBE farther for the right deal. Looking for an M1 Carbine, M1 Garand, Galil or Golani with extras, a good AK-47 with cash or lots of extras (not a million mags... real extras like sling, bayonet, and a million bullets), Dragunov style rifle like PSL,  maybe an AR-15. Just let me know what you've got. No tacti-cool AK's with rails and crap. Only nice wooden furniture on AK's and I would really like a paratrooper underfolding stock. I will take an M1 Carbine (especially one with WW2 style paratrooper stock) over anything. But I want a shooter not a collector. 

I may trade for a pistol too as my previous add stated. But as you can tell from my guns, I tend to only shoot rugged military side arms (with the exception of the Kel-Tec but it's still tough). So Glocks, other HK's (compacts and P2000's), Beretta 92 Inox, etc. Just let me know. I have no interest in XD's and M&P's and such."

In 1988, Smith & Wesson, working in conjunction with requests from the US Customs Service, went to work on the greatest combat revolvers of all time. The Smith & Wesson CS-1 (Customs Service 1st Edition), also called by some the ""Treasury Model"" (U.S. Customs is under the Treasury Dept.).

Using the Famous .357 Magnum L-Frame 686 Distinguished Combat Magnum, S&W hand built 3500 CS-1 revolvers using the following Improvements.

Forged Hammer 
Hammer Mounted Firing Pin
Pinned Sear on Hammer
Forged Trigger
No Internal Lock

3” barrel that allows the use of a Full Length ejector rod unlike the 2 ½” Revolvers.

Some were made with 4” barrels for uniformed officers.
Satin Stainless steel finish
Round Butt
Thinner front blade pinned sight
Polished internal surfaces
Modified firing pin bushing for use with High pressure loads.
Tightened tolerances

When Janet Renoe took office as Attorney General, the US Customs service made an ill advised switch from Revolvers to the SIG semi Auto. Upon implementation, Janet Renoe ordered the destruction of 1500 of the 3500 S&W CS-1 Revolvers less they fall into Civilian hands. 2000 of these revolvers were sold to US Customs agents for personal use. As of this day, these are the only CS-1 Revolvers in existence. 

The Smith & Wesson CS-1 686 Distinguished Combat Magnum, is known far and wide to be the finest Smith & Wesson Revolver ever made.

Also a decent pancake holster and five HKS #10 speedloaders.

Finally, a Crossbreed Supertuck Deluxe, right hand, with horsehide natural leather. ($85) This is a sweet holster and the best IWB option in my opinion.

A little gun history, I bought it new and it had a broken extractor. I sent it back to S&W and they fixed it very quickly. After that I took it out and shot ~500 rounds out of it, and its a great shooter. In my opinion, this is the best IWB carry in .40 available. I have reassessed that my needs for carry are met by my Ruger LCR, thus I am looking to pass this setup on. I have not worn in the holster/belt, they are literally new in box.
