I have a 1943 Mosin Nagant 91/30 for sale. The triangle with an arrow inside denotes it as Izhevsk armory. The stock has been sanded, stained and polyurethaned. The bluing is very good, with only a little wear at the front handguard and the edges of the metal butt plate. The bore is shiny with very good rifling. All parts are matching numbers. The gun was rated very good/excellent when I purchased it from Century Arms six months ago. 
I have an NCStar pistol scope mounted on a weaver to dovetail mount, which has been placed on the dovetail where the rear sight typically resides. I have the rear sight and can replace it if the scope and mount are not wished for purchase. The gun comes with all the original parts; bayonet, dual ammo pouch, cleaning kit (typical), tool and boreguide, oil bottle. I have extra ammo pouches that I will sell. 
Feel free to ask any questions, price is FIRM and FAIR."

Please contact me ahead of time to arrange a meeting. For sale or trade, I have a Remington Model 12A .22 takedown rifle. These were produced from 1909 to 1936. There is no Remington date code on barrel putting this one at 1921 or before. Overall, the gun is in good to very good shape, with average wear for a gun this age. Mechanically, everything is 100% operational with a smooth slide action, and fires everytime. Removal of the receiver screw enables the rifle to breakdown into two pieces for easy cleaning and storage/transportation. The stock has some light dings, and there are some light rust spots on the receiver and barrel. Not firm on price, but not going to give it away. I travel alot, so may be able to meet if you are not local. Can accept Paypal and will ship insured, at buyers cost, to a FFL.

Then of course, we all know what happened here in Aurora.  I believe that they will ban the outright possession of them and then what am I going to do with it?  I don't think that my voice is being heard, nor many others in this state but Im going to stop going down this path.

So rather than fight a system filled with stupid people and worrying about them trying to take my rifle, I think it's time I just sell it and be done.  I've only taken it to the range one time with a group of buddies and we put about 250 rounds downrange and it was everything that I thought it would be.  The Sig ad's are right, this thing is spot on.  My buddy has a fully kitted out SKS and he was trying to buy it on the spot!  After that I had to have several surgeries which have prevented me from doing hardly anything physical and am just getting back to normal It's a fantastic rifle!!  Enough about the performance.  

As stated, it's lightly used with only one time at the range.  It will come with a Sig Sauer case, 3 PMags with dust covers, Barska 1x30 IR Tactical Electro Sight Scope, and FAB Defense magwell grip.

To make this deal too good to pass up, I'm going to include my surplus metal ammo case that's almost completely full of .223!  It's about 1000 rounds.  

Don't ask me to split or part out, etc...I'm only willing to sell the complete turn key package.  You seriously don't need anything else besides what Im including here.  Buy from me, drive to the range, and you're putting lead downrange immediately!

A VERY DESIRABLE AND COLLECTIBLE MANDOLIN . . .

EARLY 1970s ALVAREZ
F-STYLE MANDOLIN
IN EXCELLENT CONDITION

Here is a beautiful Alvarez F-5 style mandolin from the early 1970. There isn't a lot of information available on these models, but they have grown in popularity due to their elaborate ornamentation and generally nice playability.
This one features a gorgeous sunburst finish, a two-point body with a solid spruce top with f-holes and plain-grained maple back, rims and neck.
The neck is white-bound and topped with a 30-fret rosewood fingerboard with very block abalone inlays. There is also an adjustable rosewood bridge, and the pickguard is bound plastic pearl. The headstock is probably the nicest element of this mandolin, with four-on-a-plate tuners adorned with pearloid buttons, and an abalone vine headstock inlay that really stands out. The tailpiece cover also features an engraved fern and ""Alvarez"" logo.
Inside the mandolin is an ""ALVAREZ HAND MADE"" hot stamp.
This particular mandolin was made in Japan.
Again, for the money you simply can't beat these Alvarez mandolins from the 1970s, and they don't come up for sale very often so grab this one while you still can!"

Excellent condition Smith & Wesson 5906 9mm. DA/SA. Very low round count, which can be seen by the lack of wear on the internal parts. It is NOT a worn out police trade in. It is one of the most accurate 9mm pistols I have owned.

The extra magazines are great for trips to the range, being able to shoot for a long time without having to stop to reload magazines. 

It is pretty much impossible to find 5906 magazines now especially the Hi-Cap, and if you do they are insanely priced.

I am selling my Cougar 8045 pistol in .45 caliber. This wild cat of a pistol is made Stoeger (a Beretta company) with the same tooling and specifications as the Beretta Cougar 8045. The Cougar has never been fired outside the factory and comes with everything fresh from the store. The best thing about the Cougar is that it shares the same magazine and ammunition as the CX4 Storm in .45 caliber!  

This CX4, by Beretta, has several extra features, all by Beretta. It comes with the front and side rail kit, Beretta front sling swivel, Beretta barrel shroud, and a fine illuminated reticle optic. The optics and sights on this partner to the Cougar is zeroed in and deadly accurate--if you put the dot on it, all the bullets will follow! The CX4 is a dream to shot. It was designed for fast and accurate rapid recovery from recoil and as such is a great CQC weapon. This carbine is user adjustable from left to right hand shooting in a matter of seconds.

Like I wrote earlier, both guns share the 7 magazines that accompany them. These guns are being sold as a set and at a competitive savings. Both these guns come with their carrying cases and are in EXCELLENT condition!

Roughly 500 rounds down the pipe so its just broken in. No issues with function, fit is very nice too. Comes with original box and paperwork, 3- 10 round magazines, and a fobus OWB holster. It also has night sights which are very bright. It does have some minor handling marks and a small idiot mark, I am the second owner and this was on there when I got it. I love the gun and its a lot of fun to shoot but really want to move into a more traditional 1911 in 45 ACP. I do want to stay with the commander size but will consider officer models as well. Trade value is set at $900.00, cash price is $800 and I am willing to negotiate with all perspective traders. Please no wheel guns or rifles I am only interested in 1911 handguns. I can add cash for up trades or ammo and will accept cash for down trades.
Please do not offer any low ball offers, and if your interested in trading then be honest about it. If I agree to meet please stick to your word, if your just thinking about trading the please don't waste my time or yours, wait until your ready to trade to make a offer. I am ready and available within a few hours notice anywhere in Hampton Roads but I do expect the meeting spot to fair to both parties."

I thought I would be able to enjoy these, but life leaves no time, so it's time to sell. 
I will not give away so please don't submit silly offers . I will price fairly and sell...or not. 

This is a Winchester M1 carbine with a reproduction stock. It is very nice, I have hand rubbed several coats of boiled linseed oil to preserve its natural beauty. There no arsenal markings on the stock as it is a reproduction.

The M1 is a Winchester receiver, with a Winchester barrel. Bore, M-E, rifling is great. I believe this will make you a great shooter. 

It will come with 6 ea 30 and 6 ea15 rnd magazines and approx 1000 rounds ammo.

I will not respond to emails asking questions already answered.

A lot of folks asking..hey, what's your bottom dollar...well, a good ol rule for selling is mark it up a little, let me feel good about haggling. So you will all know...i dropped from 1700 to 1600. And my bottom line is 1600. I'm not much of a haggler, and this is fair. If you price everything out, this is a pretty darn good deal. You gotta have ammo anyway, and may not be able to find any right now and it won't dome any good if I sell the rifle, so...save yourself some time if you don't want to pay that...I'm not about to lose my car or house, not trying to take my wife ona Disney cruise (although I probably should) I'm just here trying to let someone else enjoy a good firearm at a fair price.

Accuracy with this thing is incredible, and it will definitely help you shoot your other larger caliber weapons better.   Good self defense home gun and the grip is small so many women feel comfortable when firing this revolver.

This gun was purchased from my local dealer about 3 months ago.  Looking to focus my money and attention on larger caliber rifles now after the recent ""ban/scare.""

This revolver has about 200 rounds through it (at the range after I purchased it), and haven't had the chance to shoot it since.  This weapon is in pristine condition.  The gun will come with the original box with serial number stamps, wax paper, warranty, test fire factory brass, user manual, and safety manual.

These guns sell for $759 + tax/licensing new and the S&W holster $80.. that's almost $850-900 total.

If you want to know the reserve just ask. And note the following about why I use a reserve and wish there was an better alternative. Your opinion is welcome: 
- So you don't have to wait I usually have one day auctions with automatic renewals until sold. I start with a lower price to spark some communication While if I didnt use a reserve its a risk as I cant watch and end them and not fair to you either. 
- When asking for the reserve also please feel free to make an offer and maybe set an agreeable BUY NOW price. I've tried several times to get Gun Broker to offer a haggle or second chance feature and they say they will not. 
- So please don't be frustrated with reserves as I think this is the best of both worlds but open to your view. Thanks and if you like lever guns watch my items such as the John Wayne, Wells Fargo and other commemoratives.

The only fitting choice for your Remington shotgun is an original factory barrel.  If you own a Remington shotgun, you know quality and, when it comes to replacement parts, there’s only one brand good enough – Remington.  We offer a wide variety of original factory barrels ranging in styles from vent rib, to cantilever to rifle-sighted, so you never have to compromise the superb craftsmanship and dependability that make Remington ownership a matter of pride.  Whether you want your Remington shotgun to perform like two; or you’re looking to restore “an old friend”, there’s no substitute for Remington replacement barrels.

For more information please reference our Original Factory Barrel Tables.

The Model 870 3” chamber fully-rifled barrel with cantilever and 2-7x32mm scope is a perfect upgrade to turn a shotgun into a highly accurate sabot slug gun.  Model 870 barrels with 3"" chambers will fit 3-1/2” Super Magnum; 3” Magnum; and 2-3/4"" receivers.  An “M” at the end of the serial number = magnum receiver.  These barrels will handle both 2-3/4"" and 3"" slug shells when used on Magnum and Super Magnum receivers.  Use only 2-3/4"" shells when barrels are used on 2-3/4"" receivers.  3"" Magnum chambers are capable of handling 2-3/4"" or 3"" slugs.

The 12 gauge fully rifled slug barrel is 23"" long and features a mounted and boresighted 2-7x32 scope.  It fits Model 870 Wingmaster®, Special Purpose, and Express® models.  Please call or text REDACTED"

I bought the gun new a few months ago and have put less than 15 slugs through it just to sight it in. The gun also came with a trap barrel which I put less than 100 shells through.  I am NOT selling the trap barrel.  So the receiver has a total of about 100 shells through it.  I had to drill the dimples out to attach the magazine extension (this is a common practice which is required for a mag extension on a 870 express, you can read about it online).  The original hardware replaced by the Wilson combat Extension is included (spring, threaded cap, follower).  The barrel and scope are made by Remington and came with the gun.  This gun is in perfect condition and has nothing wrong with it.

What’s the difference between Eagle Arms and ArmaLite?
ANSWER: There are normally very few differences. ArmaLite rifles are the top of the company’s line. They tend to be more up to date and include higher quality parts such as chrome lined barrels. They are produced from selected forging. However, internally, they use exactly the same parts. Eagle Arms rifles are intended to compete with lower priced brands. They are extremely high quality rifles in their own right. ArmaLite used to use only “ArmaLite” lower receivers for actual factory built guns and sold “Eagle Arms” as stripped lower and upper receivers. This was to differentiate between the two different warranties. ArmaLite has a lifetime warranty and EA has a one year only warranty."
