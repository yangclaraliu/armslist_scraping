Benchmade 470 Emissary Knife USA MADE

This one really hurts to sale but I have to do it. This is a premium knife that is made by a HIGHLY reputable company. This knife like my other I have for sale is less than a month old and is in almost like new condition because it is almost new. Factory razor sharp edge, S30V premium stainless steel blade, super light at 2.2 oz, and it's as fast if not faster than an auto. The deep carry clip allows the knife to ride all the way inside the pocket. This knife has the sharpest edge of any knife I have owned. It's never been sharpened and has cut open a few envelopes. 

Retail on this Premium Knife is $205 and you can't even get them from Benchmade now because they're on backorder.

Price is $125 and comes with everything.

I will include both the Tru Glo and Sight Mark 4 reticle red dot sights (both sighted in at 50 yards). Internal mods include a polished feed ramp and polished receiver cover. Gun comes with 2 factory 10 round mags and one ProMag 15 round mag. No failure to feed, failure to eject, or failure to fire.

Hi-Point has a lifetime warranty on the gun to any owner! Free parts and repairs are done to the rifle if needed. When the rifle returns you receive free mags or free product. Customer service is really great from Hi-Point!!

This has been a great plinker rifle for me. The 9mm ammo is a cheap alternative to bigger caliber ammo. I am looking for either a trade for handguns or revolvers. I am also looking for any AKs or ARs (I can put cash on top of trade if need to). I am looking to let go of the total package for $450. I can part some items out. Or if you have a reasonable offer I will let the package go all together. GLOCK NOT FOR SALE

This rifle was awarded Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence Rifle of the Year. It will be sold in like new condition. It has been taken out and shot once. That one time 100 rounds were shot through it. That's it. This is the A1 style model, but has had many upgrades added and installed by a licensed gunsmith. I love the gun and the only reason I'm selling it is due to unfortunate circumstances where I need the money more than a gun. I've owned it for less than a month and, except for the one time I shot it, it has been in a rifle carrying case and secured in my gun safe. This base rifle retails at $519. It will include the 1 25 round clip, original box, and cable lock it came with. I will also include the tactical rifle carrying case I purchased for it. It too is in like new condition. It was purchased within a week after the rifle and has never touched the ground. Below are the details and features of this rifle along with all of the upgrades that have been added to this rifle. Total retail value of this gun with all of the upgrades is close to $1000.

OPTICAL FEATURES

Waterproof - Optics are sealed with o-rings to prevent moisture, dust, and debris from getting inside the scope.
Fogproof - Nitrogen purged to inhibit internal fogging.
Shockproof - High recoil rating. Tested with .375 H&H Magnum for 1000 rounds.
Parallax Free - Allows for rapid shooting with both eyes open, without concern for parallax shooting error. Parallax free beyond 50 yards; less than one-inch error closer than 50 yards.

5. MAGPUL AFG - Angled Fore Grip

FEATURES
Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

6. MAGPUL CTR - Compact/Type Collapsible Carbine Stock Mil Spec

FEATURES
The Magpul CTR (Compact/Type) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

7. Hogue Rubber Grip Ar-15/M-16 Rubber Grip with Finger Grooves ( THIS ACCESSORY HASN'T BEEN ADDED TO THE RIFLE YET, BUT IS NEW AND STILL IN RETAIL PACKAGING. IT WILL BE INCLUDED IN SELL. )

FEATURES
Hogue rubber grips are molded from a durable synthetic rubber that is not spongy or tacky, but gives that soft recoil absorbing feel, without affecting accuracy. This modern rubber requires a completely different molding process than ordinary neoprene and results in a much superior grip. The material we use does not come apart or deteriorate and is resistant to all solvents and oils used around firearms. Hogue Grips give you a lasting precision fit and durability that will provide years of dependable service. The flexibility of our materials and molding process has allowed us to produce superior rubber grips with features that out perform all other makes.

I have several optics i have zeroed to rifle and i mix and match depending on the day. I will place an optic into trade/buy out for right price. Optics are: EOTech 512, and TRIJICON Tripower (fiber optic) with 3x magnifier. Also have low end scope when i actually feel like working longer ranges. Rifle recently modified by RATWORX. Mods done were drilling out gas port (reliability- MSAR drilled them small and not enough gas would go through when rifle got dirty causing FTF), internals checked and polished, chamber checked and cleared, Trigger/pull/creep smoothed out as well as a basic all around hand fitting. Rifle functions absolutely fabulous..but im headed back to ARs for competitive shooting. Bought this rifle used a s a toy and now want a workhorse. Price firm. If you dont like the price we'll talk but dont low ball....you may just get told no. These rifles are hard to get and this one has been seen by Chris at RATWORX and has been smoothed out..no MSAR gremlins hiding in this one. 
Ill entertain multiple trades..please be real. im not looking for LWRC but im not interested in a DPMS. Ideally some one may have an AR with several cal uppers to throw in, or an FS2000 or ACR..ill take offers...but id more rather trade than sell outright."

Mid Range/Tactical Scope Features

Low-profile, finger-adjustable ½-MOA windage and elevation adjustments with audible, tactile clicks. Engraved Bullet Drop Compensation dial for 5.56mm/.223 Rem, or 7.62mm/.308 win.

This pistol was the first of the ""XD"" series. After springfield bought the rights to the HS series pistols, springfield renamed them to the XD to remarket them. The pistol shoots great and I have never had a problem with it. Estimated round count is around 500-700. It eats FMJ and every HP I have feed it. Only wear is on the barrel. Slide is in great condition along with the rest of the weapon.

From the website:
""						A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.
The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech® system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever."""

Very good condition , shoots amazing groups, cycles quick and smooth for fast follow up shots. Have some papers that show how to take this apart and service it and parts breakdown ( not original) this gun has not been shot much , but does function perfectly and is in great shape for being so old.   
Woodsman “Match Target” Pistols were designed for competition, bull’s-eye shooting…This Colt has features that make this pistol rare and more collectible than base models. For example, the full length lugged “slab sided” match grade barrel. This adds balance to the entire frame of the pistol and that translates into a less fatiguing grip. It does add weight to the overall gun, but the additional weight absorbs any recoil and keeps your sights on target.  The factory installed adjustable sights- standard front blade, rear notch configuration.

The P11 is made primarily for concealed-carry use.  If you need a gun with a safety, this is not the one for you.  If you need short trigger pull, again, not for you.  This handgun has a very long trigger pull so the user, in the event of an emergency, can fire the pistol without worrying about a safety toggle.  The long trigger pull also ensures the pistol cannot be fired unintentionally while in a proper holster or pants pocket.

Very easy to achieve 1 MOA with match ammo!  A friend (and better shot than me) has gotten 1/2 MOA with it :-)   The bore is in exceptional shape. This rifle runs on a short stroke gas piston system and thus runs extremely clean and cool in the bolt. The whole rifle is constructed of high impact polymer less the moving parts. As a result, the entire firearm is a modular platform capable of being converted to almost any configuration. The rifle comes with 4  factory 10 round mags and a great combat style one-point sling, plus its factory original sling.  It has been upgraded to a high hand-grip with integral 3x scope,  reticle set-up for up to 800 meters with built in ranging grid for man sized targets.  This scope is perfect for this rifle  and offers a superb field of view and excellent light transmission, very well balanced.

I'm looking to trade my Norinco M1911A1 Nickel plated, compensated .45 ACP. The gun is in really good condition with less than 100 rounds fired and all numbers match. These haven't been imported since the 1994 import ban. Very few made it into the US Nickel plated. These pistols are very rare and top quality, the steel is 5100 Ordnance grade tool steel compared to the 4140 the US manufactures still use. The compensator is aftermarket but it matches the gun so perfect it looks factory. It has Pachmayr American Legend grips and stainless Wilson Combat hex grip screws. Internals are polished, I've never had a hiccup! It is very accurate and has mild recoil for the big fourty-five.

This pistol includes;

-Hardcase (Padded, fits gun and all mags)
-2x Norinco mags serial matched (both 7rd)
-2x stainless steel mags marked ""Colt 45 Auto"" (one is 7rd and the other 8rd)
-Nevr-Dull wadding polishing compound (to keep it always looking new)

I'm looking to sell outright for $800 or trade for other Chinese arms (some plus cash, just depending)"

You might want to take the gun apart and oil and clean it for the first time when you get it.  The reason I bought the gun was because I did not have a hand gun, but my dad gave me one the weekend after I bought the CM9.  I have no reason for the gun anymore.  It works perfectly!
