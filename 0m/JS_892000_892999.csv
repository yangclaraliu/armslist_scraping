This is the Magpul MOE black edition of Colt LE6920 from the factory with extra Magpul upgrades installed. This carbine has a 16.1” chrome lined barrel. with a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited for 556 or 223. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip, MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine. Also includes factory kit with extras like cleaning kit, sling, and 2 Magpul 30 round PMAGS.

If you buy a Colt, you are buying a military spec rifle, tried and true. Consider that before you pay the same price I'm asking for a rifle that isn't chrome lined, and isn't mil-spec.

If you win, I have more 10 Magpul MOE PMAGs in factory wrapping that I will sell at $35 each, and 380 rounds of ammo that I will see at $0.75 per round. Try finding those deals elsewhere. 

The rifle has had one box of ammo fired through it, so while it is not new, it is the closest used you will find to new. It is 9.9/10 condition, with no defects. This is the cheapest price I saw any plain Colt 6920s for this weekend at the Salem Gun Show, and this has $300 in Magpul upgrades.

I am located in Martinsville, VA. I will ship to your FFL if needed. Or, buyer must be a VA resident with a VA drivers license, at least 21 years old, and must not be a felon. I also require a bill of sale. 

If you have any questions. Please let me know. I can take more pictures if needed and check my email often."

The stock has not been refinished and yet has very few blemishes for a rifle that's over 75 years old. It's a wonderful shooter, and the bore is in excellent condition. The price is $170 firm, or I will trade for a really nice M44 and I'll throw a little cash.. this is not some piece of crap Mosin covered in cosmoline with a chewed up stock. This is fine piece of history that will serve you well for display or hunting if you so choose.  Note: the bipod is NOT included but I will include a cleaning kit and sling.. I will not ship or drive to meet someone outside of my general area , and you must have a valid Wisconsin ID. Yes you can find less expensive Mosin's but not one as nice as this one, I'd just assume hang it on the wall or will it to family member than sell for less.. It's that nice.

Among the most unique magazine designs, the 30/45 magazines were designed with an extendable bottom section that would allow the magazine to be fully loaded to 30 rounds and stored (with the base extended) with the spring under minimal pressure. This allowed long-term storage of fully-loaded mags with no wear to the spring or the feed lips. They can also be loaded with 45 rounds when the base extended, though they shouldn't be stored in this configuration.

Offered for sale is a really nice Springfield 1911 GI stainless in .45 ACP.  I am not the original owner, but I have taken very good care of this pistol.  I have installed aftermarket G10 grips, and the original grips are included with the sale.  Pistol will also come with the original case, holster, original magazine, magazine holder, and tools.  The pistol is in really, really good condition.  I purchased this pistol about a year ago to find out what I did and didn't like from a standard 1911.  The proceeds from this sale will fund a 1911 with more options.  This, however, is a very good ""starter"" 1911 for those who want to check it out!

Though I am selling this pistol from my personal collection, I will verify your age and Oklahoma residence at the time of sale.  I will also get your name and telephone number.  No exceptions.  

Price if FIRM.  I can sit on this listing until I get a fair price, as I am not desperate to sell.  No trades whatsoever.  Face to face in a public place, and cash only.  Thanks for looking and good luck!"

After seeing what USED Beat up Bushmasters are going for at the so called ""FIREARMS APPRECIATION DAY"" Gun show and on the web as well, I decided to build this sexy beast and offer it for less. which is still too much, but I actually paid quite a bit for the parts on this bad boy... I have invested alot into trying to make sure as many Americans as possible can get a rifle, NOW, without alot of paperwork and lollygagging. This ban, which is 50-50 in my eyes, could happen anytime, or not. But if it does, I have got you covered and at least you know I will be taking any profits and putting them right back into the AR community. Behind every front door, an AR-15... sounds awesome SAFE to me ;-)

Keep in mind that I have enough parts to complete several different purpose-built rifles, but this one is first this week, and was an experiment gone terribly freakin awesome if you ask me.

It includes

MOE Furniture - Rifle Length Handguard, 1 5 inch and 1 3 inch mod rails
Chrome Moly HBAR with a Carbine length gas tube and Lo-Pro Block
Lo Pro is tucked away ""Dissipator"" style and a FSB is mounted ner the muzzle.

Will come with as much OR as little as you want it to. That is were the negotiating comes in, but, for just the rifle and 1 LOADED USGI mag, I am asking $1900. Add or subtract from my assortment of buttstocks, triggers (ALG ACTriggers, QMS Triggers), flashlight mounts, BUIS, Muzzle Breaks, etc etc 

OR we could always start from scratch with either a 14.5, 16, 20 OR 24 inch barrel in Stainless or Standard anodized and build something that is totally YOUR STYLE.

Anyway, that's what I've got for y'all. 

1900 is pretty FIRM, but I'm a reasonable guy. I will consider trades for quality firearms or AR parts of course but for only up to 50% unless it is the deal of a lifetime or something.



Thanks for your time everyone!

Standardized by the DEA, ATF, and FBI SWAT team, the Model 552 holographic weapon sight is the sight of choice for such military units as the Stryker Brigade, 10th Mountain, and 3rd Infantry. The Model 552 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment. 
The Model 552 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. The battle-proven design can withstand the abuse that any harsh environment, high-powered weapon platform, or military mission can dish out. Other features include a 65 MOA ring reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 30 brightness settings. The Model 552 is compatible with Gen I-IV night vision systems and mounts on 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

This gun as well as all of my other guns has been shot every chance I get, the pistol has seen somewhere in the neighborhood of 5k from me personally and I am the second owner.  The pistol has more life left in it than most have money or time to run rounds through it.  Gun has been extremely reliable when I do my part, and it has run like a champion for me, but it up for sale or trade because it never seems to make it out of the house with me now that I have picked up a couple semi-custom 1911s.  This gun runs great is accurate and has a great (stock) trigger so it deserves to be run and I'd like it to go to someone who will put it through its paces.

Asking Price is $925 or trade
Price includes Pistol, 7 total mags (3 wilson combat, 4 Ed Browns and 3 of these have Tripp Research internals) FDE gun bag, and 100 rounds of brass factory .45acp(only if it's a Face to Face and I don't have to travel significantly)  I do not do PAypal as they are anti gun and I will not contribute to them. Payment will be cash FTF, Postal Money Order, trade, combination etc...

Who wants an AR wih no Ammo?...   No one!  What's the point of having an AR if there's no ammo to shoot it.  That's why I'm including a Box of 500 rounds of Factory sealed Federal 556 ammo in the deal.

I will include ALL my additional accessories as well...  That's a discreet carry backpack, Hoppe's bore snake and a Laser sight.  Plus 5 extra Cal. Legal mags, these are 10/20 steel mags (they look like they hold 20 rounds, but they are Cal. Legal and only hold 10).

Local Pickup only.  I will not ship the Item.  There are more than 4 locations within 30 miles of me that can take care of the transfer, take your pick.  No Haggling, the price is fair given the current state of affairs and the number of extras I am throwing in the deal.  The price is firm at $3000 (see possible trade below).

I only had this gun a week and would gladly offer a cash reward for information leading to its return. If you have information my cell number is REDACTED.

It is a marvelous gun, in top shape, and I don't think it will be here long. I am a private seller, so I don't collect taxes, fees, or require permits. I am just exchanging my investment here to free up some funds for more firearms I have on order. You can be the next owner but only, if you hurry. This gun is the model 19c , which stands for compensated, and that makes the gun lots more fun to shoot by lessening the muzzle climb, and helping you to stay on target. It will come with the case, 2 -15 round mags, manual, books etc. You could be fooled into thinking its new, its so nice. Email me or text me or call me at REDACTED."

So what if we told you that you could effectively cut down the weight of your current aluminum handguard to 50% of its present weight?  When you install an INTRAFUSE® AR Carbine Handguard that is exactly what you will be doing.  Tapco has created it out of a light weight but high strength composite that offers both weight reduction and durability.Tapco has also done something you can't do with an aluminum handguard, over 300 rounds in full auto and our handguard is cool enough to be hand held!  But that’s not all this handguard brings to the table.  Customization is a key component to the INTRAFUSE® line and this handguard is no different.  Molded into it are four Picatinny rails (located at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 positions) with the side and bottom rails having removable covers so you can decide which ones you want to use and which ones you want to keep hidden.  If you’re in the market for a light weight handguard that is built around the idea of “customization,” there is no better fit than the INTRAFUSE® AR Carbine Handguard.

This is a rail mounted weapon light for rifles. It has never been on my rifle while being fired. I have never even used it. I basically just took it out of the box and put it on my rifle and saw that it would not work with my rifle (the way I would like) because of my AR-15 set up then I put it right back in the box. I decided to buy a different light with a smaller bezel. This is the rifle package which includes a pressure switch cord (non coiled), two rail clips for mounting switch to picatinny rail (really nice!), the light with remote door switch, CR123 batteries. The light has a strobe function, constant on, and momentary. 200 lumens! Very bright but not too bright for indoor use. Beam can light up to a 100 yrds effectively outside. This retails for $289 with pressure switch. Sorry i cant load pics from my phone but email me if you would like to see some. Here is the link from Streamlight for more info

** Here's What I Have **
- Bushmaster XM-15/E2S M4 Rifle with adjustable stock, flash hider, fixed carry handle sight and front post sight, forward assist and dust cover, 1/9 twist, aluminum/steel body (ie: not the cheap polymer feeling ones), shoots .223/556 NATO. This gun is perfect and ridiculously accurate!
- 7 Hi-Cap Mags: 3 thirty round PMags, 2 twenty round thermolds, 2 thirty round thermolds.
- All mags will come LOADED for the right deal + 85 extra rounds of extra ammo (275 rounds total).
- You're getting a gun that is totally ready to go when you get it from me!
- Gun has had 150 rounds shot through it (at most), functions and looks perfect, cleaned thoroughly after every shooting trip....you're getting a great barely used gun from a very responsible and picky owner :)

** Trade Towards **
I am looking to trade this gun for multiple other guns. Here's my ideal pairing:
- Ruger SR1911 (45acp) + Ruger Mark III or 22/45 (22LR) & a Ruger 10/22 (or the SR22 version).
- Or this pairing: Ruger SR1911 + M&P 15-22 AR Pistol.
All guns that are traded must have mags with them and preferably have ammo as well. Must be in great shape (minor wear from usage is okay, but mistreated and neglected guns are NOT)....your guns must also have a clean and legal history. I will check into them.
- Or I would also consider trades towards the other guns listed below in this post.

** Trade Value **
If your offer is not that exact pairing I've mentioned above, my trade value is around $2,000-2,200. Cash price is undecided as I'm more interested in getting the above mentioned guns....but if you want to buy it shoot me an offer.

Questions or other offers? Feel free to shoot them my way - I'm an easy to get along with guy and want to come up with a good deal and exchange some great firearms :)

Thanks for looking and have a great day!"
