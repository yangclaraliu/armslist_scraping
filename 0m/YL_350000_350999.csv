SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards 

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.

The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select
 one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change
 everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.

Round count is 0. Bought new and has sat in the safe. This pistol has the six dot Viking Tactical sights with the top three dots being green fiber optics and the three lower dots are tritium night sights. When looking through the sights the transition from the tru glow fibers to the tritium night sights is seemless. When going from light to dark the night sights appear as the tru glows fade out and the oppisite when going from dark to light. The trigger is very crisp and ild say breaks about 5 lbs.

My trade intrest are a 1911, Maybe an AR 15 M4 or AK. The 1911 ild like to have has a rail and preferably night sites but ild consider other 1911's. I love AK's but sorry no WASR's or CAI.

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force. Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun. A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot. a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

The small size and single stack mag makes this a very nice gun for concealed carry. Fits easily in a pocket and there are various holsters available.

This satin walnut set includes a Winchester butt plate and will fit .22 Long Rifle, .22 Magnum and .17 HMR models.  The forearm is 8”.

These are Winchester factory originals and have not been carried so the checkering is still sharp and well defined. The right side of the stock shows a bit of iridescence in sunlight.  Note that there are no scratches or scuffmarks on the stock set or the butt plate.

Here is a great way to upgrade your classic Winchester .22 if it has a worn or damaged stock or if you just want to change to a checkered set instead of the smooth stock set.  These sometimes show up at auction but tend to be hard to find since the 9422 model has been discontinued since about 2005.

I'm looking to buy a padded rifle case to hold multiple rifles.  Lots of pockets are a plus.  I'm a fan of Voodoo cases, but anything will do as long as it holds multiple rifles.  
So please do not show me your awesome Pelican case that will protect a gun from being run over by a steam roller, if it only holds one gun.  

You guys get the idea.
Also looking for magazines for Ruger 10/22, Savage Mark II, GSG5 (all those are in .22lr), and also Glock 22 or 23.

I'm located in Albany, and for the right deal I will drive a little farther out.  I will also cover shipping if you have something worthwhile.

This rifle was 100% American built, not some cheap thrown together rifle. The rifle was made in 2008, I confirmed it by calling the manufacturer and looking up my serial number. The gun was recently DuraCoated in the color of Parker. Because this is a quality AK-47 variant, and I know the pricing this thing was originally priced at, I will not let this go for under $650.

Magpul MOE hand guard, in flat dark earth (installed)
Magpul MOE grip, in flat dark earth (installed)
TAPCO Mil-Spec T6 6-position stock, in flat dark earth (installed)
Original black metal carbine hand guard that came with the Colt
Original black grip that came with the DPMS
A UTG 1"" Flat Top Riser. (brings the scope up to a more natural level)
A UTG/Leapers 4x32 illuminating scope. Cheap optics, paid around $80, but it is actually a nice scope. Crisp glass, lots of light, and it stays true.
A detachable carry handle with sights, great for if you need to switch back and forth from scope to iron sights.
Brand new bore snake.
Rifle sling.
13 various magazines, some Magpul, some military issue. All work well.
Any ammunition I have around for it. Currently probably near 50 or so rounds.

I had the front tower sight ground off and painted to accommodate the scope in a lower position (without riser). If you would want to use the front sight you will need to buy a new gas block with a flip up sight (easy and cheap).

Gun is in great used condition, and would be great for any application. NO trades please, cash needed. If I could have any gun I'd keep this one. Lots invested,looking for a quick sale. I am asking $900, the Colt upper was over $1,200 by itself. Please contact by email, and if you'd rather talk on the phone please email me your number and I will respond promptly.

I am thinking about selling my AK-47 made by Inter-Ordnance. The model is: I.O. Inc. 10K-47C. This rifle is NOT a WASR, not by a million miles. This thing was quality built, I compared it to a WASR that I bought new (and got rid of because it wasn't up to par with this one). This rifle was 100% American built, not some cheap thrown together rifle. The rifle was made in 2008, I confirmed it by calling the manufacturer and looking up my serial number. The gun was recently DuraCoated in the color of Parker. Because this is a quality AK-47 variant, and I know the pricing this thing was originally priced at, I will not let this go for under $650. So if you are going to try and offer $649 or below, don't bother wasting our time.

The rifle will come with the following:

- 1 Brand-New, never used TapCo magazine (in plastic still)
- TapCo infusion hand guard with a tri-rail system and heat shield (top one screws on but I took it off)
- TapCo AK-47 style buttstock with metal buttplate.
- Un installed scope mount bracket.
- Two 30 round magazines (steel)

***MAGPUL FORWARD ANGLE GRIP WILL NOT BE INCLUDED.

Asking for $750 for all of this. If you look up the price of the rifle as well as all of the stuff included, you'll see it's valued a few hundred less.

I can send pictures of the rest of the stuff, but if you look it up, it's going to be the same as in those pictures. I WILL NOT TRAVEL MORE THAN 20 minutes from Fayetteville and I will NOT accept a bullshit offer. Thanks for your interest."

He has wonderful advanced obedience training including silent hand signal responses. Very intelligent, focused and high drive family guardian. I am very experienced with working Rottweillers and he is an A grade protection dog. The reason I am considering placing him in a new home is because he is just too large for my 6 year old daughter to work with, so I have decided to get another female rottie for our home. He is housebroken, crate trained, good with kids, and rides in the front or back of truck as often as you let him. He is not however for inexperienced or first time dog owners, this is a serious tool for protecting your home and family. He was sired by a European born Int. Champion and his dam was also sired by an Int. Champion. He comes with akc papers and a certified akc pedigree. I would be very willing to discuss co-ownership where I retain breeding rights to this exceptional dog. I am interested in cash, guns, silver or any combination of those. Asking price is $1600 or $1100 with written breeding rights. If you will search the internet this is an Extremely reasonable price for a dog of his breeding, not to mention the extensive training! A link to his website is below, use the buttons at the bottom of his page to see his pedigree. The siblings page will also show you his numerous siblings that are already champions.

I just got this, but the wife got mad, because I didn't inform her I was getting it. :)
This is an M70AB2 Yugo underfolder built on a Century/D.C. receiver. It's in amazing shape, and the only wear is where the safety, and the grenade sights flip up (where there is always wear).
I paid $500, and 6 boxes of 45ACP (worth $120) for the rifle and magazines. I've since purchased 500 rounds of Wolf Performance 7.62x39 ($130), 160 rounds of Tula 7.62x39 ($45), and 130 rounds of surplus 7.62x39 ($40).

As you can see, I'm asking less than I've paid, and I will not reduce the price.

I've looked everywhere for pricing after people kept telling me that the price is too high. The internet ads selling these for $550 are a few years old, and they've been sold out for a couple of years. Everywhere I've found that actually has on in stock it's make with the cheap plastic furniture, and they're listed at $650-$700. The price is fair, deal with it. If you don't like my price, buy one of the ones that you've found that you say is cheaper than mine."

This is a very, very sweet shooting gun, it just seems a little too small in my hands. This gun carries in the pocket like a dream and has the sweetest trigger on the market. 

This gun has been refineished yesterday when I planned on keeping it, but have decided otherwise. It has a Satin Stainless Cerakote finish, this was professionally done by Harsh Firearms here in OKC. It is a beautiful finsih, I had it finished over the factory stainless so it reduced the glare from the shiny steel. It is smoot matte silver finish, very near factory color. But no shine! 

I am also including a Sticky brand holster that is made for this gun, as well as Kahr cm/pm series/ Ruger LC9/ Kel Tec Pf9 and maybe other similar sized pistols. These holsters are awesome and conform to your body heat from wear and also mold to fit the gun. They are also great pocket holsters.

Also including a 25 round box of Federal 135gr low recoil Hydroshock Hollowpoint ammo.

I am looking for guns such as Ruger LC9/ Kahr cw9/ Kahr cw40/ or any other smaller pocket sized 9mm or maybe larger, depending on the gun offered may have to have cash added to the trade or other products. Just let me know what you have. I will also sell outright for $475 with everything. That is selling the gun for only about $350 and the holster goes for $25 and the ammo goes for $25, I have a lot in the finish as well. So if you break it down this is a very good deal for someone. I paid $450 for the gun just a few weeks ago!"
