The stock has a few knicks in it, but nothing major. The only issue is with feeding, a common issue with these rifles. If you work the bolt slowly, the round will hit the feed ramp and point too high to go into the chamber. The remedy to this is to be brisk with the bolt and you won't have feeding issues. Besides that, this gun shoots great, only reason I am selling it is that I don't give it the love it deserves. Make me an offer."

Also comes with Guncrafter Industries .50 GI drop-in slide conversion in melonite.  

The .50 GI recoil feels like a stout .45 ACP load in the Glock platform with awesome ballistic performance. Gun and conversion work perfectly. Never had a failure of any sort. In fact the .50 GI conversion has worked so perfectly that I've never even used the .45 slide that came with the gun, it is unfired since the factory. 

Two different calibers with one gun, just pop off the slide and magazine and install the other slide and pop in other magazine, takes about a minute to swap back and forth. Low round count, I would guess approximately 250 rounds through the gun.  Cold Bore Customs did a tasteful minor grip reduction for me to make the handgun more ergonomic, feels great in the hand."

I just bought a 2013 Chevy Silverado and had a lift kit and new wheels & tires installed.  The stock wheels & tires are now sitting in my garage collecting dust, so this is your oppertunity to get a great deal and not pay retail price!!!   The wheels & tires are stock Chevy 18"" 5 Spoke Machined Silver w/ Goodyear Wrangler P265/65R18 112T.  This package is brand new with only 18 miles on them!!!!  If you bought these from the dealership they would cost you approx. $2,100 without installation.  You might be able to find them online for around $1,700.  Will fit any 2007 - Present: Avalanche, Tahoe, Silverado, Sierra, Suburban.    I have all center caps and lugnuts as well.

The tent that is being offerd for trade is in like new condition and complete.  The first picture so you can have an idea its almost the size of a 2 car drive way. Tent dimensions are 10' wide, 10' long, and 5'6"" high at the peak. 

This is an outstanding Military style tent that is similar in design to a Coleman tent but very heavy duty and designed for very cold weather. It is constructed of a heavy weight waterproof vinyl canvas. It has two doors with zippered openings and fly screens. It has a stove opening for 4"" stovepipe and two vents in the roof. The inside of the tent is tan and the reversible fly is white on one side and green on the other. The pictures of the tent show it with and without the fly. The fly must be installed to make the tent completely weather-proof. The frame breaks down into a 2.5 foot long package. It is constructed of heavy duty Aluminum sections that are shock corded together such that all the frame pieces remain connected together through the center hub when folded. A liner is also included that is made of heavyweight cotton cloth and lines the inside of the tent for insulation in cold weather. This tent has an integral floor just like a Coleman tent. The floor is made of very thick vinyl for extra puncture resistance. This tent has a removable mesh gear loft.

The entire tent consists of six components: the tent with integral floor, fly, liner, frame, gear loft, and transport covers."

I'm not sure what parts are interchangeable but I have seen forums that list all of them. I sanded down some of the contact points of the slide in order to increase the smoothness of the action. I also removed the magazine disconnect. It is one of three safetys that comes installed in the gun and I prefer not to have it. I can reinstall if necessary.  Comes with the factory grips as well as the Hogue OD green finger grips.  This is the tactical model so it has the picatinny rail under the barrel and also comes with the factory faux supressor. I've been shooting Remington Thunderbolt High Velocity Ammo with it and I have not had a single jam. Will come with ammo if your trade comes with ammo.

Everything needed to fight the zombies or other bad guys.
 Package includes: 

MEGA Arms AR15 upper factory built and unfired. Has factory installed quad rail, forward assist, and dust cover. 16inch 1/9 twist barrel with threaded 1/2 x 28 and removable A2 birdcage.

SAA lower unfired and also brand new. Put a mag in it to test fit and that's it. Has a milspec PSA tube with VLTOR adjustable stock in FDE. magpul grip in matching FDE and rail covers on left and right sides. The stock and pistol grip both have storage compartments.

 THE BUFFER, SPRING, STOCK, GRIP, OPTICS, AND RAIL COVERS ARE USED. EVERYTHING ELSE IS BRAND NEW FROM THE FACTORY.

For optics it has a Primary Arms M4 red dot with 7 brightness setting in a 30mm cantilever mount. Behind it is a Vortex 3x magnifier on a swing mount to move it out of the way. The magnifier has had the rubber cover removed to allow it to swing clear of BUIS I was running on my other rifle. This combo works awesome and makes 250+ meter shooting a breeze. I can hit the steel plate at 225yds 30/30 shots with this setup with barely trying on my other rifle.

I'm including 1 matching FDE pmag that is lightly used and 6 brand new, unopened pmags. 2 Gen1s and 4 Gen2s all black 30rd w/o window.
 Also in this deal is enough ammo to fill all the mags that are loaded on stripper clips tucked inside a bandolier for easy transport. 
Ammo consists of: 

90rds of FMJ 62gr
 60rds of 5.56 Tracers
 60rds of 62gr washougal green tip. these are licensed factory M855 reloads from a local company.

 The .22 dedicated upper is from CMMG. It has an unknown round count on the barrel/upper but the bolt has seen about 300rds or so. I got it replaced a few months back and just don't shoot it much. Unfortunately some moron before me hacked the front sight post off with a dremel and left a weird ring around the barrel where the finish is missing. Purely cosmetic issues and it fires surprisingly well with no issues using HV ammo and really well with an occassional FTE with subsonic. I'm throwing in 2x 25rd CMMG mags with it too. This is a direct drop in for your upper as the pics show. Great way to practice w/o spending $1 per round. Removable carry handle and Diamond head flip up front sight give it all the accuracy you need.

CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG????


The Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee did not endorse colleague Dianne Feinstein’s assault weapons ban at a packed Capitol Hill hearing on guns Wednesday in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., shooting.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., called for “common sense reform,” that closes loopholes in current gun laws and enforces background checks. Buthe did not endorse Feinstein’s tougher ban. “I know gun store owners in Vermont,” Leahy said. “They follow the law and conduct background checks…why should we not try to plug the loopholes in the law that allow (criminals and the mentally ill) to buy guns without background checks?”

The rebuffed California Democrat plans to hold her own hearing in her Judiciary subcommittee on her legislation, which is strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association. Senate majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has also refused to back a ban on military-style weapons and high-capacity clips. Reid’s position reflects the political fact that a whole bevy of conservative Democrats do not support Feinstein’s ban.

Former Arizona Rep. Gabriel Giffords opened the hearing. As a House Democrat from a gun friendly district, Giffords opposed stricter gun laws, but since being shot in the head by a crazed gunman while holding an event in her district has reversed her position. Giffords, accompanied by her husband, gave a halting and brief but extremely forceful opening statement.

“Speaking is difficult but I need to say something important,” Giffords said. “Too many children are dying
We must do something. It will be hard, but the time is now. You must act. Be courageous, Americans are counting on you.”

Her husband Mark Kelly gave equally forceful testimony, noting both he and Giffords are gun owners. He said the Arizona gunman who shot his wife in 15 seconds emptied his magazine of 33 bullets, “and there were 33 wounds,” including a fatal shot to a young child. Kelly said one of the most important things to do is close the gun show loophole and require all sellers to require a background check. “I can’t think of something that would make our country safer than doing just that,” Kelly said.

David Kopel, an adjunct Professor of constitutional law at Denver University, said universal background checks “are only enforceable with universal gun registration,” which in other countries has left gun ownership “in serious peril.”

Kopel said teachers should be allowed to be armed, as they are in Utah. “Armed defense in schools is the immediate and best choice,” he said.

Gayle Trotter, an attorney and senior fellow at the conservative Independent Women’s Forum, said guns “make women safer,” because they “reverse the balance of power in a violent confrontation” between a male attacker and a weaker female. “An armed woman does not need superior strength” in a hand-to-hand struggle, Trotter said."

CT Laser Specs:

Springfield Armory's XD(m) and XD pistols are acclaimed for their superior balance, reliability and ergonomics. Crimson Trace is pleased to release laser sights for XD(m) and XD pistols. The LG-448 Laserguard® is designed to fit both lines in all sizes and calibers. Featuring instinctive activation, the laser sight immediately springs to life when held in a normal firing grip. Attaching firmly to the trigger guard and balanced against the accessory rail notch, the LG-448 can be zeroed by the user to their individual firearm (both windage and elevation) and has been rigorously tested to hold zero under the most demanding field conditions.
_____________________________________________________________________
Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture.

I'm looking to trade it for another firearm or two. So I've decided to try at a cost $300 less than I have into it. Around $650 trade value.


I have a Savage 340 in good, well cared for condition (with a few inevitable scratches from hunting) that is chambered in .223, but has a swap out barrel for .222 Remington.
It has a scope, with scope rings attached. A laser bore sight for .223. (3) .223 five round magazines, and (2) .222 five round magazines.
Also comes with 140 rounds of .222 Remington.
Has a 1:14 twist, which prefers the 55gr loads, and fires milsurp 5.56 well.
Valued around $859.
Only reason I'm wanting to trade is because of the craziness for .223 at this time, and I just picked up another bolt action, so the rifle fills a role I have filled in other ways.
Very little interest in cash, just trades. 


I also have an Mtech crossbow rated at 80 lbs, if I recall. It's all set up, and hardly used. Shoulder injury doesn't allow me to use it anymore. The bolts for it have been lost in a move, so the $100 dollar value is closer to $75.
Not expecting to get much for it, just hoping it can sweeten a trade.

I value my privacy, so if I don't get back to you anytime after 4PM, I'm not interested in your trade. I just don't want to send my email out to people I don't want to do business with.
But offers, and pictures are always welcomed. I have pictures of both of mine, but the files are too big for this site. Will gladely email, if enticed.

It has a 16.5 inch theaded barrel with a short 3 inch belgum flash hider and is currently fitted with a full picitinni railed handguards, Red Dot 40mm sigh,t and a DSA X-Series Butt-stock. The Upper receiver is a metric Brazilian made Imbel and the lower is a Metric Canadian Military receiver. It has a grenade launcher flip up sight (sorry no grenade launcher with it). The selector switch is able to rotate all the way to the ""full auto"" position (No it will not fire as a full auto, the full auto sear was removed to make it legal). This is a rare FAL and functions flawlessly! I am able to destroy milk jugs with it out past 300 meters. I have 2x 20 round metric mags to go with it along with the original FAL handguards, 2 extra FAL Butt-stocks, and one extra FAL pistol grip. This is a heavy hitter in the world of battle rifles. It fires both 7.62x51 NATO and .308 perfectly!! Get it while you can, I don't expect it will last too long.
I know what this awsome battle rifle is worth due to it's rarety/functionality and will take a resonable offer from my asking price or partcial trade for what I listed in the trade section. AR-15's and AK's can't hold a candle to this weapon, there is just no compairison to a .308!! If you know anything about the FAL, the metric version is more desired than the ""inch"" pattern FALs...metric mags are easier to find than inch mags are. The Metric FAL can also take inch mags but the inch FAL's cannot take the metric mags. This FAL is the closest you can get to the actual original FN made FAL without spending double. I have a video of the weapon being shot at your request!
The FN FAL is used by over 90 countries as their main military battle rifles...it's called the ""Right Arm of the Free World"" for a reason! If you think that an AR is the thing to have right now then you have never fired a FAL!

It has a low round count because I started to build an AR15 shortly after buying this bushmaster. It has been thoroughly cleaned after both trips to the range.  

*UPDATE*
The best part of this rifle is it has a 16"" Heavy Barrel (HBAR), which means it's not regulated. I can do a Face to Face sale assuming you are willing to sign a Bill of Sale. MUST BRING MARYLAND STATE DRIVERS LICENSE. 

 NO WAITING like most of the AR's on this site. As of last Saturday, the waiting time to here back from the state for a regulated AR is over a month. And that's if the laws don't change. 

I can also do a transfer at an FFL if you wish, but the buyer will pay the transfer fee.

Price is $1500 OBO. 
If you pay the price of $1500, I will include 2 mags (1) 20 round mag & (1) 30 round mag. It will also include a brand new Quadrail with rubber grips. You will not find a cheaper HBAR in Maryland or on Gunbroker.

If you make an offer below the price of $1500, it will only include the rifle, the removable carry handle, and the original hand guard, which is what is in the 1st picture.  
By the way, for those who don't know, OBO means ""or best OFFER."" That means MAKE AN OFFER. If you ask what my bottom line price is, the only response will be ""The highest amount you will pay"" 

I am more than willing to make a deal with someone, but I am not going to waste my time with bottom feeders"

It's unfired, all black, has 1 pmag, and the factory soft case.  As much as I like AR's, I hate having almost $2300 bucks in a rifle I can't go deer hunting with.  What I'm really looking for is a cheaper AR like a Bushmaster, Core 15, Windham etc in .556 to go plinking with.  I know there's a bunch of people that have settled for the less expensive models because that's all they can get their hands on at the retails stores lately.

So here's the deal, if you've got a NIB AR, or even a slightly used one (like 1 mag run through it to sight it in) in perfect condition that you have the receipt on, show me the receipt, pay me the difference between $2253  ($2100 + tax is what I paid at a Wichita gun store), we swap guns and away you go with a Black Rain.  I don't need your optics, additional mags, ammo, sling, or other acc.  We only swap what came with the rifle new. If you've got the box, sweet, but not a deal breaker.  I'll only swap AR to AR, no AK's, or other tactical models. And NO, I don't want to trade for tools or an 89 Chevy Pickup.

If you're not familiar with Black Rain AR's, check out their website.  These are top end high quality rifles.

I'd like to keep my total dollars in an AR below $1500.   Current retail pricing from local Wichita gun shops only is what I'll consider.  If you got hosed on Gunbroker and paid $1500 for an $800 rifle-sorry can't help you.  I'm not dead set on any particular model to trade for so let me know what you've got.

If this interests you, shoot me a picture/e-mail about what you have and I'll send you some pictures of my Black Rain.  I'm going to be in and out of data range the next couple of days so I might be a little slow responding to e-mail-but I will respond.

Face to face transaction in Wichita only.

I will consider trades for firearms or possibly steel AK magazines. But those would be the only trades I would consider. These magazines will likely go quickly. We may not be able to purchase these in the coming months so the time to buy is now. I started out with over 300 of these and they have went quickly. I have made many face to face transactions but I have shipped them nationwide as well. Many dealers are selling these for $40. Thanks for looking."

These guns are in excellent condition and the quality of these guns is absolutely second to none. These guns are almost impossible to get right now. If you want one you can order it through LaRue and wait months and then you may or may not get it depending on legislation that is pending. 

The OBR is the 18 inch version. It comes with the test target from LaRue and it shot a .46 MOA group which is just unreal.   This gun is outfitted with the best components available. Magpul CTR stock, LaRue POD, LaRue RISR, Magpul enhanced buttpad, Norgon ambi catch, Geissele SSA 2 stage match trigger, Battle Arms Ni Boron Bad Ass Ambi Selector, Knights Armament Micro BUIS front and rear, Gas Buster charging handle, Atlas Bipod with American defense QD mount, matching rear Monopod by Accushot(same company that makes the Atlas bipod), LaRue grip, Surefire X300 Ultra 500 lumen Tac light with LaRue QD mount, Trijicon ACOG TA31F-RMR( Green fiber optic/Tritium with chevron reticle ballistic ally matched to .223/5.56, has the RMR red dot mounted on the back, its the RM02 which is an LED 3.25 MOA red dot) the ACOG has a LaRue QD mount and a Fitted Scopecoat for the ACOG/RMR, Surefire muzzle brake/suppressor mount

The PredatAR is the 16 inch and is a real beauty. The rail extends right out to the Surefire muzzle brake for a really clean look.  This weapon is no different than the OBR in accessories department. It has a Magpul UBR stock with a Magpul Enganced buttpad and Magpul Steel strike plate and sling loop. Geissele two stage match trigger, Battle arms Bad Ass ambi selector, Knights Armament ambi mag release, Tango Down grip, Tango Down QD Stubby Vert grip, Bravo Co Gunfighter charging handle, Troy BaatleReady BUIS with Trijicon Tritium inserts front and rear. Daniel Defense 1 O'clock mount/Surefire Mini Scout light with push button and additional tail cap with pressure pad. Surefire MB556 muzzle brake. 

Both rifles have their test targets and hard cases from LaRue Tactical.  It really doesn't even need to be said but these particular guns are going for lots of money and big premiums. I have a lot invested in the guns and accessories listed. I will sell all of it for $12,500 or I will trade for a LaRue Tactical Costa Edition PredatOBR with optics and add ons."

 This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.Ambidextrous 3-Position Safety
