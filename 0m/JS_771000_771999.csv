(I REQUIRE THE BUYER TO HAVE A WA STATE CONCEALED PISTOL LICENSE OR PROOF YOU ARE A POLICE OFFICER/CORRECTIONS/JUDGE.)
Original walnut stock, original sling, 6 Springfield magazines (five 20-round, one 10 round mag. The tan mag served in Middle East). 3 mags are not pictured but they're mint condition mil-spec. The $300 scope mount (picatinny) is “SADLAK INDUSTRIES Airborne,” made of steel - this is the newer lightweight model with weight-saving cutouts. The synthetic camo stock is Springfield Armory. I bought the camo stock used and it has some normal scuffs on it. Walnut stock is bran-new. Cheek riser included for perfect cheek weld. Scope is a Millett 4-16x50 TRS-1 (30mm tube) tactical scope, illuminated mil-dot reticle, about 1 year old. I bought this M1A in late 2008. I put 200 rounds through it and took very good care of it.  The bayonet is an authentic U.S. M7 bayonet, bran-new, super-sharp, anodized, and not a scratch. With 2 stocks, bayonet, scope, and scope mount, you can configure it any way you want. Put on an AimPoint to make it a tactical rifle like in Black Hawk Down. Keep the scope on for a sniper rifle like in Tears of the Sun. Take off the mount and use iron sights like in Full Metal Jacket. Use it for hunting. Or home defense. Switch the stocks. Change it to your liking. It’s like 3 different guns. 
This is the last steel and wood battle rifle issued to U.S. forces. Ultra-reliable in sub-zero winter conditions or desert heat. This is not an average, steel-barrel M1A and a .308 will hit a lot harder at 500 yards than a .223. 
You must provide proof of a WA state Concealed Pistol Permit, or prove you're a cop with a commission card, or corrections officer, or judge.
I have 20 more pictures if you want to see more. They're too big for this site.

First, thank you for viewing my advertisement. Secondly if you are unable to own a firearm for ANY reason, please stop reading and don't waste my time. I don't care if you offer me thousands over what I am offering, it ain't going to happen. I don't need the money. I am not desperate. I have have a nice rifle to sell to a good law abiding citizen that doesn't mind passing a background check.

The rifle that I am selling is a SOG Enforcer. It is a M4 style AR15 style personal protection rifle. It is made in the USA in Houston Texas and is a very nicely built gun. Some say they are a bit overpriced, but I think the fit an function makes it worth the extra few bucks.

It is perfectly brand new and ready to shoot or store for later shooting. This rifle comes in the original hardcase, with a brand new MAGPUL magazine sling, and a box of ammo.

Feel free to give me a call or text at REDACTED. I don't have anytime for lookie-loos. I won't waste your time. It is a very nice rifle. I am not open for trades. I am open to reasonable offers. This is not worn out junk, but brand new factory original.

Given the fact that the local ranges are 100 yards max, it's pretty much overkill for me.  After a few outings, I took it off my .22 rifle and kept it in the box.  Figured it was time to find a new home for it where it would be happier on a hunting rifle.

The scope is in perfect condition and was never used in wet weather or anything other than my .22 rifle.  The glass is flawless with no scratches.  The scope comes with the original box and all accessories and manuals.

Vortex is a standup company and has an unconditional lifetime warranty that is fully transferable.   What that means to you is that if the scope ever fails you for any reason other than you threw it off a building intentionally, Vortex will replace or repair the scope for you.  No proof of purchase needed.

I'm also including the scope mount that will fit all weaver type rails.

Not looking for any trades at this time.  Thanks and contact me if you have any other questions.

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16"" barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail."

First, thank you for viewing my advertisement. Secondly if you are unable to own a firearm for ANY reason, please stop reading and don't waste my time. I don't care if you offer me thousands over what I am offering, it ain't going to happen. I don't need the money. I am not desperate. I have have a nice rifle to sell to a good law abiding citizen that doesn't mind passing a background check.

The rifle that I am selling is a EGYPTIAN BUILT MAADI AK47. It is was built in Egypt on Russian machinery and is perfect and ready to run.  It is the closest thing to the Soviet AKM. These rifles are very rare with the bayonet lug.  It was build before 1989 so it comes with the bayonet lug as a true preban rifle.

It is in excellent condition and ready to shoot or store for later shooting. This rifle comes in a soft case, with an original high capacity magazine. sling, and a box of ammo.

Feel free to give me a call or text at REDACTED. I don't have anytime for lookie-loos. I won't waste your time. It is a very nice rifle. I am not open for trades. I am open to reasonable offers. This is not worn out junk, but brand new factory original.  They only imported about 10k pre 1989 guns.  Do not cofuse this with post 1995 guns.  Very different. This is the closest to the Soviet Unions original AKM.

Thank you again for taking your time to look at my advertisement. Have a Happy and Safe New Years."

I am not interested in anykind of hunting rifle or hunting shotgun or anything made by kel-tec.  Also if you reply to my listing and i do not respond within an hour please dont take it the wrong way but im more than likely not interested.  Things i might consider for trade down below.  I'd prefer a cash deal over trades.  Please do not email me asking how much I'll take for it, just throw me an offer (serious offers) and ill let you know.  Thank you"

Not adding cash on my end unless it is definitely in my favor. No hunting shotguns. 12 gauge only. I know what it's worth. Your trade must either equal my WASR's worth. If not, you'll have to add cash or ammo. No, I won't trade a $100 gun for my WASR. No, I don't want your junk gun.

You will not find another 1911 of this age and build quality in as good of shape as this one. When I acquired it it had never been fired. Since then I have only put 125 rounds through it and never had a single problem it ran perfectly. It comes with two mags. One Wilson Combat and the original mag. I am the second owner and this gun was a safe queen from 1994 to 2012! Trust me you will not be disappointed with this gun. I am asking 1700 OBO. I know this gun may have a few years on it but it is in as close to brand new shape as a gun can be and it has tons of custom work done to it. To build this firearm new right now would be well over $3000."

     Just beginning to show early signs of very light holster wear on the high  
points. Finish wear is VERY light and difficult to see (and photograph), and there are a few VERY small scuffs/marks in the finish here and there, but they are very shallow and minor, and only affect the finish, and have not scrated into the metal at all. They are VERY hard to get to appear in photos, so they may or may not be visible. The difficulty in seeing them in photos does attest to how shallow/minor the matks are though. 
      Comes with original box and manual. Bore is in excellent condition, and although I Haven’t kept count, it has likely only fired between 200-300 rounds. 
     Good shooter, comfortable grips (the Neoprene grips are very good about  
preventing slipping in the hand when wearing gloves, or hands are wet or sweaty).  
Mechanically great, and has had no feeding/firing issues of any kind with multiple

I bought this new a year ago and never shot it-it has sat in the case the whole year. While I have had it I mounted the handle and front sight. Above the handle I mounted a picatinny rail that will accommodate horizontally mounted scopes/accessories. The front site contains a RED LASER. The stock is telescoping and the gun includes 2 high capacity magazines.
I will accept offers and will sell it when an offer hits my price point. I do not plan to keep it on here long, maybe a couple days.
I can sell WITH or WITHOUT the ammo-200 rounds. When making an offer please specify with/without the ammo included."

This is a true example of a battle veteran, that most likely saw lots of serious use and  could have been involved in at least two wars.

The rifle was assembled using a German made Bohler Stahl stepped barrel which retains it's original bluing and has an ""96"" dated antique receiver.

I would rate the bore at good or better and it is not counter-bored.

The two piece Finnish fingerspliced stock has some scars as should be expected, it also has some A's or M's stamps that indicate the butt portion at least, saw some Austrian use(World War1 ?), the handguard has the early copper rivets.

The barrel bands are an early type and are in great condition.

The bolt does not have matching numbers and is not that unusual on an issued and well used mosin. 

The sling and loops pictured were added by me and are not part of this sale.

Cleaning rod is part of the rifle and stays with it as it should.

This rifle is available for face to face sale in the Richmond, Henrico, Mechanicsville, Charles City and Hopewell areas.

This rifle would be a nice addition to most any Finnish or Mosin collection. 

Avoid all of the waiting, shipping charges, tranfer fees, and auction hassles.

choke 26"" barrels, checkered walnut stock, single gold metallic bead sight on the  
front of the serrated, vented rib, and the stock red rubber Ruger recoil pad on the  
butt. 
     Also has a very nice, comfortable, and durable, aftermarket cheek pad that that  
aids in a good, solid, comfortable cheek weld. The Pad is held on with velcro, and  
thus is easily removable and/or its position adjustable. Also has the original  
manual and pictured, but not currently installed, vent rib ""filler"" bars (purely  
aesthetic item, they are metal bars that pop into the rib and make the entire thing  
solid as opposed to having the vents/spaces in it that is currently seen)
     There are absolutely NO scratches anywhere on either the wood or the metal,  
and also NO wear or rub marks anywhere. The wood and metal finish is amazing  
condition, and looks just like it did right out of the box 30+ years ago. In spite of  
its age, it has fired relatively few shells, and has spent 99% of its time sitting  
oiled up in a safe. It was used on occasional weekends for about a 2 year period for  
skeet shooting, but both before and after that, it simply sat in the safe.  
Aesthetically and mechanically, this gun is in about as close to new in box condition  
as possible for a used (albeit very lightly) shotgun.
     There are plenty more pictures available on request, and I can also take  
specific pictures to show whatever you  like, however you like, to give you the best  
idea possible of condition.

Theres alot of hours in this project
I know these are going anywhere from 100-200. I would like $225 for the work that i have put into it. But i am more less looking for a trade, not quite ready to sell yet

+++ The sks in the pic is not for sell, sorry..... 

This mosin will look beautiful weather u keep the front sight (removable) or mount a scope.

No matching numbers, but it shot great at 50 yards standing today i hit 4 inch groups just i could have done better but man it was cold! The action is great with the turn down bolt. with a good crown, it will be perfect.

Would trade for a CZ-82, no revolvers, pistol?

No cash price. I can't post pics but can send some if you want them. Email me your number. Has three magazines and a bunch of other stuff. No tactical stuff though.  

Your Beretta must come with a bunch of magazines (At least 4. Must be 15 rounders). Maybe a holster. 3-dot sights preferred. Wood grips are nice but not a deal breaker. Ammo is optional. Extra parts are a plus. No INOX Berettas. I value my WASR for trade at around $700 and that's pretty darn good considering the market right now. If your trade value doesn't match my value you'll have to add cash. The more wear you have on the handgun the more money/accessories you'll have to add. I want keep keep this as near Greenwood as possible. 

Don't NEED to get rid of this, but a handgun is a little more practical for me at the moment. Email me your number and we can text pictures. Thank you!"
