Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) is proud to introduce the Ruger 10/22 Takedown™. Readily separated into two subassemblies, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger® 10/22®. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America's favorite rimfire rifle by your side.
The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves which hold the subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

The 4.67-pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37"" long when assembled; each subassembly is less than 20 1/4"" long when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action and ten round rotary magazine (one magazine is provided), the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a compact and portable package.

(The American Enfield.) A military collector in great condition! 

The stock is rock solid with no cracks and the expected handling marks.  It does have some cartouches behind the trigger guard, behind the lower band, and a very faint “RAP” on the left side.  The stock tip is marked “R”.

The metal finish and condition are great, and the receiver finish is outstanding. The only thing to mention is some VERY light pitting on the barrel, just behind the front sight. 

Behind the front sight the barrel is marked with a “E”, a flaming cannonball ordinance mark and the date code 12-18. This is fitting since the rifle was manufactured in May 1918.  

The action is nice. The bore seems to have some light pitting, and is a little dark, but the rifling is very strong. The bolt is the correct “Nickel Steel” stamped “W” bolt with all matching “W” parts.  

The bayonet lug/upper band is stamped “R” with an eagle proof.   Almost all the parts are marked with the “W” for Winchester and display the eagle proof.  

As I stated, the serial number on the receiver is 2636444, which by the majority of expert opinions indicates it was produced in May of 1918 [from 261,023 to 302,650]. (Experts disagree on exact production figures, but two published estimates of total production for all manufacturers- Winchester, Remington & Eddystone- as of November 1918 are 2,202,429 and 2,267,888.)  That makes this rifle having been produced and probably used during WWI.  

The rifle will come with a 1917 dated and maker marked M1907 sling and a nickel buttstock cleaning kit and oiler.  The sling is in very nice shape and is solid.  It has some cracking but as I stated, it is solid.  The oiler comes with the pullthrough and wisk brush.  All parts are in excellent shape.  The leather bumper and oiler bushing are in excellent shape.  Not all rotted out.

This rifle is not a lend lease and does not bear any foreign stamps This rifle is NOT import marked.

Winchester M1917’s are the rarest of the M1917’s.  Get one for your American War rifle collection while you can.

Rubber cheek weld attached to folding stock (removable). UTG quad rail with scope mount installed, quad rail covers included. Original foregrip included (not shown in pictures). Bipod stud mounted in quad rail. Folding forward pistol grip with storage compartment (composite). Bayonet lug. Flip up night sights present, but no glow left in tritium tubes. A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase. The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver look great, good feed ramp. There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new. Chromed bore is in fantastic shape. Shoots brass or steel case ammo and ejects both no problem.

This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47. The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section. This rifle has a chromed gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented. The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design. Chrome lined barrel. The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights. There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the night sights can be replaced by new mepro sights from Optics Planet for about $80.

The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic. There are (12) 35 round magazines. There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).  

CDNN is selling the 35 round magazines for $70 each plus shipping, that's over $1200 in magazines alone for 17 mags! The UTG quad rail/scope mount was $100.  So you are paying only $700 for the rifle, I paid more.

Price is $2000 cash, firm on price!

Face to face, no felons. 21 or older. Will want to see a CCW or CO drivers license (just name and photo). Will want a receipt for both parties. Cash only. Local sale only, will not ship.

These cost me $99.50 plus shipping. $85 firm. The description is from GG&G:

A set of our 30mm Aluminum Scope Rings weighs only 4.8 ounces. The 30 mm aluminum rings bodies are manufactured from exceptionally strong 7075 T6 billet aluminum alloy. This is the very same aluminum alloy used to manufacture Colt AR-15 and M16 receivers, as well as many of their clones. Great attention has been placed upon the design of these aluminum scope rings. The side bar is significantly thicker than most to permit high-torque tightening without the associated problem of sidebar flex. The ring cap is held in place by four socket-head steel cap screws. These screws thread into stainless steel Helicoil inserts to prevent stripping the threads. The square-cut cross bolt and its locking nut are manufactured from 4140 chrome moly steel.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with your zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales."

I bought these for a rifle but found out the mount only accepts Weaver, not Picatinny, rings. These are super burley and cost me $99.50 plus shipping. $85 firm. The description is from their website:

A set of our 30mm Aluminum Scope Rings weighs only 4.8 ounces. The 30 mm aluminum rings bodies are manufactured from exceptionally strong 7075 T6 billet aluminum alloy. This is the very same aluminum alloy used to manufacture Colt AR-15 and M16 receivers, as well as many of their clones. Great attention has been placed upon the design of these aluminum scope rings. The side bar is significantly thicker than most to permit high-torque tightening without the associated problem of sidebar flex. The ring cap is held in place by four socket-head steel cap screws. These screws thread into stainless steel Helicoil inserts to prevent stripping the threads. The square-cut cross bolt and its locking nut are manufactured from 4140 chrome moly steel.

Our Aluminum Sniper-Grade Scope Rings are 0.625-inch in width and are high enough to accommodate a scope with a 56mm objective lens. They are only available in 30mm diameter. Light and yet incredibly rugged, they set a new standard for professional lightweight scope rings for law enforcement, military and civilian use."

All original parts besides the Lyman  peep sight mounted on the side, these holes were drilled and tapped from the factory and were original, no wood was cut for this sught as well. Metal is good on the barrel with blemishes in a few spots, the real wear is on the bottom of the receiver and the butt plate.

I really prefer trading over selling at this point in time. Any offer to buy had better be impressive, otherwise I won't consider it. 

Going by gen 4 prices at Cabela's, the G21 is $50 more expensive than the 19 or the 26. This amount can be made up through ammo, mags, or whatever else. 

Will consider gen 3 with cash, mags, ammo, or accessories on your end. Must have low round count.

I am selling my Savage ML-II with a scope, its original papers, and a lot of accessories. The muzzle-loader is in great condition. The gun works excellently and according to many, it is the finest muzzle-loader on the market. It can shoot smoke-less and black powder, and it looks great. The Savage ML-II is the ONLY model muzzle-loader that can shoot smoke-less powder. The stock has a few minor scratches on the finish and a small ding on the forearm of the stock, otherwise, this gun is in pristine condition. 

The Savage ML-II has been discontinued, and they are hard to find. The stock and barrel combination that I have is even more uncommon. When I originally purchased this gun, I had to order it special, because this combination (wood stock and stainless steel barrel) is not “standard”. The stock color’s shade is unique, in and of itself, compared to most of their wood stocks (according to the Savage factory dealer I was dealing with).

I had planned on keeping this gun for the rest of my life, but with the economy the way it is, I need to sell it for the money. 

The gun comes with a Nikon InLine XR 3-9x40 Silver BDC 300 scope (which is designed for muzzle loaders) and silver Leupold scope rings. I’m also including a nice, padded leather sling and enough accessories to get you going for some time.

Here is the list of the included accessories: over 50 TC Mag Express Sabots with 300gr. XTP bullets, about a pound of IMR SR4759 smokeless powder, 25 Powerbelt 295gr Copper Series bullets, 60 pellets of Triple Seven 50/50 (50grain) black powder pellets, a few Winchester Triple Seven 209 primers, a 209 Primer Cady, a digital Frankford Arsenal powder scale, 5 muzzleloader quick-shot reloading holders, a bullet ramrod starter, cleaning patches, muzzleloader breech plug cleaners, 3/8” drive socket (to remove the breech plug), 10” drive socket shaft, a socket wrench, a muzzleloader muzzle brush, a ramrod accessory kit, Gorilla grease (anti-seize grease for use on breech when using black powder), 8 oz. of Bostik Never-Seez (anti-seize lube for use on breech when using smokeless powder), over 4 fluide oz. of TC No. 13 Bore Cleaner, and gun oil (rust prevention lubricant).

I’ve seen Savage ML-II muzzleloaders with the wood stock and stainless steel barrel going at $1,850-2,000 with just the gun (no scope, no sling, and no accessories). In addition to my rifle, I’m including a $240 scope, scope rings ($40), a $40 sling, $100 of bullets and powder, a digital powder scale ($65), and a bunch of other accessories, a total package value of $2,450-2,600 ; furthermore, this package includes everything you need to get going for a while.

Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

The electronic components in the CompM4 improve upon Aimpoint s existing stateof- the-art ACET diode circuitry, allowing this sight to run constantly for over 8 years on a single AA battery. The CompM4 features an internal voltage regulator that allows the sight to operate on any AA size battery available worldwide. This sight features a 2 minute-of-angle (MOA) dot size, making it perfectly suited for use with Aimpoint s 3XMagnifier scope module. The CompM4 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, and features an extremely rugged and easy to use 16-position manual switch with 7 night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settings. The CompM4 sight body is designed to protect both the optics and adjustment components against hard use, and is waterproof to 45 meters (150 feet).

The CompM4 also features an improved QRP2 Picatinny rail mount, eliminating the need for a separate mounting ring. This mount has over twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and features a lower and wider torque limiting knob to improve ease of use and lessen the chance of the sight base becoming snagged on other equipment. The mount is keyed into the sight to absorb recoil forces. Vertical and cantilever spacers are available to allow the sight to fit on all M16 rifle and M4 carbine variants. The sight can also be used on any other weapon with a Picatinny rail mounting system.

This design, designated as the CompM4s, features a low-mounted battery compartment giving the sight a lower overall profile, and placing the switch and battery compartment in a more protected position while preserving all of the outstanding features of the standard CompM4 sight.

The electronic components in the CompM4 include Aimpoint's Super ACET diode circuitry, allowing the sight to run constantly for up to 8 years on a single AA battery. All CompM4 sights feature an internal voltage regulator that allows the sights to operate on any AA size battery available worldwide. These sights also feature a 2 minute-of-angle (MOA) dot size, making them perfectly suited for use with Aimpoint's 3XMagnifier and Concealed Engagement Unit (CEU).
The CompM4 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, and features an extremely rugged and easy to use 16-position manual switch with 7 night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settings. The CompM4 sight body is designed to protect the optical and electronic components inside against hard use, and keeps the sight waterproof to 45 meters (150
feet).

- QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation, and lessen the chance of becoming snagged on other gear.

- Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring is required.
- 500,000 hours of use on NVD setting 
- 2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
- Matches perfectly with Aimpoint 3XMag, (magnifier module).
- Unequalled light transmission.

It has only 8 rounds fired through it and has been kept in a safe over the years. It has been pumped very few times. There is an ever so slight handling blemish (see picture) on the front of the barrel. The folding stock can be removed and the gun can be used in a pistol grip only configuration. It has a factory mag tube that holds 7+1 in the chamber. It also has the capability to ghost load, allowing you to hold 7+1 in the chamber and +1 on the carrier. In case you're not familiar with this gun it is one of the few guns ever made that can shoot either pump or semi auto mode. These guns have not been imported for 20 years so you are not going to find this in your local shop or at a gun show. This gun is priced to move...get it while you still can!

In response to the need for smaller and lighter tactical sights, Aimpoint is proud to introduce the new Micro T-1 electronic red-dot sight. Built to offer the same battleproven ruggedness as larger Aimpoint sights, the Micro T-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon.

This new compact sight is suitable for use on rifles, carbines, shotguns, submachineguns and handguns. The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics. The Micro T-1 weighs in at only 3.6 ounces, and comes complete with a patent-pending integral Picatinny mount that is keyed into the sight body to absorb recoil.

The Micro T-1 is a 1X (non magnifying) parallax-free optic that features a 4 minute of angle (MOA) red dot for fast target acquisition. No tools are required to zero the sight, as the top of the caps covering the windage and elevation screws fit directly into holes on the adjustment screws to make the adjustment. The Micro T-1 is waterproof to 25 meters (80 feet) and tough enough to stand up to the worst field conditions. Optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, the Micro T-1 features a manual adjustment switch with 6 night vision compatible settings and 7 daylight settings (including one extra bright setting for use in desert sunlight or with laser protection filters). Aimpoint s state-of-the-art ACET diode technology allows the Micro T-1 to operate continuously for over 5 years on a single CR-2032 battery(May come as Duracell DL2032 or Energizer ECR2032).

People who have bought these in the past have used them to: store valuables while boating/canoeing because they float, store loose ammunition,  keep valuables from being exposed to inclement weather, camping (one guy puts all his dirty knives, forks, and spoons  in one of these with hot water and Dawn dish detergent and shakes his silverware clean. He claims it works. I never tried it). I have one on my atv to keep things clean and dry when out in the mud or inclement weather. Makes a great tool kit for an atv.Like I said, you can find a way to use these things to keep your things dry and out of the elements. I have eight of these left at the present time."
