High Standard had a close relationship with Sears, to the point where the Sears decision to stop selling firearms seriously damaged the High Standard Company and contributed to its demise. 
Researching the Higgins Model 80 is best done by researching the High Standard M-101. The Model 80 is a M-101, with the Sears brand stamped in place of the High Standard.
The Duramatic .22 semi-auto pistol was designed as a low cost plinker and informal target shooting pistol. One interesting feature was the easily removable barrel (something High Standard designed into most of their .22 autos). Production began in 1954 as the M-100, with a barrel mounting change in 1957 resulting in the model change to M-101.
The Sears Model 80 is the High Standard M-101, so the earliest it could have been sold in Sears stores was 1957. Sears dropped the JC Higgins name in favor of Ted Williams in 1961, which limits the sale run of Model 80’s to 1957 thru 1961. Given leftover stock, that means a 4-5 year period of retail sales on the JC Higgins Model 80. Not a long run!

The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

Excellent condition. Maybe 40 rounds through this gun. Works Perfect!

Weighing an incredible 6 lbs., the Ultra Light is arguably the lightest 12 ga. semi-automatic shotgun ever produced. The Ultra Light sports a featherweight alloy receiver, shortened magazine tube and a unique raised target rib made from the same super light, super strong carbon fiber employed in Formula 1 racecars. However this new Benelli is no lightweight when it comes to standing up to punishment. Chambered to shoot anything from field loads to 3 magnums, the Ultra Light features a two-lug rotating bolt head that locks up steel-to-steel inside the barrel. Powered by Benelli’s tried and proven Inertia Driven® bolt system the Ultra Light will hold up year after year through thousands of rounds without missing a beat, but that’s not all. Whether you’re slugging it out in wet New England grouse cover or a scorching hot dove field south of the border, you won’t have to worry about the Ultra Light’s beautiful walnut stock. Both the stock and fore-end are sealed with a five-step process called WeatherCoat™. This new coating makes it impervious to any kind of weather and as a bonus, this special stock finishing process also enhances the fancy figure of the wood. No matter if you’re in those long pheasant fields in South Dakota or after scaled quail running through the cactus, if your average hunting day is measured in miles, check out the new 6 lb. Ultra Light at your Benelli dealer or for more information go to BenelliUSA.com.

***I can also switch stocks out to an equally nice straight grain stock, also the 700 Classic 1985 issue, for 150 dollars less than this one.***

HUNT INDIANA with a 700 Remington bolt action repeater in an EASILY formed round, from any mag belted brass. Dies are any factory reloading dies you pick up plus 50 to have the gunsmith alter to the round.

NOT as big as the WSM wildcats but easily matches 358 winchester velocities of 26-2700 fps with deer weight bullets. An EASY 200 yard (250 if you know your range) indiana legal deer round without needing heavy reforming brass knowledge needed. 

Shove them through the form and trim die, cut off, full length resize and trim to 1.790 (1.8 legal 2012).

Plenty of energy for bigger deer species of elk and moose with appropriate bullets and ranges. More than enough for black bear for anyone who may travel BUT>....LEGAL FOR HUNTING DEER IN INDIANA.

F-Marked Front sight base
Optional chrome lining

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.

REVOLVER RHINO - 2"" barrel, Black finish
Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

I would be willing to trade my Kahr MK9 for your Kahr PM40, MK40, CM40, or pay you $6000 for your PM40 or MK40, and $500 for your CM40. The pistol must have a stainless slide, or black stainless slide and look in next to new condition like it was well cared for. I am not interested in any other models with longer grips and/or barrels. I am a CHL holder and have no problem with signing a bill of sale for your gun if that’s what you’d like. 

The reason I want to buy a used Kahr pistol, and not a new one, is because I want to know that it WORKS 100% reliably. We can meet at a local firing range and I’ll provide the ammo and pay the range fee. Just mention to me which kind of ammo your pistol seems to work best with. If your pistol can fire off 75 rounds without a hitch, I'll hand you the cash. It will cost you nothing except a little bit of your time. I own numerous pistols that can each fire off 75 rounds without a hitch including my Kahr MK9, so hopefully somebody owns a Kahr PM40, MK40, or CW40 capable of the same performance. Feel free to go look up my user name ""flitepac"" on both the Gunbroker and Ebay websights. I do business right and have a combined 15 years 100% positive feedback at both places. I'm not interested in any other pistols except perhaps a Walther PPS40 which I would offer $500. Thanks, Randall"

The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired.  The accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. The P-01 is the only NATO-spec pistol on the market that is available to the public. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability:  The U.S. Army ""Mean Rounds Between Failure"" (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!"

Blackhole Weaponry Barrels employ the use of 416R, match grade stainless steel. BHW Barrels specialize in Polygonal rifling; The shape of the lands and grooves are based on a circle, so there are no sharp corners or edges for the bullet to conform into. This means there is a tight seal and thus less bullet deformation. This rifling form is unique in its ability to allow the bullet to be centered and fully supported by the barrel’s bore.This arc shaped rifling has long been held in very high regard for its accuracy, increased velocity, reduced gas cutting and ease of cleaning.

Receiver is American Made, D.C. Industries which is a contract for Century Arms like Elk River Machine Co. Very heavy gauge receiver. No Scratches or blemishes. There is some very minor repaired pitting on muzzle brake, but its an ORIGINAL russian krinkov brake, and barrel is threaded so you can easily unscrew and put on a slant brake or Izzy Brake.

This is DIFFERENT FROM DRACO!, Draco uses the shorter Gas Tube so it Will Have both sets of hand guards! This Uses the STANDARD length AK Gas Tube/Piston so the tube is almost as long as barrel, so has thicker tube with no hand guard, yes They come this way.
