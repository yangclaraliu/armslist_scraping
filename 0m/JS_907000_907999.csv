*Important* -Has some minor wear/scratches but nothing deep. Some were dabbed with a flat black paint pen (removable) -Factory Stock is not included. -Barrel has some marring from sight removal but is not visible installed in the stock. -Receiver has some wear/scratches from installation due to the tight fit and current finish Ruger uses on blued rifles as of late. Was going to polish it or dura coat it personally but I need money for school -A thread on the original buffer tube extension may have been stripped slightly (these come cheap though).

Misc - Blue loctite is recommended on Take Down Screw/Hand guard screws/AGP Screws. It can easily be degreased. -Replaced screw on Muzzle Brake with an actual steel screw. Will send an extra.

This gun was valued at $750.00 in 2007 at a gun show right after my dad died and left it too me. Since then I have added leupold scope rings and the Barska scope. I have kept it cleaned and oiled and in a humidity controlled gun safe. This rifle is Top of the line, and as we all know, it doesn't get much better than Mr. John Browning's firearms.

Will sell both bundles together for a discounted price of $395 or will sell the bundles separately, the xbox bundle for $315 and the Wii bundle for $115, but not splitting it up more than that so don't ask. I've lowered the price way under what its worth used.

You won't find a bundle/bundles this size for this low anywhere and you couldn't buy it all at gamestop for anywhere close to my price either. Due to a recent family crisis I need the money to help out in anyway that I can and Im not a gamer anymore so all of this is just taking up space.

Will sell both bundles together for $395 firm, will only meet around the cedar bluff or turkey creek area at a safe public place. 

No trades will be considered so don't ask. The prices are firm and non negotiable I've lowered the price way under what its worth so if you respond with an offer less than my asking price I won't reply. I'm wanting to sell asap

Will not let a stranger into my home to test out the consoles nor will I go into a strangers home to test them out. If you want to try the systems before you buy them bring a small tv and a way to supply power to it and the console. If you do that then your more than welcome to test everything, it all works flawlessly I just don't feel safe letting people I don't know into my home or going into the home of someone I don't know.

PMAG® 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE® Window, 5.56x45 Magazine

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately.

Sig Sauer P250 9mm. Bought it last week, found one mag yesterday but it was way to expensive for me to buy many of them. I have yet to even shoot this gun. 
I want to trade the gun, 2 mags and 100 rounds of Sellier & Bellot 115gr FMJ ammo (maybe more, depends). I was offered $500 cash from one person for JUST the gun and 1 mag, but, I just want to trade. I do NOT want to add cash to anything and I believe that a trade value of $520 is reasonable.  I don't care about holster wear or the bluing comming off. I care about functionality and reliablity.

I have other  calibers of ammo to trade. From 7.62X39mm to .410 shotshell and .22LR CCI ammo. I have listings for those also.
Please email or text me REDACTED. I'm Dave, I'm in Lakeland and will travel a short distance. Will sign a bill of sale, as will you be willing to. I have a valid FL DL.

For those who don't know, ""pre-agreement"" means this revolver has no lock for the cylinder as newer Smith & Wesson's do, circa 1994 and on.   This beauty accepts either .357 Magnum or .38 Special (regular and +P), features super rosewood grips by Altamont, a full velvet hone finish by Magnaport, a jeweled and polished trigger and hammer also by Magnaport, polished flute cylinders, ejection rod, inverted muzzle crown and dual barrel ports, all done by Magnaport as well.  It also comes with a new, buttery soft, custom full-grain Italian leather holster by Blackhawk.  

I inherited this revolver in it's current condition, it was purchased new and exactly 10 rounds total have been fired through it (by myself), post customization by Magnaport, just to make sure none of the finish work obstructed any function.  It fires perfectly and more than accurately, with greatly reduced recoil and muzzle flip due to the dual ports on the barrel.  This is a perfect sidearm for CCW, home defense, or just about any other application a person can need.  

The only reason I'm selling is to re-invest in a platinum Sig Sauer 1911 to match the other one that I already own.  This revolver will ship in it's own hard-sided case, complete with holster, original grips, original paperwork and Magnaport custom paperwork (totaling $450) and a new cleaning kit with Ballistol cleaning wipes.  I'm a firearm collector/enthusiast, I know what I'm talking about and don't false advertise.  If you have any questions, feel more than free to email me, and I will reply promptly.  

I will consider trades.  I'm mostly interested in Sig Sauer or Kimber full-size 1911's at the moment, have a few and absolutely love them.  I'll consider decent offers as well, let's talk!  If you're looking for a nice piece for your significant other, guarantee she'll like this."

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is a .40 S&W caliber.

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is a .40 S&W caliber.

This is XM855 specification ammo with the SS109 penetrator bullet. The SS109 is a 62 grain projectile with a lead core and a steel penetrator designed for combat use.

XM855 ammo features a 62 grain, copper jacketed, lead core, steel tip bullet. It is not armor piercing ammunition, but the steel tip does allow it to penetrate farther than other types of ammo. This bullet will attract a magnet because of the steel in the tip, and some ranges will not allow you to use it because of this. However, it will not damage the barrel of your rifle, because the steel is entirely covered by a layer of copper.

The ammunition itself is extremely high quality, and has features not seen on other ammunition of this type. This ammo has a crimped primer, reducing the chances of a blown primer stopping a semi-automatic, or automatic rifle from functioning. It also has a lacquer primer sealant and a case mouth sealant, to prevent the internal components from being compromised by moisture intrusion.

Federal offers a weather resistant ammo can containing 420 rounds of this ammunition. Composed of 14 30-round boxes containing three stripper clips of 10 rounds each, this product is ideal for those looking to store ammo long term, but who also want to be able to access and load it quickly

I bought this weapon with the idea of doing a tremendous amount of customization. I have decided that I need to concentrate on some other projects for now which is why I am selling this wonderful pistol. 

Included with the pistol is a Ruger factory holster that was about $80.00, although it is left handed and brand new condition. It comes with the original box with documentation and Hogue Mono Grips for when comfort is desired while firing heavy loads.

I prefer to sell to fellow CCW permit holders, but at a minimum I require a bill of sale between myself and the buyer.

It's in great shape with some minor wear on the side of the bolt and a few spots here and there...nothing serious. Bore is excellent. Also has a SideSaddle installed.

I usually have pics but can't get them posted up right away so the stock photo from the REMINGTON website will have to do.

No trades at this time, please."

This is a top-rated flat top rifle with solid components (check out the online reviews if you haven't heard of Windham - newer company but top notch rifles with lifetime warranty).  

This gun comes with a sling, hard case, and the standard 30 round mag.  Also available are 9 extra mags (five 30 round pmags and four 20 round thermold mags) if you're interested.

Several years ago, Bushmaster quality was declining, and so Windham Weaponry was started by many of the top Bushmaster owners/employees who wanted to produce the finest AR rifles in the country.

I like that they have taken the old Bushmaster AR and made it even better than it was before.  But the thing that sold me on this rifle is that there is the lifetime warranty, which can be transferred to a new owner, should you sell or trade the gun.  That says a lot in my book, when a gun company is so sure of their products, that they are willing to back them up forever against defects in materials and workmanship.  Check out the reviews online which speak plenty of praise for this rifle.

I could use a good spotting scope if you have one you would like to pair with something else to make it a more appealing offer.

I do not need to get rid of this gun so if the right deal does not come along I will keep this in the safe, I am wanting to trade it as I am really wanting a 1911. I would also consider a pistol in 10 mm like a S&W or Colt, I'm not to fond of Glock 10mm pistols.
Trade should be in the Hampton Roads area, FTF, with 2 forms of ID and we will do a bill of sale. So no felons."

797,http://www.armslist.com/posts/907797,For Sale:  Stainless AMT Backup 9mm $450,"longview, Southwest Washington, Washington",$ 450,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 23, 2013",Handguns,Arcadia Machine and Tool                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Stainless AMT Backup 9mm $450
This is the full 9mm, not the short (.380)  it's an AMT Backup, DAO in 9mm.  All stainless, I believe there's not a bit of plastic or rubber on it - even the grips are fiberglass. But I did put on a houge rubber grip, visible in the photos.  It's about as small as you can find in a 9mm, even some of todays compacts are bigger than this bad boy.  It weighs a ton, right about 21 ounces with a full mag (6 rounds).  
It's Double Action Only - hammer fired, which means it's got a trigger pull that's probably heaver than even the New York Glocks  - I believe the specs say this is 14 oz. I know it takes a very deliberate pull,  no hair triggers ere folks.  It's got all the original factory paperwork and box,  a spare mag, a very nice Don Hume molded IWB and a generic leather mag carrier.  And parts are still available if you should ever need them (HI-Standard bought out AMT, and still has a lot of stuff for these)

Like all brands, you'll find both good and bad reviews on the web, and this one is no different.  Personally I think the bad reviews are all crap. This thing is as crisp and clean as the day it was made, the machine work on it is top quality, and I didn't have one hiccup in the hundred rounds I've put through it.  It feeds everything I've put in it with no issues, it shoots straight - every time,   there's no safties or even a hold-open so it's got very very few moving parts.

If it were a couple ounces lighter I might keep it,  but I went for an ankle carry and this is just too heavy for wear like that.    It does fit great at the 4:00 position, but at 6 rounds I'm reluctant to make it my primary.

All this can be yours for the low - low cash price of $450,  Trades considered,   I'm always looking for 9's 40's and 45's in compact and subcompacts.  HK, SIG, Glock, SW, and so on,  with cash to make up the difference"
