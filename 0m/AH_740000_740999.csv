The HK High-Reliability 30rd Steel Magazine is the Mercedes of AR-15 magazines! It has a well executed design, special attention to production tolerances, a steel magazine housing and follower and a proprietary HK ""Maritime"" anti-corrosion coating. It is considered by users in elite US military and law enforcement units as the best AR-15/M-16/M4 magazine in the world. In US military testing, the HK magazine improved feeding reliability by 30-50% overall. The Maritime coating easily surpasses the US MIL-STD-810 E salt fog test. During this test the magazines were exposed to a 100 hour salt fog and then stored three days at ambient temperature. After this procedure each magazine was fully loaded and fired twice with no problems. The superior function was validated during three separate tests by the British MoD in arctic, jungle, and desert environments during the firing of more than 1/2 million rounds,

I had this custom built as a .308 sniper platform but have never had an opportunity to break it in.  This is a Noveske N6 Lower with an Armalite National Match lower parts kit.  The NM trigger is very nice.  Magpul PRS stock and DPMS hand rest grip.  The upper is a free floated Armalite AR10T with Armalite BCG and a Harris Bipod.  The scope is a Bushnell Elite 4200 which has been bore sighted and is ready for the range.  This is top of the line quality and a sound investment.  Neither the lower or upper has seen one round yet.  I'm including 2 twenty round, 3 twenty-five round and one five round magazine if you want to hunt in an area that has a capacity limit.  The five round mag is quite rare and not easy to come by although in the future it may be all that you can find.  The mags are all Armalite and have never been loaded.  I'll include 200 rounds of magtech .308 as well as 215 unfired, unprimed brass cases and a hard shell gun case with the deal.  This package should shoot sub MOA without any difficulty.
I'm looking for $4750 cash but I'd consider payment by Paypal with you covering the surcharge if you need to use a Credit Card.  I'll give priority to a cash offer.  I can meet in North Seattle or perhaps a bit further if we can agree to a location.  Not interested in trades at this time.

(I have been told by a Luger dealer that a correctly numbered clip can be had, which is logical if you know the Luger numbering system.)  There is even an 86 on its firing pin, reciprocating mechanism and each wood grip just to mention what I remember.  This is a WWII war trophy passed down to me over 40 years ago. The inspectors numbers are IV 154 and S 92 as best I can tell. There is pitting on the barrel and left side plate. Local guns store owner said it was 65%. The bore is dull from the type of ammunition of its day and looks okay but not pristine. I have shot it and it functions properly.  This is a legitimate war trophy taken from a German who must have fought and not a staff officer.  As a war trophy it has never been registered to anyone.

I prefer to sell to a fellow Coloradoan to avoid the FFL, shipping hassles and costs.  Since this is over 50 years old I would consider sales direct to a C&R FFL holder under my terms.  I have many pictures and the sale is final.

Disclosure:  With the new Colorado law I don't know if come July 1 even black powder guns will have to be sold via a Federal Firearms License holder.  I'd move quickly with all Colorado firearms purchases as they will soon all be recorded on the dealers books (ATFE has access to all FFL holder records) you will have to complete a 4473 and have a background check currently costing $10 and pay something to the dealer."

Inglis reportedly (The Browning Hi-Power Automatic Pistol book) made 151,816 of these in the Mark I and Mark II patterns. Approximately 50,000 Mark 1's as this is, were made under what is called the Chinese contract, however few if any went to the Chinese because of WWII demand for side arms. The Mark I's are differentiated from the Mark II's by the slotted grip to accept a shoulder stock and the adjustable tangent sight versus the driftable only blade sight. The Mark I's are said to be in the most demand. You should understand that ATFE says that only the original stock that looks like the ones used with C-96 Mauser (aka broomhandle) is legal to attach to the pistol. All reproductions are not.

Due to the risks, costs and hassles of interstate handgun sales, I'm offering this to a fellow Colorado resident only.  I will be open to discussing otherwise.

The Democrats control Colorado legislature and governorship with pending laws to make all private sales illegal.  The cost to purchase and time delay in taking possession will only go up should (and probably will) occur.  Don't hesitate.

Before the illogical gun grabbers make private sales require a background check, sales only through gun dealers and only 10 round magazines you need to act now to obtain this set up that has never been sold through a dealer."

Selling my nearly new Olympic Arms AR16 AR15 A3 (Flat top/Detatchable carry handle) with heavy profile barrel.  Manufactured in 2005 and listed as Multi Caliber.  This is chambered in .556 so it is good to go for .223 as well.  This has less than 50 rounds fired but looks new inside and out.  The fit and finish are like new and tight with no wobble between the upper and lower.  Trigger pull is very nice as well.  I've upgraded the furniture with a Magpul MOE fore grip and stock.  The grip is an Ergo and very comfortable.  I'm including 3 new 30 round P-Mags.  Two of which are still in the wrapper.  As soft sided case and basic sling are included as well.  I'm also including the original factory furniture.
I'm looking for $1375 Cash.  I would consider payment by PayPal if you need to use a Credit Card.  You can cover the PayPal premium.  I'm available to meet in North Seattle but could travel a little ways if we can agree on a location.

 Just completed refinishing and tune up  by well known and famous local Gun Smith Ricky Evans. He is a very thorough going and meticulous craftsman who still uses 8 tanks in the re-bluing process.
I have not shot the gun since the refinishing was completed due to bad weather, but I will shoot it as soon as I can. Before it was a very sweet shooting revolver and I`m sure it will be even better now.
This gun is a very nice looking Colt you can be proud of. It can be used and enjoyed as it was meant to be without having to worry about messing up a ""too valuable collector`s item"".
It is very well priced and ready to shoot, and you can be the first one to put a turn ring on it."

I also bought a couple pocket holsters and an XS front sight a few months later. After I installed the XS front sight I realized that the front sight post was a little 'off', so I sent it back to Ruger. They sent me a brand new gun, but not before I fell in love with the idea of getting a shotgun and a good friend sold me his LCP for super cheap.  So now I have a BRAND NEW .357 LCR for sale, just picked up from my LGS yesterday.   I also have a pocket holster (desantis superfly, worn once just to try it out) and a brand new XS dot sight shipped separately from Ruger for sale as well.  Send me an email at REDACTED if you're interested or would like more pictures or information.  I live in central ohio but I may be able to drive out and meet you halfway."

Up for sale is my rare, numbers-matching Norinco Hunter model, in excellent condition.  This model was imported without a bayonet mount or blade, cleaning rod holder / rod, nor sling mounts.  It looks cleaner and weighs less than a standard SKS.  It came from the factory this way, and I have only seen information / pics of this model on the internet.  The rifle's finish, barrel, and chrome-lined bore are in great condition.  This rifle has the preferred screwed-in barrel, not the weaker pinned barrel to receiver type fitting.  The trigger pull is quite nice; better than a Kivaari-modified trigger I compared it to on another SKS.

Additional features:

The rear sight blade has been replaced with an adjustable aperature (peep) type, for faster and more accurate sight alignment.  

A 4X scope on a Leapers mount, that HOLDS ZERO because it fits tightly, using only the dust cover take-down pin (the four side screws are included, but not used since they aren't needed, and damage the rifle's finish).  The standard dust cover is also included.

Two tested and functional 30 rd. high-capacity magazines, and ten stripper clips for loading the rifle.

Tapco six-position polymer stock with optics rail on upper hand guard and storage space in the SAW-type pistol grip.

My price is $685, face to face in N. Austin.  I'm not desperate to sell, so please don't make lowball offers (they will be ignored).  Trades for one or more firearms, +/- cash  may be possible (mostly ""tactical"" weapons or target guns), but I'm not very interested in typical hunting rifles or hunting shotguns, antiques, etc.  No archery equipment, computers, jet skis, etc.  Serious buyers will provide me with a (local) phone number if they want to talk in person.  I won't give out my number unless I can contact you at yours (too many spammers & scammers).

Thank you."
