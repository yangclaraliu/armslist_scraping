These guns are excellent for younger shooters or plinking, and with the beauty of the Nomad stock making it appear like an HK G36, it's a 22 that turns heads. 

Even though it's a .22 I've literally only fired just under 200 rounds. It's barely been used as I've not had the time at all to enjoy it ( hence selling it ).

As listed, it comes in the Nomad stock with an EoTech clone. It'll also come with the 10/22 stock 10 round magazine and a ruger brand 25 round magazine, as well as the magazine that came with the stock ( Though I majorly prefer the ruger brand mags over the stock's. It's more for aesthetics I figure ).

10/22's alone are just under 300$, but you're getting 250$ in accessories basically for free. I think this is more then a fair price.

I have the original bill of sale for the rifle, a VA state license and a CCW permit. 

I will only sell in person VA STATE RESIDENTS with a valid VA license, though a CCW is always a plus. A private transfer bill of sale is also required.

I will only sell out of state if it is done through a FFL transfer.  However, shipping costs are entirely on you ( around 20$ through fedex is what I normally see for this size/weight ). 

The shotgun pictured above is also for sale - never fired Mossberg 500. Comes with soft case, about 20 rounds of ammo and the shell mount ~ 250$. Feel free to contact me regarding it through this ad or its own in the shotgun section.

***** I have received an OVERWHELMING amount of replies concerning both of these guns. I will respond to emails as fast as I can or until they are sold. I'm probably going to have to go to a first come, first serve rule. First person that can meet me fastest is going to get the sale. ******"

I'm selling a Mossberg 500 Pistol Grip with a soft case, about 20 rounds of ammo the shell mount. This shotgun has never been fired. Not a single round through it. I bought it for home defense but ended up getting a Mossberg 590 a few months later, so I don't need two. 

I have the original bill of sale, VA state license and CCW permit, so buy with confidence. 

I require that the buyer be a VA state resident with a VA state license and preferably also a CCW permit, though not required. 

I will only sell out of state if done through an FFL transfer. Shipping is entirely on the buyer, however.

As for the rifle in the picture, that is a Ruger 10/22 in a Nomad stock that I'm also selling. I have it's listing in the rifle section if you're interested. Over 550$ worth of stuff, listed at 300$. Extremely low round count for a .22 ( under 200 rounds ). Feel free to contact me through this listing regarding it or through its own listing in the rifle section.

***** I have received an OVERWHELMING amount of replies concerning both of these guns. I will respond to emails as fast as I can or until they are sold. I'm probably going to have to go to a first come, first serve rule. First person that can meet me fastest is going to get the sale. ******"

up for sale is a Colt MK IV Series 70 Government Model in 45 acp in satin nickel aka colt guard finish. according to colt experts this is a factory blemish gun as there are a few tool marks on the rear of the slide between the rear sight and the hammer and it was then finished in the satin nickel.  im told by the same colt experts that this gun was supposed to be a blued gun originally by the serial number but since they blemished the gun at the factory they made it satin nickel and sent it out that way.

This rifle was purchased during the nationwide AWB and now that I live in Texas I really don't have to have a true pre-ban piece of gear. It has about 350 gentle rounds through it and shoots great. There were no combat training maneuvers performed or animals harmed during the shooting of this rifle. I shot it right after I purchased it from another AR15.com member and then it became a safe queen. Thank you for looking.

Rifle is in excellent condition for its age, 90%+, may be unfired but has several decades of sitting in a safe so its not ""new"" as it has minor blemishes in wood near receiver and butt stock plate, it looks like this is more of the finish flaking due to age rather than damage to the wood.  

Brass forearm cap and butt stock plate are tarnished from 40+ years of exposure to air in safe.

Imperfections can be easily corrected, but I did not want to polish or re-finish wood or remove oxidation on brass in case new owner wants to let it remain in ""as-is"" condition.

The Medusa utilizes an ingenious, patented 6-fingered ejector rod and a unique 2 stage forcing cone arrangement built into the chambers to center widely different length rounds. Designed to chamber, fire, and extract 25 different cartridges (actually 117, if you count every one ever made, but only 25 were claimed) in the .380/.38/9mm/.357 ammunition range (just about any handgun round with a bullet diameter between .0355 and .0357 inches) can be loaded, fired with remarkable accuracy and ejected without the benefit of moon clips or other special accessories"

These were designed by the Hungarians for use in tanks and close quarter battles. As you can see it has the very cool skeletonized side folding stock so it is handy for home protection or easily stored away for future use. 

I have owned several AK47s over the years and they are still the most dependable and durable weapons for SHTF situations. They function well in sub zero climates and desert sands, as well as swamps and jungles.  I can still do a face to face sale in Iowa if you show ID and shipping to an FFL in most states is about 35.00. This sale of this compliant rifle will be in accordance with state and federal laws. I can only sell to an out of state buyer through an FFL in that state.
 I do not need to sell it and it will only increase in value so the price is firm but I may also trade for a 8-10k generator. 

Attention: Liberal politicians said before the election that they would try to take our guns away and more than half the population voted for that. They do keep some promises and are working on global bans right now disguised as sustainability policies?  Guns have been used to free hundreds of millions more people than they were used to kill.

The butt stock and handguard upper and lower are black polymer / used, plus I'm throwing in a smooth dust cover that I found that has the same serial number digits. The basic 922r compliance parts are included: U.S. piston / Tapco G2 single hook trigger group / Tapco muzzle brake and a Red Star Arms retainer plate (to replace the wire hook). That adds up to 5 of the compliance parts (maybe six, depending on how you look at it), so the polymer stock set or pistol grip is the variable you can decide on to match your tastes. The stock set included does not indicate the country of origin or manufacture. No receiver included, since this is a kit build and no FFL is required, but you can pick up a flat or an 80% receiver for cheap, or a serialized completed receiver for less than $100 on GunBroker.

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 58.
 * The VZ 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 58 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47.

Please ask any questions, used but in mint condition! Will ship and will take paypal. This sight is selling out most places and retails for well over $100, get it from me and avoid save on taxes too!

The A.R.M.S.® Stand Alone Flip-up sight, utilizes the same well proven concept as the rear sight on the SWAN® Sleeve system. The unique design of the spring loaded rear sight, ensures constant battery action and repeat zero. The sight is held in the locked down position by a quick release lever, that prevents the sight from being accidentally engaged, but is as fast as a trigger to release even with arctic mittens. The initial elevation zero utilizes the standard M16/M4 front sight bead. When the sight is released into battery the 250-300 meter aperture is ready for immediate close combat use.

For longer ranges the leaf sight aperture is rotated to access the 500-600capability with the built in horizon line feature that helps lead distant targets and lets the shooter square the rifle to counter windage offsets, if the rifle is inadvertently tilted. Other type rear iron fold-down sights require the shooter to push it into position, which means they can be accidentally knocked down at the worst time. The A.R.M.S. spring loaded flip-up sights never let you down, because they're designed to always be there even when going thru brush or being dropped.

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556 offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

I am also open to trades as long as the value is equal.

I also have an Escort 12 Gauge Pump action shotgun (also like new) I am selling for 200. I will sell separately or together. The pics below are not of the actual guns (but are the same models), but I do have pics upon request I can send by text or email.
