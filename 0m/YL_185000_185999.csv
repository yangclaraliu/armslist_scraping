There is a slight discoloration on the very back of the slide, left side. There are no other issues except an occasional FTF (not a jam) that is easily remedied by a sling-shot racking of the slide to load the round that failed to feed. Since I have only shot approx. 50-75 rounds through this handgun, this should resolve itself after a more appropriate break-in of a couple hundred rounds or so, I'm told. Sale includes a second 6+1 round magazine that didn't come with the original purchase (a $26 addition).  Also includes a Tagua leather IWB holster. Buyer must complete the sales transaction at a licensed arms dealer or gun shop and is responsible for any transfer fees.
Thanks for considering."

Like new condition.
This is the hunting version of the Model 1200 with the longer barrel.

The Model 1200 is the original heavier build model
 that latter was produced as the lighter, cheaper Model 1300.

It was used by US Marines and US Army soldiers in Vietnam, as a supplement to the Ithaca Model 37s and Remington 870s. 
It was a successful design and was also adopted in a police riot model for many departments across the United States. 
Though the shotgun was well received, Winchester wanted to develop a 'cheaper' shotgun...(Model 1300).

This shotgun has been used perhaps fewer than 20 times.  It was treated with silicone spray.  And has been in storage many years.  And now appears to be in pristine, new, unused condition.

Location is south central Saskatchewan.

Very few rounds appear to have been fired and there are no blemishes. Has SigLite night sights factory night sights (still very bright) and an internal guide rod laser (LaserMax). Comes with two magazines and blue Sig storage box.

Date of manufacture 28-Dec-2009.

Asking price: The Blue Book puts the value at $725.00 not including the SigLite night sights and LaserMax guide rod laser (an additional $275.00 minimum). I will sell the Sig as outfitted for $800.00.

The Sig Sauer P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as Sig's entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy Seals, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full size pistol easy to handle with its longer barrel yielding better ballistic performance and accuracy.

I have had it up to Delaware twice, put about 200 rounds through it, and decide I want to move on. The Sig is a great piston-driven alternative to the AR platform, and comes standard with a folding stock. Awesome to shoot- but I won't have time to shoot for a while, and would rather direct the funds to other projects (not to mention, save the room in the safe!) It's in stellar shape, no marks or scratches, etc. New, this setup would cost you over $1200 after tax. Looking to get $1000... about 20% off of retail, and face to face keeps the taxes out of the equation. Wouldn't mind a fast sale... I'm going to be out of town a lot in the next few weeks."

The serial number dates to 1948. It has a 6"" barrel with patridge front sight and adjustable rear sight. Action is silky smooth with just very minor movement of cylinder in lockup that does not affect the functionality of the gun. Serial numbers matching on frame, cylinder, and barrel.

The extras are the following:
Fore-grip- very comfortable for rapid fire, which is very fun with this gun
Compensator/flashhinder- it offsets the almost nonexistent recoil
Mag coupler for the stock- 20 rounds of +P attached to the stock at all times 
Sling- I had one that fit it perfectly
4x32 Scope- MilDot recticle, nitrogen filled
Extra Mags- 3 15 round clips. I think one more would almost be overkill
Flashlight for the under rail- I'm almost tempted to keep it because its so damn good
AR Case- it fits perfectly with everything and it has pouches for 5 mags

It's a great plinker, cool indoor shooter, or cheap 100~ yard gun. Thank god for the 9mm Luger There's enough rails and durable, economical plastic to make it perfect for anything, reliable, and comfortable to shoot.

Took it to the range to sight in the new burris fullfield II 3x9x40 scope. At 100 yds all three shots were touching. That is as good as my model savage 10FCP sniper rifle will do. It is by far the most accurate hunting rifle I've ever owned. I did take one 6 point with it last year. I am primarily a bowhunter and rarely do any rifle hunts. It has the synthetic stock, Burris fullfeild II 3x9x40 scope, sling, and ammo holder on the butt stock. I will throw in a couple boxes of winchester 150gr ammo the rifle is sighted for, and a camo soft case. I really hate to see it go, but times are hard, and I could use the extra cash. If you aren't familiar with the savage accutrigger, it is IMOHO the best trigger system bar none. I have two other savages with the accutrigger that will shoot with the best of them. 
Rifle is in like new condition with new scope, been in the woods once. If interested please call REDACTED ask for jody."

Very good condition and EXTREMELY accurate

I have a Sig trailside chambered in .22 LR that is extremely accurate, fun and fast!  The Sig trailside by Hammerli is one of the most accurate .22 target pistols made (especially for this price range).  All trailsides were factory tested with 5 shots at 25 meters to ensure the pistol was accurate enough.  I have the actual test paper that has the matching serial number to my gun so you may see the results (each shot touched another).  

The slide is perhaps one of the smoothest I've felt on a pistol and the trigger is nice and light.  This gun is way too much fun and with the practically nonexistent recoil can be enjoyed by anyone!  

Please e-mail me with any questions!!!  Can send pics upon request.  Could be interested in trades... Good scopes for mid-long range 100-500 yards for AR-15 (Leupold Mark AR, VX3, Bushnell Elite, etc...)

Make: Colt 

Model: Double Eagle 

Serial Number: DA21857 

Year of Manufacture: 1990's 

Caliber: .45 ACP 

Action Type: Double Action / Single Action Semi Auto Pistol 

Markings: The left side of the slide is marked ""Colt Double Eagle / - MK II / Series 90 -"". The right side of the slide is marked ""Colt Double Action"". The right side of the frame is marked ""Colt's Pt. FA., Mfg. Co. / Hartford, Ct. U.S.A. / DA21857"". The left trigger guard shows the proof mark and a ""2"". The right side of the trigger guard shows a ""1"". 

Barrel Length: 5"" 

Sights / Optics: The gun is mounted with a 3-dot sight system. The front sight is a single dot and is fixed. The rear 2-dot sight is set in a dovetail. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock(s) is/are checkered plastic. The checkering is sharp, but there is wear to the checkering on the left panel and a heavier wear mark on the right panel behind the bottom screw 

Type of Finish: Stainless 

Finish Originality: Factory Original 

Bore Condition: The rifling is sharp and bright with just a bit of fowling in the grooves at the breech. There is no erosion. 

Overall Condition: This gun retains about 90% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows some dulling (storage wear) from the box and some freckles of surface rust on the underside matte surfaces of the gun and in the slide serrations. These should cleanm, as this is a stainless gun. Otherwise, the gun is very sharp with just a few scatterred surface marks. The Screw heads are sharp. The markings are crisp. Overall, this gun rates in about Very Good - Fine condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions well, though we have not test fired this gun. 

Box & Accessories: The gun comes with its original box, but no paperwork. One 8-Round Colt magazine is included. 

Our Assessment: The Colt Double Eagle is a double-action / single action, semi-automatic pistol manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company between 1989 and 1997. The design of the Double Eagle was based on the Colt M1911 pistol. Magazines are single stack and are identical to magazines shipped with the 1911. Most of the Double Eagle models were available in stainless steel only. The slide used a version of Colt's series 80 locking firing pin safety, but unlike Colt's series 80 pistols, the Double Eagle Officer's model in .45 ACP held an 8 round magazine. Here is finally your chance to stick with an American Double Action Semi Auto Pistol"

Make: Colt 

Model: Double Eagle 

Serial Number: DA21857 

Year of Manufacture: 1990's 

Caliber: .45 ACP 

Action Type: Double Action / Single Action Semi Auto Pistol 

Markings: The left side of the slide is marked ""Colt Double Eagle / - MK II / Series 90 -"". The right side of the slide is marked ""Colt Double Action"". The right side of the frame is marked ""Colt's Pt. FA., Mfg. Co. / Hartford, Ct. U.S.A. / DA21857"". The left trigger guard shows the proof mark and a ""2"". The right side of the trigger guard shows a ""1"". 

Barrel Length: 5"" 

Sights / Optics: The gun is mounted with a 3-dot sight system. The front sight is a single dot and is fixed. The rear 2-dot sight is set in a dovetail. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock(s) is/are checkered plastic. The checkering is sharp, but there is wear to the checkering on the left panel and a heavier wear mark on the right panel behind the bottom screw 

Type of Finish: Stainless 

Finish Originality: Factory Original 

Bore Condition: The rifling is sharp and bright with just a bit of fowling in the grooves at the breech. There is no erosion. 

Overall Condition: This gun retains about 90% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows some dulling (storage wear) from the box and some freckles of surface rust on the underside matte surfaces of the gun and in the slide serrations. These should cleanm, as this is a stainless gun. Otherwise, the gun is very sharp with just a few scatterred surface marks. The Screw heads are sharp. The markings are crisp. Overall, this gun rates in about Very Good - Fine condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions well, though we have not test fired this gun. 

Box & Accessories: The gun comes with its original box, but no paperwork. One 8-Round Colt magazine is included. 

Our Assessment: The Colt Double Eagle is a double-action / single action, semi-automatic pistol manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company between 1989 and 1997. The design of the Double Eagle was based on the Colt M1911 pistol. Magazines are single stack and are identical to magazines shipped with the 1911. Most of the Double Eagle models were available in stainless steel only. The slide used a version of Colt's series 80 locking firing pin safety, but unlike Colt's series 80 pistols, the Double Eagle Officer's model in .45 ACP held an 8 round magazine. Here is finally your chance to stick with an American Double Action Semi Auto Pistol"

I am wanting to trade this Walther P99C QA in perfect condition for a Walther PPS in similar condition. 
Furthermore to sweeten the deal I have decided to include the laser sight I purchased for this gun. The laser is an excellent and tiny Laserlyte V3 Micro, valued at approximately $100.

INCLUDED ITEMS:
WALTHER P99C .40S&W, 2nd GENERATION, ALL GERMAN MADE 
LASERLYTE V3 MICRO LASER SIGHT
Two Walther made 8 round magazines, one flat bottom, one with pinky grip  
Four spare batteries for laser
Four front blade sights
Two original butt plates of varying size
Original hard carrying case
Original owners manual and paperwork
Original factory cleaning jag
Original factory tools


More about this P99C:
This rare P99C is one of the rare all German made, second generation Quick Action models. The QA models feature Walther's unique 3 state trigger so often praised.
Most P99C .40 components were manufactured under license by S&W, unlike this gun. The barrel, slide and frame of all 100% German-manufactured P99Cs bear an ""Eagle over N"" proof mark of the German Proof House at Ulm. View the images of this gun to see the Eagle over N proof marks on each and every component. 

The gun has fired precisely 189 rounds during two trips to an indoor gun range and has been cleaned and cared for meticulously; a fact easy to see once you view the pictures.

This is honestly the best handgun I have ever owned and I greatly prefer it even to my H&K USP. The quality, fit and finish is unlike any other gun I have seen and is worlds better than the P99's with the Smith and Wesson manufactured barrel.
I am only trading this gun because I personally need a slightly smaller gun.

I am seeking a Walther PPS in any caliber in similar condition to this gun.

Pretty good shape for it's age. This is a model 2. It doesn't have the patent on the trigger. The trigger guard is blued. It has a 4 digit serial number with 98 a little offset. I believe the 98 is the manufacturing date. In 1898 the vest pocket safety hammer was upgraded to smokeless powder which would be why it might be date stamped, although that's just a W.A.G.
Nevertheless, I believe it was manufactured between 1898 and 1904.
The cylinder pin end is broken off but I still have it.
The grips have chips off the bottom corner.
I have a few rounds of ammo.
The revolver is fully functional, but have it checked by a gunsmith before you try to shoot it.

Some of these posts are downright comical...or criminal, whichever you look at it. I constantly flag posts for being over priced, but its not enough. I've been watching armslist decline for two years now. I think I've had enough of dealing with people that either want too damn much for their piece, or dealing with guys who will cut your legs out from under you to get your bottom dollar on an honest deal. Any decent moderation here has long since gone to hell, as I recognize posts from the same shady characters I've dealt with, over and over. Just seems worse as time goes on. Armslist is a great idea, but as with all good things, people just plain suck. And they will bring it down with them.

I'm positive any replies I get will be those I'm talking about, and I dont really give a damn. This will probably be the last post ever from me. I'd rather go through all the paperwork than keep getting screwed.

If you DO have what I'm looking for, and for a fair price, please let me know, and I'll be more than happy to do business with you. Thank you."

Included are the Pistol Scope Mount & Red/Green Dot Sight, and 2nd magazine with pinky extension.

I purchased this so my wife would go to the range with me more often. It worked, but now she wants a 38 revolver to carry. We both have CWP's.

We are looking for a nice 38 with a short barrel. She likes the looks of the Taurus 85 series, and REALLY likes the new Poly Model but it's a bit new to see here on trade.

She wants a model with a Hammer, as she likes to practice both SA & DA.

She might be interested in a 357 if it's light enough, or a 327.

Let me know what you have, and we can make a deal.

These guns were reworked from M.1943 Mauser rifles, and this one is accordingly stamped on the receiver, ""Fabrica De Armas La Coruna 1955"". The receiver displays a slightly fading Spanish crest. FR-8 was used for practice by Spanish soldiers before they were issued CETME assault rifles. The rifle has a fake gas tube installed under the barrel, to make it look like the CETME rifle. This fake gas tube is actually a cleaning kit container (the cleaning kit is not included). This gun has stronger, 1898-type action than FR-7, which was build on 1893-type action. Straight bolt handle. Stock with pistol grip. The stock does not display any markings. All matching serial numbers (the matching serial numbers are stamped on the receiver, barrel and on the bolt only; all the remaining parts do not display any numbers, which is correct for this model). CONDITION: Excellent, as rebuilt by Spanish arsenal. Most of phosphate finish is still on metal. Very nice stock has been filled in one place. Excellent bore with strong and shiny rifling. Strong action. All the internal parts of the rifle are in excellent condition, with little visible wear. Mechanically, the rifle is in great condition.

It's an old but good one. It was manufactured sometime between 1961 and 1978. The action is still very crisp. A good part of the bluing on the barrel has turned to patina and it has plenty of wear all over pistol.  The grips feel good in the hand but are plastic, not wood as the picture may suggest. This gun would be perfect for a tackle box, tool box, boat storage etc. It is nothing special, but it goes bang every time you pull the trigger, and if it gets scratched, beat up, or otherwise miss treated you don't have to get sick over it.
As with any gun in this condition and this old it is not 100% the pull pin cylinder release will no longer come out, fortunately there is a loading gate on the right side and a twig or other small rod like tool can be used to push the spent shells out the loading gate however, the cylinder still rotates freely so the CRITICAL functions of the gun are not impaired.  I am not partial to this firearm so please don't hesitate to make an offer, at the same time I'm not going to give it away for a song and dance..
If nothing else I can wait until one of my other ""ruff use"" guns finally gives up the ghost and replace it with this one.
