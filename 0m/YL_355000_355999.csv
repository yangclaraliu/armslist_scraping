Fluted Bull Barrel with long free float handguard and scope.

From Bushmaster webiste:Adapted from our very accurate and successful 24"" Varminter, the Predator Upper Receiver/Barrel Assembly's 20"" Fluted Extra Heavy Barrel is button rifled 1 x 8"" to stabilize the heavier 69-77 grain bullets that a predator hunter/caller would choose for bigger varmints and predators. This superb barrel features fluting for increased cooling and weight reduction; an 11 degree competition crown; 1"" diameter heavy profile under the handguard; custom match hybrid chamber with a tighter SAAMI Spec headspace from the shoulder of the chamber to the bolt face, and longer chamber throat or ""Leade"". This chamber accommodates 5.56mm ammunition without developing higher pressures encountered when firing 5.56mm ammo in a .223 chamber with shorter ""Leade"" (both calibers can be used safely). This Upper is sold complete with Bolt, Bolt Carrier and Charging Handle to ensure positive lockup between bolt and barrel extension. The Predator Upper also features a Vented Tubular Aluminum Free-Floater Forend with Bipod Stud (free-floats the barrel from the barrel nut forward) and B.M.A.S. 1/2"" Mini-Risers to add scope height for correct sight picture and comfortable cheek weld.

I will trade for 200 rounds of Winchester Ranger-T 147 gr
I will sell for $90 FTF Akron

Here is the explanation of the source of the ammo:

Guys, this is a Law Enforcement contract overrun. Federal HST, Winchester Ranger Bonded, and now Speer Gold Dot have all found their way to retail channels in this manner. It says not for LE use because it's it's supposed to be for the contract order and since the contract buyer is not taking them it is only to be used in retail channels and not used in any other contract or by any other agency. Each contract has a specific requirement they ask for in the order. The manufacturer would like to not risk an LEO using this round and having it be outside the department requirements and the blame going to the manufacturer for such a round being outside the department requirements for a duty load. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. The ""Not for LE use"" sticker is a save your butt liability sticker, so that if an LEO uses the round in a shoot, and after investigation it is deemed the ammo falls outside the very specific department requirements for velocity, they won't be liable for any damages because it was marked to not be used in that capacity."

Good condition Star PD.  Same size as a Commander-size 1911 so this would be an inexpensive way to try out carrying a 1911 style pistol to see if you like it before paying an arm and a leg.

Comes with:
-3 magazines
-2 holsters: 1 horsehide Crossbreed-type IWB, 1 nylon with snap closure and magazine pouch
-Wolff Springs replacement recoil springs and firing pin springs
-2 extra recoil spring guide buffer
-Owner's manual
-I also have some ammo to throw in for the right deal

*I posted the specs below if you're not familiar with the pistol.

It's in good shape for an older gun.  I've never had any failures with it except one light primer strike, but that was with reloaded ammo so I don't know which was at fault.  It has some holster ware, but the internals are strong and the walnut grips are in great shape.  

The previous owner milled out a bit of the front post and added some white paint to it and the rear sight so it has a nice 3-dot sight picture now instead of the black-on-black iron sight picture. (See second pic)

This is a brand new never fired Kahr CW40, it is a .40 cal, semi auto pistol in box with all paperwork unopened. It has 2 mags and houge grips. My fiance got it for me for my birthday (march 17th) and it is too small for my hand. I have rather large hands so if you have normal to small hands it will be perfect for you. I will also add in a box of 50 winchester silver tip hollow point defence rounds. I do not have a holster for this gun as I never used it. It is in perfect condition. She had a gunsmith do a feed ramp pollish on it for me as well. I feel bad for selling it but she told me to so I can get something that fits my hand. I am not going to trade it. I already have a pending deal on the gun that I want. I am marking it down at $350 so I can beat everyone else price on backpage. everyone else wants over 400 and they dont come with anything and they have prob, been shot to hell. If you want the gun I need to sell it by monday to get my gun, If not I am going to take it to cabelas or some other gus store to sell it for 400. I would rather it go to someone who will take care of it though. If you want it feel free to call or text matt at REDACTED Keep in mind you WILL be showing I.D. and you WILL be signing a bill of sale for the gun. I will NOT sell to anyone with a felony, also if you show up looking like a gang banger thug with your pants around your knees you will not be getting the gun."

Recrowning your barrel can increase accuracy in many cases, especially on banged-up hunting rifles and mil surplus rifles.  Re-crowning is when you make the muzzle of the barrel perfectly concentric to the bore so that all gasses explode evenly in all directions so as to not affect the flight of the bullet.

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semiautomatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. 

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ chrome lined button rifled barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. 

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m."

216,http://www.armslist.com/posts/355216,For Sale:  Tangodown Advanced Combat Bipod (ACB-4) in Flat Dark Earth,"Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North Carolina",$ 155,"Listed On: Sunday, April 1, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I got this for a rifle I ended up never using it on. It is out of the packaging, but this bipod is in excellent/like new condition. I'm asking $155 shipped. This bipod retails for $190 to $220.

The Advanced Combat Bipod features the following:

    Low Profile Design
    Built-in Cant and Traverse
    Silent Leg Release Mechanism
    Adjustable Legs

Standard Height: 8""
Fully Extended: 10 1/2""
Weight: 16 1/3 oz

Advanced combat bipod is designed specifically for the M16/M4 weapon families. Attached directly to the MIL-STD 1913 MWS (SOPMOD) rail system, no separate adapters necessary.

Bipod body - The clamp body and center portion are forged from 7075-T6 aluminum with Type III hard anodizing. The center portion has two pivots, to which the legs are attached. It will fit on any MIL-STD 1913 rail, using a clamp on the base that is secured by two stainless, black finish screws. An allen wrench or screwdriver can be used to install or remove the ACB. A black stainless button on the outside of each pivot releases and engages a sealed, pre-lubricated stainless steel locking mechanism, which allows the bipod legs to rotate 90° from stowed to deployed. It is locked in both positions and can only be released by puching the button. The center portion rotates for traversing and allows about 40° of angle. The whole bipod body can cant 15°. Urethane bushings keep the bipod center-favoured while allowing it to cant on uneven ground.

Legs - The legs are made up of two pieces - the inner and outer legs. The outer legs house the locking mechanism and button, and have 3 holes/detents which provide 3 height adjustments. The outer legs are made of a proprietary glass-reinforced nylon and are much tougher than they look (I was concerned early on in the design stage when I saw the inner legs, but tried to snap one and I couldn't. The ACB-4 has exceeded Army drop-test requirements). The inner legs are made of carbon-fiber reinforced nylon, and slide in and out of the outer legs. At the top of the inner leg is a button, which fits into the detents in the outer legs. The inner legs are extended by simply pulling them out. In order to shorten them, the button must be depressed and the leg slid in, where the button will engage the next detent. The feet are large to prevent sinking in sand and aggressively checkered for a good grip. When stowed, the bipod legs are locked along the rail system, fitting neatly between the lower and side rails."

It is also all numbers matching and has the bayonet and the gernade launcher with sights.  Both come with the complete kit which includes Leather pouch, cleaning kit, sling and oiler.  Both were still packed in cosmoline when I got them and after cleaning them up, I have put less than 30 rounds through each.  Both are very nice rifles and are getting harder and harder to find.  Would make a great addition to any collecter or shooters arsenal.  I also have some ammo for both that will come with them and the SKS has 7 strippers clips also.  Thanks for looking.  I will seperate them.  They are 450 each or 850 for the pair and I am firm on the price.  Might consider trade , but i am looking to buy a Ruger mini 30 so I perfer cash.  Thanks"

Now, you just found one for sale(because i'm not a serious collector.Ha,,Ha.LOL)
I rate the finish on the gun about 95% like new. Remember,this gun was make in 1999(13 years ago). Sitting around all time,didn't shoot much. Just put the Truglo night sight on recently ,which fiber optic and tritium inserted,this combination give you the same sight picture both daylight and night. This sight costs me $129(damn,sometimes i thought it made by gold,to expensive) I love this sight a lot,i have the original sights which came with the gun,too.

Just want to make it clear,nothing's wrong with this gun to force me selling it. All i want is pocket carry and the North American Arms NAA Guardian .32ACP is my "" Guardian "" right now. It will serve me as long as i'm still alive, until...i die or it's...stolen. Lol :-)

I posted the gun for sale once and i got a serious buyer, who wants to trade mine for his rare Ruger Mini14 stainless made a long time ago ( 1987 or ???) with $300 cash. He is one of nicest buyers who i've been contacted with, but...then, i decided not to trade because i love this gun so much, i can't live without it. And took the post off Armslist. Now, it's back. 

This is what i believe the best compact .45ACP ever made base on factors:  all metal made, fires .45ACP-firepower proven with little recoil (easy get back to target quickly after the 1st shot), compact grip for conceal carry but still feel comfortable in hand, accuracy, safe, reliability, durability, brand name, second strike option(DA/SA) if the primer is bad, easy to take down without tools to clean, ...I'm confident 100% to trust my life on this particular handgun. Don't believe me, bring the ammo, go to the range with me, i'll let you shoot it by all the positions you want. If the gun's malfunctioned by any kind, i'll give you $100.00 plus i'll pay you back the ammo. If it's eat anything and so accurate as tack-driver, no malfunctions occur, you lose your ammo and just give me $50.00 for my time.Ha...Ha Wanna gamble, guys...????? 

The best way to contact me is by phone, email is ok, but no guaranteed i can response your questions as quickly as by phone.

I suggest you do the same before making an offer. This is great as a collectors piece or a shooter. Would only conside a trade for an AR-15 plus cash (depending on what you have)

One more thing that really isn't that import to some but to others is everything. The BATF banned the importation of AK 47 barrels from any contry and any arms imported from China years ago and just about every AK 47 or AK 74 you run across these days is a parts kit built on a US made receiver. If it's not done right you will end up with problems...Century Arms is famous for questionable built AKs. The Polytech AK 47s on the other hand were completely built in China as as export model...semi-automatic rifle instead of full auto. So there isn't really any question about how well they work. Also most newer built AK 47 kits are not going to have a chrome lined barrel. The polytechs on the other hand came with factory chromed barrel like milspec AR-15s which adds to the demand. Bottom line, they don't make or import these anymore and if you want a higher quality build than most Aks the this is for you."

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force. Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun. A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot. a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

The small size and single stack mag makes this a very nice gun for concealed carry. Fits easily in a pocket and there are various holsters available.

You dont have to mess with the crappy sks highcap mags with this gun. Great alternative to a wasr-10 ak because it has a high quality norinco barrel and the inherent accuracy advantages of the sks which still maintaining ak level reliability. Originally intended to drop this in to a tapco t6 stock but never had the time. I have 0 rounds through this gun, it has very little wear on the internals and the stock is in perfect shape, which leads me to believe this didn't do much more than sit in a safe after the 1994 ban."

Barrel is chambered in .223 Wylde. This chambering wrings out the most accuracy of either .223 or 5.56 nato. It was designed by Wylde himself for competition for using either commercial based or Nato milspec ammo and shoot both extremely accurately. 
I have fired 20 rounds through the barrel and find myself in a bind. The Admas Arms piston Kit i used for a gas system loses too much pressure and cant reliably feed the rifle with the .223 wylde chamber which lowers pressure. So Barrel has to go...or if youre interested the Adams Arms has to go....either one so i can get what i need to get this rifle running right. Barrel is BRAND new stoner from Midway industries.

I love this pistol more than any 200 plus other guns i've owned and hate to sale, but i just started a new job and it'll be at least 2 more weeks until i get paid. So, i need to let her go, if not sold by 4/18/12, do not bother calling. What is comes with is 2 10 round glock mags, standard sights, a fobus molded paddle holster for 475. and before i get smart e-mails, you can not buy these near as cheap as you can a glock 17 or 22, they're closer to 550-600, also these are very hard to find so i should be asking more. Now, if you want this pistol i do have about 200 rounds of fmj 230 grain reloads that i've never had a probelm with, i'll throw 200 in for 50 bucks on top, so gun mags and holster 475, everything 525. ....sorry for the book!"

Smith M&P 45 Full Size(Night Sights preferred)
If the M&P has the APEX trigger kit we are really in business.

Gen 3 or 4 Glock 19 Black or OD (Night Sights Preferred)

If you would like to purchase using cash instead of trade, serious inquiry, just message me.

Just as full disclosure if you look real hard on the front of the slide, left side up front there appears to be a couple little marks right there that look shiny. Those marks are there, it is very minor and happened from me sitting the pistol on a flimsy spiral notebook and the spiral touched the slide.  I will be throwing you a little extra for these couple small, small marks right there. They can also be touched up if necessary by a coat pen.

Gun is almost like brand new except it has been fired and sitting in its custom holster :)

The rifles dust cover has been replaced with a TEXAS WEAPONS SYSTEM. This is by far the most prized accessory on this gun in my opinion.
