I intended to turn it into a project gun, but because of new circumstances, I gotta let her go. 
I never got around to shooting her but the fire control group seems to be in excellent order. A few scuffs & nicks here and there but nothing that would compromise function. She has Pachmayr wood/rubber grips with the grooves. 
She has been retrofitted by her earlier owner with now faded Tritium sights and it seems that the staked front sight has started to loosen up (I was planning on having a new sight dovetailed in by SA's custom shop). 
Aside from that, she's a very nice gun and would make a great starting point for a custom project. 
Included with the pistol are a few parts I scavenged from a friend's parts box that I was thinking of putting into her; a 3-hole Videcki style aluminum trigger minus the overtravel stop, an unknown beavertail and a commander style hammer. 
Lastly I'm also tossing in a SERPA holster and 3 different mags; GI-style 7 rounder , Pro-Mag 8 rounder , and Chip McCormick Shooting star 8 rounder.





For the whole thing I'm asking $500 FTF in Vegas area at Metro PD substation of buyer's choosing.
No trades, I need the cash to buy the necessary parts to fix my car. 
I will only accept a USPS Money Order."

Matching numbers on the receiver and stock, bolt and trigger group are electro-penciled to match. Scope is original, mount is a reproduction.

There is one arsenal repair on the stock, at the rear of the receiver on the left side; but it blends in well and is hard to see. Finish on the metal parts is excellent. Bore is fair, but that is common with these rifles; it still shoots straight and is in perfect working order.
Scope is still nice and clear; both adjustment knobs do work.
I don't need to sell this but I am interested to see what I can get for it and will not pass up the right deal.

 the Russian Firearms manufacturer Baikal marketed various Makarov handguns in the United States under the IJ-70 model. Included were handguns in both standard and high capacity frames.  9 mm Makarov round. Some minor modifications were made to facilitate importation into the United States, including the replacement of the rear fixed sight with a  adjustable sight (only these Russian models marketed abroad feature an adjustable sight). It is unlikely that more will be imported in the near future due to voluntary agreements restricting the importation of small arms from Russia.  The Makarov has a DA/SA (double-action, single-action) operating system. After loading and charging the pistol by pulling back the slide, it can be carried with the hammer down and the safety engaged. Russian Makarovs are considered Curio & Relic eligible items by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ,"

The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P220® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function."

One of the best made. It has a bull barrel, new 15 round magazine($40), new firing pin($18), new sling($22), new sling swivels($38), new scope mount($23), rings and a new Burris Timberline 3x9 scope($200). I bought the factory replacements direct from Havlin Sales and the receiver was drilled and tapped during assembly. The firing pin was good when I got the rifle but I like to go new on old components. Never know when they won't be available anymore. According to Havlin, this was probably a custom build. Often times a worker would build their own rifle. I mention this because this particular rifle has a barrel 1.25"" longer than factory specs and the stock is much nicer than normal. When I was ordering the parts, I mentioned this to Havlin and that's where I got that information from. Anyway, it's stunning. The stock is amazing and it shoots really tight groups using stock ammo. The peep sights are likewise accurate. These models are valued at $350++ depending on condition. Add in the extras and my price is fair. My firearms are clean, functioning and ready for the range. If you've been looking for a Mossberg 44US, you won't find a nicer one at this price. I've taken 16 pictures and will email additional pictures to those interested. Looking to trade as opposed to selling out right. Thanks for looking!

Nice 12 or 20 gauge, over/under, auto or pump.
Will take a 22 mag on partial trade unless it is a T-bolt of course.
I would love a really nice, built up Ruger 10/22.
Also a Ruger mark II or III 22 pistol would catch my interest.

NO MUZZLELOADERS or air rifles, not my thing, thanks.
I am not into tactical type rifles.
I prefer longer barrels on handguns. 4""+ are best for me."

One of the best made. It has a bull barrel, new 15 round magazine($40), new firing pin($18), new sling($22), new sling swivels($38), new scope mount($23), rings and a new Burris Timberline 3x9 scope($200). I bought the factory replacements direct from Havlin Sales and the receiver was drilled and tapped during assembly. The firing pin was good when I got the rifle but I like to go new on old components. Never know when they won't be available anymore. According to Havlin, this was probably a custom build. Often times a worker would build their own rifle. I mention this because this particular rifle has a barrel 1.25"" longer than factory specs and the stock is much nicer than normal. When I was ordering the parts, I mentioned this to Havlin and that's where I got that information from. Anyway, it's stunning. The stock is amazing and it shoots really tight groups using stock ammo. The peep sights are likewise accurate. These models are valued at $350++ depending on condition. Add in the extras and my price is fair. My firearms are clean, functioning and ready for the range. If you've been looking for a Mossberg 44US, you won't find a nicer one at this price. I've taken 16 pictures and will email additional pictures to those interested. Looking to trade as opposed to selling out right. Thanks for looking!

It has the usual handling marks but is easily in 90% condition and is safe-kept. I bought this rifle new about 4 years ago, ~400 rounds of .223 through it. I am starting up an SBR project and want to start fresh, and I have no need for more than one AR. Original forend comes with the rifle. First $675 takes it. 

JUST TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR! This is not a parts weapon, this is ALL RRA. The upper was bought direct from RRA and the lower was purchased complete and new from a dealer. I am the original owner. Other than the accessories I have added, this weapon is 100% Rock River Arms. No gimmicks. Again, this is NOT some piece-together weapon someone made in their garage, like some other listings found on AuctionArms.

This has been my varmint hunting rig, but I have since found interests elsewhere. I have targets to prove the accuracy. My last group was 5 shots at 100 yards you can cover with a 9mm casing. This rifle is in very good condition and has had about 250 rounds put through it. You can test fire it if you desire, but there is no scope. The barrel balances the gun very well. I've carried this gun for hours with a single point sling many times while groundhog hunting, and had no fatigue.

Listed on Gunbroker.com-ends Sunday afternoon! Get er now or good-bye! Just add ammo and this rifle is ready to roll! SGWorks-U.S.A. Made Bullpup stock assembly with SKS rifle/innards that are a type M Norinco Sporter. Great thing about these type M paratrooper size rifles are that they take AK Magazines (comes with a 20 round metal tanker mag and a 30 round standard Pro-mag for 922 compliance). Rifle length is 26.5 inches from butt-stock to barrel tip, and around 29"" at end of flash-suppressor from butt. The SGWorks stock is the newest in the land, supposedly these have been on back-order for over a year or two due to high-demand (Cannot find another built set for sale on Gunbroker.com or anywhere else). The stock has a flat top rail for whatever picatinny/weaver optics/sights you want to mount. Included in sale is a Target Sports 4X32 tactical scope (new with box, caps & paperwork) with a P4 reticle (Bullet drop style) and it has the factory picatinny rails on the top and sides (of scope) to mount red/green dots/halos, lasers, lights, etc. Also included for the buyer is a Tri-Tac GL3X with a 5mw Green Laser (brightest allowed by law) with a main LED light that puts out 170+ Lumens and a single LED light on the side for use as stealth-mode only light. Laser/light combo is trigger activated (as seen on fore-grip handle) with a main switch to mix it up for laser-light, light only or laser only, multiple combos. This GL3X uses 2 CR123 batteries and they come with it. More on the rifle: SGWorks.com has videos and information on the Stock set. The gunsmith who built set for me had to use epoxy on a couple of the Allen bolts as the brass studs spun on the synthetic stock (Minor cosmetic issue, but note worthy). The bottom of the stock handle assembly has been ground/filed down so the 20 & 30 round AK magazines will fit into bottom of receiver properly. Again, these are cosmetics only, but I am doing my best to share all information regarding this gem so there are no surprises for buyer or seller. 
922 compliance/converted parts consist of: 1. Ramline-US made Muzzle brake/Attachment 2. US Made piston extension 3. US Made Gas Piston--Parts 4-9 covered by US made Bullpup stock set: Trigger housing, trigger, buttstock, pistol grip and forearm, and lastly 10-12 from the US made magazine--Body, follower and floorplate. The Type M rifle was purchased new to build this set and after Bullpup/922 build, 50 rounds were put downrange flawlessly! So buy with confidence in this practically new weapon. This is a perfect urban weapon system and would be a blast anywhere it is needed, be it fun or defense. A picture speaks a 1000 words so have a look and l will answer any questions regarding the Rifle. Legalese:
Oregon residents can buy FTF with ID, and sign Bill of Sale declaring legal ability to own/buy a firearm. All others know your laws before asking to buy. I will ship to FFL only and shipping will be actual cost on your end, should be around $40 or so. Thanks for looking!

The MK11 first stage's streamline body is constructed of machined marine-grade chrome. The MK11 has a balanced diaphragm to offer you peace of mind with its smooth breathing mechanisms and maximum performance that don't diminish as your tank's air pressure changes. This first stage is available with a DIN or yoke configuration, making it ideal for divers around the globe. This first stage comes standard with the Thermal Insulating System (TIS), which keeps your first stage from freezing up and malfunctioning in cold water conditions. Additionally, its over-balanced diaphragm first stage design gives you better breathing performance at greater depths. 
The S555's air-balanced flow valve allows you to breathe easily and steadily throughout your dive, regardless of the air pressure within your tank. Without this feature, your breathing may change as your tank empties, leaving you working harder to fill your lungs as your dive progresses. The S555 is resistant to corrosion, which gives it a long lifespan and makes it an excellent value. The manufacturing and materials used to create this second stage make it a great choice for cold-water divers.

Manufactured Date: May 2011. 
Purchased Date: June 2011. 
Purchased Location: Chaffee Outfitters
Retail Price: $484.99 + 9.25% sales tax = $529.85
Original box, papers, 2-15 round magazines, speed loader, cleaning brush.

Gun originally came with Glock fixed sights. 
The night sights were an extra $95 installed.
Roughly 300 rounds fired.

Included Accessories:
Extra 2 Glock brand 15 round magazines @ $30 each = $65.
Blackhawk Conceal Serpa Holster = $55.
Houston Paddle Holster = $10.
Night Sights = $95.

Here are the figures:
Glock 19 = $530.
Night Sights = $95.
2 Glock 19 (15 rd) Mags = $65.
Blackhawk Holster = $55.
Houston Paddle Holster = $10.

Overall Total = $755.00

Note: Gen 3 Glock 19 retails for $484.99. Dealer cost is $420 + $25 shipping = $445.00.

So compare the dealer cost of a new Glock 19 without night sights ($445) vs the overall total invested in my Glock ($755)...

I am asking the following prices:

Sale Price = $600.
Trade Value = $650.

Or (without Blackhawk Holster):

Sale Price = $550.
Trade Value = $600.

Keep in mind, you get two extra hi cap mags, night sights, one or two holsters depending on your budget.
You are only paying $70 more over the cost of retail and you're gaining all the extras as noted above.
