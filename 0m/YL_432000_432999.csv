It is in good shape but has been pocket carried for about 6 months, so shows some definite pocket wear.  It comes with one seven round mag, 1 or 2 leather holsters, about 40-50 fmj target rounds and the soft Keltec case that came with it when I got it.  The internals and feed ramp have been polished for more reliable functioning and a smoother action as well.
This is a sweet little pocket pistol and no one in there right mind can argue that.  The only reason I am getting rid of it is to get a little bigger one that will fit my hand better.  
I am asking $220 for it and everything I mentioned.
I am having an issue getting pics up but can send them by phone if you want them.

Built entirely in the Custom Shop in extremely limited numbers, it is the finest pistol ever offered by Kimber. A full-size 1911 with all the custom features and quality expected from Kimber, the new SuperAmerica is finished out in highly polished blue on the flats and matte blue over the curves. Front cocking serrations are absent in favor of an uninterrupted engraving surface. The engraving itself is a fine English scroll pattern set against a gold border, and coverage is appropriate for a classic pistol. Both the SuperAmerica and matching custom knife wear stunning mammoth ivory grips. Each carefully matched slab is unique, and selected for its particular character. For all the refinement, the SuperAmerica is a shooter. The 5-inch stainless steel match grade barrel, barrel bushing, and Premium Aluminum Trigger™ are fitted and tuned. The adjustable sight is securely mounted in a dovetail. Each pistol bears a sequential serial number beginning with KSA, and each knife is serialed to match. The set rests in a wood presentation case with the Kimber and SuperAmerica marks.I Will only Ship to FFL Dealer only after we have a Copy of their FFL..I will not  entertain trades and no local pick ups.I Take Cashiers Checks, Postal Money Orders."

I got this gun approximately 6 months ago and am only selling for financial reasons, I absolutely love it.  Has maybe 250 rds through it.

Tanfoglio is an Itialian pistol company that has made some of the very best precision target/match pistols in the world and have won competitions in every division.

This gun, their Elite Witness Match, is considered by many to be THE SINGLE BEST VALUED SPORT SHOOTING PISTOL IN THE WORLD.  At a retail price of ~550 to 600 this pistol provides 95% of the precision shooting expieriece of a $2,000 custom race gun at a price point anyone can enjoy.  The website Best9mm.com says ""The single action factory custom shop tuned Witness ""Elite Match"" model would rank at the top of the list. You can get the Elite Match (production legal race gun!) for under $600!"" whe comparing this gun to other pistols available.


Extremely solidly built, full sized pistol comes in at a solid 33 oz. weight.  4.75"" barrel length, fully adjustable rear sight, 10+1 capacity, very vast changing magazines.  The trigger on this gun is incredible! very very short take-up then an extremly crisp break with no creep what so ever.

This version also has a rail section on the bottom of the frame, an upgraded Houge wrap-around grip, an aditional (second) magazine, one of the nicest locking factory cases I've ever seen come with a gun, and a very rare and near impossible to find Blade-Tech holster specifically made for this gun.

Don't miss this deal, prices are being raised on these guns as their value, reliability, and ammount of gun per doller is becoming more known each day.

These are selling between 530 and 550 online currently so I am offering this one, with over $100 worth of extras for $475.  I will gauruntee that this gun is in 98% like new condition and has zero cosmetic flaws.  If you are unsatisfied after recieving the gun I will allow you to return it and I will refund.

THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE GUN SHOP VARIETY 91/30.  It is a Izhevsk/Izhmash ""Izzy"" arsenal produced rifle.  This is a Dragoon that was converted into a 91/30 in Russia when they had a surplus of Dragoons and switched over to making 91/30's.  This has the hexagonal receiver, ALL numbers match including the receiver, bolt, magazine floor plate, and stock.  The bore still has good rifling and it has NOT been counter bored.  It is a very low original serial number - its serial number is just 386.  What also makes this gun rare is the double striking of the Russian writing on the receiver.  The top line was partially double struck in production.  This rifle is also old enough that it doesn't have the standard ""arrow inside a triangle"" factory Izhmash logo, it has the old style bow and arrow logo.  There are several lines of Russian text on the receiver as well as the hammer and sickle emblem.  This is a great addition to any collection.  You will not find many others like this out there anywhere.  Has original tool pouch, tools, cleaning rod, sling w/ Russian markings, oil bottle, bayonet and ammo pouch.  I also have 20 rounds of ammunition to go with it.

I also swapped the factory standard Sig rear night sight and true glow front fiber optic/tritium out for trijicon tritium sights and have had the magwell grips stippled for a better grip surface. The pistol is in excellent shape and has just gotten back after going through the Sig full service package where they replaced all springs, swapped out night sights, replaced old magazines, did a detail strip and ultrasonic cleaning, and replaced and refit old standard barrel for a threaded barrel. I have the paper work to verify all of this. Pistol will come with three factory 20 round mags and a lv 3 & 2 black hawk light bearing serpa holster, as well as a number of mounting platforms (I.e. thigh platform, Molle vest mount, etc) and the Blackhawk xiphos weapon mounted light. I may consider partial or full trades. The worst I can say is no so please feel free to inquire. This has been my duty pistol for just under a year and I am looking to swap out for a glock due to department policy and such.

There is a large outer ring and inner dot that is projected onto the front reflective glass simply by being outside in the existing ambient light. Even on a heavy overcast day, this sight works perfectly!! This is the Model 47 and it is stamped ""patent applied for"". It was made by the Swain Nelson Company of Glenview, Illinois. 

Developed from technology used in WWII bomb-sights, it is a fore-runner of the red-dot, hologram and reflex-type weapon sights popular today.  Allied aircraft had similar sights using the exact same principal, and shot down many axis war planes using their modified Nydar Sights. The inner dot represents 12"" inches at 50 yards, while the outer ring is positioned so that the ring itself is always 24"" inches from the inner dot. This makes the Nydar Gun Sight the PERFECT ""shotgun"" hunting sight. 

There are adjustments for windage and elevation, the sight is mounted on a base plate and that is able to be manipulated for front to rear and side to side movement, once it is zero'd you lock it down.

423,http://www.armslist.com/posts/432423,For Sale:  300 Blackout Brass,"Muncie, Indiana, United States",$ 60,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 13, 2012",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have:

2000 pieces of a 100% lake city brass with 95% of it being a single 2010 headstamp.
60$ per 500

This, in my opinion is the best brass for blackout. It has a stronger primer pocket compared to the other brass i run and I seem to get more reloadings from it compared to others. The brass costs me more and requires more work though. Primer pockets are swagged just enough that the primers go in but still giving it a snug fit for long life. I trim the brass to 1.355 which is closer to the lower tolerance so your brass should last longer between trimmings. I Should have another 3-4k by Friday of lake city and another 3k of a cheaper priced WCC by next Monday. I dont sell mixed brass, all my brass will be either WCC single headstamp or late year Lake City 09/10. You will get more consistent results that way when tying to get maximum fps or staying as close to under sub-sonic.

Shipping is not included but flat rate is pretty reasonable. I take PayPal (gift or 3.5%) or postal mo. I can also take a credit card by phone but there is a 3% fee. PayPal however will get you the fastest shipping. Might take a trade of some h110."

The slug barrel was ordered directly from the Mossberg factory, and comes fully rifled for increased accuracy with sabot slugs. The barrel is ported to reduce recoil, and is equipped with a cantilever scope mount. This barrel was used on my back-up slug gun from 2005 - 2011, and I estimate that I shot less than 100 slugs through the barrel over that time. The barrel is in fantastic condition - No rusting or pitting at all. New retail price for this barrel is approximately $200, but I'm selling this barrel for $125, nearly a 40% discount to the new purchase price. 

Also available, listed in a seperate auction, is a Bushnell Trophy XLT 1.75x4 Shotgun Scope with matching Burris rings in RealTree APG camo. The scope and rings are basically brand new, purchased in November 2011. I'm asking $125 for the scope/ring combo, or $225 for the barrel, scope, and rings purchased together.

Rifle was rebarreled and has a HRA 51 barrel

this is a CMP rifle, so there is NO importers stamp on the rifle

Wood is in very nice condition with no cracks and metal is in very good condition with no pitting.

This is overall a very nice example of a M1 Garand shooter grade rifle.




You can get this rifle cheaper through the CMP, but you have to meet their criteria, wait in line for the rifle to be shipped, and then there is no guarantee that it will not have pitting in the metal or a crack in the wood.

This particular GEN 3 G37 is outfitted with a Glock adjustable rear sight and Glock extended slide release.  It comes with two 10 round magazines and enough Magtech 230gr JHP rounds to load them both.

Price: $199.99
Your Price: $179.99
The Magellan eXplorist 310 GPS receiver comes packed with tons of helpful features and is ready to use right out of the box.
The eXplorist 310 is pre-loaded with the World Edition map, which includes a complete road network in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and major roads throughout the rest of the world. This unique preloaded map also includes water features, urban and rural land use, and city centers. Regional versions of Magellan's Summit Series topographic maps are available for download to expand mapping coverage and level of detail.
A vibrant, transflective color screen allows for the best readability in direct sunlight. To zero in on the exact location of a geocache, favorite fishing spot, or the next summit, the SiRFstarIII GPS chipset provides accuracy of 10-15 feet (3-5 meters). To keep your outdoor adventure going all day long, the device is powered by two AA batteries for 18 hours of constant usage. The eXplorist 310 is rugged, waterproof, and submersible (IPX-7). All of this is packed into a small and attractive handheld form factor that can be hung around your neck with the optional Magellan lanyard or attached to your pack with the built-in carabineer hook.
The eXplorist 310 provides unmatched assistance with navigation, such as the combination of the world's two most useful navigational tools -- a compass and a map! Overlay a series of different transparent compass styles on top of a pre-loaded worldwide map that show roads, water features, parks, and city centers. Access the dashboard screen that shows a mini-compass for quick reference and customizable navigation data fields, such as latitude, longitude, heading, bearing, distance to end, trip odometer, and many more. Go back to the map screen and view your active track, which is a series of digital breadcrumbs to record all yours movements. Mark your starting point (car, trailhead, parking lot. . .) with a waypoint and easily navigate back to that location at the end of the day.
The eXplorist 310 supports paperless geocaching, which allows you to download more than 20 unique characteristics of each cache, including name, location, description, hider, size, difficulty, terrain, hint, spoilers, attributes, and last 20 user logs among a number of other details.
Reference your track summary to keep track of your distance travelled, elevation gained or lost, complete travel time, moving time and stopped time, and average time to find. Easily reset your track summary statistics to track the details of your next geocaching adventure.
No matter where you enjoy the outdoors, the eXplorist 310 GPS receiver will provide precise GPS signals thanks to the Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) of WAAS, EGNOS, and MSAS; display coordinates in a myriad of different global systems, including UTM and WGS84; and accurately guide you to and from your next adventure, where ever in the world that may be!

This is a double/single action revolver that has matching numbers featuring a half moon fixed front sight, a v-notched fixed rear sight and smooth wooden grips having a serial number of V204XXX that makes it manufactured in late 1942 thru early 1943. Has the markings of ""SMITH & WESSON SPRINGFIELD MASS. U.S.A."" ""PATENTED FEB. 06, 08, SEPT. 14, 09, DEC. 26, 14"" in two seperate lines on the top of the barrel, the markings ""SMITH & WESSON"" on the left side of the barrel, the markings ""38 S.&W.SPECIAL CTG."" denoting the caliber on the right side of the barrel, the markings ""V204XXX"" on the rear underside of the barrel, the markings ""U.S. NAVY"" on the upper middle left front top strap side of the frame, the markings ""I"" ""52243"" on the inside of the frame when you open the cylinder, the markings ""I"" ""52243"" on the inside of the crane recess when you open the cylinder,  the matching serial number ""V204XXX"" are on the rear underside of the barrel, on the underside of the extractor, on the backside of the cylinder and on the bottom of the butt plate. This revolver mechanics works fine in both single and double action locking up tight being in good cosmetic condition with the finish being parkenized having turned to a nice even light gray in some areas (as I am no expert in the grading of these just going on my opinion that defers from person to person) with the metal surface having normal handling marks and finish loss, the bore and cylinder chambers are in good condition with good lands, grooves and good rifling the entire length of the bore. The smooth wooden grips are not numbered to the gun being in good condition with normal handling marks with no visual breaks, cracks or repairs, but please see pics and ask questions if there is something we have not covered as we are not experts in these type of firearms. This would make a great addition to your smith & wesson revolver collection to keep in your gun safe as these are becoming harder to find in original condition. Will drive to meet a reasonable distance to sale or trade this item to Missouri Residents FTF on a bill of sale or will ship upon receiving a clear payment and and a ink signed copy of a verifiable FFL paperwork for legal firearms transfer.

Wanting to sell my Browning Gold Stalker 3.5"" magnum. I have had it for 2 years. First year I shot the most - somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 shells. This year I haven't shot it at all. With kids at the age they are and so many other things to do I guess waterfowl hunting isn't the priority it used to be. I live in  and if I don't have to ship it to anyone I even have a few shells I will throw in the mix. Also comes with the box and everything that came with it.

If purchased before Sunday morning, this rifle and accessories will be sold for $650.00. If not, I will wait until I get what I want for it or part it all out. 

Hard times require hard choices, and unfortunately, its time to sell off some treasured stuff, one of which is this rifle. It's a Savage Model 12 BVSS chambered in .223. Fluted 26 inch barrel with 1:7 twist rifling, threaded for a suppressor but currently sporting a Surefire flashhider to protect the threads. The 1:7 twist is handy for heavier rounds, and she prefers 60gr and up. Best ammo so far has been Black Hills 77gr SMK, but amazingly shoots Hornady Steel Match 75gr 5/8 inch @ 100 yards, and 1.5 inches @ 200...

Included with this rifle are the following:

Burris Fullfield II 3-9x40 scope mounted in Burris Tactical rings
Champion 6-13 inch bipod
Plano hard case

Buy it all for $750, or----

Rifle only: $600
Scope and rings: $175
Bipod: $30
Case: $10

Also have 500 rounds of Hornady Steel Match 75gr ammo which I would sell for $20/box or would sell with the rifle for $175.00.


So for less than $1k, you could be zapping prairie dogs or steel from 300-400 yards with a rifle that is set up just right. The retail cost to buy this rig and ammo, etc is well over $1400, so my loss is your ticket into precision shooting."

*Note*
The foam in the case is pretty tore up from the previous owner. When I bought the gun it came with a Rail that mounts to the gun, a reflex red dot sight and laster/light. I guess he cut up the foam to fit all this.

Because of this rail he had on it; (I still have it if you want it) The back part where it attached to the XD rail chipped out a small part of the plastic at the back *will post pictures later*. This does not affect the performance of the gun it's only cosmetic. I never paid attention to it, I had a front mount light that covered the chip pretty well.
