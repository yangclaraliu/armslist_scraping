This ammo contains no gunpowder. The bullet is propelled solely by the eley priming mixture. This ammo is as quiet as an air rifle!!! This ammo travels at 575 FPS. This ammo is so quiet that it can be fired indoors, even in the living room, provided a proper back stop is available. The .22 super Colibri round can be fired in any .22 LR rifle or pistol. However it will not cycle the slides of semi-auto guns. WARNING: Don't let the lack of sound fool you, This round is still extremely lethal!! All safety priniciples must be used!!"

This is a brand new FNX-40 pistol. The item number is 66852. What I have is actually a certificate from FNH USA, signed by Ken Pfau, VP of sales and marketing, for this pistol. So, you know that you will receive a brand new pistol direct from FNH, not some lemon that someone bought and didn't like. I won this at the FNH 3-gun match, but I want to stick with a caliber I already have. The certificate is in the original folder it was given in, and has the instruction sheet for how to get the pistol from FN (free shipping to the FFL of your choice).

These rifles are well made and reliable. Nice checkering on wood, bluing decent but some freckling in spots which seems to be normal as seen online at other Gun Selling Sites, no pitting but this rifle is used. 

Functions as new, just disassembled and thoroughly cleaned. 

Gun breaks into 2 sections via knurled nut into sections each 18"" long.
Loads via tube in stock. 

Normally selling in the $250-350 range used due to being imported for a very short period in the 80's. 

Great inexpensive alternative to risking damage on your $600+ Browning. 

Excellent plinking gun and could be used for small game if your state allows semi auto rifles.  This can also be scoped by removing the rear site and installing a base that is less than $20.

This rifle is also very light and well balance for the young and small of stature.  It ejects out of the bottom so it can be shot left and right handed.

Reasonable offers considered.

I have a Benelli M1-Super 90 Tactical Model Shotgun for sale. I bought the firearm new in 1994 and have used it very lightly on the range.  Adult owned with less than 200 rounds through it.  This Benelli is the finest tactical shotgun in the world as far as I'm concerned. Please know what you're responding to. The specs are readily available on-line. The only missing element is the two chokes that shipped with the shotgun new. I had this for specific reasons and only used the full choke.

I'm selling due to unemployment, but I'm not interested in low ball offers. Local pick up, cash ONLY!

$940.00 or reasonable offer.

You will need Oregon ID to purchase and you'll need to sign a bill of sale.

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:  Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
 The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
 The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
 Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
 All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
 Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice."

It is widely believed that due to the excessive cost of the precision fit upper/lower receivers, the super match s/s barrel and the custom muzzle brack that Colt will not continue to produce these. So if you think that the Colts with the LE roll marks are going up (with tens of thousands having been made), imagine what these will be worth. Until then, you have the highest quality, best engineered AR Colt has ever produced.

  This is a large majority of my firearms collection. I have decided to consolidate after realizing that I am only one man and can only shoot one gun at a time. To the same respect, I'm looking to shoot more often on fewer platforms. Restricting myself to only higher quality, higher end pieces. If I diminish my collection from many to few, I want those few to be the very best out there at what they do. I like to think of myself as a VERY diverse shooter. I enjoy the sport of shooting and am open to many different venues, situations, and purposes: Home Defense, Competition, Target, Etc. With that being said...My goal is to trade up, not to sell. I have no problem offering multiple firearms in exchange for one, as long as the VALUE and QUALITY is there. Every firearm I own is in excellent condition or brand new. Nothing on this list is below 95%+ condition and most are way above (unless noted). The prices listed next to each piece are fair middle ground prices. I could start high with the expectation to be bartered with, but why not skip all the BS and cut to the chase. Please do not contact me expecting to be able to pay the lowest price listed, as again, I'm not really looking to sell. I understand that due to location and demographic, the values I have listed may be lower or higher then what is available in your area. I would like to think I am a reasonable person. If you believe I'm too low or too high please let me know and depending on what you're offering we may be able to work something out. I'm not in any hurry to get rid of any piece so please no low ball offers. I'm looking for straight value for value here. If you believe your offer to have higher than expected value, please explain why. That is why I'm here, to get the best of the best.

 What I'm looking for:

 1911's (for carry, competition, HD, etc)... Brands I'm interested in: Wilson Combat, Nighthawk Custom, Les Baer, Ed Brown, Colt, Dan Wesson. 

 AR-15 Platform (anything from LD, to target, to tactical)... Brands I'm interested in: Noveske, POF, Les Baer, Colt, Sabre, BCM, LMT

 Creative Platforms that I have interest in: Kriss Vector .45 ACP, Styer AUG, Saiga 12Ga, FN PS90, FN FS2000, FN FiveSeven, Kel-Tec KSG 12Ga, Kel-Tec RFB, Volquartsen .22 & .17

 I am an experienced shooter, but I'm far from an expert. I ALWAYS love learning about new firearms and platforms. If you have a firearm that isn't listed above, but think it meets the expectations of what I'm looking for, then please tell me about it and I would be happy to do some research.

Please understand that I've done a lot of soul searching and even more research. Every person has their feelings on the matter, but what it boils down to is that this is an ad NOT a forum. While I respect every firearm owner’s opinion and their right to have one, to that same regard, I would hope that you would respect mine. Please do not respond with advice rather than a genuine offer or question about the firearms listed.***



  This is a large majority of my firearms collection. I have decided to consolidate after realizing that I am only one man and can only shoot one gun at a time. To the same respect, I'm looking to shoot more often on fewer platforms. Restricting myself to only higher quality, higher end pieces. If I diminish my collection from many to few, I want those few to be the very best out there at what they do. I like to think of myself as a VERY diverse shooter. I enjoy the sport of shooting and am open to many different venues, situations, and purposes: Home Defense, Competition, Target, Etc. With that being said...My goal is to trade up, not to sell. I have no problem offering multiple firearms in exchange for one, as long as the VALUE and QUALITY is there. Every firearm I own is in excellent condition or brand new. Nothing on this list is below 95%+ condition and most are way above (unless noted). The prices listed next to each piece are fair middle ground prices. I could start high with the expectation to be bartered with, but why not skip all the BS and cut to the chase. Please do not contact me expecting to be able to pay the lowest price listed, as again, I'm not really looking to sell. I understand that due to location and demographic, the values I have listed may be lower or higher then what is available in your area. I would like to think I am a reasonable person. If you believe I'm too low or too high please let me know and depending on what you're offering we may be able to work something out. I'm not in any hurry to get rid of any piece so please no low ball offers. I'm looking for straight value for value here. If you believe your offer to have higher than expected value, please explain why. That is why I'm here, to get the best of the best.

 What I'm looking for:

 1911's (for carry, competition, HD, etc)... Brands I'm interested in: Wilson Combat, Nighthawk Custom, Les Baer, Ed Brown, Colt, Dan Wesson. 

 AR-15 Platform (anything from LD, to target, to tactical)... Brands I'm interested in: Noveske, POF, Les Baer, Colt, Sabre, BCM, LMT

 Creative Platforms that I have interest in: Kriss Vector .45 ACP, Styer AUG, Saiga 12Ga, FN PS90, FN FS2000, FN FiveSeven, Kel-Tec KSG 12Ga, Kel-Tec RFB, Volquartsen .22 & .17

 I am an experienced shooter, but I'm far from an expert. I ALWAYS love learning about new firearms and platforms. If you have a firearm that isn't listed above, but think it meets the expectations of what I'm looking for, then please tell me about it and I would be happy to do some research.

This is the perfect Sniper/long range system. It is designed for percision with its completely adjustable stock, fully free floated threaded and fluted barrel, crips trigger, and straight pull bolt. The is the ulitimate way to go for long range shooting. 

I'm looking to do a high end 1911/AR-15 Trade or sell for cash. I had big dreams for this rifle system. However, the cost for ammo/optic was just going to be too high for what this rifle deserves. It has had less then 20 down the pipe. Below is some info about the Blaser Tactical 2:

The Tactical 2 is the most advanced version of the precision rifle developed by Blaser.
Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform
possible. Exceptional accuracy was one of the key principles during development, with
effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more, depending on caliber and
ammunition. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet
of design. The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull
action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking
groove in the barrel – the bolt head is auto-centering and self-headspacing. The straight
pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum
movement. The rifle can easily be converted for left or right hand shooters. Interchange
calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in under a minute, without special tools
and no change in accuracy. Barrels are cold hammer forged, fluted and plasma-nitrided to
provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is
fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting
systems. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake. The receiver is
machined from aircraft grade billet aluminum alloy and is the interface for the barrel, bolt
assembly, trigger assembly and magazine. A recoil lug of hardened steel is integrated
into the receiver. The entire unit is fixed to the stock, eliminating temperature induced
distortion. The outer surface is hard anodized. The ergonomically correct stock is injection
molded out of fiber reinforced polymers and is absolutely stable, even under extreme
temperatures.

It has standard glock sights, comes with case and 3 17 rd mags(Only two made the picture, sorry). One of the mags has been carried two or three times as a spare mag for glock 19. It shows now wear, and hasn't actually been fired from, but it has had ammo loaded in it. The pistol is stock, unaltered, and has never had a round though the barrel since it was test fired at glock headquarters. 

I'm selling it because i've decided to stick with the G19, G23, and G32 frame sized pistols for carrying. The Gen 4 G17's are $539.00 at budsgunshop.com plus the FFL transfer fees. They are $539 locally as well (what I paid for this one) but you have to pay sales tax which puts them around $580. You can get this one for a few bucks less."

I bought it recently, and have shot some. The price is 35c per round, $1 for the really nice blued stripper clips, or $2.50 for a clip of five rounds. Your choice as to what manufacturer, but I have much more Romanian than Turk ammo. This is all brass cased, berdan primed, very mildly corrosive. Cases can be reloaded with the right tools.

See if you can answer these questions - which every American who loves his country should be able to answer:
1. When and where was the American Revolution won, according to John Adams?
2. When and where did the Revolutionary War break out?
3. What caused the British Regulars, the most well-trained, well-disciplined army in the world, to break and run at Concord's North Bridge, after only two minutes of musket fire by shopkeepers and farmers?
4.  What caused this reversal of British military opinion:

BEFORE April 19, 1775:
""Americans are raw, undisciplined and cowardly"". John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and 1st Lord of the Admiralty 

""With a thousand British grenadiers I would undertake to go from one end of America to the other and geld all the males, partly by force and partly with a little coaxing"". Major General Alured Clarke 

AFTER April 19, 1775:
""Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about..."" Lieutenant-General Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland

And to make that fit and look right, she got a Yankee Hill front flip-up sight and gas block.  Now that she was easy to hold, needed a more comfortable way to hold her close so she got a Magpul CTR friction locking stock and matching Magpul MOE grip, both in FDE to match her ""down to business"" personality.  And, she needed an NcStar bipod to help her stand up straight when it was time to get serious.  Because of her long reach, a 4-16x40 scope helps her see what she wants to touch.
Now she handles like a dream and wants to go everywhere I go.  But there are too many others and I can't take 'em all.  This one has to be left behind.  It's going to be a sad parting, but it has to happen.  She just needs a good home.  Is it yours?  Will include some extra mags, the original paperwork and the carrying case."

he KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

I dont need to sell this so save your lowball offers for someone else! May trade for the right gun or guns or gun and cash, let me know what you have worst I can say is no thanks! Local trades only unless your willing to come to me! Keep your offers Reasonable Please!

Well, i decided to go the way of the 5.45 and unfortunately i am too poor to afford the project without having to let another toy go. so i'm putting up my mini 14 up for sale. it is a 181 series mini in a ATI strikeforce stock with scorpion recoil pads. these pads really work, feels like an AR but far more reliable (this weapon will never turn into an over-priced club). it has a muzzle brake/flash hider and removable scope mount. this thing will swallow all .223 & 5.56 rounds no problem and is backed by ruger's awsome no-question-asked lifetime warranty. this rifle will come with a 3-9x50 simmons scope and rings (already mounted on the removable mount and sighted in at 100) very basic sling, midway soft case and 2 factory 20rd mags, 2 40rd, 2 20rd, 1 30rd no-name mags(steel). i also have 3 30rd factory mags ($75) & 3 30rd pmi stainless mags ($75) that i will let go for $100 with the rifle. a fvg bi-pod $50 w/rifle and 350 rds of federal 55g ammo ($100) $50 w/rifle. ammo is 2 bags of 100 and 180 rds loose loaded in mags (did 150 for easy math) .

I've got a FLIR BTS-X Pro with a QD35mm Lens for sale together. I've had these for 3 months, its amazing technology that works great, but I'm moving to a short-range handheld unit for work now, and get don't get time to shoot long distance like I used to.

This is a binocular thermal unit from FLIR, the guys who invented Thermal Imagers, so no ATN or some chinese make. 

It's got a 320x240 detector inside it, which when combined with the 35mm lens lets you detect a mansized heat signature at 780 yards regardless of night or day. The company says if you upgrade to a 100mm lens that increases out to over two thousand yards easy, so this is LONG range detection.

Price is negotiable, and I am interested in other night vision trades. If I were to divide up the lens and the imager I'd put the imager at $4500 and the lens at $2000. I will pay shipping to anywhere in the continental US.

The gun is all new with no surplus or used parts used. It has a Chromed Barrel and Bolt. It also includes a picatinny rail mounted on the dust cover which is OK for mounting some sighting systems, but will not sustain zero because of the inherent loose fitting dust covers on some of the rifles. I added the side mount because it allowed the mounting of most optics and will sustain zero much better since it is an integral part of the rifle. 
I have had it to the range one time and have run ~20 or so rounds through it (3-5 rounds each in various mags to make sure it would use other mags than came with it... I found that metal mags work fine, but plastic mags are a little too tight a fit...close tolerances, I guess)
Price is 1050.00 with the AimPoint...
I would take the AimPoint off if the buyer did not want the optics and sell for $695.00 
I would prefer cash for the rifle, but would entertain trades of equal or higher value or trades plus cash. 
I don't need to sell the rifle, so low ball offers will simply be ignored."
