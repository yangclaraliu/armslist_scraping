This means you retain the beauty of the wood without the warping effects found in solid wood stocks. This is a mountain-rifle style, slim stock with an open grip. It is English walnut. The Serengeti pattern here is called a Cheetah geometry. Schnabel forend tip, Ebony Grip. LOP is 13.5"" with this slim butt pad. Deluxe Checkering, 22LPI by Charlie Kuter now (deceased). Slim line cheekpiece. Includes a Bausch & Lomb Elite 3000 3 x 9 Scope. The barreled action is stock, off a Rem 700. The barrel extends just over 8"" from the schnabel tip. It is not serekoted. The bolt knob does have the very handy checkering for extra grip. The true value here is the Serengeti Stock worth over $2500 itself. I paid $600 JUST for the barreled action, excluding scope! This rifle was shot on one hundred and two hundred yard ranges and produced within a half MOA on factory loads. This is offered at this price to SELL. A super fun and lightweight rifle! I will accept paypal or check. You have 3 days maximum to review and return (return shipping at your own expense). Pls note-the wood to metal fit is not superior like it would have been had Serengeti fit it. But at this price, do it yourself and save THOUSANDS. Email me with any questions."

I'm just putting this out as a feeler to see what else is out there. It is a magazine fed bolt action gun with a 10 round detachable magazine. It has an 18 inch barrel and a wood monte carlo style stock. It is missing the flip down forend and it was in my restoration plans to replace it, although should you want the gun without it that would be fine as well. The only other major issue is that the plastic buttplate is cracked in half but again that can be found and replaced easily. Otherwise I was just going to touch up the bluing with some cold blue and refinish the stock. The gun shoots 100% as is right now but is a little sore on the eyes. I would be interested in other .22s or a .22mag. Other old Mossbergs would be great as well, i'd love to tinker with a semi auto.

I bought this pistol new, many years ago, and didn't shoot it much because I didn't think it was very accurate.
In 1994, I sent it to Clark Custom for their accuracy job. They sent the gun back, along with the test target of 10 rounds at 50 yards, under 3"". I have fired several groups at 50 yards with this pistol that were under 2"".
It has been sitting in the safe, unused, for the last 8-9 years, so I thought it was time to get it to someone that will use it.

The only reason I am selling this lower is because I had a custom lower on backorder from Spikes for my .50 Beowulf, after waiting nearly 2 months I got tired of the wait game and bought this one, the very day the YHM lower got to my FFL, I got a call from Spikes letting me know my order was ready and had been shipped, go figure.  As I stated this lower is unused brand new and I am listing it for less than I paid for it so my loss is your gain. As for trades I am currently in the market for a semi-auto handgun (nothing smaller then 9mm) Or really anything else interesting to add to the collection. Anyone in this market knows that ""good"" lowers are getting hard to come by, everyone has a long lead time right now, here's your chance to beat the rush and get your build started.

Oh and to whoever flagged my post last time, please don't. This lower is in my hands, I am a real person stationed in Colorado and don't have time for childish games, Thank you."

This pistol was purchased in Dec 11 and sent in to the custom shop for 1300$ worth of custom upgrades Feb 1st 2012.  200 rounds before custom shop - 350 rounds after.  It has been upgraded to the FBI model Professional that SA offers along with a custom length threaded Nowlin NM bbl and Harrison custom flush fit yellow lamp rear tritium night sights.  It's been refinished with Armory Kote Flat Black.  All work is on paper and is lifetime warrented through SA.  You cannot go wrong with this pistol, everything on this pistol will be fixed or replaced for the rest of its life through SA.  The croc holsters were custom made for me by Tim of TT gunleather in CA - I shelled out A LOT of money to have these made and Tim had to go out of his way to aquire me some Croc skin - You will not be disappointed in this set.  I've worn it for about a month mayble less.

If not for the JC Higgins name, these rifles would sell for much, much more as it is a high quality and very accurate rifle. 

I personally have fired 45 rounds. No idea of the previous round count over the past 60 years, but the rifle is in great shape with a shiny bore and good rifling. .30-06 is expensive for frequent target practice, and I do not hunt, so I really have no reason to justify keeping this rifle as I hate keeping guns I rarely shoot when someone else may get more use out of it. 

The rifle and stock are in great shape. The only flaws are some minor wear of the bluing, especially near the muzzle, and a previous owner attached a Kick EEZ recoil pad that is about the correct width but a 1/4 inch or so short in length (there is a gap between the pad’s toe and the toe of the stock). No idea as to where the original pad is. 

The scope is a like-new Meike 6.5-24x40mm with a very clear sight picture (I am the first owner and purchased it for $200 only a couple months ago). From my research I have gleaned that the company is in Hong Kong, and they make amazing optics for very low prices. The scope has lockable turret adjustment knobs, 6.5x-24x zoom, a yardage interval focus knob, and a battery powered, adjustable brightness, red/blue reticle illuminator. I have Weaver quick-detach 30mm scope rings mounted on Weaver Mauser scope bases.

To round everything out I am including:
1 - Blackhawk cheek rest with pouch and 5 cartridge loops 
1 - Blackhawk .308 MOLLE pouch holding 20. rds, coyote tan 
1 - leather sling
1 - bore snake

(If you haven't heard of one, check out the link below and watch the demo video)

www.atlanticfirearms.com/storeproduct1064.aspx

I bought this gun a few weeks ago from a private party, but now I have my sights set on another gun, so up for sale it goes.

Technical Specs:

- Romanian G AK-47 built on a US made NoDak Spud receiver
- Tapco G2 double hook fire control group
- Steel 30 rnd mag with Arsenal US made follower
- Tapco slant muzzle brake
- UTG tactical quad rail 
- CAA short vertical foregrip
- Black nylon padded 2 point tactical sling
- Slide Fire Solutions SSAK-47 bump fire stock

Also includes a set of beautiful Russian Red wood furniture and bakelite grip with standard mounting hardware. The wood furniture is foreign made, but the gun is configured such that as long as you use US made magazines or the included steel mag that I added a US made follower to, you can put the foreign made furniture on and still be 922r compliant. If you don't know what 922r is and don't know what I'm talking about, it is worth running a google search. I also have an original Romy G furniture set with the black stripe buttstock and the wooden ""Donkey dong"" foregrip that everybody likes to cut off. I'll throw it in too if I can find it.

Price is $850 firm, face to face transaction in Enumclaw (willing to drive to Puyallup or Auburn but that's about it). I will need to see your WA state drivers license just so I know you are a legal resident. I won't be writing anything down, I just want to take a peek. 

Anticipating possible objections by those accustomed to $400 - $500 AKs, and to save the same the trouble of sending me an email with a lowball offer, my asking price reflects the fact that the slide fire stock is a nearly $300 stock and a Romy G is a quality AK, not the typical cheapo WASR-10 Century guns. Even without the Slide Fire stock, we are talking a $650 - $750 gun. Not all AKs are the same. $850 is a heck of a deal for this set up. 

If you dont want the tacticsl configuration, I am willing to sell the gun with just the wood furniture for $650 without the SSAK stock and quad rail.

Not really looking for any trades... but feel free to try.

This rifle has seen immaculate care and maintenance, with a round count right around 700. Only reason I’m selling is to buy a top end Colt rifle, otherwise I would never sell this one.

Compare this rifle to all the other used AR’s and you will see this one has all the bells and whistles far beyond the others.

This bow has had very few shots out of it. When you see it there is no doubt. I purchased this last year long before archery season and shot it enough to sight get things squared up.

This bow has nearly $1500 invested. Its a sweet shooting bow and an eye catching bow! Sad part is that it has never even seen the woods. It has killed an unlucky bunny rabit that was caught nibbling on my garden last spring!

I have up for sale my like new H & K  Version 2 P30. It is chambered in .40 S&W and comes with 3 MAGS and the Case.  The weapon was sent to H&K by me to have the trigger modified do the Version 1 4 Pound Double Action Only LE Trigger group. I spend about $400 for this alone, and you will be hard pressed to have H&K do this for just anyone.  The weapon has only had about 200 rounds down range, and has been my off duty  carry weapon of choice, but I am changing weapons to the S&W M&P Series Pistols & would like to to offer this one up to help cover the cost of the new weapons. 

I will post pictures shortly, and I am open to reasonable offers. The weapon is worth what I am asking due to the modifications, and the exclusivity that it holds. If you know anything about the P30 line they are truly remarkable shooters, and not much compares to the comfort in your hand!  Please feel free to email with any questions or offers you may have. Thank You for Looking and Have a Great Day!"

892,http://www.armslist.com/posts/364892,For Sale:  Catello Tribuzio 1889 Palm Squeeze Pistol -Rare!,"North Columbus, Columbus, Ohio","$ 2,100","Listed On: Wednesday, April 11, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This posting is for what I believe to be is a very unique and by all accounts very rare, Catello Tribuzio Palm Pistol. All information I found dates it to around the 1880's to 1890's. One account states that Tribuzio received the patent in 1899 for this self-loading pistol and I heard it referred to as the 1899 Tribuzio Palm Pistol. This particular gun does not have any visible markings and I am not sure if that means this was a prototype or maybe it wore off over the years. From doing some quick research myself, it appears this one is missing the side extractor bars and possibly a pin close to where the ring-trigger closes. I could not find any other obvious missing components, but I am also not familiar with this model. The barrel is nicely threaded into the frame and the firing mechanism is removable as well. The long pin protruding from the rear is spring loaded and goes all the way through to become the firing pin. I did a quick check and it looks like the caliber would be equivalent to modern 25acp. The ring-like trigger seems to function properly and it closes the bolt upon squeezing. The safety lever on the side rotates around to allow the side plate to be removed, but I am not sure how the safety itself is supposed to function. I will post a lot of detailed pictures later today and certainly do not hesitate to ask any questions. This is definitely outside of my field of expertise, but I have consulted with some of the industry experts during my research of this unique firearm.  Additional pictures available."

I have never found another like it, so if you can enlighten me on it or correct something about it please let me know. It is a real beauty especially since i guess it is 123 years old!! In fact it is so pretty for its age i would have to say that the blueing and stock have been redone exceptionally well. I have shot some Turkish nickel 8mm Mauser ammo through it as well as Sellier & Bellot 196 grain 8x57js ammo. Functions perfect and has a nice smooth action and nice feel overall. There is some question whether the Sellier & Bellot ammo is safe to shoot through this due to the js designation, so i would recommend having a competent gunsmith check this for you, but both fired fine for me. It is a very powerful rifle! To much rifle for me and what i need! It has a redfield peepsight on the rear with a blade sight on the front. It has a brand new handmade custom leather sling that goes with it along with about 15 rounds of the turkish ammo in a bandolier and about 40 rounds of the Sellier & Bellot along with some empty casings and stripper clips, which will have to ship seperately. What I think I know is that it is the first rifle produced by FN. It says Fabrique Nationale and below that faintly is -liege I cannot really make out the Herstal part that is suppose to be before the -Liege, but i believe this puts it made in belgium. It has a 5 round detachable magazine and a pachmayr butt pad. It does not appear to have any matching numbers. It has 8mm stamped on the barrel. It has various markings on it including the FN crown. It has approximately a 23-1/2"" barrel. I would rate the metal at 90% or better and the wood at about the same. The only real places that the blue is wearing is on the bottom of the bolt handle and bolt itself. When i got this rifle the bore looked perfect to me, but since shooting about 40 rounds through it it doesn't seem to look that great. I have cleaned the heck out of it, but still seems to have powder in the rifling, I will try to clean it again before sold. The rifling is strong but i guess i would rate the bore at 80%? U.S.P.S. postal money order only! Flat shipping rate of $30.00 for lower 48 states will include proper packaging, tracking and insurance via UPS the fastest way possible for the money, but will probably be ground. Guarantee it to shoot and be in condition stated! If i were to keep it i would possibly drill and tap it for a scope, but like i said it's to much gun for my needs. It is the only bolt action in the pic of the three guns. Other two shotguns are sold. Thanks!"

I'm not even sure if it was ever fired before i got it, but it was very dusty. I gave it a thourough cleaning and i just put a couple rounds through it to make sure it functions correctly. It has a vent rib at an overall length of 26"" including the compensator and multi-choke which includes cyl., imp.cyl., mod., imp.mod, full and xtra full! The metal i would rate at about 98%!, the beautiful tiger striped wood at about 95% (the pistol grip portion lacquer came off when i cleaned it, but if you oil it it is hardly noticeable)and bore at 95% or higher and still plenty shiny. Original jc higgins butt plate is in great shape along with the pistol grip plate. Gold tone trigger even still looks very good along with the jeweled bolt. These were made by high standard and i have a pdf version of basically the owners manual i can email you to go with it. This must have been a deluxe model and is a beautiful example!

This gun was shot, and carried some. Its always worked well for me. It doesn't like hollow points, CZ can fix that if you send it in to them though. It has some scratches on the main spring plug from pulling it in and out so often, it has the comp hammer from CZ Custom installed with an extended safety that has been ground down some. It comes with the two factory magazines, and two MecGar EAA Witness mags that work fine.

Its a nice gun, but I'm trying to consolidate to 9mm, I would trade for Glock 34, 17, or 19.
