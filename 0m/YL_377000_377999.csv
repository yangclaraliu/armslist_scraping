The Makarov can be fired double-action or single action.  It has a slide-mounted safety that will also de-cock and safely drop the hammer.  Its smaller size makes it perfect for home or car protection, or even concealed-carry.

ATI Scope mount
ATI Bent Bolt Kit
Caldwell Fixed Bi-pod
BSA 6-24x40mm mil-dot scope
low-pro scope rings
removed original iron sights

Bent bolt kit is welded vs. screwed on
Also had a mechanical engineer friend use a mill to drill and tap for the scope mount vs. using clamps and hand drill as the instructions say to! (wow! still cant believe they would suggest that!) There are spots where the front and rear sight were that the bluing is removed or never was.. could use a nice stencil paint job.

Reason: Time to move on to the next project and let someone else enjoy this awesome rifle. Looking to build a piston driven AR-15 or buy Ruger SR-556.

I had a Springfield XD subcompact in 9mm a while back but traded it in on a Springfield XDm.  I always missed that gun, plus I still had 200 rounds of 9mm left, so I bought this PX4 to play around with a double action pistol and use up the rest of my ammo.  After a few months of owning it, I just don't shoot it often enough to be worth keeping.  I prefer my striker fired pistols and want to stick to .40 S&W as a single caliber.

I have shot exactly 89 rounds through this pistol.  It has functioned flawlessly.  One of the magazines has a drop down extension that allows for a full grip.

Since finding holsters is a bit tough for this gun (the full and midsize PX4 use a different holster), I decided to modify one meant for the full size weapon for this subcompact.  It is a Blackhawk SERPA  CQC that has been relieved in the areas that the PX4 is wider than the full size and I also cut down the overall length of the holster.  The holster along with a belt slide and paddle adapter will be included.

In addition to all the normal things that came with the gun (case, 2 magazines, lock, backstraps, mag loader, manuals), I am including 111 rounds of Winchester white box 9mm ammo and 20 rounds of Speer Gold Dot 9mm hollow point ammo.

- Beretta PX4 subcompact in 9mm ($500)
- Blackhawk SERPA CQC holster ($40)
- 111 rounds Winchester ammo ($30)
- 20 rounds Speer HP ammo ($20)

Since this is my second 10-22, im only looking to trade for a change of pace and im willing to respond to any offer so long as it involves another firearm of equal or greater value (in which case I might add a small amount of cash).

I can make your glock fit your hand better. This IS a permanent modification. I can perform this on any glock, including GEN 4 guns (Which I own and have done myself) I can do as little or as much as you like in terms of making the grip smaller or larger. I do very clean work. I can remove finger grooves as well. I can soften trigger guards, and round them if you like. I can also offer trigger compenent polishing to improve the feel of your glock trigger. 

I can do work on non glock weapons that are polymer framed as well. I can do heat stipling or you can choose my custom texture that it a bit less aggressive. You decide! 

If you have aftermarket parts and pieces you'd like installed I can do that as well. My services will be top knotch and I will not charge a ton of money.

IF you have one, and would rather have the standard serrations, now's a good opportunity.

About The Gun: This G19 has seen 50 rounds, and has had a polish job done on the internals equating to a much smoother trigger.  Also installed are BRAND NEW XS Big Dot Night Sights, an extended slide stop release and an extended take down lever. No wear on the gun, it literally is 99.9%. I have filled in the engraving on the slide with a durable white paint, and it looks sharp. 

Included: Glock comes with everything that it would come with when bought new. cleaning rod, bore brush, speed loader, paperwork and the test fired casing. Also included is a nice DeSantis IWB holster.

So, like I said guys and gals, if you have an RTF 2 out there with the fish gill serrations, and feel like you'd rather have the standard serrations, now's the time to do it!

Would also trade for the following:

- WASR 10 AK 47+Cash and Ammo (Maybe a KelTec PF9 in lieu of ammo and cash)

- Remington 870 in good shape+ Taurus 605 or Ruger LC9

- HK USP 9c

- CZ P01 WITH NIGHT SIGHTS

- G19 RTF2 without the fish gill serrations

- Ruger SP101 3"" with a night sight set-up/carry package. Ammo would be a plus as well.

- S&W 686 4""

In South Africa, an inexpensive ring lock folder is sold everywhere. It's a good design, but it's constructed from sub-standard materials, is poorly made, and is horribly overpriced. And yet, millions of these knives are sold there each year. Well, we thought we could do better, in the quality of materials, cutting performance, and in price.

The Cold Steel Kudu, takes some cues from its South African competition, but our version is vastly superior. Ours has a Krupp 4116 Stainless steel flat ground blade, heat treated to Rc 56-57 for better edge holding ability and ease of re-sharpening, and a thin razor sharp edge.

For safety, we have thoroughly tested the locking mechanism and are well satisfied it will hold the blade rigidly open until you decide to close it by pulling up on the ring attached to the back spring.

The handle of the Kudu also reflects our dedication to making an effective and affordable folder. It's made of 43% glass reinforced ZytelÂ®. This material has proven to be extremely strong, and is stiff enough to complement the blade and spring when locked open. Plus, the gripping surface has a wood grain texture for traction and features an attractive polished steel Kudu horn emblem for a little extra flair! We think the Kudu represents an unbelievable value. It's ready for anything and makes a wonderful work knife, utility knife, bait knife, or hunting knife.

Reflecting the best of its Finnish heritage, the Finn Bear is an extremely affordable version of our popular Sisu. It's ideal for hunting, fishing or camping trips, and makes an efficient utility knife as well! The 4116 Krupp Stainless blade is hollow ground and given an Rc hardness of 56-57, so it will hold a good edge and is easy to re-sharpen. Its blade shape is centuries old and practical because of its good sturdy point for piercing and long belly for skinning, cutting and carving. It's big and strong enough to skin a Moose, yet thin and delicate enough to slice a tomato or cut up an apple. The Finn Bear has a straight handle with a slightly ribbed texture for traction. Its modified diamond cross section will fit your hand like a glove and accommodate a wide variety of gripping methods. It's made of Zytel, one of the strongest glass reinforced plastics available, so it will last for many years and never rot, crack, warp or mildew. For safety and convenience, the Finn Bear comes with a deep pouch style Cordura sheath and generously sized belt loop so it can be worn on the waist, slung around the neck or tossed into a duffle bag or tackle box. Specifications: - Weight: 2.8 oz. - Blade Thickness: 2.5mm - Blade Length: 4"" - Handle: 4 1/2"" long.

It is chambered in 7.62x39. This rifle is from the Izhmash company in Russia. I do have the magazine for it and might have an extra. This is basically a new rifle with very very little use maybe 4 mags through it. I am asking $425.00 for it and if it doesn't sell for that I will keep it. This is a very nice rifle and no paperwork needed. I'm not hurting for money so please don't ask if I will take less. I might entertain a partial trade on a small caliber handgun but please no Jennings, Jiminez etc. I also am into the 70's model ford pickups. If you are interested just email and I will get back with you. I would take a paypal payment but you would need to add 4% to it because paypal charges like no other and I have to wait for the payment to transfer to my bank so cash is preferred.If you have something else you might want to trade just ask. All I can do is say no.I have no issues with this rifle as far as how it works I just like my SKS's better and pretty much don't use this, ever, so it might as well go somewhere that it will get used. I am going to be going through Wichita on Wednseday the 2nd and can bring the rifle with me to show after that I will be back in western Kansas again."

                                                     The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 
This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol."

The only two parts I can find that are not Springfield are the safety lever (H&R) and the windage knob (BME-Italy).  After Italy surrendered to the allies in WWII, they soon began building Garands themselves.  

The muzzle wear indicates very little use.  Good as new barrel condition.  The heel of the receiver is dipped in lead, which is also quite rare and collectable.

The maple stock is a military replacement, indicated by the proof marks and the Dept. of Defense cartouche on the left side.

All in all, a very nice, highly serviceable M1 Garand, that should provide years of happy shooting.

This gun was given that custom feel and then had Hard Chrome applied in a matte finish by AP&W when they were located in FL.  The hammer was lightened and the grips were replaced with Pierce rubber.  The trigger pull was smoothed some, not to be confused with a target trigger.  I have shot about 100 rnds of the Russian ammo thru it and it has been 100% reliable with all four magazines which are also Hard Chromed.  A question has been asked about the high price of this gun since it is only a Makarov, consider this (1) used Makarov $200 (2) 2 extra mags $35 (3) ammo $50 (4) Plating of gun and extra mags $235.

Only looking at trades adding cash my way for something like 9mm or .40cal Berettas, Hi Power clones, XDs, or Bersas. (anythinglike those types of guns). Also would consider aks with cash, prefer ak74, but either  caliber is fine. Low end AR-15s (dont need to add cash). FALs, Cetmes. Any kinda of assault pistols like tec9s, AP-9s, M11, Dracos, PPS43s, stuff like that.

I think they made them for over 30 years in several different names.  This version is marked Revelation and was made for either Montgomery Ward or Western Auto (I can't remember which).  It has a four round detachable magazine.  The stock has the usual dings and dents and is nothing fancy.  Since I don't have one round of .222, I have never even fired it.

Concerning the rifle.  It is used.  I purchased it earlier this year because I like the 1x14 rate of twist and my original plan was to have it re-chambered to .223 because I already have some .223 ammo.  I even purchased a new aftermarket scope mount with a picatinny rail figuring to maybe put a scope on the rifle someday.  BUT I have since decided to trade off the rifle.  Mostly because I think even fewer people would be interested in it after the conversion.

I will add cash if necessary for the right trade."
