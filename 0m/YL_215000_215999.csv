This is the perfect big game rifle for deer, elk, moose, bison, bear etc... 

I really hate to sell this rifle but need the money. It is really a $3700 to $4300 rifle, but I will be selling it cheap for a quick sale.  Here are the particulars: Remington  Shop new stainless fluted barrel with KDF muzzle brake; New Schillen Trigger that is crisp, feather light, and accurate; Varix 3 Leopold 8.5- 25 Power, Scope with target dot recticle and elevation windage and focus knobs; have reloading dies and brass to go with it. I have the perfect recipe for this gun. The harmonics of the barrel are beautiful and with my custom loads it is common to put the bullet down the same hole at 100 yrds, and within 4 inch groups at 700 to 1000 yrds. 

I also have the formula and a bullet trajectory chart by distance so that you can click the scope elevation to dead on no matter what the distance of your target. If you are not familiar with the STW, it is essentially an 8mm necked down to a 7mm, so you have a lot of powder and power behind that bullet. It is a little lighter than the ultra mag, but just about as flat flying with an average velocity from the muzzle of about 3400 fps.   I know exactly what bullets, powder, primers, brass etc... to get an ultra accurate round and will give all. 

If you are interested feel free to give me a call. I think you will be pleased with your purchase. This is an exceptional rifle and a lot of fun to shoot.

Will take partial trades.

The Hakim was originally designed by Sweden and produced as the AG-42 Ljungman for the Swedish Army. The tooling and design were later sold to Egypt, and the Hakim was produced there during the 1950s and 1960s. The gas operated system is adjustable by use of a special tool on a valve at the front of the gas tube. This rifle is direct impingement like an AR. Has a Tokarev-pattern tipping bolt system like the SKS and FN49.
Only about 70,000 of these rifles were ever made and only a couple thousand ever made it to the US.

This particular rifle is in good mechanical shape. Bore and crown are very good. The rifle functions as it should using Yugo FMJ. I've put about 125 rounds downrange since I've had it and find it to be very accurate. Probably in large part due to the excellent muzzle break which helps with recoil.
The stock has some dings, but could be cleaned up if you want to refinish it. I don't alter milsurp rifles for fear of hurting their value or damaging them.
The rifle uses detachable box mags, but is really meant to be fed by stripper clips. One ten round mag is included. MG-13 mags can be modified to work with this rifle. They come up on gunbroker every once in a while if you don't want to mod one yourself.
Also have about 100 or so rounds of Yugo FMJ to go with it.

Of all the Mosins, the Finnish rebuilds are the best, and of those the M24 is probably the rarest. 
These were built for the Civil Guard (called the ""Lotta Svard"") out of original Russian M91 hex receiver rifles. The action is bedded, the horrible front sight was replaced with a blade front post, and new heavy barrels made by Bohler-Stahl of Germany were installed. These were only produced from Russian captures from 1924 to 1928. Productions numbers are only about 8000 produced.

The good news is that the stock is fantastic. It looks great. The bore is clearly surplus condition, but not bad at all, and the crown is not bad either.
The bad news is that whoever had this rifle before me removed and lost the upper handguard and the entire rear sight. I imagine this was to mount a scope since the rear sight mounting bracket is basically a 3/8 dovetail mount. If you wanted to buy this for a shooter, you could put a scope back on it with no problem.
There is also a problem with the trigger. It wont set when the bolt is pulled back and as a result the bolt doesn't stay cocked. I don't know enough about Mosins to guess why this is happening, but Mosin parts are cheap online, especially common trigger parts. If I had to guess I'd say the sear is worn our or broken. You can get one for less than 10 bucks online. 
The handguards and the sight pieces cost a little more, but they can be taken from Russian M91's, and don't have to be Finn specific.
In excellent shape, these rifles generally go for $500 or more, but I admit this one has problems, so I am asking $220. It's entirely fixable if you want to put the work into it. If you don't, the trigger could be fixed and it would be a good shooter with a scope set-up. The Finn Mosins are known for their accuracy, and between the bedding and heavy barrel, I assume this one would probably be a tack driver.

I've shot approximately 120 rounds of German Dynamit Nobel ammunition and it functioned flawlessly and is very accurate. This is a 7.62 NATO rifle, 3 position stock, 16"" barrel. I purchased this as a ""go to"" rifle, but to be honest, I've never cared for the controls on a Stoner/AR design, so I guess I should've passed. The rifle functions fine with either 7.62 NATO or .308 Winchester ammunition and I've run a box of 180 grain Winchester Power Point to test this. To save you and I both time: no lowball offers. I'm not in a position where I HAVE to sell. I would entertain trades on the two models I've indicated. Please call or text at REDACTED if interested.

Serial number is 37120XX which indicates manufacture between January and March 1944. It was a DCM rifle from years ago and I've had it for about 7 years. There are no import marks! There is only one part that I know is a replacement and that's the late war, swing type safety. There may be more parts but I'm not sure. I have not changed or altered the rifle except for adding the sling and mag pouch. Finish and wear is even and good on all metal parts and the wood is solid with a few dings and bruises. Barrel is marked IBM Corp and dated 10-43.  Bore looks crisp and the muzzle passes the ""bullet test"".  Stock is marked J-LB with ordnance stamp.  This rifle comes with a correct magazine stock pouch dated 1943, period sling, and three GI 15 round magazines (one is correct IBM). I'll also include a copy of ""The M1 Carbine Owner's Guide"" by Ruth & Duff. This is a great, collectable piece of history. I'm selling this for $850. Feel free to ask questions. Serious inquiries only. No ammo included in this sale.  Thanks."

It was ignored for a little while somewhere in the garage and has some slight specks of rust on the dies but it still works like a charm! Currently set up to reload 12 gauge hulls.

It also includes an angled rail. I have messed with this so much over the years I have actually stripped two threads in particular, hence the rear left side of the quad rail is blank. I will include all the extra rail sections it came with. Overall, it has some nicks here and there but I actually don't shoot it too often. Only 740 rounds have been shot through this so far.

Wearing the following:
Magpul OD GREEN MOE Stock (Mil-Spec tube and stock)
Magpul OD Green MIAD grip holding 2 rounds, broken brass extractor and a front sight tool inside. Will include extra front/back straps.
Ergo Grip Plug (between the trigger guard and grip)
Magpul OD Green Rear BUIS
Ambidextrous Charging handle latch (Forgot make but looks like Badger Ordnance style)
EO Tech XPS2 HWS (Has the two dots in the 65 MOA ring)
Ergo OD Green Diamond Plate style rail cover on top rail
Midwest Industries Ambidextrous Sling Point (over the castle nut)
CAA Black VFG with Battery storage.
Sporting a Blackhawk 3-Point SWIFT sling (Now Shown)
The BCG is Rock River and is chromed on the forward interior. The bolt and firing pin were actually swapped out for CMMG ones a few months back. So these have only shot about 200 rounds or so.
***The Fenix TK12 R5 LED Light IS NOT INCLUDED!***

Over time, I have put about $1600 into this AR. If I were to sell, I'd ask for $1300. I would include 2 Tan/Coyote C-Products 30 round magazines with anti-tilt followers and SS springs as well as 2 PMAGS, one Foliage Green and one Black with a window.

So whether you like the paint job or not, I'd be interested to hear what people think/offer!

Everything I’m selling here is perfectly legal to own here in Nevada, as all parts are just that “parts”. There are no illegal / functioning weapons for sale - only everyday parts that anyone can buy anywhere at any time with no restrictions.

I’ll do my best to answer any questions you may have, but that’s why I also took close up pictures so you could see what you were getting. I’m 99% sure the drum clip is for an SKS but there are no markings on it except for the number 36 right by the winder! I assume that may mean the amount of rounds but I’m not positive. The shoulder holster pictured to the right in the picture with 2-clips is for a 9mm Ruger.

For the first few days of the posting, I will not separate any of the items! Its one fair cash offer / price takes it all. The only reason I put a price for this ads title is because it make you put a dollar amount in before posting! Good Luck.

This is a local transaction only as I will not ship or deal with anyone out of the state of Nevada. I will also require that you be at least 21 years old and I will ask for a valid Nevada ID before parts or monies are exchanged.

About $40 would get it running flawlessly)  I also have a Browning designed shotgun.  This one is particularly interesting because it is a take down model, meaning it can be broken into two halves for storage or travel in about 30 seconds.  It also lacks a trigger disconnect, meaning you can hold down the trigger and pump it and it will fire all the shots for you.  Makes a great range gun because with buckshot it has a higher lead output than an Uzi submachine gun!  Pictures linked are not actual guns, but very representative of condition.  I can email specific pictures at request.

Here is a swivel deck signal cannon made on board a US Liberty ship during the Atlantic crossing during WWII. This machine shop cannon is made for shipboard deck mounting with 360 deg. movement and adjustable elevation. This 1 inch bore rolled steel deck cannon measures 17 inches from end to end and fires with a black powder charge and fuze (local pick-up or shipping by arraignment only!). This cannon was made on board a US Liberty ship during WWII and is made using period ship parts (see photos). The barrel is lathe turned from a Liberty ships drive shaft and is extremely durable, the base is a six bolt steam pipe connector, and the swivel arm is from a cable winch rotator coupling. This signal cannon uses black powder only. This is not a toy and should be used with sober adult supervision. On the bow of any ship, boat, or yacht this is a commanding piece and has a loud report for a signal cannon (black powder charge alone). It makes nice smoke rings out to about eighteen feet. If you don't already have one then here is your chance. We can arrange shipping by request. The cannon unbolts into three pieces and most will fit in USPS Flat Rate boxes.  The barrel is the question as it measures 17 inches long and does not fit in standard USPS Flat Rate boxes. The total weight of the cannon is approximately 57lbs."

For high volume, dirt cheap practice or plinking with a centerfire pistol, few accessories are as useful or cost effective as a 22 rimfire conversion kit. This Tactical Solutions kit is a finely crafted, drop-in slide replacement for America's favorite sidearm, the Model 1911. Engineered to fit Government or Commander sized frames, these machined steel units come complete with a 4.5"" barrel, firing pin overtravel stop, adjustable sights, integral full-length optic rail and 10-round aluminum magazine. Installed on the pistol's frame, this conversion kit maintains the feel and profile of its centerfire counterpart, providing the user with a familiar grip angle and operating controls for economical, yet useful and realistic practice. The kit is compatible with single-stack or STI wide-body frame designs with the appropriate magazine inserted. The 10-round magazines lock the slide to the rear when depleted, a unique attribute that is often overlooked on rimfire conversions."

That's the great part, this is one of the most reliable systems you can get in a firearm, and has lasted for years previous, and will last for years to come.

Versatility through the roof - this is just as useful as a home defense weapon, or a wilderness defense weapon (bears/mountain lions), as it is as a hunting weapon.
Awesome firepower, awesome price.

I live in the Summit County, near the ski resorts.
