I have acquired quite a few more magazines and decided to sell or trade most all of my Glock mags as well. I have received over 100 offers in two days and about 2% of those I would consider fair offers. Why would I sell my Glock factory, 33 round mags for less than what I paid for them last month, well before this ban anticipation? I paid 50 dollars each at Jensen in Loveland. You will not find a single high cap magazine at any dealer, they are long gone. The cheap Korean versions are fetching 100 dollars and up for one. As a father of eight children I am not looking to capitalize off a very sad and heartbreaking tragic event but I am not going to give my stuff away either.

The bike has approximately 8100 miles on it. I am the original owner of this bike and it has been garage kept all its life. Never been down or wrecked. I have about $10,000 total invested in this bike. I am looking to trade this bike for some guns plus cash or all straight across for the right guns. The pictures below are large please allow them time to load, they are quality pics that show a lot of detail. Ok, here are some of the options this bike has on it. Cobra Drag Pipes w/o baffles. It's loud and sounds like a Harley. Clear turn signal and tail light lenses all the way around, with LED bulbs in each. This bike has been lowered approximately 1"" all around. Mapam forward controls to give a little more relaxed riding position. It has a K&N air filter inside the air box, and Barnett Heavy Duty Clutch springs have been added. The wheels and hubs have been professionally powder-coated black to match the paint, with the spokes being left natural aluminum color. Brand new front & rear Dunlop Wide Whitewalls with less than 1500 miles on them. Also numerous chrome items have been added like switch housings, new wide-style levers, Cobra 2"" pullback risers, riser clamp, master cylinder cover, radiator cover, horn cover, coolant cap cover. This bike currently has the Memphis Shades brand full fairing with the short 5"" black windshield. Memphis Shades Honda Shadow mounting brackets for said fairing. Hogtunes Audio system with handlebar mount for an MP3, or satellite radio receiver. National Cycle Cruiseliner Hard Saddlebags and their respective mounting brackets. These last 3 parts the fairing, Hogtunes system, and the hard bags alone would cost you over $1600 to purchase separately. This bike is only 750CC, but it's very powerful and everyone always mistakes it for at least an 1100CC just looking at it. It fits in with the big boys. This is a very well taken care of bike, I would rate it a 9 out of 10. This bike is a great looking bagger, so if you want a nice bike you owe it to yourself to at least come take a look at this bike. If this ad is still up on Armslist then I still have the bike.  Also, I'm not hurting for money and I know what this bike is worth. I respond to all emails promptly as I receive them. Feel free to ask any questions you may have."

37,http://www.armslist.com/posts/745037,For Sale:  New Custom Multicam Ghillie Suit made from Propper,"South Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, December 30, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is my Ghillie Suit I made AFTER Sniper School in 2010 for my 2011-2012 Afghanistan Deployment. I took this ghillie suit to Afghanistan and back(minus the hat, used my original hat from sniper), but I was in an SDM role instead of a Sniper role and I did not use it. I am in need of money for a firearm project thus I am selling. It took me over three months to make and I have receipts showing a total investment of over $1,000(I must keep for tax purposes). The ghillie hat was finished this year. The hat and netting were new and professionally sewn on by a local seamstress. It took me 8 hours to put the Jute on the boonie cap.

My total price is less than the price of the materials and seamstress labor alone! Making these is monotonous and time consuming! This is not a cookie cutter ghillie suit that is mass produced; this suit is intended and designed for combat operations. You will not find another one of this quality and in this condition for this price that is made by a US Army Sniper trained soldier; or one that has gone to Afghanistan and back and still in new condition... I worked out all the kinks from my actual Sniper School ghillie suit (pictured). The only thing I did not get around to is cutting air vents into it the hat, jacket and pants before I put the jute on; these things get hot in the summer. . .

This multicam Ghillie suit is NEW! (HAS NOT BEEN THROUGH GHILLIE WASH YET!) It was made from Propper brand jacket and pants! It's way more durable than the issued multicam uniforms. The canvas and netting were professionally sewn (have receipts). All seems have been Shoe-Goo'd and painted! Elbow and knee pads have been installed in the perfect position for sniper crawl. There are a bunch of tan 550 cord tie downs.

Package includes:

Multicam Ghillie Hat - Size: 7 1/4
Multicam Ghillie Jacket - Size: Medium Regular
Multicam Ghillie Trousers - Size: Small Regular Pants fits up to 34"" waist.
Comes with used Heavy Duty Dickies suspenders
Black sleeping bag stuff sack that fits all (has a blown seam, but still holds suit fine.)

Note: I took the the field pictures of this ghillie suit on the 23rd of Dec. This suit works nearly year round in this area(obviously not in the snow) and in Afghanistan. I had just taken the suit out of the stuff sack, it is not normally wrinkled and stiff looking. I highly recommend that you put this suit through a ghillie wash, and remember 70% of your suit in the field should be natural veg! The last picture is myself in 2010 in a ghillie suit of the same design but built from DCUs.

$400 cash or best offer, I am in no rush to sell. I am available weekends and weekdays. I can send larger pictures, production pictures, and will meet for inspections. Please call Nate at REDACTED if you're interested."

No trades please.  I need cash for medical bills.

I have a Colt M4 LE 6920 with MOE hand guard, vertical grip, pistol grip, and 2 point bungee sling.  It also comes with the original box, original two 20-round clips, and cleaning kit.

This is the military and law enforcement model; however, in 2012 Colt stopped marking them as “restricted” so it simply has the M4 roll mark.  Sweet!!!

I bought it new a couple of months ago.  I shot only 60 rounds through it to sight it in.  It works and looks flawless.  No problems at all.  Like brand new.

I am including the surefire 6PX tactical light (200 Lumen) seen mounted on the right side of the hand guard.  It has a thumb on/off switch that is easy to operate with the vertical grip.  200 Lumen is a huge amount of power and it works perfect.

If you live in Ohio and are legally capable of owning a rifle, I can sell this to you without going through an FFL.  If you live outside of Ohio then shipment through an FFL is required.  You have to show me proof of OH residence.  I live at area code 45106 and I am willing to meet you up to 1 hour away from my location but please do not ask me to drive further.

Make me a CASH offer.  I am not listing a price because I keep seeing these get flagged for removal.  I will not respond to low bids.  This is the real deal!!!  It is LNIB.

If I cannot get a good price I will most likely list on GB.  Short supply on these is driving the price up.

The manufacturing date of the complete lower is 4/30/2010.  All POF lower receivers are machined from 7075 aluminum, and are MilSpec type III hard coat anodized.  They have a flaired magwell for speed loads.

The manufacturing date of the SIG US516-16 upper is 4/13/2011.  SIG SAUER® advanced short-stroke pushrod system. This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment. Features a free-floating, aluminum, M1913 quad rail and 1:7 right-hand twist bore configuration.

An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts.

Model #14 Randall with nickel silver hilt, stainless blade, and black leather sheath. I bought this over twenty years ago and it has spent most of it's time in my safe.

There may be some very small scratches on the blade from being in and out of the sheath or what ever, but my camera won't pick those up. Beautiful knife.  Please check out my other ads.

What I am trying to get across is that if you have need of automotive services or custom metalwork, I can help you out.  

I figured since the world didn't end maybe you have more guns and ammo than you need.  So I would be willing to trade my labor for your firearms.  

Or maybe you want a custom built bugout truck. Or an apocalypse proof war wagon....or maybe you need a transmission replaced so you can get to work.  I want to help you out and guns are as good as money in my book.

It has a tapco adjustable length stock and a B.E.C. Gold label 5x42 scope with lighted reticle. I do not have the original stock that was on the gun. I bought the scope and mounted it but have not dialed it in yet. This gun shoots very well and has been good to me. I have never had any jams with it or any other problems. The only reason i am selling it is i just don't have time to shoot it anymore and it is just taking up space. There is a little bluing that has came off from it leaning but it is in very good shape still.If interested email me on here. Thanks Joe

COMES OFF THE MARKET THIS WEEK AND WILL RETURN WHEN THE BAN TAKES EFFECT. (You know its coming, don't lie to yourself)

Straight talk, real talk. Prices are still going up. This will not last at this price. If you are sitting on the fence I suggest you decide before the next round of increases. The $2000 guns from last week are bringing $3000. They are expensive but available now; better than totally unavailable later. Or the prices may drop as fast as they rose. I don't know. You roll the dice.

I wish I had bought gold at $300/ounce. I did not and the price went up to current market values. I have always maintained that the price of these Colt's with restricted roll marks would sky rocket but no one believed me and yet here is the proof. Type in ""colt restricted"" in the search block to see current market prices. I am not asking top dollar but current market value.

If you believe in the free market and want a quality AR collectible at a fair market price, buy this. It is a COLT with Colt heritage, and Colt quality. It is not some frankenAR slapped together in a machine shop or basement by some guy who has never before installed a trigger group. There is a reason they say ""never fired"" in those listings, they are afraid to. My price is firm and non-negotiable. Please do your homework prior to contacting me. Only compare apples to apples, not Colt SP1 prices without roll marks. You will see this is a good deal in today's market.

I deal in cash, FTF, and require a Concealed Carry Permit or Pistol Permit, NC ID and a signed Bill of Sale.

The AR-15A3 model AR6721 is an exceptional patrol rifle with tactical accuracy chosen by federal, state and local agencies.

The telescopic butt stock adjusts to four positions to enhance mobility and fit to a wider range of operators. In position, the removable carrying handle provides an M16A4 target style sight adjustable for windage and elevation to 600 meters.

To be forthright, I paid $800 for this rifle and have never fired it.  Obviously, due to demand, prices have went up significantly and I cannot replace it for anywhere near that price.

This AR-15 is an ATI manufactured flat top receiver. It comes with 1 30 round magazine, a detachable carry handle, hard case, and cable lock.

The first person who can pay $1800 cash gets it.  No haggling.  The price is high and firm because I would have to pay that much to get another one.  I wish it wasn't that way, but unfortunately these are the times we live in.  I am willing to deliver in Chattanooga or Knoxville tonight or tomorrow."

FIVE for $250. CONTRARY TO WISHFUL THINKING PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE. GET THESE WHILE YOU CAN. (CONFIRM PRICES ON EBAY.) Or you can wait to see if they go back down or...? Well we are all thinking it aren't we.

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine.

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floorplate when not in use to prevent possible loss. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

Short Yugo Correct flash horn hider and original M92 trigger group (Tapco G2 installed) 2x 30 round Yugo mags, Yugo cleaning kit, Yugo Military Sling, and mag/ammo pouch.
   This is an original Yugoslavian Military factory Short Barreled AK47 with a 10.5 inch barrel with a 5.5inch spot welded hollow horn style flash hider to make it 16inch legal rifle without having to obtain an SBR stamp first. It can be removed and the original short horn flash hider re-enstalled once you obtain your tax stamp for an SBR weapon. This is truely a collectors AK47 and the absolute rarest of the Yugo factory made Short Barreled AK47 and it's NEW. Look around you will not be able to find one like this anywhere! This is not a cheapo Romainian WASR 10/63 AK or Chineese Norinco made AK crap that people here are asking tripple price for...this is the absolute best AK47 made next to an original Russian made AK!! I had two of them...this is my last one!

*Note* The last picture only shows what it would look like as it was originally made from the factory as an SBR (Short Barreled Rilfe) If you were to buy one already as an SBR you would have to wait 8 months for the stamp before you could even take possession of it! with mine you can buy it now, take possession of it, shoot it, enjoy it, and at your leasure get you tax stamp to make it an SBR if you choose to!

One of the most popular trends has been the rise of lower wattage micro stacks and Krank Amps has lead the way with the Rev Jr., the 20W version of the monster Rev Series 1 head and cabs and the first in the line of the Jr. Series of small amps. The Rev Jr. boasts an all tube dual channel head (two 5881′s, three 12AX7′s) with boost switch and tube-driven active effects loop that gives even the most discerning tube amp enthusiasts an array of tones ranging from clean to high gain.

The Rev Jr. cabinet is one versatile little cab! It was originally designed as a studio cab prototype at the Krank factory and was used a lot during the development of the Rev Jr. heads. We liked the look and sound so much what was going to be a combo became a stack!
It features a 13 ply baltic birch shell and is loaded with the same premium Eminence Legend V12 speakers as the Rev 4×12. Because the Legend is rated at 120W this cab easily handles full size heads as well and is ideal for home rehearsal, studio use, club gigs, or personal onstage monitoring.

High Capacity Magazine

The MWG 90 Rounder high capacity magazine for the AR-15/M16 provides you with the finest in state-of-the-art high capacity magazine design. The 90 Rounder's innovative snail-drum design and advanced space-age materials are combined to create a very light, completely reliable, low maintenance, high capacity magazine that will withstand a level of heavy field use that would destroy a metal magazine, while weighing 33% less.

The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 is designed for 5.56mm NATO or .223 Remington ammunition.

The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 is designed to be close to maintenance free. Never remove the silver-gray Teflon lubricant powder. Never Use any oil-based lubricant. Never disassemble MWG products, and never disassemble the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 .

The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 contains small parts & springs that may cause injury if improperly released. If repairs are required, return the magazine to MWG Company for repair. Any disassembly, alteration, re-adjustment, improper installation, or misuse of any MWG product voids all warranties.

Never attempt to load the 90 Rounder into the weapon or detach the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 from the weapon, with a cartridge in the chamber. Always lock the bolt back first and visually ensure the chamber is empty.

Because of its unique design, the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 can be left partially loaded for an extended period of time, but never store the 90 Rounder with more than 80 rounds loaded. Leaving the 90 Rounder for the stored with more than 80 rounds loaded may damage the springs and cause the weapon to malfunction. Never attempt to load more than 90 rounds. Loading more than 90 rounds may damage the magazine.

Always avoid lethal situations whenever possible. High capacity magazines such as the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 are intended to eliminate re-loading downtime for persons in unavoidable potentially lethal situations, but no product can fully protect the user from injury or death in a firefight. The knowing use of MWG products, when a potentially lethal situation could be avoided, will constitute an assumption of the known risks of engaging in a lethal situation.

LOADING 
The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 must generate energy to reliably feed ammunition into the receiver at a consistent rate. As the magazine grows full, more energy must be exerted to load additional rounds. This energy is stored in a special spring & released to move the entire ammunition load during firing. It takes a lot of energy to reliably move 90 rounds of ammunition, and so it takes a lot of energy to load those same rounds. As the magazine nears capacity, the final rounds may require substantial energy to load.

The boys that made this AR at Aero did a great job on the timing of this little guy. It’s not as loud as most pistol ARs, and points GREAT. Comes with a SIG red dot and a multi 5 setting light/laser combination. The light runs over 100 lumens (forget the right number) as has an optional pressure activation pad (zip tied to the magpul AFG). I want to trade this AR for two pistols; one for me and one for my mother for home defense and nightstand. I’m seriously fixed to the following fire arm choices for trade… but if you have one of them and perhaps another along similar lines, I’ll take the offer into consideration. Thanks for looking!

Must have ALL matching numbers (bolt, reciever cover, trigger guard, magazine, stock, etc. This means all numbers must be stamped (not electropenciled), have Cyrillic (Russian alphabet) prefixes, and must not be crossed out with a new number nearby. Must be unaltered from original condition. Must be unrefurbished (no ""xxxx"" on stock). Must include bayonet and cleaning rod. I would prefer if the cleaning kit was included but this is not absolutely necessary. Bore can be dirty but must not be pitted/corroded. Finish must be original at 90% or better (none of that black paint). Depending on condition willing to pay up to $800 (this would have to be an absolutely flawless example with pristine bore, bluing and wood). Will only buy locally.

I never thought I would sell this but, I just don't use it as much as I used to. This was built to shoot competitions and I now shoot in another class that does not allow a shotgun with detachable mags.

922r parts include, trigger, hammer, disconnector, gas puck, and 3 in each SGM mag. So you are covered.

I Started with a new and well tested s12 to guarantee function and reliability.

Charging handle was moved to left side to speed up charging and reloads. Charging handle is made from a Stainless steel forging and was turned down on a lathe.

Side mount was removed and all holes welded shut with reinforcement added to rear trunion.

Carrier and bolt were worked over by Pauly from Pauly's steelin. This improves reliability and allows you to reload with bolt closed on a full mag.

Magwell for SGM mags was fit and installed to allow for AR style mag insertion and release (drop free) no rock n lock like standard AK's.

Saftey and Mag release extensions were custom made and fitted. This allow for fast index finger operation improving ergonomics.

Tromix S12 trigger was used

HK style sights were installed, and XS sights inserts were used. This is a ghost ring style sight with a tritium insert.

True Thumb hole stock was used No dragnov crap here. We machined a custom butt-stock end plate so that we could install a recoil pad, you will not find this on any other S12.

Gun was blasted and coated with Norrels molyresin, a durable and true firearms coating.

If you would like to view the gun in person I currently have it at Jackson Guns and ammo in Henrietta NY."
