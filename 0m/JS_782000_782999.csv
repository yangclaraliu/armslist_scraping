I see on gunbroker these often go for $1200-$1500, but I'll sell it for $1000 flat on the condition that we use an FFL to do the sale.  (I bought it through a dealer, and I want the NICS system to show the transfer to someone else.)  I like using All Star Tactical as an FFL (Webster) but I'll also use pro-gun services (Victor).  I'll cover half the FFL cost.  If you want it shipped, I will ship it to your FFL for an extra $25.  The pictures only show one mag, but two are included.  Each is metal, pre-ban, and holds 30 rounds of 7.62x39.  This gun fires great - about 300 rounds fired through the gun since I've owned it, mostly Russian steel-case non-corrosive ammo.  The picture shows a strap but that is NOT included.  Contact me through this site if you have any questions.  Thanks for looking."

 Special Ruger 10/22 Takedown Supports USA Shooting Team 
July 26, 2012 
Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) and TALO Distributors, Inc. have teamed up to create a limited edition USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ rifle. This special run is limited to just 5,000 rifles, with serial numbers GOLD-0001 through GOLD-5000. A $20.00 donation will be made to the USA Shooting Team for every rifle sold. This is a historic opportunity to own a collectible Ruger® firearm and support the USA Shooting Team at the 2012 Olympic games. 

""We are proud to team up with TALO to support the USA Shooting Team,"" said Ruger Vice President of Sales & Marketing Chris Killoy. ""Every person that buys this rifle will be part of a team contributing $100,000 to support USA Olympic Shooters, and we're excited that Ruger and our popular 10/22 Takedown™ rifle are part of this patriotic fundraising effort,"" he concluded.

The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is a stainless steel rifle with a distinct blue stock. Like all 10/22 Takedown™ rifles, the barrel and forend are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction-fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but rarely needs re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is also shipped in a special red ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features the USA Shooting Team logo. The bag features internal sleeves, which hold the two subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options."

The magazine capacity is 8+1, and the firearm can be operated in pump or semit-automatic mode.  

This was originally designed as a tactical shotgun from the ground up and this is the reason behind the firearm being capable of operating in manual pump or semi-automatic mode.  The manual pump mode is to be used if you want to fire non lethal rounds (i.e. less powder and less blowback force) that dont contain enough charge to chamber another round via the blowback gases.

I am asking $1700.00 and I am factoring the hook not being included with this weapon.  These sell regularly on www.gunbroker.com for $1800-$2000+  Judging wear marks and the barrel this is a very low round count weapon, and is in overall great condition.

Only one magazine will be included.  Your choice of a 15 round magazine or 17 round magazine.  The 17 round magazine will stick out slightly.

It comes in the newer style Glock box.

The previous owner was a real smart one and decided to mount a laser by drilling a few holes into the trigger guard.  They don't affect the performance of the gun obviously, but can be slightly ugly.  May be an easy project to fill with epoxy or just leave the gun alone.

It is a great shooter and accurate too.  No problems.  It is a Gen2 Glock, aren't they invincible??  :tophat:

The rifle is brand new in box, never fired. It has a side collapsing stock to shorten overall length when maneuverability is an issue with more punch than the 5.56. It will accept all other AK mags, even the cheap ones.  I have another one of these that I have fired and two other AK's. This rifle is better balanced and fires better than either of my AK's.  (they are not cheapo’s) This rifle comes with the Sig red dot optic, one thirty round Sig magazine, and one hundred rounds. This rifle's manufacture date is October 2012, so it is the latest gen. There will be those guys that will rant and rave about the demand driving up the prices, but this rifle will go for $2100. Please look around before you pass judgment on the price. There are very few listed out there and getting them is not likely. I am listing it now, but it will go to the show with me this weekend. After going to the small show last weekend, I know I will not have any problems selling it. I just would rather not lug it around and have every golly gaucker offer me $1000.

The M9 Semiautomatic is a 9x19mm Parabellum pistol that was adopted in 1985 as the ofﬁcial sidearm of the United States military after winning a competition in the 1980s, beating out many other contenders. The 92F survived exposure to temperatures from -40°F to 140°F, being soaked in salt water, being dropped repeatedly on concrete, and being buried in sand, mud and snow. Additionally, the 92F proved a MRBF (mean rounds before failure) of 35,000 rounds, the equivalent to ﬁve or six times the pistol’s service life. It ofﬁcially entered service in 1990. The Chiappa M9-22 is a replica of the US Military sidearm chambered in .22 rimﬁre and is available in two versions, the Standard model featuring ﬁxed front sight and windage adjustable rear sight, and the Tactical model with novak style ﬁber optic sights. The standard model is available with black plastic or wooden grips; the tactical model is supplied with black plastic grips"

Each crate is supposed to hold 1400 rounds, packed on clips in bandoleers. I've never actually opened them to be sure. The writing on the crates is long faded, so I cannot determine the year of manufacture--though I can make out the Ankara label.

The Turks loaded their 8x57 with 154 gr. cupro-nickel bullets. Of course the cartridges are Berdan primed and they're also corrosive. These have a reputation for being relatively warm loads, and many shooters will only fire them in the 98 Mauser variants.

I have two crates available and am asking $300 per crate. You can compare that to the $280 that J&G is asking for Persian 8x57 (1000 rounds, packed loose, guaranteed to have hangfires and misfires). In other words, this is probably the best price you're going to find on 8x57 ammunition of this quality.

It is old and shows signs of having been holster carried--see photos.  It is marked on the left side as ""V. BERNARDELLI - MODEL 90 - CAL 22 L.R. / GARDONE V.T. MADE IN ITALY.""  The right side is marked with the Interarms sunburst logo.  The left side grips are marked ""VB,"" while the right side grips displat an Interarms (?) crossed rifles logo.  Various other hallmarks and the serial number are also stamped into the right side of the gun body and slide.
The pistol is not rusted, but the bluing has worn froom the nose--which should be evident in one of the photos--and this appears to be holster wear.  Otherwise, this is one primo handgun: slide trigger, stepped blade front sight, adjustable rear sight, knurled hammer, ergonomically pleasing grips, 10 shot magazine (10+1 cap), pinkie extension on magazine, positive thumb safety, European attractiveness (looks a lot like 007's Walther).
The grips make the gun feel like a natural extension of the hand as the are widened at the base and the magazine extension offers a feel that is not common among .22s.
This is an old piece, and it is fully functional, but it ain't perfect: It is heavy--not a composite or plastic piece to be sure--it is made of steel.  And the piece is finicky toward ammunition: it will not cycle with low velocity shells; however it is a humming machine with hot ammo (Remington Yellow Jackets or similar).
The first $300 cash buys it.  I am open to offers, but I am not going to give it away."

Zastava, Serbia (former Yugoslavia), AK-47 M70 PAP rifle in 7.62x39 caliber. This rifle has an RPK heavy duty receiver, complete with 16"" barrel, solid wood stock and forearm, synthetic pistol grip for 922(r) compliance, slant muzzle break, and a weaver style scope rail buiilt into the receiver cover. Comes with a 30rd magazine. Superior quality AK by Zastava! This is even better quality than the already well-respected MAK-90, or even the pre-ban 56-S, and definitely much nicer quality than any of the Romanian/US WASR series of rifles.

When I got a close look at this particular AK, I sold my MAK-90 and bought it. Up until then, the MAK-90 was hands down my favorite AK...but now it is this one....and it is my last AK. I never got around to firing it because I kept it for my collection, but over the past year, I have become more interested in collecting handguns and WWII rifles.

I purchased this new at a licensed gun store right here in New York State, so this is definitely New York legal. You will see a lot of these for sale in gun stores throughout New York, but don't be fooled: Many of these have the single stack mag and unless you look carefully before buying, you won't know until you get it home. Many others only have composite furniture. Not the case with this one. This definitely takes a standard double-stack mag and definitely has beautiful high quality real wood. Both Eastern European AK mags fit and Chinese AK mags fit.

ID required from anyone as part of sale. Current/former law enforcement, current/former military, and NY State Pistol Permit holders all preferred, but still with applicable ID. If you have a felony conviction or psychiatric issues anywhere along the line, please skip this ad and move on.

Price is $1400 or reasonable offer. If F-T-F with ID is not possible, I can ship this to a licensed FFL holder of your choice anywhere in the US, as long as their license is current and you pick up the tab for the actual shipping and packing cost.

This rifle is classified as a Category 2 Assault Weapon by The State of California DOJ, per Penal Code §12276(e), (http://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/pdfs/firearms/forms/awguide.pdf) and is therefore not for sale to anyone in California or wherever else prohibited. If the 30-round mag is an issue where you live, I can ship the gun without the mag and we'll knock something off the final price (or replace with a 5 or 10 round mag, if you'd rather).

Additional pictures available.

I originally received this in a trade and I did not care for it.  If you know what an ARCHANGEL is, then you know that these came out with a very cheesey bayonet (made of polymer).  

Being a gunsmith, I opted to modify this as NO other ARCHANGEL was modified before.  Since the original design was that to look like an AR15, I decided to make this look even moreso like one.  I took the original length of the barrel and cut it down (professionally on my Smitty lathe).  The length (from the original receiver) is 16.25 inches which is the legal length of a rifle.  I then added a real AR15 front sight assembly to the barrel.  The flashhider (A2 birdcage type) was added and permanently pinned & welded.  If you notice in the picture, the bayonet is an actual  M10 military issue bayonet (BRAND NEW), and it fits like a glove.  And before you ask, YES...this weapon was sighted in and the front sight is not canted (as the weapon is on target).

When I first got this rifle, it DID NOT come with a rear sight, and the standard AR15 sight was a little too high for the sight picture.  So I took a rear AR sight that you see on this and cut some of it down (from the upper portion of the base), and now it is sighted in beautifully.  

Go to YOUTUBE.COM and look at these ARCHANGEL .22's, and you will see that there is NOT any that look exactly like this.  And of course none of those other ones have a real bayonet that attaches as this one does.  

With this package I have included 4 standard 10 round magazines, 2 30-round magazines, a M10 military issue bayonet, a BSA GREENDOT, and a BRAND NEW tactical rifle case (not pictured ).  One of the 30-round magazines ( the clear one) has a crack on the backside.  This was one of the magazines that I received in trade with the rifle.  The black 30-round magazines is BRAND NEW as well as 3 of the standard 10-round magazines.

It is a fun weapon to shoot.  If you are looking for a total awesome weapon for the ZOMBIE invasion, then this would be something that you should truly consider.

You don't see these very often and this ones got extras!! Includes all 4 standard barrels; 3 that appear to be not fired through ever. I have shot this once using the 2"" barrel that was mounted on it. It's pretty solid. The 8"" full lug vented barrel is mounted on it now, and you have to admit it looks pretty damn cool. The pistol pack also includes the barrel tool and the suitcase it came in. So, to summarize, you get the gun, suitcase, barrel tool, and a total of 6 barrels....a 2"", 4"", 6"", 8"" standard barrel pack, including barrel nuts for each barrel; making up the set. You also get a vented 8"" barrel, shroud, and nut; and the much sought after 8"" full lug heavy vented barrel, shroud, and nut The original boxes that the 2 extra 8"" barrels came in will be included along with the original packing paper. The 8"" barrels alone are selling for over $160 by themselves on Gunbroker. Dan Wesson wants a whole lot more. The pistol packs recently listed are over $1300 by themselves on Gunbroker. If you don't need or want the extra barrels, reesell them and offset your cost for the pack. Everything is very pretty and shiny; and if you know Dan Wesson products, you know the quality. Make sure you are allowed to have this in your posession before bidding....know your local laws. Shipping from my FFL to yours, unless you live in Northern Virginia. If you want to come pick it up, bring the proper I.D. which you knew already. I'll flex on the price a bit, but not too much. Heck, it's cheaper than an AR 15 and so is the ammo."

It is an Ishapore 2A1 and comes with the correct bayonet, scabbard & frog, and leather sling. (I'm super particular about making sure that my guns have the real, historically authentic, original, correctly as-issued accessories. I do not like having to deal with reproduction accessories or accessories that are from a similar weapon and are 'close-enough' to being correct. You won't find any better than these.) ""The Ishapore 2A/2A1 has the distinction of being the last bolt-action rifle designed to be used by a regular military force (other than specialized sniper rifles)"" This is the newest bolt action military rifle you can get. They kept making these well into the 70s and its been said that the factory may have been continuing slowly assembling more of them from spare parts even up till the early 80s. This particular rifle is maker marked ""RFI"" (Rifle Factory Ishapore) and the date marking is 1966 and is in good shape with its original 20rd magazine. I've never done it, but I think you can use regular 7.62 nato stripper clips (like for the M14 or FAL) to load it faster as well, it has a spot in the receiver's bridge to accept the stripper clip. It has a very clean bore and it has the strongest rifling I have ever seen in an ex-military rifle. It has a 1 in 12"" twist rate, which is about ideal for the 147 grain or 155 grain ammo you'd use in an FAL or G3/CETME, so you should be great with most 7.62 NATO ammo,  should even be OK with the heavier 160-168 grain stuff meant for the M14 and M1A/etc. It is being sold with a historically correct Indian made leather sling, this sling is still new and in its original wrapper and looks like it is in amazing condition (it is a real, original 2A/2A1 sling, but it is unused, 'New Old Stock').  

Most important of all, it comes with a nearly new, really hard to find, historically correct, original Indian bayonet (this is a late, made in India, ""II*"" (Mk. II*) model bayo specifically intended/made for the 2A/2A1, a real 'clip point' bayo. It is NOT one of the crummy cut down .303 Enfield bayos from WWII you always see with Ishapore 2A/2A1 or, god forbid, one of the .303 Enfield sword bayos. It comes with its original scabbard (also in GREAT shape) and frog which is correct and new as well. Because of India's desire to be able to use existing .303 Enfield parts as much as possible, the 2A/2A1 shared nearly/essentially the same nose piece/bayonet lug as the .303 Enfield. This offered the convenient fact that any P'07 type bayonet or later bayonet that fit the same attachment specifications could be used on the 2A/2A1, and thus India was initially able to simply re-use old bayonets. As time went on though, and supplies of old bayonets still acceptable for use began to dwindle, India eventually began making new bayonets specifically for the 2A/2A1 (of the bayos made for the 2A/2A1; the Mk I, Mk I* and Mk I** models were made from P'07 bayonets that were cut down, sometimes had other slight modifications and were then refinished; but most model Mk II, Mk II* and Mk III were actually manufactured brand new). This is a little known fact and is often obscured further by peoples confusion between the brand new late models and the few late models that were made from cut down re-used .303 Enfield bayonets. Real Mk II, Mk II* and Mk III bayos made new will not have any proof-marks/hallmarks on the blade, the few cut down .303 Enfield bayonets that were re-manufactured to Mk II, Mk II* or Mk III specs will have their blades stamped with either their original british or colonial indian hallmark or will have the orginial hallmark ground off and/or over-stamped with a post-colonial/""free"" indian hallmark. As a result there are alot of people who actually have a 2A or 2A1 and don't know that India actually made brand new bayonets for this rifle, there are even some people who don't know any better and insist that India only re-used cut down bayos from older .303 models and never made any new ones... that is how hard to find they are! This bayo cost me $143 and I had to have it shipped from a knife collector in England who specializes in bayonets. I really can't say just how incredibly nice, and super rare it is to find the correct RFI 2a/2a1 bayonet instead of a generic Enfield bayonet. I was just reading that it took another guy 6 years to find one for his Ishy 2A1. I won't go so far as to say for sure that you will never see one again with the correct bayonet, but it is pretty darn likely you won't unless your searching pretty darn hard. 

The only accessory that I wanted to have for this rifle but do not is a correct, Indian made, cleaning kit to go in the trap-door in the butt-stock. The reason I don't have one is because I searched high and low and could not find an authentic one, all I could find was original cleaning kits for the .303 Enfield and reproductions of the cleaning kits for the .303 Enfield. If you want one, but don't care if it is an 'authentic' original Indian one, the reproductions are like $10-$20 on ebay/gunbroker/etc.






I AM ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO SEND ME ANY AND ALL REASONABLE OFFERS!!!!! I may accept some trades, see just below. (When making offers, please keep in mind that a certain very large, green and yellow, chain sporting good store in La Vista that is known for having very reasonable prices on guns and accessories is currently selling an adulterated/""sporterized"" 2a1 for $489.99 with just the one magazine and nothing else!) Soo many have been cut down/sporterized, the one I'm selling is still in military configuration and comes with the new in wrap/nearly new historically-correct accessories! I also know how much my rifle and accessories are worth, but I also understand that over the last few weeks most people have blown all their cash on AR-15 stuff and thus I am open to any reasonable offers. Like I said, somebody else is selling a 'sporterized' chopped down (ruined really) Ishapore with no accessories for $489, so if your gonna try to low ball me by a lot keep that in mind.

TRADES:
I may also accept in trade (partial or whole depending on just what you have) some guns and/or gun related items. Feel free to ask if I'm interested in what you have, I don't bite, the worst I can say is ""thank you but no"". 
Here is a loooong list of things I am particularly interested in: ANY GUNS, ANY RHODESIAN STUFF, AR UPPERS!!!!! (any size/any length/any caliber), AR LOWERS, AR Bolt Carrier Group, AR charging handle, 1911 magazines or supplies, AR magazines or supplies, FAL mags or supplies or related stuff, some South African military stuff, 7.62 NATO ammo (I still have a starving FAL to feed), other ammo (7.62x54R, 7.5x55 Swiss, 7.7 Jap, 6.5 Jap, .270 Win, .30-06, .308 Win, 7.62x39, 5.56 NATO/.223, .25 acp, .32acp, 9mm Luger/Parabellum, 9mm Makarov, .40S&W, .45acp, .44 Mag, 12ga & 20ga, and possibly some other calibers and some rimfire ammo), motorcycles or motorcycle stuff, automotive stuff, airplane stuff, some boat stuff (seats), welding related stuff (especially OxyAcetylene regulators/hoses/torches or mixing bodies, or MIG wire (flux or no-flux) or a CO2/AR/AR-CO2mix/other MIG gas bottle), or cameras/photography related equipment. Again, if you want to trade something I didn't mention, please, don't hesitate to ask me.

If your still interested, here's a little more reading on the Ishapore 2A/2A1 from wikipedia:


The Rifle 7.62mm 2A/2A1 (also known as the Ishapore 2A/2A1) is a 7.62mm NATO (7.62x51) calibre bolt-action rifle adopted as a reserve arm by the Indian military in 1963. The design of the rifle - initially the Rifle 7.62mm 2A - began at the Ishapore Rifle Factory of the Ordnance Factories Board in India, soon after the Sino-Indian War of 1962.

The Ishapore 2A/2A1 has the distinction of being the last bolt-action rifle designed to be used by a regular military force other than specialized sniper rifles. Due to fluctuating supplies of affordable .303 British ammunition, the Ishapore rifles are becoming increasingly popular with civilian shooters and collectors in Australia, United Kingdom and the United States.

Externally the Ishapore 2A/2A1 rifle was based upon (and is almost identical to) the .303 British calibre SMLE Mk III* rifle, with the exception of the distinctive “square” (10 or 12 round) magazine. The rifle was designed to allow the British Pattern 1907 (P'07) sword bayonet to be attached. There were other differences to the Ishapore 2A/2A1 rifles that include the use of improved steel (to handle the increased pressures of the 7.62mm NATO round), and a redesigned extractor to cope with the rimless round. Production of these rifles started in early 1960s and is believed to have been discontinued in 1975. The original (2A) design incorporated the Lee-Enfield rear sight which had metric graduations out to 2000 meters. The re-designated ""Rifle 7.62mm 2A1"" incorporated a more realistic 800 meter rear sight. The stock is recycled from the No. 1 Mk. III armory stock, with the addition of a cross screw forward of the magazine well. Some stocks were salvaged from existing surplus and show artificer repairs where rotted or damaged wood has been replaced, this is especially evident with the recoil draws that often fail over time due to the rifle being rack stored butt down / muzzle up that allows oils and grease to migrate downwards into this critical area.

The Ishapore 2A and 2A1 rifles are often incorrectly described as "".308 conversions"". In fact, the 2A/2A1 rifles are not conversions of .303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifles: they were designed and built right from the outset to fire 7.62mm NATO ammunition.

This is a Spike’s barreled upper so it follows military specs using the correct, certified type of steel, the manufacturing process it goes through, the phosphating (including under the front sight base), the MPT & HPT testing of barrel and bolt.  The bolt carrier group is nickel boron for greater lubricity and corrosion resistance – and it looks cooler.  This is a 16” barrel and I’ve put a Rainier Arms XTC brake/hider on there that keeps this gun put when firing fast.  Report from the brake is a little louder than an A2 muzzle device and it helps keep friends back behind the firing line.  One of the more effective muzzle devices you can get 

A2 front site post (“f” marked), rear sight is magpul MBUS flip up BUIS, red dot is Primary Arms microdot on a American Defense quick detach riser that is rock solid and can come on and off without losing zero.  The red dot does a perfect lower 1/3rd cowitness with the iron sites.  BCM Gunfighter type 3 big latched charging handle on it.  There’s a Spikes ST-T2 heavy buffer (steel & tungsten) that compliments the mid-length gas system providing as reliable cycling as an AR can get allowing for greater lock-up time for the bolt which translates to less violence in the action and even improved accuracy due to allowing the gas to do its job sending the bullet.  This is about as good a setup as you could get in a battle rifle…and of course it’s only been used to kill paper, steel, Tannerite and some laptops that pissed me off.

Lower half is built from a Rock River Arms stripped lower using a Daniel Defense LPK, Buffer tube/spring kit.  Magpul CTR stock, Magpul grip (the nicer rubber overmold one), magpul trigger guard, Troy battery assist device, and three 30 round magpul mags with windows, and a 20 round magpul mag.

On the mid-length magpul MOE handguard is a scout light mount that I’ve used with a Streamlight TLR1S weaponlight that puts the controls perfect for a “thumb-over-bore” grip with your support hand.  I’ve also got a 5 slot pic rail attached firmly to the bayo lug which allows me to use a small, micro pistol laser (laserlyte) that let’s me play with a laser on the gun.  The laser does not come with the gun but the bayo lug mount does.

Well over $1500 put into this gun.  Probably 800ish rounds through it flawlessly.  Meticulously and carefully cleaned after each use.  Only lubricant used was tw25b grease on all rubbing surfaces.  I can hit 300 yard iron plates standing unsupported 8 out of 10 times with this gun with any ammo I’ve used.  This gun has only had brass cased factory ammo through it..no steel, no handloads.

They want to pass an awb in Northbrook. If it happens expect other cities to follow. Please pass this on and come support the 2nd Amendment. We need to flood that building and put overwhelming pressure on the committee leaders. Let them know that law abiding gun owners will not give up their rights. Let these people know that Northbrook businesses will be boycotted if they attack gun owners.

--------update------

This gun has been shot, but not by me. I bought from the widow of a very serious collector last year. The gun has been pampered and is mint. Looks like less than 100 rounds.

I'm a collector, not a dealer, so there is the rare opportunity to buy without paperwork. 

I don't need cash so I'm not desperate to sell, just willing to if right deal. I'm heavily invested in this gun and won't sell for a loss. I've also been told that Barrett is 2.5 years back ordered on this gun. So, if ban happens, prices will go thru roof as these people's orders are cancelled.

If you ask what's my bottom dollar I will ignore you (4 of those so far). You are welcome to make an offer. If it looks feasible that we can put together a deal, I'll contact you.

Mechanically in great shape. Problems are small ones. Known problems: 1) there is a pretty large crack in the plastic of the dash, 2) driver side mirror needs to be replaced, 3) Tires are getting a little worn (probably need to replace in 10K miles or so), 4) one of the gauges needs a new light bulb, 5) one of the interior overhead lights is out, 6) paint is weathered (about what you'd expect for an 11 year old truck) and stacks need a new coat of paint."
