I just dont have the time/money to play with this gun and am going majority AR.  

IM really not interested in trades that come nowhere near the value of this gun...I've listed this on here before and been swarmed with people trying to trade me antique/off brand/knockoff guns, stuff from their parts box, and usgi 30 round magazines they didnt pay for.  

Rifle is sold AS IS, no warranty expressed or implied.  I am not including any ammunition or magazines with this rifle either.  If you wish to do a deal, email me, i am slightly open to negotiation on price.  im looking for an FN 20in barrel for an AR15 which could be PART of the deal.  lastly, if you are an anti-gunner and just feel like sending me some hate mail because i own rifles that load themselves from hi-cap magazines, save it.  Thanks!"

Commercial tube diameter, same threads and thread diameter as mil spec tube, screws onto any AR 15 lower. Came new on a tactical solutions AR 15. Mil Spec vs Commercial is not the threads or castle nut, it is the tube diameter for other accessories or stocks. Mil Spec threads are only minimally deeper because the tube diameter is smaller and the way the threads are cut requires the tube threds be slightly deeper. Commercial tube is larger diameter (like only thousands of and inch) and the threads are cut into the tube like a pipe is threaded not pinched up like Mil Spec is done. There it is... so the question of tube diameter should be answered. I prefer commercial because the stocks seem to fit tighter."

These units are fairly rare and unusual in that they were only produced for 1 to 1/2 years.  This one uses ""B"" type magazines, so finding magazines (present circumstances not withstanding) is not an issue as with the earlier ""Type A""

I bought the pistol new in 1994.  The one magazine that came with it is a 15 round magazine.  It was imported by Action Arms Limited.   Unlike the CZ-75B currently sold by CZ-USA, the transitional CZ-75 magazines do no drop free, (this was requirement by the European military and police clients that CZ dealt with).  I have tested the pistol with Mec-gar ""B"" magazines and they feed and function just as the original CZ magazine does.  Since buying the pistol, I have fired 500+/- rounds in it."

With suprisingly light recoil this metal piercing slug has its way with TWO car doors and still has plenty of horse power to take care of business on the other side. Body armor won’t help a suspect with this round, either. We use a propriatary heat treated alloy and a magnum powder charge to make this 2 3/4″ shell perform like a 3 1/2″ round. You have to see this round in action to appreciate it. We use a 500 grain, heat treated, alloy slug and shove it at about 1,700 fps out of a 19″ barrel. The rounds not only penetrated completely through two car doors but also passed through the milk jugs and then one went through 2 2×4′s!! This round also has an incendiary tip that will explode with a bright flash and sparks upon impact. It is visible day or night upon impact. It will burn at 3000 degrees when it hits a sufficiently hard target. This is some extremely fun ammo to shoot and has a devastating impact. Use extreme caution when shooting this ammo, it will start fires when it explodes around flamable objects.

The Colt .22 cal. Conversion Unit can be installed on the receivers of those Colt Government Model and Gold Cup National Match semi-automatic pistols which are chambered for .45 ACP and .38 Super Auto ammunition.  The unit is designed for economical shooting practice by using .22 Long Rifle (LR) ammunition while maintaining the size, shape, balance and feel, and simulating the recoil of the larger pistols.  A floating chamber provides the simulation of the heavier recoil while assuring positive semi-automatic action from the lower impulse of .22 LR cartridges.
This .22 cal. Conversion Unit includes the following components: A barrel with floating chamber, a barrel bushing, a 10 round magazine, special slide stop, ejector, shorter recoil spring and a slide.  The slide comes with a rimfire firing pin assembly and an Accro adjustable rear sight.

Most online prices on the WASR are running at around $1200 and the ammunition is in the $500 range, if you can find it.  Because I know cash is tight for everyone, I'm up for trading.

The things that are on my trade radar are 
1. Lever action 357mag/38spl rifle 
2. Model 1911 pistol (open to most manufacturers)
3. Glock 19 
4. Taurus Judge or S&W Governor. 

I'm also in the market for a .22 pistol of some sort (Ruger SR22, Walther P22, etc) and a smaller carry pistol in 9mm of the Ruger LC9, Keltec PF9 variety.

I'd suspect that I would want two off of my list for the WASR and the ammo. Of course, like anything, it's subject to some negotiation and haggling. I'd also be willing to clean up either side of a trade with a little bit of cash, as needed.  Would also consider taking some ammunition in trade as well.  So, for the most part, I'm game for a lot of different things.  If you've got something you'd like to trade, just let me know."

This kit is taking up room at my place and it's time for it to have an owner that will enjoy it.  

Included are the installation instructions for the stock and the allen wrench needed for installation.  The instructions state it fits on a Mossberg 500/600, Maverick 88, and Remington 870.  I think the traditional style fore end came with the stock so it probably works on the Mossberg and Maverick as well.

First off, the blade is made from pure ELMAX® powdered steel for the extreme edge retention, high strength, and toughness a hard-use knife demands. It rolls out of the handle on the KVT ball-bearing system so deployment is rapid and it's ready when you need it. 

The handle is a 3-D machined flat dark earth G-10 scale on the front, and equally 3-D machined titanium on the back. A framelock with a lockbar stabilizer ensures a rocksolid lockup every time. So that this good sized knife carries comfortably, Zero Tolerance has skeletonized the liner and machined pockets in the titanium handle and framelock allowing for greatly reduced weight. To top it all off, the 0561 is equipped with ZT's new deep-carry pocketclip.

His first collaboration with Spyderco features a “flipper”—a novel blade-opening device that was pioneered by custom knifemaker Kit Carson. A flipper consists of a small lever that extends from the base of the Southard’s CTS 204P hollow-ground blade and protrudes from the back of the knife’s handle when closed. Pulling on it with your index finger creates a tension against the detent mechanism that holds the blade closed. When the detent is overcome, the blade rotates on a special captive ball-bearing pivot system and snaps authoritatively into the open position.

The Southard’s handle combines a textured Earth-brown G-10 scale and thick titanium liner on one side with a solid titanium scale on the other. The titanium scale forms the foundation of the knife’s sturdy Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L.) mechanism and features a small inlaid G-10 panel that acts as an overtravel stop when releasing the lock mechanism. It is also home to the knife’s matching stainless steel clip, which supports right-side tip-up carry.

Offering an amazing synthesis of ergonomics, functionality, and state-of-the-art materials, the Southard is one of the most advanced Spyderco folders ever produced."

Rubber cheek weld attached to stock (removable).  UTG quad rail with scope mount installed, quad rail covers included.  Original foregrip included (not shown in pictures).  Bipod stud mounted in quad rail.  Folding forward pistol grip with storage compartment.  Bayonet lug.  Flip up night sights present, but no glow left in tritium tubes.  A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase.  The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver looks great.

This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47.  The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section.  This has a gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be used with the left hand also.  The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47.  The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the 2 size peep rear sights.  There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the tritium tubes can be replaced if you search online.  

The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic.  The 12 rounders were purchased new/unfired and are designed to only fire blanks.  The blocker for live rounds was removed from each of the (5) 12 round mags and cosmoline stripped with kerosine.  There are (12) 35 round magazines.

It is a good shooters has about 100 rounds through it since coating and could use some more it is a little tight in some places but will be fine after some more rounds.
