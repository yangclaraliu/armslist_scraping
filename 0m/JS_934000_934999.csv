 I just got the pistol a couple months ago, but only used it once..
 It had no FTF or FTEs,shot about 150 rounds flawlessly.Of 6 different kinds.

 A good first gun by far, Im just looking to get a CC handgun.
 Anyways It comes with 5 Smart Reloader 100 round cases(New) worth $12 and 120 rounds of various types including Viper,CCI Velocitor,American Eagle,Winchester Varmint..Also comes with a brand new Sightmark Sureshot Reflex Sight(Red Dot)worth $50.It has 4 different patterns in red and brightness adjustment to from 1-7..
 Also comes with microfiber cleaning cloth and rubber cover for lens.Also paper packaging that came with it..Also comes with a HKS .22 Speed Loader(worth $5)
 The gun comes just like new with Beretta hard case and CA certified lock and 2 mags also all paperwork.
 So originally the gun is $250 w/tax=around $275 w/backgroundcheck = $300
 The Red Dot is $50 w/tax=around $54
 The HKS Loader is $5 something w/tax
 and the Smart Reloader Cases equal out to about $13

Wikipedia:
The Beretta 9000 pistol is a polymer framed design that retains traditional open top slide styling with modern materials. It is chambered for either the 9 x 19 mm or .40 S&W cartridges (this gun is the .40) and can be fitted with either 10 or 12 round magazines depending on the caliber. Adapters that allow the use of high capacity Beretta 92 series magazines are available but rare. Some magazines are equipped with an adjustable finger rest that can be either lowered for those with large hands or raised for those with small hands. The weapon has fixed sights that can be replaced with night sights if desired. The Beretta 9000 is most popular for its use by the character, John Anderton (portrayed by Tom Cruise) in the 2002 film Minority Report.
Includes:
Two 10 round magazines, as pictured.
50 .40 rounds, not pictured."

Sample Letter-

I'm very concerned with the actions that many of your colleagues are taking in regard to the Rights of Law Abiding Citizens to buy, own or possess firearms. I understand your job as my elected official is to defend the Constitution and our 2nd Amendment Rights. To that end I am requesting you take a stand against any further actions of this nature. In the interest of brevity I will outline my position below.

1) I DO NOT support any type of weapons ban based on cosmetic features.

2) I DO NOT support any type of ban or limit on the capacity of magazines (clips).

3) I DO NOT support a national firearm registration of any kind.

4) I  DO believe that Pennsylvanians have nothing to fear from Law Abiding Gun Owners.

5) I Do believe that any actions taken to ban or limit firearms in the hands of good Pennsylvanians to be an unjust punishment for crimes we have not committed.

*I WILL NOT vote for or support any politician that will not stand for ALL of my 2nd Amendment Rights.

Thank you for your time,"

 Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups or charging handles.

  As a note: BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.


 M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI) M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver

 In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 

T-Marked Upper Receiver 

The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 

The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 

BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.


Chrome Bore and Chamber 

One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 

Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

5.56 NATO Chambers 

The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 

Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

Government Barrel Profiles 

Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels 

Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

This drum attaches to the rifle exactly like a normal clip. No alterations to the rifle are required. Simply drop in all 75 rounds of ammo, close the cover, wind up the spring, and you are ready to fire. A wind-up drum is a great way to store a loaded magazine long-term without the worry of a compressed spring loosing its ability to deliver enough push to empty a magazine. With the drum, you don't wind up the spring until you are ready to use the drum.

The gun was imported back to the US without the right sideplate, which is legally the “frame” on this gun. AA made a new sideplate and replaced a few parts in the trigger linkage so that it is semi-auto only so, if you can own a rifle, you can own this. 

A really nice feature about Allied Armament is that they received permission to mark their name on the inside of the gun and reproduced the original General Motors, Saginaw Gear Division markings on the outside. So, other than the few Israeli marks designating the new caliber, this looks like a brand new 1940’s military machinegun. 

The gun comes mounted on a new M2 medium tripod and a really cool reproduction bronze pintle mount and T&E mechanism, giving it a cool pre-war look. 

Here’s where it’s gets really cool. Included in this package is a brand new Emory Jones Crankfire adapter, which is also no longer in production. This allows you to shoot either single fire with a thumb trigger or use the crank to spit out 7.62 at 470 rounds per minute!!! (keep in mind that the 1919 doesn’t have a quick change barrel so the sustained rate of fire is 75rpm). “Gatling type mechanisms do not fall under NFA so this completely legal to own, if you can own a single shot .22 rifle.  

If you don’t want to lug this beast around old school (a good way to have even more respect for those from the Old Corps), This will come in a used but, very good condition Hardigg Storm Case iM3300; that comes with a new foam insert set you can custom cut to fit your new gun & accessories perfectly. Best of all this is the wheeled model : ) 

If you order now, I’ll include a WWII, US, M1 ammo box, which could use refurbishing but overall very good condition. It will have about 300 reusable links and 100 rounds to get you started.  Other than the case & ammo can, everything is brand new and only used for indoor display

Compared to the $20,000 price tag for a full auto 1919 with the bonus joy of having the BATF become your best buddy, this is a deal at $4,995. 
Willing to travel a bit, ship (realize this will be costly), & I’d consider partial trades too (not limited to: 20 or 28 o/u, .308 carbines, SAA 2nd & 3rd gen .38/.357 4¾“, Python, Manurhin, Sig 556 or P-210, S&W .22.32.38/357 revolvers, Stinger 22, SVD, Whitney Wolverine, or anything cool…), I'm a C&R and could receive appropriate guns however, this is not C&R eligible & if going out of state would need to transfer through an FFL."

Right now this ammo is on sale at Fleet Farm for 4.88 a box. Whether or not they have any, I don't know. I am going to ad .12 per box (less than tax) to that price to make this lot of 36 boxes priced at $180, thats with the can.

I sold a large lot of ammo earlier this week for essentially the same price as you can get it in the store, provided they have it. So, to the few a-holes who felt the need to e-mail or text me to let me know that it costs that much at the store, then go to the f-ing store.
It's not like I went to Fleet Farm and picked this up and turned around and doubled the price.

So, this lot of ammo costs LESS than Fleet Farm+Tax and it comes in a handy ammo can.
Price is firm at 180.

It has a Daniel Defense BCG and an unknown brand charging handle.  I also have a brand new never used Surplus Arms and Ammo lower with a CMMG parts kit. I also have a buffer and a Troy medieval muzzle brake. All that is missing to complete the AR is a buffer tube, spring, stock, hand guards and a rear sight, meaning this rifle can be completed for around $150. I can sell them separately or together, but it will be cheaper to buy them together. I know how much the parts are worth so please no low balls. I am asking $1200 OBO for the whole package.  The upper by its self with the BCG is $900, the lower by itself is $400, the parts kit is $120, the muzzle brake is $50."

It has a sling that carries 6 extra cartridges, a Simmons 3x9x40 scope, rings & scope mount rail. I have a couple of boxes of shells with it. The only modification from factory is the sling mounts and they were added by a gunsmith. It has been cleaned every time it was fired and has only about 45 rounds through it since purchased new before I was born by my father's best friend. The scope holds zero very well. The ONLY sign of wear at all is the small black plastic disc below the handgrip is missing but is so unnoticeable that I didn't realize it was missing until I decided to sell it. The metal & wood is beautiful and flawless. I prefer cash but will entertain GOOD trade offers. $500.00 or Best Offer.  I also prefer to trade   FACE - TO - FACE."

I have owned this rifle for approximately 35 years and have taken around fifty some animals with this rifle, and it has never failed.

Hunt varmints all the way to the largest North American big game and most of the other world big game.

With a 160 grain boat tail with a good powder load kicking out 3200 ft muzzel velocity and consistently knock them down instantly at 200, 400, 600, 800 yards.  I personally shot over 10 deer one season at 600 + yards one at close to 800 yards, all one shot, one kill.

This rifle is ready to go hunting again.

Own a very collectable Pre-64 Model 70, Serial # 531xxx, Manufactured 1961. Equiped with a Leupold Vari X III 3.5x10 with Vari-Focus.  It comes with Sling swivels, leather sling, Pachmayr Tressel Type Butt Plate, Jeweled Bolt. All original Beautifully finished walnut stock.  

This gun is used and shows some very minor stock nicks which is to be exspected with a hunting rifle. The blueing is excellent for a used rifle, shows a little muzzel wear. This gun is better then any new off the shelf rifle as it has already proven itself and is read to go again, in addition it has collector value and will only increase in value. A new off the self rifle you might have to spend endless dollars at the range getting a gun ready just to go hunting.  

Don't be afraid to outshoot your friends with the 7 MM Mags, 300 Win Mags, or anything else.

If you know how to shoot & bet with your hunting buddies this gun will pay for itself within a couple of years.  See who gets the most one shot kills, the longest kill, the most number of kills, make the guys pay up for the game they wounded and it got away.  Heck with this gun if you know what your doing you might win enough to pay for your hunting trip."

(603) 363-GUNS

Asking $1850. If you call the shop and give them a CC on the phone, they can likely ship it for you (legal states).

I'm pretty sure this is MA and CT (other states too) compliant if you just take off the muzzle brake. Check with the shop on this one. I don't think the barrel is threaded and the stock might be fixed. With the included 10rd magazine, you should be good to go.

 USP's are smaller and lighter than the larger frame USP - SCOM. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP uses a full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
 Like their large frame predecessors, USP's are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P+ loads full time .
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
 Features & System Characteristics:
 Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
 Grooved target triggers
 Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life. 200,000 rounds design tested.

This rifle is in perfect condition and has only been removed from the box to verify its serial number and take this picture.  The rifle has jungle green surplus furniture and an 18-inch barrel.  It comes with one 20-round alloy magazine, manual, lock, scope mount, and original plastic box.  I will include the ten (10!) steel HKG3 magazines you see in the picture.

Up for sale is my 1916 Oveido Spanish Mauser rifle still originally chambered in (7x57) 7mm Mauser. A lot of these rifles were rechambered to accept 308 ammo but this one is still in 7mm Mauser which is better.  Stock has been sporterized for lighter weight/hunting. Has front and rear slings but no sling included because i dont have one for this rifle. Stock looks nice. Gun looks great overall. A nice lightweight hunting/range shooting rifle with a nice balanced feel to it and nice shooting rifle. Comes with a soft case. I am selling off a few guns i am not using right now and this is one of them. Priced to sell at $140.00 or best offer. No emails because i rarely check them. Phone calls only please.Thanks for looking.

This is a really nice out of the box AR as it has the picatinny and flip up rear with the classic A-style front sight.  The 6 position stock is really nice, as that is what is usually upgraded on the older models first, no need on this rifle.   You can email me at REDACTED or feel free to text me at REDACTED.

I will require cash and for you to show me your drivers license and sign a gun sale slip for my own protection, stating that you are aware of FL and Federal gun laws and are permissible to own a firearm under state and federal laws.  If this scares you away, well than good it probably should if you are trying to buy a gun illegally.

Due to armslist.com limitation, I can only upload 3 images of the rifle.  I have several more that I can send you upon request if you provide me your email address.

I take cash, credit card (add 2.5% for local, 3.5% if not local), money order.    
I will ship anywhere, if you cover shipping and associated fees.

EDIT: I really do not want to sell this.  So the price is 450 firm, and not a penny lower. Comparing it to my Ruger MK III Hunter, the trigger on this little Sport King is just about the BEST trigger I've ever used on any pistol.     

EDIT: Price SUBSTANTIALLY reduced because I lost the magazine.   I can include a broken magazine that you may be able to repair.

I highly recommend meeting at a range somewhere for to test firing this if you are interested in buying it.  You'll be amazed at the trigger."

It has some barrel hood wear as Sig's are noted for. I have less than 500 rounds through it since its rebuild. It has Sig night sights, two 6 round magazines, original box and papers (minus holster, which I did not get when I bought it and is a POS anyways) and laser (needs battery, too lazy to buy one). Also, spare all black plastic grips Sig gave me because the original aftermarket G10 grips had stripped screws. I installed the original aluminum grips and kept both extra sets so if you want to install the sweet G10 grips, you can find the proper screws.

This is a great little shooter, and a most excellent choice for CCW, but I'm just looking for something a bit more ""duty/full"" sized. Excellent conditon with the only significant visible wear on the front sight itself. Speaking of sights, it comes with an upgraded set of Novak's/Trijicon night sights that are VERY bright. Includes the matching factory hard case, paperwork, loader, (4) 10 round factory magazines, with (4) 3 round extentions, although I only have (2) of the extensions installed at the moment. Unknown round count as I am not the original owner, however, based on condition, I would say not very much.

Estimated trade value of $650, but it is NOT for sale, TRADE only.

I am only looking to trade straight across for an excellent+ condition Glock 17 or 19, with at least 3 magazines preferred. However, I will also consider other VERY GOOD-EXCELLENT condition, QUALITY brands like: Beretta, Sig Sauer, FNH, etc. I would like something that is rated for +P ammo with at least a 15 round capacity.

Sorry, but NO WWII guns, Hi-Points, Rugers, or Taurus handguns.

You MUST be legal to purchase a handgun in the state of Colorado. A basic bill of trade with signature is required, as is a check of ID's for both of us. This is NOT an option. LEO or CCW holder preferred.
