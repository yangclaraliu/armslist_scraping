I have some black non-window P-Mags for sale. Some New in wrapper some new out of wrapper. All have dust covers. The only reason is purchase a new G-27. So no trades other than a G-26 or a G-27. Considering current conditions these seem to be going pretty high when you can find them. I have seen them over $60 each.  I am going to start at $40.00 each and I will start with 10 mags for sale. If you need more I have a few more I might sell. Again, I know this is a lot more than they sell for but supply and demand seems to be dictating the market at the moment.

Late serial number Colt, with the shouldered cylinder (not bored straight through like early model colts. Means you can shoot them without the moon clips). The finish on this piece is good, so good I couldn't believe it was original. I was told by a gunsmith that it was likely an Arsenal Refurbished gun (for WWII), but was probably never issued. I would rate the finish at a strong 97%-98%. The grips are original and correct military grips, but I have not taken them off. The bore is super bright with ZERO pitting, lands and grooves look nearly unshot. The serial number on the receiver and crane match each other, but not the grip frame (another reason I suspect arsenal refurbishing). This is a very collectable WWI revolver, in fantastic condition.

Late 90's JCM2000 DSL 100w amp head & custom cab in a vintage white and checker. 2 channels, 2 modes per channel, EQ, & reverb, installed is a MOD reverb tank and upgraded rca's, sounds much better than the accutronics. Has EH pre & JJ power tubes in it, only a couple hours of play time, amp is quite with not abnormal noise. This one is over 10 years old, not the newer cheep versions they sell now. Comes with the footswitch for channel & reverb, a very nice black vinyl head cover, power & speaker cables. The cabinet is a clone of an early 70's Marshall 4x12 cabinet done with genuine Marshall white tolex & grill cloth, stamped steel handles and heavy casters. It was not cheap, made with 3/4"" baltic birch and all the Marshall gear, then the speakers in it puts it over the top. Electro-Voice EVM 12L speakers, these are originals from the 80's, NOT the new reissues, in perfect condition that can be seen in the pictures, very hard to find mint, matched originals. The current reissues of these sell for $249 a speaker. The cab is wired for 8Ohms 800wRMS (yes, these speakers are 200w each and will take any amp every made thrown at them)"

I bought this Colt AR-15 new in August and have since put about 300 rounds through it.  I have meticulously cared for it and it’s in like-new condition.  This is a Colt, so it’s always performed perfectly with no issues.  I’d like to sell it before I can’t (given the upcoming legislation), and give someone the chance to buy and enjoy it before they can’t!

Most folks recognize that Colt makes the premier AR-15, and this one is no exception.  This is the SP6920, the most popular, well-regarded AR-15 chambered in 5.56mm/.223 with a 1/7” twist.   The stamp on the lower receiver reads “Colt Sporter M4 Carbine Ser. SP” (serial number).  The Sporter carbines are identical to the ones stamped LE (law enforcement).  Buying one stamped “Sporter” may be wise with the upcoming legislation, which may make things more difficult for folks with the Colts stamped “LE.”

Have an  Mauser that has had a new .308 barrel / receiver installed. The new barrel is marked M16 308W Spain.  Comes with 47 rounds of .308 ammo. It's in great condition so I assume my price is good.  I have never fired this thing after owning it for 12+ years. I don't know much about mausers so I'll do the best I can with any other questions.

Will do FTF in Longmont or Boulder. Send trade offers"
