This thing is an absolute tack driver out to 150yrds and I am able to pie plate at 300 with little wind.
The barrel went through a very strict break in process and since then has seen about 600-700 rounds.
It has been a range queen from day one. I have taken it into the woods but it has never been abused.
I also have 2 or 3 boxes of ammo and a bore snake that will go with it.

This rifle was purchased new in the box directly from Dakota in 2005 and has had three cartridges fired through it-total. The original factory bluing isn’t even worn off the bolt body. It is in incredible pristine condition and is completely devoid of any abuse. The wood on this rifle is really something. The photos do not do it justice. It retains all of the original factory finish. Capacity of this bog bore thumper is four cartridges. The .416 is best suited for a 400 gr bullet. The 26” barrel is equipped with a muzzle brake and is mirror bright. The quick detachable 1” scope rings are from the Dakota custom shop and are original equipment. There has never been a scope mounted on the rifle. The rifle comes with a three position safety which allows the bolt to be functioned and still be in a mechanical safe condition.

Take them both to the range, or have more options when you go hunting.  What a fun set up!


This one is not perfect. There are a few marks in the wood where you would expect. Also, the barrel on the 22 needs some rust oiled off.  The inside of the barrels both look very good.  This is the youth version with the shorter barrels and shorter length of pull.  This also has a youth padded sling that holds shotgun shells.

This is a classic, hard to find semi auto 9mm. It is a 9+1 capacity single stack. Trigger is a dream to pull - best I've ever had in any pistol.  Comes with 2 blue and 2 parked magazines, original manual.  These pistols are ideal for suppressing (as the US Navy SEALS did during the 70s and 80s).  I swore I would never sell this pistol, but I need the money and I just don't shoot it (probably 150 rounds through it total)

Simplicity, 1911 style safety, DA/SA trigger and practical use are its best qualities. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design.

Is compactness and light weight makes it an ideal all day deep concealment carry gun. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this compact pistol provides firepower equaling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet all this serious capability is packed into a compact lightweight 4.9 (125 mm) 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. 

The snag proof design permits quick presentation to the target and a blade front sight allows for fast target acquisition. It has a smooth and crisp trigger pull in double / single action.

It functions FLAWLESSLY and shoots amazing groups at 100 yards. ONLY reason I'm selling it is to free up some funds for my upcoming wedding. Not interested in trades but I am open to reasonable offers. I have over $1800 in the gun alone, let alone the ammo and accessories. Feel free to ask any questions you might have.

It is in the 6.37 serial number range and has a 9/44 barrel that guages a 1 ME. The type II barrel band is a real one and not a cut down type III. The front sight has never been removed and I have up close pics of the pin and also of they type II band in my link below. There has never been a type III band on the rifle. The bore is great.

The stock is a real paratrooper stock. It is maked IO on the inside as well as IO on the handguard. The stock has never been sanded and has it original cartouches. It has the ordance wheel on the grip but it worn from being handled. But you can still see the top part of the wheel. There are no cracks or repairs to the stock. It's in nice shape. It also has a WWII IS oiler that come with it. And it will come with 1 WWII carbine mag.

I have known where this carbine has been since 1998. So this is not a recent purchase carbine And this isn't a recent cmp gun. As far as I can tell it is all correct and original and probably a vet bring back.

I'm looking for $3500 or I will ship it on your dime.  

Which I believe is a reasonable price since rebuilds do not go much less than this one. I might also sell just the stock by itself if persuaded for $2000. But I would rather keep it all together since I truly do believe it's all original. I will accept payment by postal money orders, paypal with 3%, or a certified bank check if I ship it. If paying by bank check all I ask is it clears by bank before I ship it.

I might accept trades plus cash. As I have a few bills to pay so I do need some cash. But I don't mind some in trades. I'm about into anything, so just ask, worst I can say is no.

If you have any questions just ask.

I have up for trade a Finnish M-39 in excellent condition, along with five stripper clips and 40 rounds of surplus 7.62x54r ammo. I bought this rifle about a year ago and cleaned the cosmoline off myself. It is a beauty. The stock is in near-mint condition, as is the bluing. The bore is mint. I've probably only put about 80 rounds of NON-CORROSIVE ammo through it due to going to school and not having enough time to go shoot. The barrel is dated 1942, and is a ""B"" denoting that it was made in Belgium at the FN Herstal plant. (Check out that plum color)! I am unsure of the receiver date, but the top has a czarist cartouche, indicating that it was made sometime prior to 1918 or so. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. Ask me anything; I can provide more pictures if asked.

I'm not really interested in selling this rifle. I'd love to trade for another  military surplus weapon or reloading setup. Military pistols might be OK too. Here's a short list of what I want. Let me know what you've got; the worst I can say is ""no thanks."" Also, we can work cash up or down depending on what you've got.

1. M1917 Eddystone
2. M1903/03A3 Springfield
3. Swiss GP-11 ammunition (bulk)
4. Lee-Enfield in nice condition. (Ammo'd be nice, too)
5. AK-74 (Not interested in AK-47s, sorry)
6. GERMAN 98k Mauser, not a Russian Capture
7. Swedish M38/M96
8. Swedish Ljungmann
9. A complete reloading setup, preferably RCBS or Hornady.
10. Anything Swiss. Let me know what it is."

the gun itself is a .40 cal with one 1 12 round magazine. it was a police trade in and has CMPD on the right part of the slide below the ejection port. i broke it down and including the rounds ive shot, id say its had less than 90 shots down the pipe. rifling looks to be new. the finish is good EXCEPT for some minor scuffs / scratches on the left part of the slide, like someone drew it from a holster and dropped it on the ground. it has trijicon tritium night sighs that are dated 05, but they still glow strong in the dark. set this thing on your bedside table and turn out the lights and watch em glow! decocker- loaded chamber indicator- striker indicator- a hidden paddle trigger are the standard features. ambidextrous controls are the mag release....and thats it haha! only one backstrap is included and its the large one. slide serrations both sides front and back. lower frame is marked ""walther made in germany"" slide reads ""smith & wesson springfield mass usa"" also has a mag safety and accessory rail

Above and beyond that is all additional depending on the items you wish to add. Here are a few of the models available. Remember ladies and gentlemen. If you like to shoot more than anything and still want something for home protection, I assure that a .22LR will be just as potent as anything else and also more accurate when considering recoil. Cops and active military personnel require a larger caliber because they are actually shooting at objects that shoot back. I don't mean to be cocky, but you can own the meanest looking gun without spending as much as you did on your first car."

It is the lightest and flattest 9MM ever made. Firing mechanism is double action only with an automatic hammer block safety. 

i bought it brand new and have owned it for about 6 months. put maybe 45-50 rounds through it when i first got it to site it in. great pistol. im only selling because i need something with more in the mag. it has a houge handall jr sleeve on the grip which increases the grip 110%.  i bought another clip for it and a blackhawk inside waistband CCW holster and both will be included as well. paid $300.

i got the laser/light combo for it but it DOESNT fit it. so no need for it. works great. paid $120. 

selling them both for $375 OBO...

The Apex Tactical Forward Set Sear and Trigger (FSS) is installed right now. With it still installed I will sell it for $715. Can be adjusted from 3 to 5.0 lbs. right now, or a few extra springs can take it down to 2.0 lbs. or under and up to 5.5 lbs. 

Will sell it without the Apex FSS & Trigger and then it’ll cost $550. I’d rather sell it with it installed, even though I __will buy__ the FSS again, just be easier to leave as a package. Once you pull the trigger with it in there more and likely you’ll want to keep it. Closest thing to a 1911 trigger so far, from my experience and from what I’ve read and having people at the range shoot a few rounds. Look at some Youtube vids.   

It comes with the original S&W box with lock, papers, 2 magazines and 3 back-straps.  Shot around 550 to 650 rounds.  If your planning on going to IDPA, USPSA or 3 Gun and need 3 extra magazines ASAP, then they’re yours for $33 each as I can wait to order more.

I think I will buy NEW, however I will consider a used M&P9 FS (4.25”).  Just want something smaller.  Sorry, I will __only__ consider another M&P 9mm, if I had the money I would consider other trades but can't at this moment.

CCW Permit and ID Required.
