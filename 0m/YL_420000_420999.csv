This is a great and complete package. The gun has about 250 rounds through it. For being a very strong caliber it is a pleasure to shoot. It is very accurate and with a firm grip I feel the recoil is pretty mild. The balistics of the .357 sig are fantastic, but the ammo can be pretty expensive, with this package you will have enough practice and SD ammo to last a good while.

  I am downsizing my collection to only 9mm and 45acp, so that is why I am looking to trade. I dont have a cash price, feel free to offer one, but I would rather trade right now. ( I am not a crack head, so be respectful and no low ball prices)

The 800 series is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer. The 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger.

With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range. 

The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package.The 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols.

This is a perfect shotgun for home defense or getting started in 3 gun competition. This SuperNova is set up for 7 +1 shots in the gun and 6 more at the ready on the side saddle. The stock has been shortened and repaded with a pachmayr pad to improve handling and feel. The length of pull is about 12.75 inches. It handles like an ar15 with a partly collapsed stock. Along with the shorter stock a qd sling mount has also been added so a single point sling can be used in the same way it is used on an ar15. 

The Mesa Tactical rail/saddle makes this shotgun red dot ready, and the Nordic barrel clamp also provides a rail for a forward flashlight or laser.

Some minor scuffing can be seen on the stock from where the pachmayr was ground to shape.

Included aftermarket upgrades:

- +2 Nordic mag extension 
- Nordic barrel clamp with picatinny rail
- Mesa Tactical 6 shot side saddle with picatinny rail
- qd sling mount

This Dan Wesson has definitely been used but not abused. It has some scratches as seen in the pictures below, it is a shooter and definitely NOT a safe queen. It also has the idiot mark that was put there from the previous owner. However, this has the ""Match"" barrel & shoots like a dream. The scratches are just cosmetic. This is one of the best PRODUCTION 1911's for the money, no MIM parts!

Parlor pistols and rifles (zimmerschutzen from German, ""room marksman"" or ""room shoot"") were popularized in the mid to late 19th Century, particularly in the Germanic countries, as a way to entertain guests, have family fun, and to increase one's shooting skills. Generally heavy barreled and often elaborately engraved rifles (zimmerbusche) were produced for clearly upscale clients. These generally used a Flobert (CB-Cap) cartridge chambered a few inches from the muzzle. Sometimes equally elaborate parlor pistols (zimmerpistole) were chambered for Flobert cartridges or simply used a percussion cap. In this country, a small, almost toylike parlor pistol was briefly manufactured by Remington in 1860.

If I have not sold it by 10am on Sunday June 3, 2012 then this price will be void.

Sig 522 for sale. Bought new, a little over a year old, good condition except for what is mostly a cosmetic issue. 

I was trying to do a modification to the storage tube inside of the 'gas block' (its not really a gas block and is purely aesthetic, its what would be the gas block on the sig 556) to mount a laser sight in there. Unfortunately, I sheered off a screw tap and haven't been able to get it out due to lacking the proper tools to do so. I also had to cut the storage tube off to allow the front end piece to be snapped back into place as a result. The end result of this whole thing is there is a screw tap snapped off inside of the cosmetic-only "" gas block "" and it no longer has a storage tube. When the front end-cap is in place, you can't tell that anything is wrong.

Function is flawless and I would never have attempted the above if there were any chance that it would effect function. With the proper tools it shouldn't be hard to get the tap out and finish the mod. A cheap laser sight to use for that purpose is included and is mounted on the front rail.

Also includes a foregrip and a total of 3 Sig 26 round magazines and a BSA red dot. Also it has the tri-rails mounted on the front of the grip, these too, are an option and don't come on the gun new. I'll throw in some 22lr ammo as well to get you going in the unlikely event you don't already have a 22lr gun.

This thing has fired every 22lr I have thrown at it. It runs excellently.

This is probably the best of the 'tacticool' 22s, in my opinion. 

Because of the cosmetic issue I'm going to let it go pretty cheap for a Sig 522. 

First $250 gets it. (They are $450+ New without said accessories.) This is ridiculously, horribly, unbelievably cheap.

Must be willing to meet within a 1hr drive of Steubenville (43952).

Must sell by tomorrow morning and as bad as I need to sell it I am not going one penny lower in price."

Pics in the Gunblast review to back it up. This is a cool lil gun. Shot it at the Meet & Greet and really liked it. Only flaw is if you limp wrist it the brass wants to bounce off your head. But there are other toys I want and since I am going back to the Gunshow in the morning I figured I would see if I could get some cash or work a trade. 

Asking $450 OBO and consider all firearm trades (really want 5"" 1911, AK47, Mossberg 590/500 Home Def shotguns, revolvers or good semi-auto carry gun) Can add cash to right deal.

I used it this past year for one day of coyote hunting and seven 3gun competitions and am selling it only to fund the building of another very similar rifle.

JP Cooley Comp $90
Bravo Company charging handle $46
(if you choose to remove the comp, handle or mag release they can and will be replaced with the factory components)

Rifle price as pictured is: $1050
Rifle price bare bones (Minus the ""options"") : $650
I am located in St Paul, shoot at Oakdale on Thursdays and am working in StLouisPark the next few weeks so I can meet you anywhere out that way everyday but Thursdays.

I will sell the optic separate only once the rifle is gone. I will determine a price at that time if the rifle buyer does not want it. I am pretty firm on the price and but will consider trades and trades +cash (shotguns, ar's, .45, 9mm, 44mag pistols). Its a fair price for a perfectly functional black rifle and considering the upgrades its a pretty great deal. The BCM bolt makes the gun extremely reliable as long as you keep it well lubricated (as I always have using Slip 2K EWL).

We will TRADE for your old beat-up barrel in most any condition. Rusty, Nasty, Bent, Bulged or Dented.

We're not a regular business. We don't have a storefront. We're just two old guys that sell shotgun parts on the weekends at gun shows. We both hold regular full-time jobs too. To atempt to keep up with demand we also BUY shotgun parts, pieces, stocks & foreends. We'll buy junker pump &* auto shotguns just to get the parts. Why, we've bought four gunsmith's estates for its parts.

We're not a regular business. We don't have a storefront. We're just two old guys that sell shotgun parts on the weekends at gun shows. We both hold regular full-time jobs too.

Why, we've bought four gunsmith's estates for its parts.

- 	
For those of you that are familiar with this weapon, company or the owner I dont need to say anything more than this weapon holds true to the Tac. Ops. standard. For the rest of you allow me to reassure you that this is one of the finest weapons I have shot. It is short, compact, the work on it is outstanding with a crisp trigger pull of 2.5 LBS along with accuracy repeatability that is unmatched. The action is a smooth as can be and the bolt knob makes cycling the weapon a breeze.

This weapon is Sub MOA all day! The best I have managed to do with it is just around half MOA (but I just recently got in to the precision rifle arena so I'm sure many of you can do much better than me). Mike R.(the builder) managed a .156 group with it and I have proof of that. This weapon has exactly 181 flawless rounds of match grade ammo through it. As all of my weapons it has been kept in immaculate condition.

I am in somewhat of a hurry and will post a pic of a Tac. Ops. Tango 51 from the internet but for those of you that email me you will get a picture of the actual weapon.

Only the rifle is for sale, included will be the base and rings, nothing else.

Thanks for your time Gents and possibly Ladys

****The rifle is identical in appearance to the one in the picture except without the pistol grip and forearm texturing. Also, mine has a black stock that was built by Mike****

This gun is a beast. Its accurate out to hundreds of yards even with the short barrel. I let me friend shoot it the other day and I could feel the thump on my chest from the muzzle blast standing next to him. This gun unlike most ar pistols runs flawless. the h3 buffer plus adjustable gas port allows the whole gas system to run way smoother and gives the gun time to extract the cartridge rather then ripping the case head off. The result is total and utter reliability. as a matter of fact I much prefer to shoot wolf out of it its just as accurate for me and WAY cheaper then buying 223 brass cased ammo all the time. this guns will eat wolf like your ak does. The pics didnt turn out so well but you can see the reciever doesnt have so much as a scratch on it.

I had a 21SF and sold it because I wanted something I could conceal better, plus I liked the idea of a factory dual recoil spring.  Took me a week to realize I didn't really carry it into public places as much as I thought I did.  I just like the feel of a full size better. (Personal preference). The G30 is right at the size of a G19/G23.  Sight radius is spot on!  These cost the same as the full size Glock .45 calibers $600+tx so don't think since you are trading for a smaller frame Glock the cost or quality is any different.

Made in Loewe, Berlin. Sporterized to the popular .308 caliber - stamped .308 on barrel. Barrel length 21"", overall length 42"". 

This gun spent most of its days in a closet and it shows. The metal is in good condition. The bore is also good. Action is very smooth. As expected the stock shows some wear but is nice. This is an old gun and as such has a nice patina to it.
