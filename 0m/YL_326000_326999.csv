Can you do it with a rack-grade rifle and surplus ammo? Can you do it with iron sights? Want to be a Rifleman instead of just a rifle owner/shooter? Join us for an Appleseed Rifle Marksmanship clinic, April 14-15 2012 in Williamsburg, KY.

Project Appleseed is an activity of The Revolutionary War Veterans Association, a 501(c)(3) all volunteer, non-partisan, non-profit organization, dedicated to teaching every American our shared heritage and history as well as traditional rifle marksmanship skills. 

Appleseed rifle marksmanship clinics are non-competitive, family-friendly, and open to all, from novice shooters to experts. There is a $5.00 per day charge for women, and a $2.50 per day charge for youth (under 21). Peace officers, active duty military, National Guard, reserve, disabled and elected officials shoot FREE as honored guests. For all others, the cost is only $70.00 for both days, or $45.00 for one day of instruction by some of the best rifle marksmanship instructors in the nation. Attend one day or both days. Politics are not discussed at Appleseed shoots, except for the politics of 1775. 

You may shoot anything from a .22 rimfire (the Ruger 10/22 and Marlin 795 are popular) to a centerfire such as an AR, AK, SKS, M1A or M1. You will shoot approximately 250 rounds per day as you try to qualify as a Rifleman (210 Points) on a modified version of the AQT (Army Qualification Test) course of fire.

The number of slots for each shoot is limited, so pre-registration is highly encouraged to make sure a spot on the line is reserved for you.

I have for sale my XPS3-0 EoTech Holographic Sight. It is in great condition and is not broken in any way. Buttons are still intact and have not worn down. I have never shot any rounds, while this sight was on my firearm.

Here is the information EoTech has on their website about this individual sight.

XPS3-0

""Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.""

I am going to upload pictures on here asap. But in the mean time, I do have pictures on my cell phone. Feel free to message on the cell phone number below, and I can send pictures to you if you'd like!

On EoTech's website this EoTech Sight is going for $610 without taxes and shipping, probably around $700 with taxes and shipping included. So no, I will not take $350 like I've had offered thousands of time!

Trades: Kimber, Sig Sauer, and Colt 1911's ( I add $$$ ). Ruger SR9 Fullsize. Sig Sauer 226 and 229, preferably Elite model but will look at others ( I add $$$ ). Certain model Glocks.


As it says I am asking $500 obo, cash only or trades I specified ^^^.

Description M500A
The SureFire M500A replaces the original handguards of your M4 or similar carbine. It features a 9-volt shock-isolated incandescent lamp with a 1.62"" reflector suited to close- to medium-range applications, and two low-output navigation lights available in white, red, or blue.

This is the sales pitch and info from Hogue.

Hogue rubber grips are molded from a durable synthetic rubber that is not spongy or tacky, but gives that soft recoil absorbing feel, without affecting accuracy. This modern rubber requires a completely different molding process than ordinary neoprene and results in a much superior grip. The material we use does not come apart or deteriorate and is resistant to all solvents and oils used around firearms. Hogue Grips give you a lasting precision fit and durability that will provide years of dependable service. The flexibility of our materials and molding process has allowed us to produce superior rubber grips with features that out perform all other makes. 

Details:

   - Non-slip rubber outer for greater control of your weapon even when   wet or cold, even with sweaty hands
   - Comfortable, soft recoil absorbing feel
   - Made by OverMolding™ soft rubber over a hard inner skeleton for soft grip comfort, hard grip performance
   - Rubber exterior chemically bonds to the insert so the smooth hard surface can remain on the inside of the grip for a precise stock grip configuration and exacting tolerance
   - Fully relieved for use with speedloaders
   - Attach securely to your gun in just seconds with Hogue® patented steel stirrup
   - Fits any Ruger GP100 Super Redhawk
   - Made in USA.

The LUCID HD7 Red Dot Sight Gen II (HD7) is a quality optic that is gaining favor with many law enforcement and recreational shooters alike. Made extremely durable, reliable and packed full of well thought out user friendly features, the HD7 is always on target.

This red dot sight has a cast aluminum frame that is fully rubber armored, waterproof, shockproof tested to .458 SOCOM, and fogproof made for extreme durability. 1/2 MOA windage and elevation adjustments on external turrets have positive adjustments with a solid audible click.

The sight gives the operator the option of four different reticles: 2 MOA Dot, 2 MOA Dot with Outer Circle, Circle with Crosshairs, Crosshairs.

The HD7 is powered by a common AAA battery for the customers' convenience and an estimated 1000 hours of battery life. The battery cap is o-ring sealed against the elements. The sight powers itself down automatically after two hours of operation.

This Red Dot Sight features two modes of operation, Manual mode and Auto-Brightness mode where a light sensor will keep the reticle at the right brightness regardless of the environment you are shooting from.

The HD7 sight is designed to mount on Weaver as well as Picatinny rails, and is secured by two 13mm 6-point slotted nuts. The mounting base height of the HD7 provides for a lower 1/3rd co-witness when used in conjunction with a BUIS. The mount is an integral part of the optic frame assembly and does not allow for the adapting of quick release type mounts manufactured by other optic companies."

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare."

***Note, the pictures show the mag release on the right hand side to be actuated with the trigger finger.  I had some folks asking about that and I  switched it back to the left hand side.  It is a personal preference and can be switched in 5 minutes, no gunsmith required.

This is a former LEO piece and shows some holster rub on the Hogue grips; nothing major and grips can be replaced for $25.  There is a slight scuff right onderneath the elector opening, again, nothing major.  This Sig shoot very smoot and is also an attractive piece.

I have for sale my XPS3-0 EoTech Holographic Sight. It is in great condition and is not broken in any way. Buttons are still intact and have not worn down. I have never shot any rounds, while this sight was on my firearm.

Here is the information EoTech has on their website about this individual sight.

XPS3-0

""Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.""

I am going to upload pictures on here asap. But in the mean time, I do have pictures on my cell phone. Feel free to message on the cell phone number below, and I can send pictures to you if you'd like!

On EoTech's website this EoTech Sight is going for $610 without taxes and shipping, probably around $700 with taxes and shipping included. So no, I will not take $350 like I've had offered thousands of time!

Trades: Kimber, Sig Sauer, and Colt 1911's ( I add $$$ ). Ruger SR9 Fullsize. Sig Sauer 226 and 229, preferably Elite model but will look at others ( I add $$$ ). Certain model Glocks.


As it says I am asking $500 obo, cash only or trades I specified ^^^.


If your interested, contact me via email, or text me at Five1Three-nine6seven-zero0zero8

The pistol looks to be in good condition.  Someone has tried to sand off the modern markings on the barrell but a few minutes with 1200 grit sandpaper and some steel wool and that should clear up.  The serial number on the brass frame is still there.  It has a few nicks, dings, a patina but don't we all?   All parts are accounted for. A flint is included with the pistol as well as a frizzen guard.  This sparks very well. The bore is bright.  E-mail if you have any questions.  This dates back to the 1970's as I have the box and newspaper stuffing located in it.

You rarely get any history with a collectable gun. Most times you don't get the box. More often than not, you have to overlook something when buying a gun like this to add to your collection. Not in this case.

The price is absolutely, 100% firm. When you think about it....it's not that much more than a new modern one.

**Update: Thank you for the generous offers for the grips ($250) and the box ($125)- BUT I will not part this gun out. You could probably make more profit if you did that-but I consider it a very rare situation-so I won't."

The truck has some wear and tear, scratches and dings. It has a larger dent on the drivers side near the rear behind the tire, all thanks to my neighbor. Also the pasenger side mirror was cracked and fell out. So, I just replaced it with a dome mirror. Other than those couple things its in real good condition.

I realize you could do a search and see that someone has the gun on gunbroker or buds for 450 so you think 400 is a fair offer. To me it is not. I may have overpaid a bit for the gun but in local shops around here it's anywhere from 549-599. Then you have the tax and 5.00 fee added. If you buy online you have the transfer and FFL fees and shipping fees. 

This package will go to the highest offer made. I don't have the time or patience right now to answer a million questions and go back and forth. Please email me your one and only highest offer on the total package. I will not seperate.

Glock considers this a ""compact"" handgun.  

Glock test-fired this gun on 10-30-11 and I bought it new in November. This Glock has approx. 800 rounds through it. It has performed flawlessly!  There are no imperfections--dings, marks, or scratches.  So far it has eaten up 200 Wichester White Box, 100 Tula Ammo, 250 Federal, 2 Winchester PDX-1, 50 Sellier and Bellot, 100 Remmington, and 50 PMC.  I was trying to find something it didn't like--couldn't do it!

For more info on the G23....see the expert, Hickok45!

It comes with everything from the factory----plus extra items!

Mags:
-3 13rd standard capacity magazines (OEM Glock)
-1 15rd hi-capacity magazine (OEM Glock)
-1 22rd hi-capacity magazine (OEM Glock-- add $20 if you want this)

Other:
-1 magazine holster that holds 2 magazines (works great--polymer)
-Glock Range Bag - (small)- easily holds gun, 5 mags, and ammo

FYI--
With a Glock 23 you can buy a G32 barrel and shoot .357 sig without any modifications or new magazines! I've done it with a friends G23---super fun!

With a 40-9 conversion barrel and 9mm magazines you can shoot 9mm at the range for a cheaper ammo option.

With a .22 conversion kit from Advantage Arms--you can shoot .22LR all day for pennies! My friend also has this kit---works great and super fun!

This is one of the few guns out there that offers so many options!

Face to Face sale only--must be able to give copy of FOID and Driver's License.

I am selling this gun because my Dad has one exactly like it.....going to inherit it someday so I figured I might as well branch out a bit!
