Up for sale is currently my last Norinco NDM 86 in 7.62 NATO. Will also fire .308 Winchester. As stated before these rifles are tack drivers, with 1-MOA and sub-MOA possible out of the box. I have sold several of these over my time of collecting, and am willing to provide referrences to ease the minds of buyers.
 The only true copy of the Russian SVD made, one of only 1000 in the country. The rifle has only 20 rounds fired through it for barrel break in. It also has the spring loaded firing pin. The finish overall is near entirely intact with wear only on the moving parts and a few scratches from handling and mounting the scope.
 Comes with accessories, including the manual, 10 round magazine, infra-red detection scope, spare bulb, cleaning rods, oil bottle, and scope box, all new and unused.

It's a beautifully built little revolver.  I've fired 5 rounds (1 full cylinder) through it.  I can tell you that this isn't a long range weapon.  This is an up-close and personal jam it in their eye socket or ear and pull the trigger weapon (or at least for me).  The .22 WMR is a very capable little round and what could be more reliable than a single action stainless steel revolver.  I purchased it as a concealed carry weapon for the summer months.  It's hard to shove my glock in a pair of shorts or under a t-shirt and have it go un-noticed.  Either loose in a pocket or in the nifty little wallet holster it is an easy to conceal little gun.  

Why do I want rid of it?  I want a bow.  I've decided that I want to bow hunt this year and I would like to either get cash to put towards a bow or make a clean trade on a decent used bow.  I dropped right at $300 to buy the little pistol and the slick wallet holster.  The holster is well made, heavy leather, molded to the revolver and has a pouch that holds an additional 5 rounds (1 full cylinder).  It fits in your pocket and conceals the outline of the pistol.  

This is the same revolver you might have seen used to take a monster of a gator on Swamp People a few weeks ago.  It's small but mighty.

For those of you who like to have your belt match your shoes, there are a myriad of accesories for these things, pocket clips, lasers, fancier grips, belt buckles that serve as holsters, etc...

I still have the factory plastic box and paperwork as well."

It is made for running from bar to bar or short distances.  It does run and ride, but it is going to require more work.  I am selling it for $300 cash firm, and not more, because I don't want to screw with it, and I have several other bikes.  It may require plugs and wires.  It also may require some of the vacuum hoses under the tank be replaced and it wouldn't hurt to make sure that they are situated in the correct areas.  This requires a Childers manual, and I do not have one.  It bleeds oil at the oil filter in very small amounts and also bleeds small amounts of fluid from the shaft drive.  Again, this isn't going to win any beauty cotests and it has only the essentials to get you down the road, but it could be made to be a very solid and roadworthy bike for little expense.  I bought it from a guy who worked on bikes last summer when I was getting my bike painted just so I would have something to ride.  I no longer need it, but am not going to give it away.  I have a clear Indiana Title and will take $300 Cash Firm or $500 worth of trade in Guitar/Amp Gear or Firearms.  Once you decide you want it, I can help move it for you as I have a truck because it is not currently plated or registered.

Additional info on the Steyr USR
The STEYR USR AUG 5.56x45mm (.223) caliber in olive stock 
Interchangeable 508mm (20”), with gas regulator and swing/pivot type barrel grip. Cold hammer forged. Chrome lined bore including chamber. Weight empty is 7.9lbs, with over length of 31” and height of 11”. Detachable synthetic (transparent) staggered type 30 round magazine weighing 5 oz. empty. 
Gas operated, gas regulated with two action settings for firing. 
Integrated 1.5x optical sight with ring reticule for extreme high hit probability. 
Synthetic trigger mechanism (except for springs, steel bearing pins and catch 
Lateral push-through type safety lock trigger. 
Fixed locking turn bolt, with seven locking lugs. 
The rifle can easily be changed from right hand to left hand ejection, simply by flipping the ejection port lid to the other side and installing a left hand bolt (no tools required). 
Design makes it a short handy rifle with high reliability and accuracy. The AUG is famous for its modular concept that permits fieldstripping into the main groups within seconds. The AUG is the standard of many armed forces and special units around the world since 1977 and is currently used by Border Patrol and Immigration

Some additional info on Steyr USR and AUGs:
- 3000 USRs were imported. These were the last all-Austrian to come in and who knows if they will be allowed again
- Most “new” Steyr AUG/A3 that they're selling is a mix of Austrian and US parts. Just enough US parts to stay out of import regs, but the catch: if you go accessorizing your gun with Steyr Austrian-made parts, you can easily 
make your rifle incompliant
- Also, most of the Steyr AUG/A3’s don't come with any optics or sights. So if someone brags about picking up a new AUG at $2000 (plus fees) off the internet, add in the cost of an optic. Steyr Optics will set you back $799
- MSAR clones are available cheaper, but as with most clones, their reputation is mixed."

This is Chinese made which means it has a chrome lined barrel (better durability than the Russian made).

It is all original, bayonet, strap, and 10 round clip that takes stripper clips...

However, I also have two 30 rd AK style banana clips that I will include with gun at a full price offering. These are steel construction and work great.

This gun is clean, ready to shoot, shoots well and a lot of fun.

I paid $400 for the gun alone and purchased the extra clips and stripper clips for it separately. I am willing to include what ammo I have left which includes a few boxes of wolf 7.62x39mm as well as some nice Egyptian brass rounds. Probably about $50 in ammo.

So in other words I am throwing in around $125 in additional clips and ammo on top of the $400 gun and you get it all for $397. This is a more than $525 value.

In order to purchase this gun the transfer will be processed at Cabelas. This means that YOU will pay the background check and transfer fee at Cabelas and they will process the transfer for us. You will also have to have $397 cash on hand to pay me when we do the transfer.

Your total expected cost is $25 for the background check and transfer when we meet at Cabelas and $397 for the purchase.

You can make arrangements with me to check out the gun ahead of time. Call for an appointment.

You MUST be 21 years of age and NO criminal record.

It was purchased from RUGER for the 629.00 retail price. I am a bit picky and tend to purchase things from the manufacturer vs 2nd and 3rd party websites. 

This has a HOGUE mono Grip.. it does not have the factory grips. I upgraded them and threw the others away.

I am selling this gun for one reason only, its lack of safety features. We have 4 small children and even with trigger locks and what not the wife doesn't feel safe with one with no extra safety being around. I agreed with her it would be gone this week.

I have listed this on a few other sites and had tons of responses and trades offers with a lot of no shows or very ridiculous low ball offers. The cheapest you can find this gun new is around 470 without shipping and that does also not include the dealer cost. 

I am looking for a fair reasonable cash offer on this and if not taken within the next day or two I will just take it to the gun store. I am asking 425 but I am a motivated seller and will listen to all REASONABLE cash offers

589,http://www.armslist.com/posts/137589,For Sale:  Stock refinishing service,"Piedmont, Greensboro, North Carolina",$ 20,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 17, 2011",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am an amateur gun refinisher that loves to take old, battered, banged up guns and make them shine again.  My experience so far has been with old single barreled shotguns, Marlin mid 60's, an antique musket, and a mosin nagant.  

I have recently run out of projects and am on the search for more.  So if you have an old rifle, shotgun, or milsurp weapon sitting around gathering dust or rusting away then let me know!

Here is what I do:

1.  Research the firearm to make sure refinishing won't ruin any collectors value.
2.  I tear down the entire firearm, clean all internals and lubricate all friction points.
3.  I strip and sand down the old stock to base wood.
4.  Apply a new wood stain of either your or my choosing.
5.  Apply at least 10 layers of tru-oil gunstock finishing oil.
6.  Order and replace any and all parts required to get the gun running again.
7.  Reassemble the gun, test fire, and apply a final oil.

What's the cost to you?  Just parts and supplies...so anywhere from $20 on up depending on parts.  I do not charge labor, as I love doing this as a hobby.

I cannot do checkering, so if your stock has checkering then what I can do is limited.

Thank you for your time!  Examples of my work can be emailed upon request."

Anyway, I'm looking to sell this beauty to help pay for the P30.

I've got the 04 spring from Glock in there because when I first got it during the first 50 rounds there was one FTE. I took it home, cleaned it up and during the next trip out of 50 rounds there was one more FTE adn one failure for the slide to lock back after the last round. I called glock and they sent me the 04 spring (as opposed to the included 03 spring). I've shot ~400 rd through it since and 0 failures of any kind.

So this gun has ~500 rounds through it, is about 2 months old and has been cleaned immediately after each trip to the range. As far as I can tell it's in near perfect condition. It comes with everything that came with it (speed-loader, 3 adjustable backstraps, backstrap tool, cleaning brush/rod, action lock (not pictured) all manuals, original spent casings, etc.) 3 mags and both the original 03 and the new 04 recoil spring from Glock.

GREAT CARRY CONCEAL GUN. This gun is extremely clean. The grip has been stippled to increase grip purchase, reduce muzzle flip, and allow for quicker follow up shots. This stipple job was done right and follows the factory grip pattern. For those not familiar with this type of custom work, it's like putting skate board tape or grip tape on your gun except it never peels or wears out. It also insures you retain positive control of your weapon no matter what. You can literally coat your hand in oil and still get a good grip on this pistol. Pistol comes with everything shown and functions flawlessly. I got it on another trade and did not like the way it felt in my hand; during my last range visit. It chewed through 100 rounds of 9mm with zero failures or issues and would make a great carry conceal gun."

It has holster wear and the usual wear that any boy in the 1950s to 1960s might have put on it. The grips are original, and it comes with an old Hunter brand holster and belt that I'm told has been with the gun for as long as the previous owner has had it, from his childhood.

887,http://www.armslist.com/posts/137887,For Sale:  Pop-up targets,"Spfld, Springfield, Missouri",$ 75,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 18, 2011",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have started making pop-up targets for my own personal use and will be offering those targets up to others who wish to add a stronger element to their training or just something different for plinking days.

Construction:  Wood and PVC (fully replacable parts)
Target type:  Pop-up
What the Pop-up does:  It's a pin-activated target that can pop-up and stay up, it can pop-up and drop back down, it can start in the  up position and transition down, or it can be set to be up all the time.  This target can be activated from the front, the rear, or the sides so that if you choose to run multiple targets you can run them in series so that one will activate another.

These are adjustable-speed targets.  All you need to do is add or remove sand to the front or the counterweight to adjust the timing.  You can adjust how fast it comes up as well as how fast it will come down.

Each will have been test-fitted and fully tested for functionality before being disassembled for transport.  You can pick it up fully assembled if you like or we can meet at a range that will allow this target and you can try it out when you buy it.  I will include one set of uprights with each target so you can mount your cardboard or paper targets.

Note:  I will not allow measurements to be taken and buyers need to be fully aware that if you want to try one out you must commit to the buy prior to.  Wait time is 1-2 weeks, but if I get one completed quickly I will contact those buyers on a first come, first served basis.

DO NOT shoot at these targets in the down position.  You WILL destroy the target."
