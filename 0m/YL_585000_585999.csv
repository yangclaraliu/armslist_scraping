Just go to the bottom and choose the matte stainless configuration to verify the new price. I'm looking for $500 obo

I will CONSIDER trades on just about anything but I'm specifically looking for a good Ruger 10/22 with either a wood or black synthetic stock. Even at brand new price though, you will have to add some cash on top of a 10/22. I don't mind trading straight across if you have one that is decked out or something else of equal value."

The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free.

This was a custom build vehicle by Pathfinder in Industry, ca. I have owned this van for around 6 years now and have done little or nothing with it. It is time to find it a good home.

The Van was originally a custom wheel chair van for off road. I removed the wheel chair lift but still have it. I believe I haveall of the extra disabled driving attachments, although they are not hooked up.

I let it sit too long and now it has a frozen rear break and needs a starter. I drove it Summer of last year and it was it's usual snarly beastly self.

I have a brand new, never fired Colt AR 15 in 9mm with two 32 round mags. I bought this as a suppressor host and that's what it will become if it doesn't sell. Right now, I'm wanting to do a .45 suppressor and since this has been sitting a while, I figured I would see what it would bring. I have the box and paperwork as well. This model is Marked for LE/Military Only and since these seem to be a little more collectible, i'm hesitant on shooting it. 





FTF in the Charlotte area, must be able to prove you are not a felon for my peace of mind.
