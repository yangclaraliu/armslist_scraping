Solid rifle, good shape, and great shooter. Used the past few deer seasons. Not really much else to say about it, what you see is what you get. Winchester quality -$275

-1945 Springfield M1 Garand

Manufactured in 1945, all original parts, saw combat in early Vietnam. It has some wear on it, but considering the age and what all the rifle has seen, it's not only expected but adds a lot of character to the gun. The rifle shoots OUTSTANDING, very well taken care of, passed down through the family for a while now. Included with the rifle are ten stripper clips, two ammo belts, and an ammo sling -$800

-Lee Enfield .303

Very cool rifle, very rare in the fact that it still has the original stock, not sporterized like you see most of the time now days. Good shooter, clean bore, just a good all-around rifle -$300


Just shoot me an email and let me know if you're interested in buying or trading or maybe a littl bit of both, I'm pretty easy to work with. I'm pretty firm with the prices, but depending on what you have I will definitely work with you as far as trades and everything goes.

The main thing is no junk, I am offering quality firearms and would like the same respect if you're interested in any of them. I appreciate it guys, have a good one"

It has custom grip stippling and trigger guard modification to eliminate trigger bite. Overall more comfortable grip. I duracoated the frame ""Snow Gray"". 3-dot TruDot night sights that are about year and a half old. Some holster wear on the slide but overall pretty good condition. I am 2nd owner and have put 600-750 rounds through it (Winchester/Remington). From what I know original owner didn't shoot much. It comes with (4) 17rd glock magazines and (1) 33rd aftermarket extended magazine. Plus IWB holster. GLock case provided, but it is a little rough. Nothing else included (factory lock, brush, etc..) Can text pics if interested.  

Don't really want to part with this glock (especially at this price), but am looking to upgrade to a newer iMac and don't feel like waiting for payday. When you want things you want them NOW, right? SO pick this up from me before I change my mind. *PRICE IS FIRM*

The gun functions perfectly, the only malfunctions I've had were due to me short stroking the action. 

The stock was cut down by a previous owner to accommodate a youth shooter. The removed portion of the stock was then reattached. The seam is visible in the attached picture, but goes unnoticed during use.

OEM Comments
Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change."

This gun has never jammed and i have it sighted at 50 yards dead on. Ammo is cheap being 9mm luger rounds. Just an all around fun gun to shoot. Only reason I am selling it is because I want a new trap gun so Im getting rid of some of my guns for a brand new BT99, being that i might shoot the hi point once every three months or so and I trap shoot every saturday its worth it to me to get rid of this very fun gun. Serious buyers only/ I have lowered to price to 325 due to someone wanting me to send it to louisville and not knowing the rules and regulations on mailing a firearm I dont want to deal with that, Please no low balling, I am alreasy taking a hit on the gun and I will only take cash. Serious buyers only. You can call or text me also @ 859-nine nine two-2957. Thanks for looking"

I have a Jimenez 380 that I purchased new from Indy Trading Post.  I know they are a fairly cheap gun, and I only purchased it to shoot it and do a review on my youtube channel, I have many others for my personal collection.  This is not a gun that I purchased because I wanted a quick gun and now I am unhappy or anything of that nature. I always hear people talk down about them, but I wanted to see if the hype was true.  I figured for the price it would make a good youtube review.  Believe it or not the gun fired federal ammo flawlessly, and when I ran out of federal I fired about 50 rds of tulammo to really try and jam it, NOTHING!  The gun is really awesome for a small conceal 380.  They have a great lifetime warrenty, and it is heavy enough for a small gun that it doesn't kick like some of the smaller lighter poly 380's, this makes it a little easier to control.  I paid $159, plus about $11 dollars tax, and I am selling it for $10 dollars cheaper minus the tax to help someone out.  The gun comes with the box, all warrenty papers, two locks with keys, two clips, and 35 rds. Feel free to contact me at REDACTED, or email me if you are more comfortable doing so, though a call will get through to me much quicker and I am trying to sell it for a little extra vacation money; leaving on Sunday.  I do not require a cary permit for sale, but I do require a drivers licence that I will photo copy, and a signiture on a deed of sale that we will both sign and have a copy of.  Thanks for looking at this firearm."

This is a highly desirable, pre-Series II Kimber Pro Carry.  For those who don't know Kimber started installing a firing pin block safety on the Series II guns.  This one was built like a 1911 was meant to be built...no firing pin block.  It has a very nice trigger, a 4"" barrel, alloy frame and Meprolight night sights that are still bright and serviceable.  This gun includes the original Kimber case (the sticker is gone, though), the little Kimber take-down tool, owner's manual and 3 Kimber mags.  

It does show some signs of use but nothing serious (other than the idiot mark under the slide-lock lever).  Someone polished the feed ramp at some point but it appears to be fairly light.  The screw slot on the lower, left-side grip screw bushing is chewed up a little but nothing that affects the gun or that you can see.  Just wanted to mention that in the interest of full disclosure.

The gun functions perfectly with all types of ammo except CCI Blazer (aluminum).  It just WILL NOT feed Blazer ammo.  Everything else I've tried works great and the gun is very accurate.  

This gun is in remarkably good shape considering it's probably 11+ years old.

The Gun was manufactured in 1948
The Gun is in great shape as it is all orginally with the exception of the Grips.  The gun has matching serial numbers on the upper, lower, and barrell.  The blue book on the gun is valued at $800 -$1200 

Here is some background on the 1911 firearms known as ""Systema Colt"" [ sister colt ].

In 1927, the Argentine Commission for Foreign Acquisitions negotiated a contract with Colt for the manufacture of M1911A1 .45 caliber self-loading pistols 
SISTEMA COLTS
For production of Colt 1911A1's in Argentina, Colt engineers supervised the set-up of the production equipment.

Sistema Colts were manufactured in accordance with Colt's 1927 drawings. The pistols were made for the Argentine Army, Navy, Air Force, government bureaus, police, commercial sales, and export. .

Sistema Colts were made from forged steel and will be just as long-lived and reliable as their Hartford counterparts. The German, British, and Swedish steel used in their manufacture was the best available. They are regarded as 100% Colt pistols, ""Fully USGI,"" according to one opinion, ""in fit, finish, form, and function."".

Numbers Produced at FMAP Rosario and Serial #s, 1945-1966
1945 - 6,000 - #24,001 - #30,000
1946 - 7,628 - #30,001 - #37,628

This is a highly desirable, pre-Series II Kimber Pro Carry.  For those who don't know Kimber started installing a firing pin block safety on the Series II guns.  This one was built like a 1911 was meant to be built...no firing pin block.  It has a very nice trigger, a 4"" barrel, alloy frame and Meprolight night sights that are still bright and serviceable.  This gun includes the original Kimber case (the sticker is gone, though), the little Kimber take-down tool, owner's manual and 3 Kimber mags.  

It does show some signs of use but nothing serious (other than the idiot mark under the slide-lock lever).  Someone polished the feed ramp at some point but it appears to be fairly light.  The screw slot on the lower, left-side grip screw bushing is chewed up a little but nothing that affects the gun or that you can see.  Just wanted to mention that in the interest of full disclosure.

The gun functions perfectly with all types of ammo except CCI Blazer (aluminum).  It just WILL NOT feed Blazer ammo.  Everything else I've tried works great and the gun is very accurate.  

This gun is in remarkably good shape considering it's probably 11+ years old.

Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many beginning shooters learn the basics of target shooting with this handy little carbine. 

This Red Dot scope is especially suitable for youngsters as they only have to place the red dot on the target and squeeze the trigger.  It can be used with both eyes open and the unlimited eye relief feature allows it to be mounted any distance from the shooter’s eyes as the shooter likes. 

The smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This shotgun only has about two dozen shells through it, basically decided I am going a different route and could use the money to fund other things around the house.

This shotgun started life as a field gun, with a 28"" vent rib barrel that is still unfired. I installed the Phoenix Technologies Kick-Lite stock, TacStar saddle, UTG receiver rail, and 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel to build it in to an HD gun that could be converted back if I wanted to hunt turkey or shoot skeet. Shot the gun one day, a dozen or so low brass target loads and a dozen high brass 00BK and slugs just to check the function, and have decided that I really don't need this gun right now so it's going on the board.

Description:  This H&R is mint to near mint in every way.  This gun comes from a large private collection that is getting sized down.  This .308 is a perfect gun for hunting, target practice or scouting.  It shoots great and  has perfect fit and finish.  Pictures do not do it justice.  I am an avid shooter and gun collector; I am not a dealer or “gun flipper”.  I shoot everything that I own and have a deep love and passion for all firearms.   I try to shoot at least a few times a week, year round.  I am only selling this gun to buy and build different projects.  There is nothing wrong with this firearm and I am open to cash or trade.  I do have many different scopes that I could sell you for a fair price if needed.   I am going to be putting up around 30 guns on this site in the next few weeks.  I am willing to meet you at any local gun shop, police station, or public building in my area.  I would prefer to sell to CCW/CPL carriers.  I am going to ask for ID and will not sell to anyone underage or in bad standing.

Price:  I am selling all of my guns below “street” value!  - $550.00 firm or trade

Description:  The “94” has been referred to as the ""ultimate lever-action design"" by firearms historians such as RL Wilson and Hal Herring.  The “94” was designed by “Gun God” John Moses Browning.  This rifle is credited with the name ""Winchester"" being used to refer to all rifles of this type.  This gun comes from a large private collection that is getting sized down.  Shoots great and it has great fit and finish.  This is not a “Made in Japan” Winchester.  This gun was made in 1972 in the USA.  The 1972 guns are just as nice (or nicer) as any “pre 64”.  This would be a great gun to hunt with and still hand down to the next generation of shooters in your family.  Not mint, but a very nice gun.  Pictures do not do it justice.  These are nice to carry because of their light weight.   I am an avid shooter and gun collector; I am not a dealer or “gun flipper”.  I shoot everything that I own and have a deep love and passion for all firearms.   I try to shoot at least a few times a week, year round.  I am only selling this gun to buy and build different projects.  There is nothing wrong with this firearm and I am open to cash or trade.  I do have a few different scopes that I could sell you for a fair price if needed.   I am going to be putting up around 30 guns up on this site in the next few weeks.  I am willing to meet you at any local gun shop, police station, or public building in my area.  I would prefer to sell to CCW/CPL carriers.  I am going to ask for ID and will not sell to anyone underage or in bad standing.   

Trades:  I only buy nice firearms at a fair market price.  I buy around one to two firearms a week and I think I’ve got a good feel on what things are worth.

Price:  I am selling all of my guns below “street” value!  - $285.00 firm or trade

Description:  This is a really nice shotgun!  This gun comes from a large private collection that is getting sized down.  This would be a perfect first shotgun for a youth or someone not wanting the recoil from a 12 gauge.  Shoots great and it has perfect fit and finish.  Pictures do not do it justice.  I am an avid shooter and gun collector; I am not a dealer or “gun flipper”.  I shoot everything that I own and have a deep love and passion for all firearms.   I try to shoot at least a few times a week, year round.  I am only selling this gun to buy and build different projects.  There is nothing wrong with this firearm and I am open to cash or trade.  I do have a few different scopes that I could sell you for a fair price if needed.   I am going to be putting up around 30 guns on this site in the next few weeks.  I am willing to meet you at any local gun shop, police station, or public building in my area.  I would prefer to sell to CCW/CPL carriers.  I am going to ask for ID and will not sell to anyone underage or in bad standing.   

Trades:  I only buy nice firearms at a fair market price.  I buy around one to two firearms a week and I think I’ve got a good feel on what things are worth.

It is in great shape. I haven't shot it much. I have taken about ten deer with it at one shot per deer. Original zeroing used less than 40 rounds and anual zero check at about 6 shots.  So maybe 120 - 150 rounds through it.  The scope is zeroed at 200 yards right now and shoots dead on at any distance less than that.  It should zero easily to around a half mile. The scope picks up so much light that you have to use both sun shades in full daylight, and I think it would probably be great for coyote hunting.  I bought it to hunt elk in Idaho at long range. This is one of the flattest flying rounds ever made.  The scope is actually a target scope and can be adjusted for windage and elevation instantly without tools.  I haven't used it in 4 seasons, and need to cover some bills.  I bought it new in the mid 90's and have taken excellent care of it (cleaned after every use and maintained while shelved for long periods). Serious offers will be considered.

Inspection and sale will take place at my office in downtown Davenport. I will require Iowa issued photo ID (along with permit to purchase, carry permit or law enforcement ID would be a bonus). I will give you a bill of sale that we both sign. You will get the original and I will keep a copy for my records (copies are the main reason for meeting at my office)."

slimmer than glock, MUCH slimmer than XDsc .. smoother trigger than both .. ambidextoerous thumb safety, great sites, 3.5"" barrell with rail on bottom, loaded barrell indicator, etc etc .. AMAZING gun for the money .. if I didnt love my heavy 1911 this would be my carry piece no doubt..

Top notch parts through out:
Receiver is matched Black Rain ordnance ""Fallout 15"" skulls milled receivers. these are heavy milled aluminum  upper lower set. not light weight like found on most AR's. 
Barrel is a 20"" Stoner Stainless steel bull barrel with threaded muzzle chambered in .223 Wylde. 
Hand guards are Samson manufacturing 12.37 inch with modular rail pieces and full length top rail. This is a free float hand guard that is as rigid as any ive held before.
Military spec extension tube and Magpul STR 6 position collapsible stock that has magpul's lock system to keep it form accidentally collapsing. Also has battery storage and small tool storage in stock. 
Rifle is bloody heavy. this was built form the ground up to be a target rifle. Scope is a cheap barska that was never zeroed. Rings are from local store and are heavy milled aluminum with thumb screws. 
The Bolt is from Les Baer custom shop. good little bolts.
I have at this time a Adams Arms gas PISTON rifle length system installed. This is the gas block, gas regulator, piston, and bolt carrier. 
Problem: in building this and working with the engineers at Adams Arms we have found that the kit is incompatible with the .223 Wylde chambering. This chambering does not create the pressure needed to fulling activate the the piston and leads to short stroking. Rifle will fire first round but fails to auto load the 2nd round. Rifle was dead on at 100 yards. Local Gunshop/Ar15 armorer inspected and saw no other issues other than what Adams Arms engineers were stating. 
Rifle needs the following to function: Barrel in 5.56mm, or remove adams arms and place a regular gas system with bolt carrier on/in rifle and will fire fine. I have done so by tearing apart another AR and doing just that. I intended to sell either barrel or kit and work on this rifle more..but wifes car comes first. Rifle SOLD AS NEEDING FINISHED! Asking price below NEW parts for this build as rifle has had 30 total rounds through it. 15 to tinker with gas piston system and 15 to test with impingement system which ran flawless. I am selling with adams arms kit and selling rifle for less than parts cost. add it up yourself and see. comes with all seen. scope and rings included as is an old Hard Case."

This is a complete bushmaster carbon 15, with flat top and quad-rail carbon-length fore-end.  The only thing wrong with it is it has a bore snake lodged in the barrel.  You could easily just switch out the barrel, and have a fully functioning rifle again.  I never had any issues or malfunctions with the firearm prior to lodging the boresnake inside it.  It had about 800 rounds fired though it. 

I will only sell this as a complete package, including the upper and lower receivers, milspec stock, bolt group, foreend, and barrel.  Again, this is a complete rifle that just has a boresnake lodged in the barrel.

If you think you'd like to try swapping out the barrel, this is a steal.

This is a highly desirable, pre-Series II Kimber Pro Carry.  For those who don't know Kimber started installing a firing pin block safety on the Series II guns.  This one was built like a 1911 was meant to be built...no firing pin block.  It has a very nice trigger, a 4"" barrel, alloy frame and Meprolight night sights that are still bright and serviceable.  This gun includes the original Kimber case (the sticker is gone, though), the little Kimber take-down tool, owner's manual and 3 Kimber mags.  

It does show some signs of use but nothing serious (other than the idiot mark under the slide-lock lever).  Someone polished the feed ramp at some point but it appears to be fairly light.  The screw slot on the lower, left-side grip screw bushing is chewed up a little but nothing that affects the gun or that you can see.  Just wanted to mention that in the interest of full disclosure.

The gun functions perfectly with all types of ammo except CCI Blazer (aluminum).  It just WILL NOT feed Blazer ammo.  Everything else I've tried works great and the gun is very accurate.  

This gun is in remarkably good shape considering it's probably 11+ years old.

Hi, the girlfriend has decided to let her LCP go, so I’m listing it for her here. It is in great condition and works perfectly. These are great little carry guns that can fit anywhere. At under 10oz and under 6” long, you can always have this one with you. This gun has never been back in for service, is all stock and has never had a malfunction or misfire with any ammunition (exactly what you want in a carry gun).

We’ve owned this for over a year and probably put 100 rounds through it. It’s neglected people. It needs a new owner to love and cherish it and wear out it’s parts (and then you can get a new one from ruger under warranty).

The Specs can be found on Ruger’s website: http://www.ruger.com/products/lcp/specSheets/3701.html#
But just know that all the specs add up to one great carry weapon, light, reliable and always with you. 

Don’t worry yourself about my girlfriend though (how will she stay safe without her best little friend?!), she has already started rummaging through my safe and I’m sure will claim one of mine for herself by tonight. 

I’m asking $280, no taxes, no FFL transfer fees and no hassle. CASH ONLY. I will require a copy of your MO Drivers License and we will complete a bill of sale."

That's unusual. There is a forward sling attachment with rings on left and right. The forearm has threaded inserts left and right for mounting accessory rails. The front sight has a full protective hood. The left side charging handle is HK familiar. It only takes about four inches to charge the weapon. There is a left side bolt release that you'll immediately recognize as like the M16. There is a two position selector switch that, although it throws in the correct direction (down for fire) and is ambidextrous, it could have been larger to make it easier to reach. From a firing grip, I can't reach it without shifting my hand hold. The grip is nice and full, a little blocky. The length of pull from the trigger face to the rear of the buttpad is 14.25 inch"

 Every blemish I could find has a picture for it. Some pictures look to show blemishes but they are really just dust. Really there are two scratches in the last pictures that are the blemishes and they are obvious in the pictures.

Overall the pistol is in good condition, functions how you'd expect a Mosquito to after reading reviews.

Original Browning 1919A4 Machinegun rebuilt to Semiautomatic configuration.  Built on original US GI parts that were modified by Israeli Military industries to operate in .308 caliber.  This weapon was hand disassembled, inspected, reworked and re-parkerized.  This weapon has been test fired only and proven to be reliable.  Built by John McGuire master gunsmith for me personally and initialed JBM for authenticity.  John is the best in the 1919 business and his reputation speaks for itself.  Each 1919A4 is marked to resemble original US GI engraving.  Assembled using KMP side plate, trigger & sear.  Meets military specifications.  This 1919A4 is recognized as the finest weapon of this type being built today by the finest builder known today. 

Probably Collectible?  There is no doubt that this will become a very collectable weapon for a variety of reasons.  This is a Heavy Barrel version for ground use.

The Browning M3 aircraft gun is an extensively modified M2 aircraft gun that could be fired remotely by the pilot or gunner of a jet aircraft, helicopter or light fixed-wing aircraft. The gun is distinguished by a massive pneumatic buffer at the rear of the receiver. The gun was extensively used on late 1940s and early 1950s fighters until supplanted by 20mm cannons. No sights are furnished on the gun because the sights are considered a part of the airplane. Changes to the M3 gun relative to the M2 are: the bolt assembly, oil buffer body, and barrel extension are modified. The pneumatic buffer on the M3 is designed to absorb the greater recoil forces attendant to the gun's higher cyclic rate. The most famous use of the M3 was by the American F-86 Sabres against the Communist MiG-15s during the Korean War. Also used F-80, F-84, F-94, T-33, B-45, B-52, UH-1, HH-53.

Here are some other selling points about the differences between a M2 and a M3

Depressor's riveted into side-plate's, (VS. part of buffer group due to High breakage rate in M2's)
Air buffer ,No need for adjustment (All new Military M2's use the Air buffer)
Heavier belt lift capacity (M2 18lbs/M3 35lbs)
Improved extractor
Split lower feed pawl (Less Belt jams)
Wider upper feed pawl (Less belt jams) 

Probably Collectible?  There is no doubt that this will become a very collectable weapon for a variety of reasons.  This is a Heavy Barrel version of the M3AC converted for ground use, Semi-Auto.

For most large ring Mauser style rifles and carbines based on the German 98K design with a flip-up rear sight hinged in the front and including the Turkish M24/47, Czech VZ 24, German Model GEW 98, KAR 98, Yugo M48, Persian (Iran) copies of the Czech M24, Argentine 1909, Spanish 1943, and others based on the original 1898 Mauser design.

The Mauser 8x57 cartridge is in the same class as the American 30-06 and is popular for hunting big game in the United States. Take advantage of the inherent accuracy of your Mauser carbine or rifle by adding this 2-7x32MM scout scope and increase your rifle’s effective hunting range by 250 yards or more.  Most big game is taken at ranges under 100 yards, but for those long shots across a pasture or from a hill top, this variable power scope provides a wide range of magnification to see your target out to 350 yards or more.

+ New Mount with Manufacturer’s One Year Replacement Warranty

Some vendors are selling mounts that use two short bolts threaded into the sides of the mount through the “ears” of the rear sight base.  With extended shooting these bolts strip out the threads in the aluminum scope mount and the mount becomes loose.  Our mount has been threaded completely through and is fitted with a full length threaded cross bolt and retaining nut that securely attaches the scope mount to the rear sight base. This mount will not shoot loose.

It is factory new ammo, packaged in plastic trays in boxes of 50. I ordered 1000 rounds. I only got to use 150 before I traded my 9mm for a 40 cal so I have no use for this ammo.

It is zinc plated, steel cased ammo with no defects and very shiny. Looks like nickel plated brass.

It shot very clean with no issues in my Glock 34.

I have only had it a few months. It has been kept in a dry box with a dry pack indoors.

For $150, this works out to 17.6 cents per round for NEW ammo that won't damage your gun. Buying a box of dirty Winchester for $14.99 at the range and adding tax makes that 32 cents a round.
