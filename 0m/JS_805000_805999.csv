This is a unique rifle. It weighs in just under 4 pounds. I have a few other AR platforms that I work on when I have the cash. This one sits in the safe. It is not a new rifle but it is in good shape. I have used brass casing ammunition only with this weapon, and it has performed without issue. This would be a good weapon to take hiking or fishing, it can take the abuse and weighs very little. 

Rifle comes with scope rail, ported flash hider, and removable butt stock. If you need some magazines I can get you some. 

I am trying to bankroll a vacation for my family and I need cash. I am asking $650 for this rifle, which is a FAIR price. It is not an inflated price, which is what you are seeing on ARMLIST and at all of the gun shows, with gun owners attempting to cash in on the scare caused by our incompetent politicians and the Newtown killings.

The attached picture is not the actual rifle. I have misplaced my camera port cable. The attached picture is a picture of the same model of rifle that is for sell. If you would like to see the rifle for yourself, I will be happy to meet you. 

Please e-mail me if you are interested in the rifle."

The 6P Original is a compact high-output flashlight featuring an anodized aerospace aluminum body. It uses a precision micro-textured reflector and a SureFire incandescent lamp to produce a smooth, brilliant beam with enough power to temporarily blind and disorient an aggressor by impairing his night-adapted vision. Output is either 65 or 120 lumens, depending on which easy-to-install lamp you use—high-output or ultra high-output. The tactically-correct pushbutton tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on.

For those of you who dont know what this is, it is an ar style shotgun.  It is semi auto and magazine fed.  It is made to look and function similar to an ar-15 rifle but it is a shotgun.  Most of the controls are the same as an ar rifle.  It originally came with an ar style carry handle and  front sight.  I took them off and put a red dot on it but I do still have the carry handle and front sight.  It also comes with 2 5rd mags and a set of 3 chokes and choke wrench.  I also have original box it came in.  I would need to see your Indiana ID and license to carry to prove you are not a felon.  Any questions feel free to ask, or if you think the price is too high make an offer.  Cash is king but I may take trades it just depends on what you have."

Other trades of comparable valued considered.  Rifle is made in Germany.

For fans of the FN-SCAR battle rifle, the MK22 should look very familiar. Along with the FN-style stock and receiver outline, the MK22 has many of the same features as the rifle that inspired it. The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights.  
The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge allowing it to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. Both 10- and 22-round magazines are available. 
The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the rifle. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage.

Thank you for looking."

The Saiga-12 self-loading smooth bored shotgun is intended for professional and sport hunting of small-and medium-size game under any climatic conditions. This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action! The shotgun comes with 12-ga. smooth bored barrel and the chamber which accepts the ammo equipped with shot or slugs including ""Magnum"" cartridges with 70mm (2-3/4"") and 76 mm (3"") cartridge case. The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well."

Here is the info on the gun straight from the Sig website:
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

What's that, you say? The Mini-14 ISN'T an Assault Rifle? You mean to tell me that it's essentially a semi-auto coyote gun?

Going back to my ""1911 .45ACP Roots"" (yes - I know - going to be capacity/ammo deficient in a gunfight :)  So I am selling my Glock-19s and 26 to help finance a Wilson Combat, Nighthawk or Springfield Armory Professional and my precision rifle that is currently being built. I am a certified Glock Armorer and both of the Glock-19s and the Glock-26 have less than 100-rounds fired in each and are in almost New Condition. 

Buyer pays for shipping and insurance to your FFL; not included in sale price. Cannot sell to individuals in States that do not allow high capacity magazines.

Glock-19 Gunfighter Kit#1 is listed at $ 2500, Glock-19 Gunfighter Kit#2 is listed at $2500 and the Glock-26 Concealed Carry/Back-up Gun Kit is listed at $600 (combo total of $5600). Contents of the Glock-19 Gunfighter Kits are almost identical with the exception one has Milt Sparks Leather Holster/Mag Pouches and the other has Kramer Leather Holster/Mag Pouches. Each Kit comes with the same amount and type of Ammunition.

Will consider combining both Glock-19 Gunfighter Kits and the Glock-26 Concealed Carry/Back-up Gun Kit and all 5858 rounds of 9mm FMJ and 475 rounds of Duty/Self Defense ammo for a total reduced sale price of $4600 (a $1000 discount) or will consider trade for a comparable priced Full-Size 1911 .45ACP Wilson Combat, Nighthawk or Springfield Armory Professional.

Will consider other Glock Gunfighter Package Combinations on a case-by-case basis, as well as other trades on an individual basis. Definitely recommend the Glock-26 back-up gun for use with the Glock-19 especially in Concealed Carry.

Note (1): Not all 9mm Factory New Ammunition has original boxes because for high round count training classes, dumped ammo in baggies or ammo can for ease of transportation, reloading mags and weather protection

Note (2): All Holsters are for Right-Hand
