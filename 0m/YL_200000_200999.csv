DISCLAIMER:  The stock magazine tube dimples have been drilled out.  I believe it could use some more work as it seems the mag spring catches on the remnants of the dimple and will jamb sometimes.  That is why this shotgun is priced accordingly.  All sales are final and you have been warned!

Price is $300.00 FIRM.  Don't waste my time with lesser offers, I'm not anxious to sell it.  Only reason I'm selling it is I could use some cash for some quad parts. FTF along I-25, Monument to Denver.  Must be 18 or older and legally able to purchase a firearm.  Be prepared to show a valid CODL, CCW preferred."

Rifle is in great condition with roughly 500 rounds fired.  Groups fantastic and I may regret selling it.  It has been a safe queen but I am trying to sell to fund an NFA purchase.  I just hope I don't regret selling such a good shooter.  There are 0 scratches to note.  Included is original paperwork, sling, and magazines.  I outfitted the magazines with Magpul anti tilt followers and then put them away.  I don't think they have ever been used to fire, only loaded for function check.  I added many things to this rifle and am leaving a few with it.  First, the BCG has been upgraded with the POF roller cam pin and chrome gas key.  I will also include the factory gas key and cam pin should you ever want them.  I also added a Magpul Enhanced Trigger Guard that you will receive installed.  Again, factory trigger guard will be included.  Finally, I added a Bravo Company H2 buffer weight that will be included. This buffer weight greatly dampens recoil and reduces stress on the BCG by slowing the cyclic rate.  I also have a VLTOR IMOD stock that you can purchase from me as well for $80 extra.  VLTOR sells them for $99.95 brand new.  This stock has not a single mark on it and I still have original paperwork and box.  Because the NFA gun I am looking at has a Mil Spec buffer tube instead of a commercial, I have to buy a new stock.  I will be purchasing the exact same IMOD stock as I love it but I just have to get the right size.  I paid $880 for this rifle, added many parts, babied it, and fired 500 rounds with proper barrel break in.  I'm asking for $700 OBO with everything listed (minus IMOD stock) or $750 OBO with stock.  Contact John at REDACTED or REDACTED  Compare to NIB prices of $800-$900"

This Ruger will shoot 3-shot groups in 1/2 inch range all day. Accurate will not describe its ability.  It will out shoot most of us. The Leupold scope is perfect and the set up includes Ruger rings. This is a hunting rifle and as such is not perfect. The bluing has rubbed off in a spot near the muzzle from scabbard wear and the wood is dented in spots. ALL HONEST WEAR FOR SURE. The wood and the metal have never been refinished as I have seen elsewhere so if you must make it pretty, you will be starting with a fresh rifle.

Here are some facts about the Model 15....

The Smith & Wesson K-38 Combat Masterpiece Revolver Model 15 is a six-shot double action revolver, with adjustable open sights, built on the medium-size ""K"" frame. It is chambered for the .38 Special cartridge and is fitted with a 4-inch (100 mm) barrel. Originally known as the K-38 Combat Masterpiece, it was renamed the Model 15 in 1957 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. It is a shorter barrel version of the Smith & Wesson Model 14 Target Masterpiece and essentially an adjustable-sight version of the seminal Smith & Wesson Model 10 (""Military and Police"") revolver with target shooting features. The M&P underwent steady evolution throughout the years and S&W spun off several variations as separate models. One of these was the K-38 Target Masterpiece, which began production in 1947. The Target Masterpiece included a number of new and/or special features, including a narrow rib to provide a level sight plane, a Partridge front sight, a micrometer click rear sight, S&W’s .375” short-throw hammer, a trigger adjustment for overtravel, and improved grips. Noting the accuracy of the Target Masterpiece, a number of police departments and the FBI soon requested the same revolver with a four inch barrel and a Baughman Quick Draw front sight. The result was the K-38 Combat Masterpiece. 
In 1957 the K-38 Combat Masterpiece was renamed the Model 15 when all Smith & Wesson revolvers were given numerical model numbers. A number of production and engineering changes have been made throughout the years, some of which are noted by a dash number suffixed to the Model number. The model 15-2 was produced from 1961-1967.
 Over the years the Model 15 has been produced with several barrel lengths, with 4"" being the most common. 

Production of the Model 15 was discontinued in 1999 when Smith & Wesson was purchased and reorganized."

The .460 has the ability to take down any North American predator or game animal. Using the .460 round, zeroing is done at 200 yards! Flat trajectory means confidence.

Product Details & Specifications
HENRY REPEATING ARMS CO Big Boy Deluxe Rifles 
First Edition Henry 10 + 1 45 LC Deluxe Engraved Cowboy/20"" Octagon Barrel/Walnut Stock 

The graceful, elegant design immediately lets you know that they paid attention to detail. The craftsmen were instructed to take the elaborate and intricately executed Nimschke style scrollwork of the engraved Henry Golden Boy and execute a similar pattern on the solid brass receiver of the Henry Big Boy. The result is an awe-inspiring companion piece to the engraved Golden boy or one that can certainly stand on it's own. The Henry big Boy Deluxe Engraved also features an engraved brass barrel band and high grade deluxe fancy American walnut stock. An oval shape has been left blank on both sides of the receiver for personalization. Production is limited to 1000 units. If you wish to purchase the Henry Big Boy Deluxe Engraved .44 Magnum, they suggest that you visit a Henry Dealer in your area and special order one by placing a deposit with the dealer.

This Beretta is in great shape with some wear on it.  It has Trijicon night sights which still glow nicely.  It comes with papers, 1 original 15rd mag and 7 15rd LEO mags from Check-Mate Ind.  
But enough about the Beretta.  Let's talk about the comp.  As stated before, it is an original SGS Made in Italy.  This company went out of business in the 80's and these comps are the holy grail for Beretta enthusiasts.  I think everyone wanted one when the saw the movie ""The Professional"".  I have never seen one in real life except for my own.  When I first saw it, I knew I had to have it.  That was 10 years ago.  I have never seen one before mine, nor since I bought mine.  Very rarely does one come up on market, but when they do,  they go for around $500.  There is a company reproducing a clone copy for around $300-$400, but there not the original.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own the impossible.

Now for the formalities.  
I'm only selling this gun to fund another project.  I'm under a timeline.  this gun has to be sold before Saturday, otherwise I'm putting this back in the safe.  The asking price is $900, but if you only want the gun and mags, I'll due $500.  I will not, repeat, will not just sell the comp alone!  Your choices are either the whole package at $900, or everything except for the comp for $500.  These prices are FIRM!

Have yet to find the booklet BUT you can look that up on Taurus if you really need it. 

Comes with a Blackhawk SERPA holster. Fits it perfect. It is black. Can send you a picture if you need it.  

Please ask me any extra questions.

I live around Roundup but will come to Billings or meet somewhere to get this to you.

Sneaky Pete ""PDA"" Holster for a Keltec PF9 (it may also fit other ""pocket"" 9mms)

I bought it new and only wore it once, for a few minutes, to try it out. I traded my PF9 shortly after I bought this holster so I never got to use it.

$40 firm. That's about $10 off the price I paid, not counting shipping.

Looking to do a face to face transaction within the Upstate.

I have one for my Keltec P3AT and love it! I use it for when I can't use a pocket holster, or don't want to.

Example... I like back pocket carry the best, but my blue jeans and dress pants don't have flaps like my cargo pants and shorts. When I need, or want, to tuck my shirt in I like using my Sneaky Pete holster. I don't have to worry about my pocket guns showing at my back pocket line because of not having a shirt tail to cover it up. I know I could carry in my front pockets, but I keep A LOT of other stuff in the front... a big knife, keys, cell phone, mini flashlight, very small wallet, etc.

The Sneaky Pete holster for the PF9 is a bit bigger than the one for the P3AT, but here's a link to a video of the one I have for my P3AT, so you can get an idea of the thing:

Spare barrels for these are impossible to find, and the nickel finish is also very rare. 

I'm selling this because the previous owner led me to believe it was in ""excellent"" condition with a ""few scratches"" on the barrel. The truth is, while the frame of the gun is in great condition, with just some minor freckling on the cylinder, the 8"" barrel is pretty torn up. It looks like he tried removing it with some pliers, so the shroud is a little chewed up. The 4"" shroud is in much better shape, but it does have a small spot worn down near the frame. 

Overall, the gun looks pretty nice with the 4"" barrel attached. 

Email me for more information, or visit my website www.MatebaFan.com to learn more about these rare guns.

I have 8 M12 racks designed for storage of the M16 family of rifles. These are in good/fair condition, as some are better than others. 2 of them have had an army modification for the M4 rifle, the other 6 are unmodified. The modification is fairly simple and is shown in the attached PDF files. I assume the M4 modification is to help secure the firearm in the rack, as M4 rifles will sit in the unmodified rack. Modifications may be necessary with various configurations of AR rifles and optics if you wish to use the locking bars. It may be possible to use this rack with other pistol grip equipped carbine length rifles, however it was not designed for this and may need to be modified.

If you have a project that you will ""get to one day"" and haven't - I want to buy it. I'll use the parts to make another Winchester almost new again! In the medical field you could say that I do ""transplants"" to patients needing a new heart, lung or such. Your old Winchester will live again but in another body. Go now, to the fartherest corner of your shop and dig out that old, tired soldier and send it to me. I'll prepare it for surgery.

This gun is an ass kicker that doesn't take any bs from any ducks or geese.  I can only imagine what it would do to a turkey.  God help any turkey you bead up on with the sp-10.

Originally asking $600 and reduced to $350 because of small chip on the bottom edge of the left side pistol grip. Very small and light weight will make a great addition to anyone’s collection. I have included photos for reference and circled in red the damaged grip. Other than that I have personally fired the weapon several times without fault but as always “I CANNOT PROVIDE ANY GUARANTEES”. Keep in mind this is NOT the M1905/M1906 Vest Pocket pistol, it is a true “Baby” Browning without a grip safety. I am sure this item will sell fast at reduced price so its first come first serve. Thanks and see below for contact info.

The Fabrique Nationale Baby Browning is a small blowback-operated semi-automatic pistol designed by Dieudonné Saive based on a design by John Browning (among Browning's last designs) and chambered in .25 ACP (6.35×16mmSR). The pistol features a 6 round magazine capacity and is a striker-fired, single action, blow back mechanism. The manual thumb operated safety locks the slide in the closed position when engaged using side thumb pressure.

POU (Philosophy of Use):
Ideal for use as an easily concealable backup pistol. With this semi-automatic in a bind you can just aim and count to six. Can easily fit in your boot holster or just in your boot! For those bike riders like me you can slide it right into your inside vest pocket and not even know its there. Comes with a great story also.

The calibre is .243 win. mag.  The Scope is the Leupold Vari-X 3 3.5-10 power with a 50 mm objective.  I sighted this gun in and hunted with it once.  That's it.  I never turned out to be the hunter I thought I would.  I'm selling it now because I would love for someone to get the enjoyment out of this that I never did.  I went with this setup because I wanted to be able to shoot anything regardless of how far away it is.  The ballistics of the bullet hit with alot of energy and the 50 mm objective draws in alot of light in dusk shooting conditions.  I'm told most big game animals step out around then.

With a permit, the seller now believes that ""to the best of their knowledge"" that the buyer is not a felon. By you stating your disagreement with people asking for a permit tells me one of two things. 1.) You are not able to get a permit issued to you because of something on your record or 2.) you are under 21.  If it is the latter, you can go to you local PD and get a permit to purchase for long guns.  Which you need if you wanted to buy an AR or other type of assult rifle.   

Most people know the laws regarding private party sales.  I would rather see a permit than take someones word that they can legally own a gun.  

If you can find and buy from your ffl (read as gunbroker), why don't you buy it from them then.  I find it irritating that someone is only willing to pay trade in prices for things.  If I wanted trade in prices for my gun, I would trade it in.  Why is my gun worth less private sale than in a retail store?  Have you ever heard of negotiating?  I bet most of the items on these listings, the seller has an lowest amount they are willing to except.  If you don't want to pay asking price or are willing to negotiate, don't buy it and go to your fll and get it for cheaper.  

I don't care if this gets flagged.  It tells me that you read it.  I invite you to go to mnguntalk dot com and post your question on the forum and see what other people say about this subject."

Well made and weighs less than 5lbs, never had a hiccup.


It has the AR15 stock & pistol grip & the heavy barrel which is standard on the C model. AR15 style stock is not standard to this rifle, it was an additional $200 and was installed when it was new. 2-stock 30rnd mags, 1-10rnd mag and 2- new 30rnd Pmags. The foregrip flips down and doubles as a bi-pod.

I've shot about 120rnds through it and the previous owner (original) put less than that through it. Shoots beautifully and clean. Looks awesome. I'll include whatever. 223 ammo I have left, I think about 60-80 rnds. Very accurate and nice trigger. I've shot a lot of AR's and this rifle shoots cleaner and better than most.


I need cash on this one.
