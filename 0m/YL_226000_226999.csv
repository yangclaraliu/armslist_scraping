The best long-term and survival food on the market is also the hardest to get a hold of, the Military Meal Ready to Eat (MRE). The MRE became popular around Y2K, but ever since Hurricane Katrina there have been a lot of companies trying to cash in on the popularity by producing similar looking products under the same name.

• Includes a full three-course gourmet meal, candy and accessories pack
• Shelf Stable (needs no refrigeration) with a history of a long shelf-life
• Used by our Military for many years, proven in combat many times over

• Includes flameless heater, but can be eaten hot or cold.
• Lightweight, Easy to store or carry, perfect for your go-bag too

We do not quarantee it will be exactly the same as MRE's change every year.

These are only $180 new at Cabelas, so I'm not going to pay new price. I undrstand different models cost more, but a used blackpowder gun isn't very valuable if it's been used with real black powder. These only cost $50 back in 1990. 

Don't even contact me if there's pitting, rust, or broken parts. Willing to pay up to $200 cash for a gun in excellent condition with extras.
Stainless or ""buffalo"" version is a big plus, but not required. If you have the detachable stock for one, I can make an exception for my price limit. 

If it comes with powder, holster, lube, lead balls, primers, etc. that is also a plus. Willing to drive within 70 miles of Arlington, WA

I'm going to buy one new at Cabelas this Christmas if I don't find one here. So if it is after Christmas and you are reading this, I have what I need.

Email only! I won't call you if you send your phone number

I can also pay in Silver and Gold bullion if that's your type of thing. Can also trade for a calibrated CDV-700 Geiger counter. (I sell them on Ebay (hughescoinsandcollectables))"

I tried others including derringer, Desert Eagle Micro, and Kar. The problems I experienced were too little ammo, small caliber, and a hammerless action.

It is one owner. I bought it new. It hasn't been used for 3 years so I need to sell it. 

This is very similar to a Bobcat 418 mini excavator. I just called them to get a price on a new one... $21900! You'd be better off to buy my used one! Note the low hours and great condition on the treads.

This gun has never jammed and has never been carried-- always just a home protection weapon kept in a safe. There are some small finish blemishes nut very minor. I have only dissambled the the gun once to clean after firing at a range. I also have a second magazine for the gun as well that I bought separately from Smith & Wesson as well.

This was designed as a serious self-protection weapon-- often used by law enforcement as a backup gun. It has a trigger safety but no slide safety and is a double action gun -- no hammer for easy concealment and draw. Very thin and compact and very light. I want to get a more target based gun so this SW380 is for sale. I will pay my FFL dealer to do the transfer and the shipping charge from my location to your location -- you will pay your FFL dealer to receive and transfer the pistol to your name.

These are Spanish made bolt action carbines constructed from 8mm Mauser actions for .308. They were a stop gap measure before the CETME could be introduced. They are very short, and make excellent brush guns. Has a NATO flash hider and a fake gas tube up front to store a cleaning kit.
I've put 20 rounds through it since I've had it and it seems to be very accurate with open sights for within 100 yards. I haven't tried the adjustable peep sights which range out farther.

I have a little over 100 rounds of Yugo 8mm on clips to go with the Hakim and a 3 boxes of ammo to go with the FR-8.

I's like to see these gone; they're taking up too much room in my cabinet, and I have no use for either one. I'm going for a trade value of $750. The Hakims generally go for about 500 and the FR-8's for about 350 or more.
Would take cash for both or partial or whole trades. Ammo as well.

Has 143,121 miles on it. Dont go thinking that this car is a show car, because its not. But it does get you from point a to point b just fine. Has newer tires all the way around, new battery, fresh tune up with plugs, wires and oil and filter changed and pcv valve and air filter. Has the dynaride option (air ride), Automatic transmission and all options available for a 1992 including dual climate control. I drive it 44 miles a day to work and back. I am honest and telling you everything about this car, so please be honest about your trade also. Here are the couple problems it has. When its cold, it idles rough because it needs an oxygen sensor ""had it scanned at autozone and thats the code that came up on their scanner"", low coolant light sometimes comes on, ""resivoir level sensor"" but it does not overheat or use coolant.. And it does have a dent on top the trunk lid with surface rust ""see picture"". Also the passenger rocker is rusted but has a factory piece of trim there, so its not as noticeable. Interior needs vacuumed, and has a torn spot on the drivers seat ""see picture"" but cleans up very well. I have a 4wd Ranger, so i dont need this anymore. It is still plated and insured so a test drive can be done. Would like to trade for a nice high powered rifle (ar15 or similar) or a nice .50 cal or .45 cal handgun.

It has only had one magazine through it and is in perfect condition. These pistols sell from 1300-1500 IF you can find them. The armory kote models in particular are hard to find.

I've put less than 300rds down the barrel and cleaned it thoroughly after every shoot, the rifling looks to be 100% and there is zero pitting in the bore or chamber, exterior shows normal wear. The sights on this are very accurate, more so than myself, and also has a separate sight for a grenade launcher attachment. Everything on this rifle is stock and everything that came in the box is included; Sling, manual, oil bottle, cleaning kit(in the rear of the stock), and some pouches. I will toss in some ammo and stripper clips. I'm not really desperate to sell  therefore low-ball offers will be ignored, while all reasonable ones will be considered, I would much rather trade and try new things.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, .357 SIG and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm. The SP2022 – the only polymer framed pistol engineered to perform, built to protect and good enough to be called a SIG SAUER.

In 2001, DPMS expanded from its share of the .223/5.56mm market, and exploded onto the .308 rifle scene. The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.
With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist and free floating handguard and a flat top receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since.
This rifle features several factory installed modifications including replacing the slick side high rise upper receiver with an A3 upper receiver with forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover. Installing a JP adjustable trigger in place of the standard trigger and swapping a vented free float tube for the standard free float tube.

Gun is in very good condition everything is Winchester except for the stock. Price is negotiable. The M1 carbine is an interesting little weapon. The original request for a compact and lightweight shoulder arm to replace service handguns for second-line (non-fighting) troops was first issued by US Army in 1938. The idea behind this request was that a shoulder arm, such as carbine, firing ammunition of moderate power, will have more effective range and will be much simpler to train the users to fire it accurately, than the standard .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol or revolver. This request was probably the first recognition of the need in the Personal Defense Weapon in the modern sense. Request was shelved for some time and re-issued in 1940. It included the new cartridge of .30 caliber but of power far less than of US general issue .30-06 ammunition. The cartridge, officially named the ""cartridge, ball, .30 caliber, M1"", was developed by the Winchester company. It was a straight-case, rimless design with round-nose bullet weighting 110 grains (7.1 gram) and muzzle velocity of 1860 fps (~ 570 m/s). Muzzle energy was about 2 times more than of .45ACP pistol cartridge but still almost 3 times less than of .30-06 rifle cartridge. In the modern sense the .30 carbine cartridge can be called an ""intermediate"" but the lack of the muzzle energy and round nosed bullet limited the effective range to about 200 meters or so. Anyway, it had still much longer range than any pistol round of its time, along with moderate recoil. Many companies submitted their designs for US Army trials but the winner eventually became the Winchester. The design of the Winchester carbine is often contributed to the David ""Carbine"" Williams, who was the developer of the gas system. But, according to some sources, this carbine was born as a spare-time hunting carbine project of some engineers at Winchesters' workshop, and, when military request appeared, this design was resurrected and adopted for intended use. In any case, Winchester began to deliver its first carbines to the US Government in the July, 1942. Some other manufactures also were selected to produce the M1 carbines, such as Inland Manufacturing Division of the General Motors Corp., Underwood-Elliot-Fisher Co., Saginaw Steering Gear Division of the General Motors Corp., National Postal Meter Co., Quality Hardware & Machine Co., International Business Machines Corp (IBM), Standard Products Co. and Rock-Ola Co. During the period of 1942 - 1945 total of more than 6 millions of carbines were manufactured. Since 1944, the only companies still manufacturing M1 carbines were Winchester and Inland. After the end of the WW2 production continued for some time, and M1 carbine and its variations saw some serious action as a first-line weapon not only during the WW2, but also during Korean and early stages of Vietnam war. M1 carbines also were widely exported by US Government to numerous friendly nations, mostly in South-East Asia. M1 carbines saw limited use in the post-war West Germany and France. It should be also noted that M1 carbines are still manufactured by various small US companies for civilian sales, using both military surpulus and newly made parts. Large numbers of surpulus M1 carbines also were sold at the civilian markets in the post-war. REDACTED"
