This Elite comes with a factory Colt box (I will go on record to say I can not verify it is the original box as there is no end label). Original (not a reproduction) Colt Manual, Cylinder Disk and what I would assume to be the original plastic bag that encased the pistol.

Again, collectors: This is NOT a standard stainless model that has been buffed/polished. This is a legitimate, true Ultimate Bright Elite and I will stand behind that claim with a 100% money back guarantee.

I am not pricing this piece cheap, nor do I feel I am trying to ask a mint. I am pricing it at $5200. Standard bright stainless models are bringing in the high 3k range, as we all know so take note on this beauty.

My plans changed. I am going to be available all day Sun. and then Mon & Tues evenings. Didn't get to stay in deer camp due to work needs this week.

If you've been following for the last week you know I'm a hobby dealer selling out. You also know that about 40% of my list is gone. The response has been great, and I've enjoyed meeting those that have purchased.

The updated list has nearly all the items listed at my cost, some below my cost, and none more than $10 over my cost. Many are well below current dealer's cost and some will be below dealer's cost even after tax. They aren't going to get cheaper unless you make an offer for the remaining stock.

Paperwork will be done.
 Background calls will be made.
 Tax will be charged at 0.0885%.
 Even though it's a hobby, it's set up as a legitimate business and all laws and regulations will be met.

I only meet to sell, not to show. Wish I had a storefront to help those still shopping, and I love to visit as much as anybody, but with a full time job I don't have time to meet unless you know what you're looking for.

I'm still catching up on emails from yesterday and scheduling meetings for today. Today is your best bet to purchase. Evenings are tough, as I'm only available after 6:30pm, and I won't meet very late. If it's like it was last week, the meeting times fill up fast. Meetings should not take more than 15 minutes start to finish.

The list is shortened even from yesterday's post.

If you are someone truly looking for a great CCW or gun for your wife and want to save some money, this is the one for you. 

PRICE IS FIRM.  You are saving around $50 versus buying online+shipping+xfer or from a local shop with tax and you get it in your hands today with no additional paperwork.  (and this is $55 less than the other LCP being offered on Armslist right now)

Not being an ARSE but if you are one of those people that is going to take the time to email me and debate this don't.  I won't respond. Likewise if you are offering anything less than asking price don't bother as I DO NOT have to sell this, it sits comfortably in the safe and doesn't eat a thing.

Thanks for looking and God Bless the USA, we sure need it."

Cosmetically:
Wood=90-95%
Receiver=75%
Barrel=Bore is very good...BLUEING IS VERY POOR

The wood on this gun is very good in my opinion.  The receiver has some wear in the blueing and a few very minor scratches.  

THE BARREL BLUEING IS VERY POOR.  Probably 50% gone.  Not sure how it got like that as it was like that when I got it but it almost looks like someone tried to clean it with the wrong stuff and it was removing the blueing.

""STRUCTURALLY"" and ""MECHANICALLY"" the barrel is 100%.

I HAVE MORE PICS FOR ANYONE INTERESTED.

Also have a Plano hard plastic case that will be included if you want it.

Asking $275 but will consider SERIOUS cash offers or possible trade: WOULD REALLY LIKE a .38 or .357 short barrelled revolver or will consider any handgun in trade with me adding cash as necessary...my gun plus $300 would probably be my limit.

It wears a full monolith rail with a full lenght 12 o clock rail, and 12, 3, 6, and 9 o clock positions forward of the magazine extension. This beast carries 10+1 rounds of 3"" 12 gauge shells. It has 12 shell holders mounted that can be easily removed to customize to your taste or mission needs. It wears an AIM red dot sight and has MagPul flip up back up sights. The sights and red dot were specifically chosen because of their height. The red dot does not interfere with the flip-ups , and when the sights are folded, they are out of the sight picture of the red dot.  The fore arm wears a tri-rail athe the 3,6, and 9 o clock positions, and has RemTac muzzle break for breaching or striking. When fully loaded and the side saddles are full, the weapon has an impressive 23 rounds of 12 guage shells. That means you have a full reload plus 1 if you wish. This is going to become a production weapon from my company soon, so I want people to get to know my brand."

Here is the factory info:The micro-sized .380s that have arrived on the scene in recent years have reduced dimensions to the point that they are difficult to control even for the most accomplished shooters. The CZ 83's combination of small size and moderate weight easily handles the new generation of high-performance defensive ammo that has become available for 'pocket' pistol calibers from leading ammo manufacturers. The DA/SA trigger mechanism operates in the same manner as the CZ 75. The 83 can be carried 'cocked and locked' with the hammer back and the safety on for single action operation, or it may be manually decocked for hammer-down carry. When carried in the decocked position, the safety lever does not need to be de-activated, but instead the first shot is double action and subsequent shots are single action. The CZ 83 features an ambidextrous manual safety and magazine catch. 
Along with its superior shootability, the 83 boasts twice the magazine capacity (12+1 in .380) of its tiny competitors."

With 50% more HEAVY DUTY receiver that also has double reinforcement and crowned with extra heavy duty Target like barrel !  A true comparison is with the Russian tiger Draganov.Having made a reputation for accuracy,This heavy duty Barrel not found on most other rifles has Chrome lined chamber and Bore. This Vepr system along with excellent quality of all parts, to many to list here, has earned a legendary reputation for total dependability from the jungles to Siberia ! Vepr Comes with 1  US 30 round magazine, cleaning rod , cleaning . This barrel length is 16.5'' inches. Has scope rail on left side of receiver for mounting telescopic scopes or holographic sights on a picatiney rails. The rifle will take most in spec hi cap AK mags & drums.

Veprs are built for extreme demands above and beyond all others with extra heavy duty receiver, extra heavy duty reinforcment each side and an extra heavy hammer forged chrome lined target like barrel. The combination of years of proven design with attention to detail has produced legendary dependability and legendary accuracy from the jungles to Siberia!

Bolt of the Vepr models in 7.62x39 caliber are fitted with two locking lugs.

Enhanced against weather and mechanical wear the cartridge chamber, barrel bore, gas cylinder, and bolt- support rod are chrome lined.

A vepr goes through a thorough inspection process at every part, every step of building and must pass the final thorough examination by a quality control committee before any vepr ever leaves the arsenal.

Why the Vepr is better than the average AK

Hammer-Forged, Chrome-Lined, Heavy Barrel.  Most durable AK Barrels Made.

Hammer Forging is a process whereby the lands and grooves of the barrel are formed by hammering the barrel material against a mandrel. This process not only creates sharp and well defined lands and grooves but also leaves an excellent surface finish on said surfaces. An additional benefit is that the barrel material becomes work hardened. The chrome plating helps prevent against wear and corrosion. We don't believe you can buy a better barrel on any rifle.

Rifles based on Kalashnikov's operating system have not been known for their exceptional accuracy. The renowned AK47 rifle was designed to function flawlessly in all environments and temperatures. In other words, functionability was more important than accuracy. However, because the VEPR has a stiffer receiver than the AK47, better accuracy can be expected.

Most Accurate.  Consistently better groups than other AKs.

True RPK Receiver.  Stiffer and longer wearing than any other AK receiver.  Made for Soviet Squad Automatic Weapon.

The VEPR costs more for a reason - It is simply the finest Kalashnikov based rifle available in the U.S. market

Will work with most In Spec Hi Capacity AK 47 Mags & drums ."

This is Winchester 40 S&W Ranger Bonded 165gr. Hollow Point Ammo. This ammo features the new Winchester Ranger Bonded bullet that is manufactured using a newly developed proprietary bonding process. This process eliminates the limitations of traditional copper plated bullets. Ranger Bonded has a controlled jacket thickness and taper, along with a unique bonding process that bonds the copper jacket to the lead core. This is done to ensure optimum performance. The resulting permanent core/jacket bond, with the special hollow point cavity, act in unison to control expansion with deep penetration. This maximizes performance and weight retention through a variety of the toughest barriers – especially auto glass. This ammo is packed in 50rd. boxes."

This TV costed $2200 and is like new in excellent condition. I MEAN REALLY GREAT CONDITION! I still have the price tag taped to the side from when I bought it. I would like cash or trade offers or a combo of both (*****Please get at least close to fair market value with me*****) I prefer if you pick this TV up, it is big. I would consider delivering it if you come here and see it and seal the deal first. I just dont wanna move this thing more than needed. You truly will love the quality of the picture."

About the Handgun:
This series of pistols is based on the Beretta 92 series patterns, except that they chamber the .40 Smith & Wesson cartridge.
About the Manufacturer:
The ancestory of this Italian company dates back to 1526. The Beretta family began in the firearms business as barrel makers. Soon after, they began manufacturing their own sporting shoulder arms. The first Beretta pistols were made in 1915, and by the end of the 20th century Beretta had become one of the world's major premier handgun manufacturers. 

In 1977 Beretta-USA was established, with a manufacturing facility located in Accokeek, Maryland. In 1985 the US armed forces adopted Beretta's Model 92 pistol as their standard sidearm.
About the Cartridge:
This cartridge was developed as a joint venture between Winchester and Smith & Wesson. It was an effort to to create a cartridge with the same power as the 10mm Norma round that the FBI had just started using, but in a shorter case. The shorter cartridge would facilitate accuracy and allow use of a smaller, more comfortable grip frame. The .40 S&W has become the cartridge of choice for many law enforcement agencies in the United States."

The barrel is super easy to install. My first one Iput on took m about 12-15 mins' but on my last MAC it took 4 mins to change the barrel. Its just a super well built easy to work with and has all the treads you'd ever need to have. Ihave them on all my MACs and M-11's. I just order one too many this last order, my fault will end up your win!

This barrel is very cool because it allows you to have multiple threads on just 1 high quality made barrel. I have them on all my MG MAC and the first one i installed is still on and probably close to 24-28k rounds through it and still as accurate and has not faded any since the day it was installed. That's why I have them on all 6 of my SMG's .

For the barrel being sold, I opened the package to make sure it was perfect in aesthetics and to check the thread quality. At this time i felt the threads and they are very smooth with no rough marks. I tested the 1/2x28 threads with my AAC Ti-Rant 9 and it fit perfectly and snug on the 1/2x28 threads. I then checked my Bowers Group CAC Suppressor on the barrels other threads, the 3/4x10 threads and they fit tight and smooth as well. It truly is one of the best threaded barrels I own. I can honestly its just as good if not better that some of my several hundred dollar Jarvis Barrels I use on my high end pistols. If I'd had known about these sooner, I have no doubt I'd have them on more pistols.

It truly is a GREAT GREAT DEAL !

The 1/2x28 threads are standard on .22 as well as on astandard 9mm barrel so you can thread on suppressors and muzzle brakes.

There have been many variants of this weapon but in my opinion the closest to the original design the better. When they tested this weapon they fired 2500 rnd through it without a single malfunction. These guns mean business. They will incapacitate your target FIRST shot guaranteed. They are not for the faint of heart by any means. If you are looking for a true American invention, and time tested weapon this one is for you. ITs a big gun  PERFECT for home defense and CCW for the bigger person. I hope you will enjoy the 1911's as much as I have. There is (in my opinion) no better , more faithful, automatic pistol in the world. If you are interested in taking home this American DESIGNED masterpiece of war call or text me anytime day or night from midnight to midnight at REDACTED or Email me I respond QUICK. If your looking for a sissy gun, there is always the French and Russians. This weapon is made in the Phillipines, but follows the same original design as the first 1911's HAS NOT JAMMED ON ME SINCE IVE HAD IT"
