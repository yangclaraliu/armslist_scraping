Selling my Kicker Comp 12"" subwoofers and 1,000watt amp due to the fact that I just sold my Charger and my new car came with a premium sound system. The Kicker subs come in a Kicker box from factory and shows no wear. The emblem of one of the Kicker ""K""'s are slightly worn off but I don't know how. Doesn't affect the sound since it's just a logo. Other than that, the subs and amp are near perfect. The subs may have slight wear, but nothing that affects the pound that these things put out. The amp is attached to the back of the box to save space and I think it did great. If you have a Dodge Charger (06-2010) it will fit perfectly since I used to have one and know that for a fact. Anyways, I paid about $1100 for the setup along with installation. I have almost all of the wiring and stuff that will go with this setup, might only need to buy a single wire for the set but shouldn't be more than $20 I would guess. I have all of the more expensive things you need. If you know how to set these things up and want to test them in your car, feel free prior to purchasing. Anyways, asking $400 since I paid almost three times more than my asking price.

It's just been sitting around collecting dust.  I figured I could at least sell it and buy more ammo for other things!  

A little bit about this lower.  It is not your standard 80%er.  This one has the mag well, AND fire control pocket milled out already!  The 20% left to do is the following.

-Tap threads for buffer tube.
-Drill hole for buffer retention pin.
-Drill and tap threads for pistol grip.
-Drill both fire control holes.
-Drill Safety selector hole.
-Drill bolt catch roll pin hole.
-Drill both front and rear take down pin holes.
-Drill front and rear spring/detent holes for take down pins.  
-Drill trigger guard pin holes.
-Drill indentation for buttstock collar.  

Now, this looks like a long list; but notice that all of this is ""drill,"" not ""mill.""  That means with proper blue prints and a good micrometer, you can do this in any old drill press.  

I'd be glad to meet during the evening sometime at the Mall of Georgia or any of the surrounding areas.  I work out in Commerce, so meeting after work is a must.  If you're an Athens resident I'm also in that area a bunch to.  I'd be glad to try and meet you over the lunch hour on the north side of town.  

I paid $150 for this in 2008 during the height of Obama's election.  I'm needing $125 in cash, or else $100 in trade value for other gun related items.  Ammo, AR mags, Glock mags, ect...  Won't hurt to ask me.

If interested in 222 Remington (NOT magnum) brass......Ill have to count. Almost all once fired but older. 20 cents each (there......that will cover however many I have.) Not pitted but will need tumbled.

If local and picking up I have various .224 bullets.

AMMO shipping is Gawd Awful and UPS. Brass is USPS and not bad but the more you buy, cheaper shipping is per item.

Prices are picked up. Shipping is extra of course. FFL number to call and get reference. Gun nut, not nutcase.

The original PTR rifle was first conceived in 2002, when a predecessor company purchased tooling and designs for the HK line of roller-lock weapons from Fabrica Militar of Portugal. PTR is committed to providing top-quality firearms to the most discerning shooters be they military, law-enforcement, or civilian. Along with this commitment comes the obligation to stand by every part and firearm that leaves the factory, and provide the customer an excellent experience long after his purchase comes out of the box.

The PTR-91 is based on the HK-91/German G3 battle rifle. Parts are abundant and magazines are dirt cheap for this rifle.  PTR has recently announced that it will be providing a Lifetime Warranty on all PTR manufactured internal parts. This warranty covers all bolt group and trigger group parts manufactured in the U.S. by PTR, and is retroactive â so it may be considered to cover all internal parts manufactured by PTR both before and after this announcement.This warranty can be further construed to cover any other parts manufactured by PTR within the Bolt Group, and Trigger Group.

Caliber .308 or 7.62X51 Nato. it also includes flash hider, H&K navy type polymer trigger group, tactical handguard machined from hard anodized aluminum and to military spec., three 6â 1913 rails on handguard at 3, 6 and 9 oâclock positions. Their is also a Picatinny rail mounted just forward of the rear site so you can mount a wide variety of optics.

It has the original Colt grips that bear the Colt horse insignia in silver.  The grips are made of plastic because the US military demanded that Colt knock the price of the weapon down to $25 per unit from $28 per unit in order to obtain the contract.  Hard to believe that $3 used to make a difference.  Today, August 5th, is the anniversary of the first patent inscribed on the top of the barrel from 1889.  This gun goes for $1,250 MIB.

It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK MP5-style sights. The sound dampener (SD) is actually a compensator. It is attached to conceal the 16.1 inch barrel that extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The MP5âs magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed for ease of loading with dual grips for holding the spring when loading. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire versionâs mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. The MP5 SD estimated retail price is $519.

Also small crack in the finish extending from the rear swivel stud, goes about 1/8 inch into the wood. Butt pad fits poorly but the stock has not been cut and the pad is correct. Compared it to my other one. The stock is for a 600 not a 660. Think it came this way as the gun was produced first couple months of 660 production clean up of 600 parts is my guess. Trigger guard is not as warped as most and requires no forcing to get it to fit into the stock. Please contact for more detailed pics.

Includes Leupold standard mount and bases. Also a second stock is included. Nothing special ramline synthetic. Fits good and I fitted a limbsaver pad to it also has a foam check piece. Helps with the recoil. Excellent trigger.Makes a great bear or elk gun for this fall.

This is THE best all around .22 tactical assault riffle out there.  It has a nice scope that is zeroed in and super accurate. 2 30-round banana style magazines and original 10-round clip.  Fun and cheap to shoot all day long. Why buy a .223 ar-15 that you can't afford the ammo for.  It was only a special run that Remington made so there are not that many out there for sale.   This one I found brand new this year and has about 1000 round through it. Just been cleaned and oiled.

324,http://www.armslist.com/posts/501324,"For Sale:  Custom Loaded Blued Springfield, .460 Rowland","AR, Oklahoma, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Sunday, August 5, 2012",Handguns,Springfield                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is  a Loaded Steel, Blued Springfield 1911, converted to a .460 Rowland, using the Clark Custom conversion.  It has a Match Grade trigger, two piece full rod guide, Mag guide, 2 magazines, and other custom features.  Will include the original Match barrel and spring.  You will definitely appreciate this 1911!  Great HOG Gun too!
 Some information on the .460 Rowland to familiarize you--
 The .460 ROWLAND has external dimensions identical to the .45 ACP case with the exception of length. With safety as a prime consideration, the .460 ROWLAND case is approximately 1/16 of an inch longer (.460 ROWLAND case length is .957 on.) than the .45ACP case, to prevent chambering in an unmodified .45 ACP handguns.  Internally, the .460 ROWLAND case is much stronger than the .45 ACP case with an entirely different design and pressure capacity.  Loading information for the .460 should NEVER be interchanged or substituted in .45 ACP cases; however, .45 ACP loads may be used in the .460 ROWLAND cases and fired in properly chambered guns with no apparent difficulty.
Tests show that a 230 grain .460 round reaches a velocity of 1340 fps, while a standard 240 grain .44 Remington Magnum round reaches a velocity of only 1180 fps. The energy in ft/lbs is 917 for the .460, compared to 741 for the .44 magnum. 
The .460 ROWLAND loaded round overall length (OAL) is the same as the .45 ACP OAL to allow use of standard magazines and common accessories.  It has been established that pressure limits for the .460 ROWLAND cartridge at or below 40,000 Copper Units of Pressure (CUP), and believes this to be the optimal pressure limit for available guns and components.

This .38 Special version of the Smith 640 was made for only a few years.
S&W then went to making the .357 Mag version of this model. This .38spl 
version is sought after due to it's shorter barrel and lighter weight when
compared to the longer and heavier .357/640 model.

ready for a lifetime of service.

Pollished Bolt (Looks awesome and cycles amazingly smooth)
Single point tactical sling

***For an Extra $50 I can include the custom fitted tactical case (Cost me well over $100***

The Pictures do not do the gun justice but I can send more if you need them.

The round count in this gun is close to 400.  It has never been in the woods, rain, mud or much less layed in the grass. So I would rate it a 9.5/10 only because it is used. It comes with all paperwork and the stock internal parts. It cost over $1800.00 to build this gun so I think $1400.00 is a fair price, If not then shoot me an OBO.  I am in no hurry to sell this gun as me and all my friends have a blast shooting it, especially skeet (in which it performed amazingly well).  It is one of the coolest looking Saiga 12's out there and if you have never dumped a 10 round mag with the folded sock you are missing out!

I'm not a collector, just looking for a shooter in nice cosmetic and mechanical condition.

I'm not cheap and will pay the difference if we determine your gun and accessories is worth more than mine.

FTF preferred but can ship if necessary.  I have a C&R and you may ship directly via UPS.  My gun must go to your FFL.

THAT'S $100. LESS THAN I PAID FOR IT, AND YOU GET AN ADDITIONAL PAIR OF UPGRADED GRIPS PLUS A FULL BOX OF AMMO!
 FOR SALE. Brand new unfired in the box with all accessories, Taurus PT-100 Stainless .40 S&W Caliber pistol with accessory rail. Although it currently has genuine Taurus Pealite Grips on the handles, it came with the black hard rubber grips which are included in the box. The Taurus Pearlite Grips are really beautiful, with a deep dimensional swirl which rivals natural pearl in it's appearance. The included black hard rubber grips are nicely checkered with the Taurus logo, and provide a firmer hold for extended range practice and competition. Depending on your mood, you can change out the grips in about 2 minutes. 
The PT-100 is based on the time proven Model 92 platform which has been constantly improved and upgraded over the years resulting in the 9mm sidearm currently carried by the US military. In fact, many handgunners consider the Taurus to be an improvement over the military issue due to the placement of the hammer drop safety on the frame instead of the slide. The .40 caliber chambering is one of the standards of law enforcement now, similar in stopping power to the venerable .45 ACP.
 A Taurus favorite, the PT100 makes a return appearance equipped as a large frame pistol in a popular police caliber. Featuring an ambidextrous three position safety that allows cocked and locked single action carry or the convenience of a de-cocked double action.

I got this pistol about 2 months ago and it has remained unfired in it's original box with accessories since that time. Unfortunately, due to medical reasons I have to sell it to pay some bills. I paid $599. for it at Gander Mountain (you can look it up on their web site) but am willing to take a hit on it ($499. OBO). Also, you will not have to pay sales tax ($36.), and the pearlite grips were about $60., and a new box of ammo I got with it was $24., so you will be getting about $220. off of what I have into it. And since Taurus has a lifetime warrantee for any owner, so your coverage is the same as if you had bought it in the store.
 Face to face sale cash only, buyer must have Florida Drivers License and be allowed to own a handgun in Florida. If I don't respond to your first email, please try again, as I sometimes accidently delete emails along with the spam we all get."

The M6A2â¢ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2â¢ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2â¢ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2â¢ rifleâs edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCIâ¢ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2â¢ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorrâ¢ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2â¢ rifle is coated with EXOâs patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2â¢ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

The use of a lighter, narrower bullet results in a significantly higher muzzle velocity and superior ballistic performance to the .50 BMG, supposedly to such a degree that the .416 Barrett retains more energy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. The projectile remains supersonic to out around 2000 yards. That's my typical ground squirrel shooting range. That's why I bought the Barrett. Ha, ha, ha. Heck, I can't even SEE 2000 yards! I saw one ballistic chart that said the Barrett puts a 400gr bullet at 3250fps with a resulting muzzle energy of 9380 foot pounds. That's around twice the .458 Winchester magnum! Those ballistics will provide greater accuracy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. This rifle is brand new in the box. It is chambered in the .416 Barrett. It comes with one 10rd magazine. It is housed in a Pelican 1750 case with a custom moulded interior designed specially for the rifle so it is held securely. This is not a factory California compliant model. If you are in California, you should email me before you bid to discuss compliance work. I included some photos of the rifle with optics mounted just for fun. Those optics are not included in the price of the auction, although they and any others are available if you wish to build a package. I also have spare mags available."

The quad rail and scout scope configuration works well, although it is not currently zeroed.  Easy enough to do, since it should be on paper right now. The Vortex 2x fixed scope is high quality, weatherproof, etc, and the eye relief is perfect for the length of this rifle.  This is the lowest profile non-red dot config for the AK, and the only configuration of its kind.

I believe in truth in advertising and this gun sucks.  I've taken it to the range twice and bad experiences each time shooting 9mm ball (115 gr.).   First time out failure to eject and kept hanging the spent cases (stove pipe).  I took it home and trimmed down the spring/follower.  Second time at the range gun shot the first magazine flawlessly and then second mag I had a hang-up and slide failed to seat new round.
