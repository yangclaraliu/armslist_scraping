During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, Russian troops armed with mostly Berdan single-shot rifles engaged Turks with Winchester repeating rifles and suffered heavy casualties. This emphasized to commanders a need to modernize the Imperial army. The Russian Main Artillery Administration undertook the task of producing a magazine-fed, multi-round weapon in 1882. After failing to adequately modify the Berdan system to meet the requirements, a ""Special Commission for the testing of Magazine fed Rifles"" was formed to test new designs.
Sergei Ivanovich Mosin, a captain in the Imperial army, submitted his ""3-line"" calibre (.30 cal, 7.62 mm) rifle in 1889 alongside a 3.5-line design by Léon Nagant (a Belgian) and a 3-line design by captain Zinoviev. When trials concluded in 1891, the units which tested the rifles were split in their decision. The main disadvantages of Nagant's rifle were the following: more complicated mechanism, long and tiresome procedure of disassembling (which required special instruments - it was necessary to unscrew two screws). Mosin's rifle was mainly criticised for lower quality of manufacture and materials. This resulted in a slightly larger number of stoppages. The Commission voted 14 to 10 to approve Nagant's rifle. However, the head of the commission, General Chagin, insisted on subsequent trials held under the Commission's supervision during which Mosin's rifle showed its advantages, leading to its selection over the Nagant."

If you know anything about AK47s, you know that the milled stock versions are a little heavier although more robust than the stamped AKs. They are, therefore, much preferred as it makes this great weapon even more reliable than it already is. (Note: AK47World.com says that the Chinese milled receiver rifles are superior to the Russian equivalents priced under $600. The Bulgarian milled AK47s fetch an average of $800-900. And many other milled receiver rifles, such as the SA-M7 AK and Poly Tech Legend AK47 go for over $1,000.) This rifle for sale is a Chinese built AK47 and has been sitting in my safe for many years as it is the backup for another, a Poly Tech Legend (see above). So, there are very few shots through it and the lands and grooves inside the barrel show just that. It has two hefty sling brackets on the left side, wood furniture, and comes with two 30-round magazines. (Also, keep in mind that AK mags are not expensive.) The shoulder stock is an under-folder which allows the rifle to have a smaller profile and also be fired without the stock extended. The 7.62 x 39mm bullet is the perfect battle round (puts the .556 x 45mm NATO to shame) and is one of the least expensive and readily available everywhere. If you are thinking about buying an AK47, this is the perfect choice. If you don’t already know, the AK47 was designed by Russian Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947 as an answer to Germany’s WWII Sturmgewehr StG 44. Since then, somewhere around 100 million of these great guns have been produced and used throughout the world because of their popularity, low cost, lethality, and reliability. Cash only.

If you want a lightweight, inexpensive tactical rifle to start or include in your self defense or sporting collection, the AR-15 is the baseline rifle from which to start. The design of the AR-15, attributed primarily to Gene Stoner with some help from others, was for developing a lighter rifle that could carry more firepower and replace the much heavier M-14. Introduced as the M-16 from Colt in the Vietnam War, it changed the way the U.S. military was armed and the same basic rifle remains in use today after 50+ years (In service: 1958). The AR-15 rifle is very popular and has had many manufacturers; this on for sale has a Sendra lower. These rifles are inexpensive to own and shoot and have many accessories available on the market.

 I have a brand new KelTec PF9 for trade. Bought this pistol last week for conceal carry and it's just too darn small for my hands. I'd like to trade it for something a little larger but still concealable. I will consider all reasonable trade offers and respond to all. 

This pistol has 150 rounds thru it with no hiccups. Comes with hard case, one 7 round magazine, pinky extention & flat bottom for the magazine. Trigger lock and Owner's manual. Below is info from the KelTec website:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Calibers:	9mm Luger                       
Weight unloaded:	12.7 oz.                          
Loaded magazine:	5.5 oz.                            
Length:	5.85""                              
Height:	4.3""                                
Width:	0.88""                               
Barrel Length:	3.1""                                 
Capacity:   7 + 1
Trigger Pull:	5 lbs  

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Up for sale today is my Ultralight Carry Sentinel (9mm) that was purchused new in Aug. 2012 from Rankin Arms. I've shot this gun approx 225 times. (4x boxes of FMJ Federal and 25x 147g Ranger T's) The gun ran flawlessly with no problems what so ever. When I purchused this gun I ordered a Richie Hideaway holster which comes with the gun as well. ($140.00) The holster was never worn, the gun did sit in the holster to loosen it up though. All together I paid over 4100.00 for this setup about 3 months ago, it's a great gun and great holster but I've got big hands and decided to do with a Bobtail Professional for carry instead. 

This gun comes with the original bag, all the original paperwork (test target, sticker, manual, dog tag) and the original dropship reciept showing that it came to me from WIlson Combat via Rankin Arms. It also comes with two 9 round Wilson ETM mags which the gun came with. Please note, you can see on the test target and dropship receipt that it lists this gun as a .45, this is an error as the gun is 9mm. You can see from the holes in the test target as well as the target load that it is 9mm. Not sure why it had .45 on it but the serial number is correct and its chambered in 9mm. 

Here is a link to the Wilson site directly - 

http://wilsoncombat.com/new/handgun-ultralight-carry-sentinel.asp

Ruger®LCP/Kel-Tec®P32 Side Mount Laser 

NEW IN PACKAGE

LaserLyte® answers the growing demand for lasers specific to the increasingly popular conceal carry market with the new Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser (CK-AMF). At half the cost of a leading competitor, the CK-AMF fits on the side of the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec .380 and .32. Easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock pins with the new screws (included). Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The CK-AMF design works also as a finger guide that allows for safe trigger control without blocking the laser beam. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. The side mounted laser allows the pistol to fit in virtually any nylon pocket holster. The new LaserLyte Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser is compact and light, and foremost – deadly

Laser System Smaller and Smarter

NEW IN PACKAGE

Subcompact V3 laser by LaserLyte® is the company's most state-of-the-art, smallest and versatile rail mounted laser to date. Now half the size of the previous model, the Subcompact V3 needs less than ¾-inch of Picatinny rail space to easily mount onto even the smallest firearms.

Constructed of T6 aluminum for extra strength and durability, this updated unit offers a smart, cost-effective auto-off feature. If left on for five minutes, the unit begins to display a unique flash for one minute, indicating to the user that the unit will automatically shut off soon. After one minute in flash mode the unit shuts itself off to extend battery life, prevent accidental activation and battery depletion. Press the unit's button at any time to reset this feature for five more minutes.

The Subcompact V3 easily mounts with a hex drive crossbar screw and features windage adjustment, elevation adjustment and programmable constant on and pulse modes. Additionally, the unit is ideal for left- and -right handed shooters with two separate activation buttons located on the backside of the laser. Not only will the laser fit nicely on the smallest of sub-compact railed pistols, it works great on modern rifles as well.

The Subcompact V3 laser is powered by four 377 batteries that provide five hours in constant on mode and ten hours in pulse mode of normal usage. Normal usage is defined as one minute on and one minute off. This test mimics actual usage where the unit is turned on and off and the battery is given time to automatically regenerate.

For sale is a brand new Beretta Tomcat 3032. This gun hasn't been fired. I ordered this gun a week ago and just picked it up Wednesday. I have had a deposit on a Kel-Tec PMR30 for about 4 months and they called me Tuesday. I can't keep both guns.  I have other defense guns, so I am keeping the PMR30.
This gun will be perfect for a man or woman wanting a total concealment pistol. 
It includes , Beretta gun box and plastic case, magazine all paperwork and lock. I'm also throwing in free, an unopened box of ammo.
The retail price of this gun is between $380 and $430, plus tax. 
You can save big by buying today, only $350.
As I said I just got the gun, so the picture is a facsimile. 
This gun is a top quality gun, so it won't last long at this price. 
Please call Bob Jones if you want to see this gun. REDACTED.

From Beretta website:
3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT.
Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short).

 This is the black parkerized model showing normal holster wear. Last time I took it out shooting it did'nt cycle bulk ammo very well, but did just fine with good ammo. I polished some of the parts and feed ramp in hopes of getting it to cycle cheap ammo but I have not had a chance to try it yet. It does feel smoother working the slide by hand now though.

Green just got good™. Crimson Trace presents the MVF-515 Green; a revolutionary, patent-pending concept that combines three tactical tools for your AR style rifle into a single modular package. With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a green laser sight and a 150/200-Lumen LED light module. The MVF-515 Green leverages advanced technology to ensure long battery life and rugged durability through a wider range of conditions than consumer grade green lasers. Hot or cold, light or dark, the MVF-515 Green readily provides the most complete sighting and target identification system available anywhere. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light. Being a modular unit, users may separately purchase a red laser module for direct replacement.
