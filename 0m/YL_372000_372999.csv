This is a powerful, multishot pellet gun.  It shoots at 1000fps.  It uses a rotary clip so it's not necessary to load a pellet manually after each shot.  It is extremely quiet and has absolutely zero kick.

Probably the best SKS mount hands down. Makes it possible to mount full length optic’s on your SKS rifle with out fear of spent shell casings damaging or disturbing your scope. Further more the shooter is able to co-witness with their standard iron sights and is able to leave the mount and optic completely untouched during cleaning or maintenance of the rifle.

and 15 for the bipod. its a odd one, it folds up and lets you rest your gun , does not move in 360 degree way it stays put when its folded and attaches to rails so must have rails on bottom of gun for this and it also has a sling mount. its a good sturdy bipod though and has buttons for quick release and deployment of this bipod that have different settings for length of the legs on it when the button is pushed and legs are extended..

Just in case you didn't know, The Kel-Tec PLR-16 is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 NATO, manufactured by Kel-Tec Industries of Florida USA.  The PLR-16 combines the multi-lug rotating bolt design and breech-locking system of the AR-15 with a gas piston system.[2] The pistol accepts the same STANAG magazine that is used in the M-16, AR-15, and other NATO rifles chambered for 5.56×45mm."

I have a 1976 SACO import HK91 with the polygonal barrel, one of less than 300 known to exist. This has the same barrel type used later by the PSG1, MSG90, and SR9. It is in 80-85%, as it needs refinishing. It was refinished before I bought it, and the finishing has worn off in spots. It comes with a factory bipod and 1-20rd magazine. 

I am interested in selling it foremost, but will consider trading for a M21 or M21 clone, preferrably with the ART scope and USMC camo stock, or a transferrable M11A1.

I have multiple interested parties. I will NOT accept less than what's listed here. It won't last much longer.

I have a brand new, never fired Gen 2 Sig P250C (compact) for trade. Manufacture date is August, 2011. It's dual action only and is identical in size to a Sig P229. It comes with both .40 s&w and .357 sig barrels and night sites. Also includes 3 magazines and the case. Looking to trade for a Sig 239, 229, an old 226 or just ask me if you have another model available. I don't mind if the trade is a bit used and abused as long as it's solid, functional and fires without any problems. Caliber doesn't matter, it's to carry around in the glove box. I bought the P250 for that purpose but decided to not stray away from what I'm used to. Not interested in. 380's.

Not at all interested in trades other than a Sig handgun. Also not interested in separating any of the items or selling outright. FTF in Clark county Indiana with Carry permit in hand or we each FFL to FFL at own cost. Feel free to email for questions or ask for contact info.

The smoker is built as a reverse flow smoker. This means there is a heavy solid steel plate running inside the smoking chamber from one end to the other. The side of the firebox is welded tight and there is an opening on the opposite side. The smoke travels under this plate and gets evenly drawn back across the racks for a very even smoke over the whole rack. The plate is also installed with a slight V with a drain coming out the bottom of the tank. The juices will run out of the chamber into a bucket or pan you place on the ground. The firebox is built with a rear opening lid. It can be used to burn charcoal with a custom sized basket or just burn all wood. It works great both ways. Inside the firebox is a custom propane burner that can be used to heat the smoker or start the fires. I used it primarily to start the wood and charcoal, but it will heat the whole smoker as well for times you just need to keep stuff warm. The smoker itself is roughly 66"" long x 36"" wide. Double lids so you don't have to open the whole smoker at one time. Dual exhaust stacks with one lever dampener that controls both stacks. The inside has two full size cooking racks that both slide out for easily tending your smokes and removal for cleaning. The tool box is permanently installed and even comes with a custom made cover for it to help keep the elements out of it. I store everything I need for any smoke in the tool box. But it will be empty when sold. The trailer is built with storage in mind. Plenty of areas for coolers and wood. The LP tanks will not be included. Trailer has lights and a clean title. Its ready to take to any big party and competitions. You will find a lot of friends you didn't know you had with this. I am selling this because I just want to build another one.

Here is the specifics on the revolver from Chippa's website.  

REVOLVER RHINO 60DS 6"" - Black Finish
Target Shooting version, featuring a new standard in competition. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. The Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

You can get a hold of me thru email or call/text, text is always better for me REDACTED or REDACTED. if you have a trade, please send a photo if possible. thank you"

Selling my like new Remington 1911-R1. Pretty nice gun for the money, I just want to get a 1911 with a few more features. It's a mil-spec style 1911, nothing fancy going on with it. Standard hammer, trigger, and grip safety, although Remington says it has a match barrel and bushing. It isn't the most accurate 1911 I've fired, but it's no slouch either. I've put about 80 rounds through it. I added a set of black/ dark grey aluminum grips (the original wood ones come with it too) and a set of Wolff extra power springs (recoil spring and firing pin spring). This is a series 80 1911. Comes with two 7 round mags.

Purchased at Gander on Feb. 12. Paid 718.90 total, not including the grips and spring set. Asking 575 firm. Will also consider trades or partial trades plus cash. Only interested in firearms, especially revolvers. Shoot me an email if interested and we'll go from there, or you can call or text me at 316-737-82 eight five. Thanks for looking."

The stud that the ring is attached to is mounted from the inside of the case, and cannot pull out, not some cheap eyelet screwed into the flash hole that will come loose over time. I also do not just drill two holes through the case and put a ring through it, I think that looks tacky. All keychains come with a 1"" split keyring.

It is suitable for mounting flashlights, and/or lasers to the A1/A2 front sight block of your rifle. It may also fit airsoft rifle with similarly designed front sight bases. It solidly clamps to the front sight using a 3/16"" allen head machine screw with included allen wrench. These are precision machined for a secure fit so that it won't rotate to twist out of alignment during heavy firing sessions. It will fits with standard carbine style handguards, as well as Magpul MOE handguards. (it will probably fit with most all handguards, I only have experience with those two) It features 1.75"" of rail space on both sides of front sight. Made of aluminum and black anodized. The mount show normal signs of wear, but nothing out of the ordinary. Please email with questions, thanks!"

Self-contained module is ready to install in your small-pin AR and deliver an exceptionally smooth, crisp, creep-free single-stage trigger pull that feels more like a traditional bolt action than a combat rifle trigger. 100% drop-in—no gunsmithing, fitting, or adjusting required. All components are captive in the lightweight, aluminum alloy housing. Hammer is wire-EDM machined from S7 tool steel that combines hardness to resist wear with superior impact resistance to withstand heavy use without chipping or breaking. Other components are EDM cut from A2 tool steel, then heat treated to Rc 56-60 for long service life. Precision-ground engagement surfaces ensure superb reliability and a crisp, clean hammer release. Installs using your rifle’s original hammer/trigger pins; proprietary design eliminates pin walkout. AR-15 models have a fixed, factory-set 3 lb., 4 lbs, or 4 1/2 lbs. pull weight, available with standard solid trigger shoe, or a distinctive-looking, lighter-weight skeletonized shoe

It is in excellent / like new condition.  I did however, get the wood stock sprayed with black bed liner to weather proof it.  Though I never ended up needing it weatherproofed because it's never left my house.  It looks awesome that way though.

This is a powerful, multishot pellet gun.  It shoots at 1000fps.  It uses a rotary clip so it's not necessary to load a pellet manually after each shot.  It is extremely quiet and has absolutely zero kick.

It's been had less than 100 pellets put through it.  Looks like a brand new gun.

It will come with three rotary mags, a sling stud mounted bipod and scope rings

I have a 1981 yamaha maxim 650 for sale.  I have green title in hand.  It can run and drive however not perfectly.  I bought this about 6 months ago as a starter bike and am upgrading.  its got just shy of 36000 miles.  its not perfect, but its ok for what it is, a starter bike or funcional bobber/chopper project.  carbs were rebuilt right before I bought it, but they could be resynced. has a new back tire and battery, front tire is ok.  starter on bike is out and no kick start, so right now has to be push started (easy enough to do but inconvient) replacement starter is available on ebay for 40$.  also I was prepping to turn it into a hard tail bobber with only rear breaks, so to get use to it I drained the front.  they can be hooked back up no prob, just dot 3 fluid and pressurised.  I dont have original side pannels, but I fabbed a pair up (see pic)  the 21 is whats left of a century 21 sign.   Like I said was going to be a low budget bobber...    I am 6ft and around 300 lbs.  got it up to 75 cruising on highway no problem.  cash is king!, however partial/full trades concidered older running pickup ranger,s10,toyota, isuzu etc.   would also consider firearms as well.  specificly looking for g17 rtf,  sub 2k with g17 mags,  amd-65, 870 or 500 defence shotgun.  others concidered but will get a definate yes to those listed above.  also may do partial trade for ps3 package..  spammers need not email"

A3 flat top upper receiver, forearm quad, pistol grip and adjustable butt stock are Duracoated an atractive desert tan (has green tint). The free floated, ""Dissipator"" style barrel system includes a mid-length gas system on a medium-heavy weight 16"" barrel. The design increases the sight radius, stiffens the barrel and helps dissipate heat. Free floating reduces the standard handguard and sight's impact on barrel vibration improving accuracy. The barrel has a fast 1:7 rifling twist necesary to stabilize the heavier, longer 69-76 grain boat tail bullets used for longer range accuracy. To further support accuracy a competition single stage trigger with competition springs has been added. The rifle has a Phantom style flash hider that is pinned in place. Accompanying the dissipator barrel is a full 12"" length, one piece quad rail with numbered rail positions at 3 and 9 o'clock with desert tan top and bottom rails. The 12"" quad rail extends the flat top receiver to a full 18"". Flip up battle sights round out the weapon system. The Lauer lower receiver and recoil tube are black. Attached to the bottom quad rail is a AFG2 angled fore grip that both supports the grip hand and protects it from the sharp edges of the lower quad rail. It has a Magpul CTR (Compact / Type Retricted) adjustable butt stock assembly and a MIAD pistol grip. This is a really light, maneuverable rifle weighing only 6 pounds and 2 ounces by my scales. It comes with your choice of two new Magpul 30 round PMags or 30 round surplus phosphated mags and a new shell catcher. This is not your grandmother's stripped AR. 

The rifle will come with an accessory package at no charge. It includes a 3x9 scope and mounts, a mini holographic sight and a flashlight with rings. The rear scope ring has quad rails at 9/12/3 o'clock. The holo sight or the flashlight can be mounted on the scope ring's quad if desired. It came ot me that way. Personally I would put the light under the handguard. It isn't an expensive set up but more than serves its purpose.

The rifle as described is worth over $1500 but is being sold for $1250. An Atchinsson 22 conversion kit can be added for $50 if sold with the rifle."

This is my absolute favorite gun I have owned. I love having a rifle that shoots the same caliber as my sidearm Manufactured in 1989. Has the cross bolt safety. This gun was made when real guns were made before everything became polymers and crap. 

Fires flawlessly. Looks great. Bluing and furniture is in really good shape. I have attached a ton of pics below and tried to snap pics of anything I thought someone would want to see... 

The price on this is $750 FIRM. Firm? Yes, firm. I will consider cash plus ammo if you have factory 45 acp ammo. For $10 I will also throw in the black leather gun case you see in the first pic). And be quick, because I guarantee this walks out the door ASAP. The 1894 comes up every few months or so, and its always the 44 mag. You almost never see the 1894C 357 mag. You can even check online, go ahead, I will wait..... Ya, maybe you found about 5 or 6 of them? Please don't PM me saying that you can get this 1894C on gb.com for $650. Yes, you can, and pay the FFL and shipping and possibly find yourself buying a new version (after Remington purchased Marlin) which isn't half as good quality wise as this one. 

I am not trying to be rude at all, I am a straight up guy and always act on the square, but recently in dealings I have had people try to use gb.com as some sort of bargaining chip. Its not. When you buy a gun for 650 on gb.com, its going to cost way more than that to actually get it in your hands. 

Happy viewing! TEXT me for quickest answer. The first person to text and setup a deal will take this rifle home (but please note that if you say you'll take it, it means you need to come pick it up in SE Portland, and within a day or so, I can't hold this for weeks waiting and passing up other offers. I have done this in the past and have been flaked on, so I don't do that anymore)"

It is a beautiful rifle, and has only about two mags through it total. Wood stock and fore end are a very red wood color and have no dings or marks. I am hesitant to use the word ""flawless"" on anything, but they are close! These are very hard to find and good quality rifles, far superior to the WASR-10's flooding the market these days.

It was manufactured by Cugir in Romania, and imported by CAI. Apparently, these are built with more than enough 922r compliant parts that they can take any mags, unlike many other post-ban rifles. It has no muzzle device or bayonet mount since it IS post-ban. However, it does sport all the other key features like the side rail for mounting optics, chrome lined barrel, cleaning rod, wood furniture and standard polymer grip, dimples on the receiver to stop magazine wobble, and a rubber recoil pad over the original metal plate.  OD green sling, polymer mag, metal surplus mag, and a complete buttstock cleaning kit (brush, punch, jag, and sight tool) are all included. Smoothest action I have ever seen on an AK.

Not really interested in trades, unless it's a sweet deal. Buyers will sign Bill of Sale, IL FOID card required for IL buyers, and all the other legal stuff.  No shipping. I am willing to meet in the general Madison County IL area."

The rifle is very clean and, as you can see from the pictures, is in excellent condition. I also have 7 mags (3 pmags, 2 C products, 1 Stoner, 1 Bushmaster) and 950-960 rounds of ammo (240 brass, 710-720 steel). I value this stuff as follows:

I gave those prices to indicate what I think is (more than) fair market value based on prices found by searching the internet (forums and auction sites). Please keep in mind fair market value (e.g., prices you can buy things for on the internet) for your items when offering a trade.

I am hesitant to use the word ""flawless"" on anything, but they are close! These are very hard to find and good quality rifles, far superior to the WASR-10's flooding the market these days.

It was manufactured by Cugir in Romania, and imported by CAI. Apparently, these are built with more than enough 922r compliant parts that they can take any mags, unlike many other post-ban rifles. It has no muzzle device or bayonet mount since it IS post-ban. However, it does sport all the other key features like the side rail for mounting optics, chrome lined barrel, cleaning rod, wood furniture and standard polymer grip, dimples on the receiver to stop magazine wobble, and a rubber recoil pad over the original metal plate.  OD green sling, polymer mag, metal surplus mag, and a complete buttstock cleaning kit (brush, punch, jag, and sight tool) are all included. Smoothest action I have ever seen on an AK.

An ex sniper is a rifle turned back into infantry format at wars end by the soviets(having over 200,000 they couldnt afford to keep them clean and ready). Scopes and mount were removed, the mount holes were plugged and put into storage. Very uncommon. ""ex PU snipers"" were the same rifles seen in Enemy at the gates.
THESE ARE REAL RIFLES ISSUED TO SOVIET SNIPERS DURING WW2 - They dont NOT come with a scope or mount.
Price is firm but if you give me a couple days to pick up boxes I AM willing to ship within North Carolina(must have a valid license and legally be able to own a firearm) for an extra $12 which includes insurance."
