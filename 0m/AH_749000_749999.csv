It has a Wilson carbine-length (16.5"") barrel, and is chrome-lined. The free-floated fore-end is Yankee Hill Machine YHM 9631 carbine-length lightweight, the front sight is also a YHM, the stock is an Ace Skeleton, and a Magpul winter trigger guard has been fitted.

I've had this rifle since 2004. I have fired somewhere north of 2000 rounds out of it (and I mean JUST north, not 5000 rounds north) and it has never failed to feed, fire or eject. Not once. I have shot my own handloads with this rifle at 100 yards into 0.7 inches, with iron sights to boot (and I have pics of the target to prove it). Scope is a Vortex Viper Ball-Plex 2-7 x 33, and is lifetime warranted. The scope is essentially new; I've fired perhaps 200 rounds with it and it's zeroed nicely.

It's simply an amazing, pinpoint-accurate rifle, and frankly, I don't want to sell it, but I need to pay for the last semester of grad school, so they're all headed out of my safe.

Comes with the pictured magazines.

Price is firm, and I'm not entertaining any offers or trades. Bring cash/postal money order or stay home. If you're in a state that frowns upon the ownership of these kinds of rifles, or you're unable to complete the transaction in any way because you won't pass background, or if you're waiting for another gun to sell, kindly don't call. CCW people will be smiled upon. All others bring drivers license and we will both take away a bill of sale. Shipping, if you're from out of state, will cost you $35 (lower 48) and I will insure the rifle, which will be delivered to your FFL via United States Postal Service.

I've had this Rock River AR15 for a couple of years now. I bought it used and was amazed at its accuracy with my handloads - I have seen this rifle shoot under 0.5"" at 100 yards. I have put a Magpul Winter Trigger Guard and MOE handgrip on the rifle, and it's got a crisp Bill Springfield trigger job. I have free-floated the fore-end with a UTG free-float kit, which is sturdy as hell and nicely anodized.

The riflescope is a Falcon Menace 4-14 x 44mm, which is a pretty nice piece of kit for the money. 

This rifle has never failed to feed, fire or eject. I have put about 600 rounds through it and haven't seen the first hint of unreliability out of it. 

Rifle will come with the magazines pictured - 5 x 30-round magazines (three aluminum, three Orlite plastic mags), 2 x 20 round magazines (one steel, one Orlite), and 1 x 9 round magazine.

I am only interested in trading this rifle for any .308 AR, and I won't be selling it at any price. If you're in a state that frowns upon the ownership of these kinds of rifles, or you're unable to complete the transaction in any way because you won't pass background, or if you're waiting for another gun to sell, kindly don't call. CCW people will be smiled upon. All others bring drivers license and we will both take away a bill of sale. Shipping, if you're from out of state, will cost you $35 (lower 48) and I will insure the rifle, which will be delivered to your FFL via United States Postal Service.

It has a M-4 profile barrel which has had the A-2 front sight post removed and a 13.7"" Troy Battle Rail with a Troy low profile gas block installed by a local firearms dealer.  Unfortunately, I did buy the wrong Troy Battle Rail (old style high profile) so the top of the quad rail is about 1/16"" higher than the top of the upper receiver.  This has very little affect on the allignment of the front and rear flip-up sights but would prevent you from mounting a scope past the end of the upper receiver (not that you would want too).  It will also come with an AR scope riser with 1"" weaver scope rings, a bi-pod adapter and the factory hard case (which I had to modify slightly to accomidate the Troy Battle Rail).  The asking price is $2,900 for now.  I unserstand that due to the holidays you may not have that amount of cash just lying around but unfortunately I do not take credit cards.  However, I would be willing to check with one of my local gun stores to see if they would consider acting as a middle man in order to do a credit card transaction for the sale; but I'm sure that they are going to probably want to charge at least a $100 fee plus $25 FFL transfer fee."

Offered for sale is this perfect Vector Arms V-93 (a copy of the H&K V33/93). I have owned this rifle since 2007 and found it to be accurate, perfectly reliable and fun to shoot, with a mild recoil. Vector makes one hell of a gun - the welds are beautiful and the finish is flawless. They bought the tooling from H&K in Portugal, but the receiver is American-made (UTAH!) as are many other parts on the rifle.

Comes with bipod, two MKK clear polymer magazines, and one aluminum 40-round H&K mag, Brugger and Thomet (real, not some airsoft piece of crap) scope mount, and 2-7 x 33 Vortex Viper scope with Leupold rings.

For sale at $1750 with scope and mount, or $1575 without - either way you get the rear irons (not pictured). Price is firm, and I'm not entertaining any offers or trades. Bring cash/postal money order or stay home. If you're in a state that frowns upon the ownership of these kinds of rifles, or you're unable to complete the transaction in any way because you won't pass background, or if you're waiting for another gun to sell, kindly don't call. CCW people will be smiled upon. All others bring drivers license and we will both take away a bill of sale. Shipping, if you're from out of state, will cost you $35 (lower 48) and I will insure the rifle, which will be delivered to your FFL via United States Postal Service.

Its the most desirable color combination, Near mint Condition, Has a few, very very small blemishes here and there from normal use. She runs very strong never had any problems with her at all. Always garaged and stored properly, This bike runs amazing, looks amazing and handles amazing.

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

I am raising money to support a campaign and to whoever helps me in that venture will be given the gun. I'm not just selling a gun here, I'm also including 800 rounds of ammo and 2 magazines, plus a SureFire flashlight, but more importantly I am asking one person that believes in the right to bare arms as strongly as I do, to support my efforts to change the minds of opinion leaders regarding the gun ban. If your just looking for a great deal on gun, then look elsewhere. If your one of the people out there that wants to screw the price down, or that actually thinks he/she will find these guns for less than $2000 then do it. Prices are going up like crazy folks, thats just the way it is.  And if you want this gun bad enough you will pay the price I ask, but know your helping to support the NRA and my efforts to change the minds of those in a position to influence gun laws in our country.  Please dont send me emails asking for the price to be dropped or to tell me you think I am ripping you off. I'm obviously charging more than going rate because its to raise money for the campaign. Think of it this way. I once wanted a book that was being advertised on a infomercial. The book was free with a $500 donation. That was the only way to get the book. Yup, I paid it and glad I did. I knew I helped support the cause being the man and got the book I wanted. Had I really just wanted the book, I'm sure I could have found it on Amazon for $20 or so... and if your in the same boat and just want the gun, then go elsewhere. But if you want to stand up for your Second Amendment and try to change the way things are going, then please donate to my cause and I will give you the gun and all the extras for free.

Ok, so what am I asking? I am asking someone donate $5000 to my venture. If you can not purchase though please make a small donation by emailing me directly for the paypal address. Even a few dollars may help tremendously. Folks, we are living in a crazy time right now. Now is when we need to speak up and let our voices be heard. Lets not let a cooked up hoax and our emotions get in the way of logical thinking."

Del-Ton AR-15 Dissipator A3 Flat-Top Upper and Spikes Tactical Zombie lower.

This Del-Ton Dissipator A3 Flat-Top AR-15 Upper Receiver comes complete and fully assembled, ready for installation onto any mil-spec lower receiver. The Forged 7075 T6 Aluminum upper features a 16"" Heavy Contour Barrel, F-Marked Front Sight Assembly, 2-Piece Polymer A2-Style Handguards with heat shield and an A2 Flash Hider. The barrel's 5.56x45mm NATO Chamber, M4 Feed Ramps and 1 in 9"" Twist rifling ensure reliable feeding and functioning with a wide variety of both commercial and higher pressure military surplus ammunition. The Dissipator upper style is desired not only for its unique and aggressive looks, but also due to its extended sight radius and longer Rifle Length Gas System as compared to a standard 16"" carbine. 

The Bolt Carrier is machined from 8620 Steel for strength, incorporates a properly staked, chrome lined gas key, and houses a Carpenter 158 Steel Bolt that has been High Pressure Tested and Magnetic Particle Inspected (MPI) to guarantee a consistent, structurally sound part. This upper is an excellent choice for both the first time buyer and seasoned AR aficionado looking for a quality product at a good price.

NATO M196 Tracers - 12/18/2012
Reviewer: Tracer Man
Good buy for the price of ammo now a days. I liked the fact that the ammo came on stripper clips with bandoliers in a .50 cal ammo can, too. The shipping was fast and the ammo does exactly what it says. It was a great price for the number of tracers that you get and they trace a lot better than the orange tipped tracers like the XM856 American Eagle tracers. Will get more in future if supplies last.

Very Fun!!! - 12/5/2012
Reviewer: 1Gunnut
Great with full auto! 95% light, had to have more!

Satisfied - 12/2/2012
Reviewer: TheDude
4 out of 5 traced. It shoots a little dirty, but it doesn't get any better for plinking. Great ammo for the range.

Now I'm ready!! - 11/30/2012
Reviewer: Gene
Bring on the night time zombies!!! I broke open the can, and after choking on the crisp Nirvana air, I see such a sight I haven't seen since I was doing a live night fire in the Army. Lots of bandoliers of red tipped tracer ammo. After stuffing 100 rounds or so into 30 rd mags (thanks so much for the stripper clips), I was ready to go light up the night sky. After killing several zombie targets, and anything else around worth my lead love note attention, only a few rounds failed to light. Just got to love it, worth every penny. Buy this ammo. Might pick up another can for the apocalypse.

Here is an excerpt from Wikipedia: The PT1911 differs from its many competitors in the 1911-style market in that the basic model offers a package of features found on top-end models from more expensive semi-custom pistol manufacturers such as Springfield Armory, Para-Ordnance, and Kimber Manufacturing at a significantly lower cost.[1]

Featuring a forged steel frame, the PT1911 was originally marketed with a blued carbon steel finish, but as of late 2007 a stainless steel version was released. The standard PT1911 is hand-fit in the Taurus factory and includes popular combat and competition custom features such as a ""Beavertail"" grip safety with memory groove, extended ambidextrous thumb safety and slide stop controls, lowered and flared ejection port, frame checkering, and other niceties unusual for a pistol of its price range.

Lights on a tree can represent so many fantastic things about the holiday period. The scene 

of a family sitting around a Christmas tree, the only light in the room, while listening to 

the Nutcracker Suite and having hot chocolate. It looks like a fairy tale, but that's what 

the period is about; indulging our winter fantasies through festive decor and customs.

A lot of people choose clear or white bulbs because they match any color scheme or tree 

theme. Colorful lights definitely give a festive look and one colored lights like red or 

blue too go well with certain concepts. LED Christmas lights should be the first thing 

applied to a tree. Before you start to decorate, pull the tree away from the wall or home 

furniture so you can walk entirely around it without obstacle.

How many LED Christmas lights do I need?

A fine estimate of how many LED Christmas lights you'll need is to apply the measurement of 

100 lights for every foot of the tree. So for a 7ft tree, you'll want no fewer than 700 

lights. 100 strand light sets work best for most people. Always plan to pick up an 

additional set of lights in case of shortage or burnout - you would not like to find 

yourself beginning your tree trimming and have to postpone it to run to the shop for more 

lights!

Stringing the LED Christmas lights

Obviously, test the lights before you start. Plug in each strand to make certain every 

thing is a go and have them plugged in as you decorate. It's less complicated to string and 

place them correctly when they're lit. One of the best ways to achieve that ""lit from 

inside"" tree is to wrap lights around select branches. Start by getting a light controller 

- a multi-socket extension cord. You can buy these at any home improvement or hardware 

store. These holiday hookups allow you to plug multiple strands of lights to one cord and 

control them through one switch. They commonly make them in green but they're also 

accessible in white for white artificial trees. Attach the cord up and down the trunk of 

the tree with twine or pipe cleaner. IMPORTANT: Make certain to read the light 

manufacturer's instructions on strand plug on limits.

Grab a string of lights and start at the top of the tree. Plug the strand into the outlet 

near the top. Starting at the base of a branch, wrap the cord around the branch. Carry on 

until you reach the tip, then wrap back to the the base. You don't have to wrap it super 

tight, just enough to give the branch a sufficient glow without obstructing or crushing the 

individual branches, and simultaneously, hiding the wires well. As you work back toward the 

bottom, you can wrap around a few individual branches top. When you hit the base get 

started with a new branch. You don't need to wrap every single branch either (this would 

take a ton of lights and probably make the tree seem it was on fire rather than beautifully 

lit!). Just make certain you are consistent with your spacing from top to bottom. Take a 

step back and take a look at the tree to see where there might be gaps. It's even easier to 

string with an artificial tree, as you can string as you gather together and position the 

branches. Using this method will give your tree dimension and depth and make it seem like 

it's lit from within!

Take pleasure in your lit tree. Memories are only a light strand away...

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in standard military Gray."

Straight talk, real talk. Prices are still going up. This will not last at this price. If you are sitting on the fence I suggest you decide before the next round of increases. The $2000 guns from last week are bringing $3000. They are expensive but available now; better than totally unavailable later. Or the prices may drop as fast as they rose. I don't know. You roll the dice.

I wish I had bought gold at $300/ounce. I did not and the price went up to current market values. I have always maintained that the price of these Colt's with restricted roll marks would sky rocket but no one believed me and yet here is the proof. Type in ""colt restricted"" in the search block to see current market prices. I am not asking top dollar but current market value.

If you believe in the free market and want a quality AR collectible at a fair market price, buy this. It is a COLT with Colt heritage, and Colt quality. It is not some frankenAR slapped together in a machine shop or basement by some guy who has never before installed a trigger group. There is a reason they say ""never fired"" in those listings, they are afraid to. My price is firm and non-negotiable. Please do your homework prior to contacting me. Only compare apples to apples, not Colt SP1 prices without roll marks. You will see this is a good deal in today's market.

There’s a reason the Navy SEALS use Hypalon RIB’s as does the Coast Guard for rescue missions,,,,,they are TOUGH, they are nearly unsinkable and draft very little water. They can carry a ton of weight and go anywhere. This RIB is carried to the water in my Yukon, in it’s own bag. The floor is rigid just like a boat, so it’s very tough, easily beached without harm. I use this on local lakes and also down at the beach on the ICW and on nice days you can hit the open ocean !!! Fishing off the RIB is easy. ALso, you can go where no one else can, explore remote locations and beach at secluded beaches no one else can get to!
 This set up was  $5,520.00 new WITHOUT a trailer and used less than 15 times. This isn’t your brothers cheap rubber raft, this RIB is for real.
 Again, look at the Navy SEAL and Rescue boats, they use RIB’s !!!

I just bought a trailer to make transport even easier ! Then I customized it to also haul the Mercury 9.9 so as to avoid the hassle of putting it in the car trunk, the motor just mounts to the front of the trailer. 

Price is FIRM at $5,000.00, no less. I’m looking for a gun collection or $5,000.00 for my RIB.

If the RIB is so great, why am I selling it ???? Simple, I want a BIGGER RIB and I need to make room !!! So, it’s for sale/trade, as is my bigger hard boat also."

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in standard military Gray."

THE KIND USED BY THE USMC.

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in standard military Gray."

COMES OFF THE MARKET THIS WEEK AND WILL RETURN WHEN THE BAN TAKES EFFECT. (You know its coming, don't lie to yourself)

Straight talk, real talk. Prices are still going up. This will not last at this price. If you are sitting on the fence I suggest you decide before the next round of increases. The $2000 guns from last week are bringing $3000. They are expensive but available now; better than totally unavailable later. Or the prices may drop as fast as they rose. I don't know. You roll the dice.

I wish I had bought gold at $300/ounce. I did not and the price went up to current market values. I have always maintained that the price of these Colt's with restricted roll marks would sky rocket but no one believed me and yet here is the proof. Type in ""colt restricted"" in the search block to see current market prices. I am not asking top dollar but current market value.

If you believe in the free market and want a quality AR collectible at a fair market price, buy this. It is a COLT with Colt heritage, and Colt quality. It is not some frankenAR slapped together in a machine shop or basement by some guy who has never before installed a trigger group. There is a reason they say ""never fired"" in those listings, they are afraid to. My price is firm and non-negotiable. Please do your homework prior to contacting me. Only compare apples to apples, not Colt SP1 prices without roll marks. You will see this is a good deal in today's market.

I deal in cash, FTF, and require a Concealed Carry Permit or Pistol Permit, NC ID and a signed Bill of Sale.

This was not and is not a safe queen. This is a working man's gun. As such it has scratches and signs of use (but not abuse). While it is collectible because it has LEO restricted roll marks, it would be on the lower end on the collectible scale because it has been used. If you need a New In Box model, this is not for you. If you you want a great reliable firearm that has a proven history and track record, one you can rely on to accurately shoot rounds down range, this gun is for you.


The AR-15A3 model AR6721 is an exceptional patrol rifle with tactical accuracy chosen by federal, state and local agencies. The 16.1"" (40.9 cm) heavy barrel with 1 in 9"" (229 mm) rifling twist allows flexibility in ammunition selection. The telescopic butt stock adjusts to four positions to enhance mobility and fit to a wider range of operators. In position, the removable carrying handle provides an M16A4 target style sight adjustable for windage and elevation to 600 meters. Easily removable, the flat top upper receiver allows for easy mounting of optical, night vision and other tactical sighting systems. The tactical carbine is the answer to all the requirements of modern law enforcement."

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in standard military Gray."

$1000 FIRM - no offers, no trades

WASR 10/63 7.62 caliber

VERY low round count, honestly can say under 200 rounds through this .. 

This was hand picked out of all available at the time, several years ago. This rifle was picked for the better fit and finish on the factory reassembly, the site is not canted, the magazine fit is tight (many of these were converted from single stack and have mag drop out issues, loose mag issues, etc be CAREFULL when buying the last thing you need is a mag to drop out in an emergency), and it has the VERY desireable Tapco trigger group which fires much smoother than the typical group used in these... 

Fit and finish is nice for an AK.. no pitting, fitment, or metal corrosion issues.. like most AKs of this type the wood furniture has some wear but works great.. comes with 1 mag which is metal and has some slight pitting that does not affect performance at all..

no box .. comes with 100 rounds of ammo as seen in pic

these are sold out EVERYWHERE and if you can find them they are priced much higher than this .. the AK47 is an amazing weapon and is unbelievably reliable, cheap to shoot, and a true classic and must have for the gun enthusiast.. Mr. Mikhail Kalashnikov designed a timeless beauty...

$1000 FIRRRRM ... 

dont like the price? Go on guns america etc and see them for $1200-1800 right now for the same model ... 

DO NOT email or call with offers or crazy trades .. i dont need the money but it wouldnt hurt and I have my eye on a few other things .. if it doesnt sell now i will gladly hold until a couple of months from now when the ban goes through and sell for $1500++ without issues

CCW holder and have sold several times on armslist without issue.. an honest guy that gives good descriptions and fair prices etc .. rare these days ...

Call/Text/Email .. anything way that works for you .. im in north west Milwaukee near HWY 45 and Hampton avenue near Butler, WI ... can travel some to meet up for a serious buyer but not going to waste my time or yours

Sporting a Spikes Tactical collapsible butt stock, with a Spikes Tactical ST-T2 buffer, and a single point sling on a multi-mission sling mount. I will outfit this rifle one of two ways. Either it will come with the Surefire M500 forend light for $1350, or with the Magpul MOE/MVG forend combo for $1200, whichever you prefer. The full buttstock is not included, it is shown simply as another option, just in case you would rather have the full stock installed on the rifle instead of the collapsible stock. Most people would not, but it's an option if you want it.

This will come with the hard case, one USGI 30 round magazine, and all original paperwork. If you choose the Surefire option, it too comes with it's original box, paperwork, optional bulb assembly, and extra parts.

I have had this rifle for approximately 13 years. I have fired probably a little over 500 rounds through it, everything from quality rounds, to surplus ammo, to the stuff you buy in Walmart. I have never, not one time, had a malfunction of any kind with this rifle. It is in excellent condition, it runs well, and it feels good in the hands. 

That said, I do not need to sell this rifle, so my prices are FIRM. I will trade this for a quality, well fitted AK-47 if anyone is interested. Just send me the info on what you've got. If trading for an AK, I will match one for one on any mags and ammo that you want to trade with it.

The value of this rifle is based on several things: 1) It's a ""pre-ban"" model imported into the US in the 80's by (then) Mitchell Arms out of Santa Ana, Calif, and; 2) It's exceptionally well manufactured to tighter tolerances.  Rifle was maintained by a collector who passed away and was sold to me by his family.  

RIFLE INFORMATION: 

1.  I fired approximately 250 rounds through this rifle to ensure all was OK.  The rifle shoots exceptionally tight - more like a custom-made rifle.  I achieved results of 1 - 1.5 MOA at 100 yards using a Lupold scope.  According to the original owners,  they guestimated that they expended approximately several hundred rounds through this rifle.  Although it has a stamped receiver, the quality level of this rifle is such that it's more in tune with a Milled Receiver - it's that gorgeous of an AK.  All metalwork was superbly crafted and the styling (and quality) of the stock is a cut above other AK's.  Everything about this RPK model speaks volumes about quality craftsmanship.  

2.  As mentioned, the rifle was meticulously maintained.  Because of the rarity of this rifle, it was impossible to find a standard ""slip on"" AK style of scope rail mount.  So, after a two month nationwide search, I purchased a Russian made (Belarus) quick release mount and had it machine modified by a gunsmith to fit this rare AK (no modifications whatsoever were made to this rifle).  Prior to modifying this Belarus mount, I found (after a nation-wide search) two different original RPK style mounts but because of their extreme rarity (and even though they were in beat-up condition), the sellers still wanted over $600 for each.  Thus, I ordered a Belarus model and had it machine adjusted to fit over the RPK-47 side mount (that's how rare this model is).  

3.  The rifle came with a traditional ""slant"" style of muzzle compensator.  I had removed that (which will be included in the sale) and I put on a Krinkov style of Compensator (both compensators will be provided at time of sale).

4.  What else is included with this purchase (in addition to the custom machine modified scope rail mentioned above):

a.  I am including the adjustable clamp-on bi-pod that you see in the photos below, 
b.  A new 3-12x44 BSA cats-eye scope which works superbly (scope is new).  
c.  A removable , adjustable cheek riser that you see in the photos.  
d.  Three (3) - 30 round metal magazines are included.
e.  A beautiful (like new) camouflaged carrying case that has pockets for 5 magazines.

WHY AM I SELLING THIS RIFLE:  I'm a retired Marine - in my 60's now and I'm not doing much shooting.  My wife has given me an ultimate of sorting out my collection.  I don't want to sell this RPK-47 because of it's awesome performance, appearance, and quality level - but I'm willing to do so because right now it's just sitting stored in a safe (in a carrying case).  

ASKING PRICE:  $1400 Cash only (no trades).  Note: I paid $1500 for the rifle 3 years ago.  Due to the rarity and quality of this rifle, it is valued at well over $2500 (as of a year ago).  I am willing to part with it for $1400 as long as the buyer will continue to take good care of this beauty.

First off, the electric guitar was made by Jarrett Guitars, 50 guitars were scheduled to be built in the limited, but only 40 ended up making the production run. Commemorative Series and this is guitar number #19 in the series, serial number CSX2002-34 . The Guitar comes with certificate of authenticity from JARRETT GUITARS, CONNECTICUT USA. A rare piece both for collectors and players, and an extremely unique piece for Shelby Cobra fans. 22 frets, humbuckers, 3 way selector switch. Volume and tone controls push/pull to split the coils in the humbuckers. Set neck with pearl inlays, and custom Shelby Cobra graphics. If you Google this guitar and read the Harmony Central reviews, you will discover just how amazing this guitar really is. This guitar has lived it's life in it's case which is included. The guitars sold in the 4k-8k range due to the limited number made and have never seen one that was autographed. It was played one time by a professional musician to get feedback on the quality, which as expected, was very impressive to him.

As for the autograph, being a '68 Shelby Cobra GT-500 owner I have attended several events at Boulder Colorado's ""Shelby American Collection"" museum. Mr. Shelby signed this at one of the annual Christmas benefits (December, 2007) and all monies collected from the benefits were donated to help operate the museum and to the Carroll Shelby Foundation (http://www.cscf.org/). As such it comes with a certificate of authenticity from them. I had Mr. Shelby inscribe it to me and my name can easily be removed with just rubbing alcohol because the inscribed signature was done with a Sharpie and since the guitars finish has several layers of clear coat built up on it, the Sharpie couldn't have penetrated through the finish. I am the original owner of the guitar and have owned it for 7 years. I have rarely come across these guitars and have never seen one that has been autographed. As you know Mr. Shelby has passed away and therefore I wouldn't anticipate a signed example making it to the market..

To get an idea of value's you can check out these current auctions for similar guitars, first ones aren't autographed, second one is but a different type. It's just to give an idea, I don't need any insulting low ball offers, I paid a lot of money just for the opportunity to own this rare guitar...
