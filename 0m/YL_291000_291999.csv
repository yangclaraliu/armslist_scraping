It's pretty much mechanically identical to a Remington 870. It's a very well made gun for the money.

The only change I made to it is I took off the stock bead sight and put on an inexpensive fiber optic front sight in green.

You can find a few minor scratches if you go over the stock and barrel. The gun only has about 50 rounds through it and it shoots great. Most Remington 870 accessories will fit if you want to make any upgrades. It just sits in my safe and I have no need for it. It's a really nice gun for the price I'm asking. I don't think you'll find a better made shotgun for $130

I would do a trade for a short barrel tactical shotgun. This gun plus some cash obviously.

It is in very good condition, clean and well maintained over all. Rifiling is sharp and the muzzle is nick free.

Has Houge grips from the factory and the original scope rings that were designed for this pistol.

The scope is a Simmons 2x20 Pro Hunter. I find it very easy to sight through on this pistol.

If you have long arms, you probably won't be able to lock out your elbows and maintain eye relief, but you shouldn't lock out your elbows on a .44 mag anyways.

164,http://www.armslist.com/posts/291164,For Sale:  Japanese Military Inert Knee Mortar Artifact,"Central, Orlando, Florida",$ 325,"Listed On: Monday, January 30, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This listing is for the pictured Japanese Military Inert Knee Mortar Artifact is offered for historical and militaria collection purposes only.  

A Japanese late World War II 50mm Mortar, Type 89 with a Type 88 instantaneous fuze. Good color with a yellow band on body. Mortar is Inert and can never be used as a weapon or for its original intended purpose, complies with BATF and EBay rules governing ordnance, strictly a relic and has only historical value. This Item contains no hazardous substances; it is inert and cannot be modified to be used as a weapon. Still has the original safety pin. Contains several Japanese characters

This item is completely inert body only.  All energetic material and priming material has been removed. All components are easily separated for inspection and viewing. This deactivated Japanese model 89 knee mortar round has a small Kokura arsenal symbol punched into the side. An excellent condition Japanese artifact. Not subject to federal law but please check your local and state laws.

A WW2 item and in excellent condition. No power or primers this is inert and safe for your military display. 2 inches wide 5.75 inches in overall height, the components unscrew for inspection. 

The Type 89 Grenade Discharger (???????, Hachikyu-shiki ju-tekidanto?), were inaccurately known as a knee mortar by Allied forces.  The Type 89 discharger first saw service in China and Manchuria.  During World War II, the weapon was used in Burma, China, and the Pacific islands. Allied troops soon learned to hit the ground when they heard the telltale 'pop' of the weapon launching its grenades or shells, in some cases from more than 200 yards (183 m) away. The Type 89 covered the gap between the range a hand grenade could be thrown and the range of a true mortar. Because of its small size (less than 60cm, or 24” long) and light weight (about 4.7 kg, or 10.5 lbs.), it was easily portable. In a standard Japanese infantry division, a regiment of 3,843 men had about 108 of these, or one per 36 men, according to the US Army Handbook on Japanese Military Forces,

One of the most feared weapons in the Japanese arsenal was the Type 89 Heavy Grenade Discharger (hachi-kyu-shiki ju-tekidanto, or more commonly just tekidanto). This weapon received the dangerously unfortunate English nickname of “knee mortar”; the curved base plate was meant to be braced against a solid foundation (the ground, a log, etc.), NOT one’s knee, as the recoil would result in broken bones or worse. 

 Weighing approximately two pounds, it was known as the Type 89 50mm shell, and was made in high explosive (HE), incendiary, and smoke variants. To fire the shell (which had a nose-mounted impact fuse that detonated on contact), it was dropped base-down inside the tube of the discharger. By setting the Type 89 discharger at a fixed angle of 45 degrees, and varying distance to target by adjusting the size of a variable chamber space inside the discharger mechanism, Japanese soldiers could adjust fire onto multiple targets at varying ranges while firing the contact-detonated 50 mm shell through a single small clearing in the jungle canopy. The method worked equally well when firing from deep trenches or pits, or between various building obstructions when fighting inside a built-up town or city

The basic round was black, with stripes in colors that identified exactly what type it was. This round is in excellent condition and the yellow designates its previous condition as a high explosive round. 

The brown band around the bottom is actually copper, which served a special purpose.  It had an ingenious design to solve the dilemma of how to get a round small enough in diameter to drop down the muzzle freely to also be large enough to engage the rifling. You can see that not only are there 8 exhaust ports in the base to allow gases to escape out and drive the round upwards, but also holes around the outside edge of the base. You can also see the reddish copper expansion band around the outside. When the primer was struck, it ignited the propellant. The gases from combustion pushed through the holes in the bottom to propel the round out of the weapon, but also outward through the holes around the rim to expand the copper band. The copper band then provided a seal and engaged the rifling to give the round an accuracy-enhancing spin like any rifled weapon.

The mortar has a one piece lower body with a reverse threaded nose cap fuze assembly marked “88 Model” (Type).  All Type 88 fuzes appear to be marked at the base.  There are symbols to the left of the numeral, which are the arsenal stamps. Here, the numeral 8 is followed by the Kanji symbols for “6 10 Showa” or 18.8 (August 1941)

Serial Number:
The Unique Serial Number 7304 is stamped in three places; the propellant cap, the base, and again on the main body.

Here is a YouTube link that shows the firing procedure of the Type 89 mortar tube assembly.

If you are looking for a cheap plinker, this is not for you. In fact, you can find a couple of these listed on internet for $700-800 w/box - but they ARE NOT in NEW condition like this ONE. The last new one I saw sell on Gunbroker sold at auction for just over $1100. This beauty has been residing peacefully in my safe for quite some time. 

$995 CASH OBO

I would consider other handguns and AR rifles on trade for this. I've started changing out my collection and have sold several of my Colts lately - most for less than I have invested. I'm starting to feel tinges of regret for selling these, since it took about 10 years to find this many really clean Colts, so not sure how much longer I'll be offering any.

The only thing that will need to be replaced is the pick-n-pluck foam. I have used this for 2 different configurations and the only thing left of the foam is the outside perimeter. I called Plano a few months ago and inquired about getting a new foam sheet and they told me it would be $15 plus shipping. You could also go to your local crafts store and buy a sheet of high-density foam and cut it yourself for a custom fit. Feel free to email me with questions or reasonable offers. Emails come straight to my phone so I usually answer pretty quickly. I can also send additional photos if requested. The AR15 in the picture is only there to show the size of the case.

 She's a third model Winchester 73 in 44.40 that has seen some serious use. This is not some engraved wall hanger that never got shot, this rifle spent a lifetime shooting dudes in the face and putting deer meat on the table. She is missing some pretty important parts and has some bad rust. The barrel is a sewer pipe, and that's putting it mildly. Structurally she is sound so if you spend a few bucks getting her back together she will still shoot. She needs a firing pin, lever springs, cam pins, and a few screws and the barrel will need to be relined.

 You remember that fat girl you took to the Prom who later turned out to be gorgeous? Yeah, this is her. She just needs somebody to love her.

 Will entertain reasonable offers and possibly trades, let me know what you got and we'll talk."

Excellent deals on Mosin Nagants and ammo.

Limited time only: Shark Coast is offering a Mosin 91/30 and Tin of Ammo(440rds)for 200.00. The Mosin–Nagant M91/30 is a bolt action, internal magazine fed, military rifle invented by Russian and Belgian engineers, and used by the armed forces of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and various other nations. The Russians modernized their model 1891 rifle into what would become one of the most successful military arms the world has ever known. The Mosin Nagant M91/30 has a simple and robust design, perfect accuracy and awesome reliability. It served the Soviets well as their main battle rifle of WWII. Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mosin–Nagants are still commonly found on modern battlefields around the world. They are being used by insurgent forces in the Iraq War and the current war in Afghanistan. Separatists have also used the rifles alongside more modern Russian firearms in the Second war in Chechnya. Under appreciated until recently, the Mosin Nagant is one of the hottest collectibles on the market today! Arsenal refinished - hardwood. 5 rd. integral mag. Barrel: 26”, Overall: 48”, Weight: 8.2 lbs. Condition: Good. As seen in on ShootingTimes.com, April 2011 Also included is a spam can of surplus 7.62X54R surplus ammo. 440rounds Perfect ZombieKiller

Purchased it on Dec. 28, 2011 so it is only a little over a month used. It is broken in and in perfect condition with 500 rounds shot thru it with absolutely no malfunctions whatsoever. I have taken very good care of this gun since owning it...cleaned and oiled after every use. I have even taken apart all 4 mags and cleaned them inside and out! The gun has no defects and is in like new condition. This is an excellent weapon and is extremely accurate! Even my wife loves it. The only reason why I am selling it is to buy the exact same gun but in the compact size and possibly in a larger caliber. I love the XDM's! They are very well made and of great quality. 

The gun comes with the whole XDM package which include case, papers, gun holster, double mag holster, mag loader, backstraps, bore brush, gun lock, and 4 (19rd) mags! I bought 2 extra mags ($60 value) when I purchased the gun which is why it comes with 4 instead of just 2. I have upgraded the gun by installing a solid stainless steel Guide Rod ($20 value) and a silver aluminum striker spring guide ($10 value). I also have the stock components which will come in the case. The gun has the rubber X-treme grips ($16 value) installed and also comes with an uninstalled X-treme sandpaper grips ($16 value). I will also include the proper size pin-punch ($5 value) that is needed to punch out the pin in order to change out the backstraps. As you can see this includes a lot of extras that have about a $127 value to them which does not include the taxes and shipping that you would normally pay by purchasing these items. This is a great deal and you will get a lot of value for your money. You will save money on transfer fees and backround checks as well (in state only)....all I will require is for the buyer to fill out and sign a bill of sale (will need your current driver's license). I may entertain an out of state sale but prefer Arizona sale. Payment in CASH form only!

I am firm on the price! Please do not attempt to waste my time by lowballing me. I am not in desperate need to sell any of my weapons. I paid $698 on the gun plus over $127 on all the extras mentioned above so I feel $650 is very reasonable considering the like new condition of the gun + everything included and the fact that you may bypass all the extra fee's that you could incure like when buying from a dealer. There is no real advantage of buying a brand new gun over this one, the only thing different that you will get is knowing it is brand new but without all these great extras. Save yourself all the fees and break in period and buy this one! Please email me if you are interested or have any questions. Serious buyers only. Will consider a trade for anyone with an xdm 45 compact in similar condition. Thank you!"

Applied to county sheriff almost a year ago, been testing and passing, and I am getting close to finishing. I need to shift my focus towards glocks at this point. I bought this gun in October of 2011 for 599. Why? Cause I am an avid whitetail deer hunter and dropping my two deer a year opening morning with my browning 12 gauge was getting boring. I had this gun on my hip and my 12g on my lap. Still turned out that I had a gorgeous buck come hi balling by and when my heart started racing instict blasted with my shoty. I finished him off with this gp but that's the only action it's seen. I shot a box of .357 and .38 special at the range the week I bought it and was ready for the woods. Awesome gun- just don't have the money to keep it and buy a couple glocks. I want to get good and familiarized with the glocks before I have to qualify with one. If your LE I know I will have to buy a new glock again when they tell me to.

XTRs also feature side turret-mounted parallax adjustment systems. LRS models have a fully integrated side turret-mounted illumination system.

Never fired any 45 LCs through this due to cost of ammo. Was purchased for home defense, but my wife is recoil sensitive. While this pistol actually kicks pretty softly with the 410s to my hand, she has wrist issues and is sticking with her bersas. It would excel in this role though, especially in home/apartment defense where over penetration is a concern. The 410 shotshells will stop an intruder/attacker, but are not going to exit and go through walls."
