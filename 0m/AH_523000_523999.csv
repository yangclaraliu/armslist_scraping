It does show holster wear, and has about 1000 rounds through it, which is low for this gun.  I bought a few extra magazines, so this comes with 4 HK polymer mags.  The Fobus holster is an OWB paddle style, and is very nice.  The gun also comes with a lanyard if that's your thing.  I also purchased a new Wolf guide rod spring that I haven't installed yet.  It cost me $14 after shipping, but it will be worth it.  

The HK does have professional engraving on the gun from the previous owner.  It reads: ""Sword Cutlass"" on the slide, and then the ""Jolly Roger"" pirate symbol is on the grips.  It's a very nice job, and it was based on a character's gun that appears in an animated series.  

Considering the extras, I believe $620 is a fair deal, so I'm holding firm for now.  I don't want to sell this, but I have 2 40's and need something else.  More pics are available upon request.  

I will only sell to buyers of legal age, citizenship, etc.  No felons, and please have a CO DL and a CCW if you have one."

What you hear about the workmanship of these rifles is no lie. Read up about them.
There is a stripper clip for it, and I purchased the correct leather sling. 
The pictures are not the greatest, but the rifle is in great shape and of course the bore is mirror bright.
It's a good deal on a nice rifle that would be a great deer rifle, or a target shooter, as it's VERY accurate.
Also included are these spare parts that I bought last year that are still in the packaging....

Press, Reloading Scale, Uniflow Powder Measure, Hand Priming Tool, Case Loading Block, Debur Tool, Hex Key Set, Case Lube Kit, Powder Funnel and Reloading Manual

I have never used any of it. All is new except two of the die sets. Now they are not mint because they have been sitting in storage collecting dust, but they are not used.

Second is from Pakistan for the MG3 which is a German MG used by many other countries and the MG3 is just the updated MG42 from WWII but fires the 7.62 ammo instead of 8mm. These also may possibly fit other MG's of German design but I am not sure.

By the way:  this is not a USA HD with the dimples in the barrel for a silencer.  Sir Lancelot was searching for the Holy Grail and never found it.  The dimples in a USA HD are for weights, not a silencer.  A few of these guns were used for covert activities, but none is documented.  Please, this gun that I have advertised is a very nice HD-MILITARY with the long barrel.  I would rather pass it on to a collector who will appreciate it or I will do like I did with my first one.  Read the papers, threw them and the box away and dropped it into a Hunter holster on an Army web belt and went swimming in the river with it.  Lubed it with 30 w motor oil, and shot a box of bullets a day.  I know what I have if you don't, don't waste my time.   Can you show me how to field strip this gun?  I read the papers so I know."

The Benelli M3 (Super 90) is a dual-mode (both pump-action and semi-automatic) shotgun designed and manufactured by Italian firearms manufacturer Benelli. The M3 holds a maximum of six rounds and uses the proprietary Benelli semi-automatic system first showcased in the M1. The M3 is notable for allowing the user the choice of semi-automatic or pump-action operation. It is reliable and versatile, and popular with both police forces and civilian sportsmen.

For sale is a LNIB Kel-Tec PMR30 with very low round count. 
I probably only shot 200 rounds through this gun. 
This gun is a lot of fun to shoot, but I need to sell to consolidate. 
These guns are very difficult to get, so here is your chance to own one at a very reasonable price. 
For sale are the gun, all of the paperwork, 2 -30 round magazines, lock and hard sided case. Approximately one half box of 22 magnum shells. 
The price is $525. That is the amount that I have in the gun, with purchase price, shipping from out of state and a transfer fee. 
The condition is Like New. Please see picture below. 
I checked Armslist prices and they range from a low of $530 to a high of $700. An individual has a used PMR30 listed in OKC for $645.
Act Quick, because this gun won’t last long at this price.

Three cans of AP ammunition headstamped LC53 indicating production at Lake City Arsenal in 1953 are also available.  These 200 round cans are $225.00 each and all ammunition is boxer primed and non-corrosive.  Available face to face in Minnesota or cans can be shipped by Fedex ground to buyer's location at actual shipping costs.  No sales to NYC, Chicago, Washington DC, MA, some areas of MD, and HI.  No sales to AK due to high shipping costs.
I also have one remaining 200 round can of LC44 which was manufactured at Lake City Arsenal in 1944.  This ammunition has corrosive primers so rifle needs to be cleaned soon after firing this ammunition.  I also have a few cans of EW43 which was manufactured at the EauClaire munitions plant in 1943, a few cans of FA51 which were manufactured at Frankford Arsenal in 1951, and two cans of SL43 which were manufactured at St. Louis munitions plant in 1943.  These cans also have corrosive primes.  All of this AP is $180.00 per 200 round can.
Shipping and insurance for one can generally runs about $24.00 per can by Fedex ground and up to four cans may be shipped in one box at a cost ranging from $40-$50 depending upon zip code of the destination.

Hey all! I've received a ton of replies. I'm having trouble keeping track of them all, so I'll probably screw this up in some respect. But the bottom line is that as a result of the number of replies, I will not accept anything less than the stated price(sorry!). If you want immediate action on my part (sorry, it's very hard to manage what is now more than a dozen responses, and I'm trying to keep track of every one), offer a bit more, and I'll respond to your email immediately and deny other offers until the sale is final or has fallen through for some reason.

The Ruger SR556 has a heavy profile chrome lined barrel.  I have used this rifle in joint operations with Border Patrol and BLM rangers in Arizona, it has about 1500 rounds through it. There isn't anything wrong with this rifle I just want some other firearms more than this listed in the trade area. I will sell the upper alone for $700 without the optic or the optic alone for $300 and both for $950. This has a Krylon paint job that has held up pretty well and provides good camouflage. It could be removed if desired.

This is Sigs answer to the Glock, with all the safety issues addressed, and the reviews of it online are excellent. This one is the newer style with the square trigger guard, and has a standard built in 1913 Picatinny accessory rail incorporated into the frame, interchangable backstraps on the grip, and factory installed SIGLITE night sights. MSRP $583. I am also including (2) high capacity 15 round factory Sig mags with the bottom grip extension that fits your hand very nicely (cost about $50 each mag). I am listing trades I am interested in but I will consider just about anything.

The standard SIG Pro does not have a manual safety but it does incorporate a decocking lever (lowers the hammer without striking the firing pin), trigger-bar disconnect (disconnects the trigger when the slide is out of battery), automatic firing pin lock (does not free the firing pin until the trigger is depressed) and a hammer safety intercept notch (prevents the hammer from striking the rear of the firing pin until the trigger is depressed).

The SIG SAUER® SP2022 Pro is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals.

Yes, this is a legal AK Pistol, it was not converted from a rifle, it was imported exactly like this.  These are extremely difficult to find and are imported in VERY small numbers.  The waiting list for these can be 6 months or more.  This one has been fired only once (100 rounds through it).  It came with just (1) 30-round magazine.  I am adding an additional (2) 30-round magazines, 100 rounds of ammunition, and tactical carrying case.  It aslo comes with the original owners manual and cleaning rod (many don't come with the cleaning rod).  Barrel length is approx 12"" with an overall length of just over 21"".  Since this is a pistol, it is exempt from 922r compliance rules so there are no american made parts inside this gun.  This is exactly how it came off the assembly line (except I changed out the pistol grip from the ugly brown one to the black one shown).  Please don't write me and tell me you can get it less somewhere else.  If you can get a hold of one, great, buy it.  These are going for $625 and up on Gunbroker right now for just the gun and 1 magazine.  Mine has 2 extra mags, ammo and tactical case.  Here is your chance to get one like new right now, no wait for only $650 for everything.  I am not interested in trades, only local face to face cash sale in the Dublin area."

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in brushed stainless finish. Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.
