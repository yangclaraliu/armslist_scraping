$1200.00 OBO

Weatherby mk. V in excellent condition (based on the NRA condition standards).  The gun is incredibly solid and shoots amazingly. It still has a very positive edge on the extractor and ejects very forcefully. It has a ported barrel to assist with recoil control. Less than 50 rounds have been put through it and the bore is nice and bright with sharp lands and grooves. The trigger pull is crisp, like breaking glass, and it’s got that nice, heavy Weatherby bolt. It comes with an approximately $600 Nikon brand scope. I do not recall the magnification on the scope and I wasn't able to get a good picture of the bore due to only having a cellular phone camera, but it's in excellent shape. I'm asking $1,200.00 for it or your best offer. It was over $2,000.00 when it was purchased (including the scope).

I'm also selling the scope and rifle separately, I'm asking $950.00 for the rifle and $350.00 for the scope.

This would make a fantastic hunting or target rifle as it is very accurate and very well made. The only reason I'm parting with it is because I'm in need of money and I know it's worth more than what I'm asking.

Please feel free to ask any questions if you interested in buying, but make sure to read my post before you do. If you decide you'd like to purchase it, please contact me by email and we can work out an appropriate time and place to meet."

Simple questions first
Yes its a real former military kevlar vest made by point blank and with kevlar inserts still inside being sold with and as is. This is rated for a 9mm but it has the cutouts for the ceramic (ceramic does not come with it but it would be  more if it did )

Size 
Its a 37-42 however I am 6'3 and wear a 44 long and I have to snug it up pretty well to get it to fit call it a large to extra large

It has been painted by my buddy who served with it incountry and simply kept it when he upgraded, all the mole straps are intact but the vest has been to otherside of the world and back on a soliders back so its not real pretty. It never took a round or shrap blast as most of the knicks are simple wear and tear

What I want for it
Open to trades within reason, I love silver coins or bullion bars guns I do shoot tactical 22 off an AR platform so there is alot I would take but it needs to be around the 200  value, cash ill take less but I know what these"

Has a full 360 degree stipple treatment done on grip surface, fine/ medium texture, has support hand index stippling as well as an under cut trigger guard with one of the finger grooves removed and the other slightly re-shaped, and the back strap has been lightly re-shaped to remove some of the infamous ""Glock hump"" so many people do not like.  Everyone that has handled this pistol says it is by far the most comfortable shooting Glock they have had experience with. The stippling offers a much more positive grip than the standard factory surface, regardless of your hands being sweaty, wet etc.
   Pistol also has a full trigger job with a Ghost 4.5lb connector, all key pieces of firing mechanism are fully polished, along with the feed ramp.
   Comes with 2 Glock 17rd magazines, factory case, lock and all paperwork as well. I can also include approx 250rds of 115gr FMJ for a good price as well or if the trade is worth it. 
   Approx 400 rounds down the pipe, not a single malfunction ever. Pistol was bought new in July by me and is in fantastic condition.This is a great shooting pistol.
   As much as I like this Glock and as well as it functions, I miss my 1911, and want another, and the only way that's going to happen right now is to let this one go. All my pics of it are high resolution and to large to upload here, but I can email more."

Browning  A-Bolt II Composite Stalker Boss, 223 WSSM, 22” Barrel.  This rifle has the Boss system with the CR cap as shown in the pictures.  Also included are the Leupold 2-Piece bases mounted on the rifle.  I bought this rifle used to try the WSSM line and this rifle was my go to coyote rig.  It puts a lot of punch behind the 55 grain ballistic silvertips.  I have put 30 rounds through the rifle sighting in and dialing in the Boss.  I have 3 ½ boxes of Winchester Ammunition and 1 ½ boxes of Winchester Brass as pictured that will be included in sale.  The rifle is in good condition has a few light scratches in the stock from hunting.  When I bought the rifle it had a Sims recoil pad on it which I didn’t like so I bought a factory pad for it which is on the gun now.  It needs sanded down to match the stock contour but looks fine in my opinion.  I will include the Sims recoil pad if I can find it.  $600 shipped to your FFL.

 Some things I would be interested in trading straight across for would be: Any model of Springfield M1A, an AR-10 308, or a Benelli Super Vinci/ Eagle for waterfowl.   
  I would also be willing to do partial trade partial cash on the AR as I am also in the market for a Springfield XDM in .40 s&w or .45 acp.
  I am open to what you have for trade, and as I stated would be willing to do a straight trade for the right gun, a half trade half cash deal, or if you have a couple guns you would like to trade out I am open to offers just as long AS THEY EQUAL VALUE TO WHAT I HAVE, just shoot me offers the worst I can say is no.
Thank you for looking.

The navigation lights are operated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. Available in Black and Desert Sand.

Don't want to, but I have to. If you know these guns, then I shouldn't have to say anything.  If you don't know these jewels, then I could say it's a helluva tack driver that takes everything you feed through it flawlessly.  But then I could say that it's a super accurate .22's pistol... or... I could say it's a great trainer to put cheap ammo down range with... OR, I could say it's a gun to get your James Bond on with (threaded suppressor, laser red dot scope mounted on the rails, and etcetera.).  

I could say all of that (and probably more) and be right on all counts.  But the worst thing I can say about this gun is that selling it is MY LOSS and your gain.  There's a reason that these guns are CONSISTENTLY out of stock online and everywhere else, especially the Hunter models.

Keep in mind that this Ruger MKIII is the HUNTER model, a different beast from the 22/45.  I've had two of the 22/45's before and thought they were great.  The HUNTERS, in my opinion however, are way better. New, the Hunter models start at 480 bucks but more typically cost in the 560 range. That is, if you can find them as they're usually sold out/unavailable.

Luckily (for you), however, I have just barely begun to break this gun in.  This one has been my cream-puff and I doubt there's more than just the requisite 1K break-in rounds through it (if that many).  It had some trigger work done right after I bought it and I love the way it fires.

I have everything the gun came with originally.  I paid 580 for this baby at the gun show when I bought it.  The gun in the photos is the actual gun I am selling.  It has adjustable rear sights, fiber optic replacement sights in both red and day-glo green, and the weaver style Ruger scope rails with original screws.  I have the original case, manual, and the two proprietary Ruger keys to lock the handgun when not in use.  Manual included as well.  It's got it all.

Here's your chance... a Ruger MKIII Hunter in stainless... going.... going... 

Wouldn't sell it if I didn't need the cash.  Best .22 pistol I ever owned. 

Call Douglas at REDACTED if interested.  Phone works better for me than emails, but will respond to all.

***********************************************************

A Tradition of Excellence, like No Other. Ruger Mark III Hunter pistols represent the evolution of Ruger .22 LR pistols, continuing the legacy created by the Ruger Standard, Mark I and Mark II pistols and yet incorporating many new engineering refinements. They are simple, rugged, and affordable, making them a great value for any sporting purpose - whether target shooting, plinking or small game hunting.

The Ruger Mark III Hunter includes rigid barrel/receiver connection; automatic bolt-hold-open latch; comfortable, rugged steel grip frame; contoured ejection port; easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears; and rigidly mounted sights for consistent accuracy. Simply stated, Mark III Pistols offer the most versatility and value of any rimfire pistol on the market today.

FEATURES:
- Patented loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded.
- Accurate sighting system features light-gathering HiViz fiber optic front sight (with six interchangeable LitePipes) , precision-adjustable rear sights and drilled and tapped receiver for Weaver-style scope base adapters (included FREE) for easy mounting of optics.
- Smoothly contoured, comfortable grip features natural pointing grip angle with checkered grip panels providing a non-slip hold. The manual safety and magazine release are conveniently located on the left side of the frame.
- Manual safety positively locks the sear when applied. Also features an unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in the “SAFE” position and allows you to safely secure the firearm when not in use.
- Magazine disconnect prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed.
- Internal cylindrical bolt construction: ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving-slide designs.
- Includes two magazines and hard plastic case.

Please see this excellent review of the 22 mini-mag before you write this off as expensive toy:http://naaminis.blogspot.com/p/mini-magnum.html

The NAA .22 magnum can send the right load out the barrel at over 1,100 feet per second - plenty of speed to ruin the day for a would-be mugger. Besides, this little jewel is so nice, you'll want to carry just because you can: anywhere and all the time. Does your wife struggle pulling back the heavy slide on a mini pocket auto? This gun is as simple as any single action revolver, beautiful in workmanship, and reliable. What's to want more? Just cock the hammer and she's ready to rumble! Your wife will love it - and chances are you will too!

""The new Bersa BP9cc pistol fills an important niche many manufacturers of polymer pistols have currently overlooked or passed by. Although a certain peace of mind comes with having upwards of 15 rounds of ammunition on board and ready to launch, double-stack medium frame pistols are not always a good fit in a shooter's hand. Pocket 9s are easily concealed, but at the price of trimming away the features needed for comfortable practice sessions.

The design of BP9cc provides a pistol that successfully splits the difference. It has the handling and tactical features of a medium-frame pistol, while providing the slim grip of a pocket pistol. When you add to this the exceptional trigger, a lifetime service contract and the reasonable price, the BP9cc becomes a defensive option well worth checking out.""

This is kind of a hard to find gun right now.  A lot of collectors are grabbing them up because the gun was made at the original thompson factory in west hurley, NY.  All of the new tommy guns being made are being made by KAHR arms.  It has a parker finish on it.  And I believe it is the commando model which is the same as the deluxe model but the stock is painted black.  And the finish is parker not blued.

It looks like new and has always been very accurate, selling because I need to thin out the herd! It comes with the Springfield Armory case w/gun holster, dual mag holster, 3 mags, different size backstraps, factory tools, and multi colored front sights (quite a few to choose from). It's a 40 cal and it holds 16+1 I thinking it's the highest capacity handgun for a S&W 40. Shoots smooth and i've always kept it clean. I bought it last year for $749.99, price tag is still on the case from Vances so I think $550obo is fair.

Old world war 2 rifle. I believe its caliber is 30-06 and it was manufactuered around 1942. 

IT NEEDS WORK IT DOES NOT FUNCTION. It looks like a piece of the metal is broken but Im not sure. I have included a picture of it. 

There is a screw in that is too high so the bolt cannot be pulled all the way back. 

I know it is not in great condition but it is still a very sought after gun. Would like to sell it or trade. Please email me an offer and we will go from there.

Item Description
This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition(2-3/4""shells). The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.

Belonged to my Grandfather. He bought it thinking he was going to go to Alaska to hunt with his friend that next year, unfortunately his friend passed and he never went hunting again. Granddad only fired it one time to see how hard it kicked, never got a scope for it, cleaned it and put it away. It has not seen the light of day other than an occasional cleaning until now. I no longer hunt and have no need for it. It has some sentimental value but I have other things from him. Just want it to go to good home. It's very clean. Has a few tiny dings and scratches if you look real hard under good lighting. Its the type of stuff that anyone with a little knowledge of wood work could make disappear in a few minutes by rubbing out or? I didn't even notice until I really looked hard in the sunlight. My guess is the occasional hanger falling grazed it while in the closet. Thanks 406-two1zero3niner7seven"

NFA regulations require an extended flash hider be installed (pinned and welded) to bring overall barrel length to over 16"". So please be aware of this. The second option is to use as a pistol upper, just don't put any kind of foregrip on it. Third option is to register a Short Barreled rifle with the ATF.

The IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates (SAPI NIJ standard III), however, the new E-SAPI plates will increase protection to armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation"

The IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates (SAPI NIJ standard III), however, the new E-SAPI plates will increase protection to armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation"
