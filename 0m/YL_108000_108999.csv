This is essentially a Mak 90 AK-47 only it's been fitted with a sporting stock and longer target style barrel so that it may be used in longer range hunts.

Gun is in excellent shape. The infamous ""safety scratch"" is barely evident indicating it's seen very little use.

Wood has an idiot mark or two but is very clean. Barrel is shiny and rifling is crisp.

Ultra Carry II pistols weigh just 25 ounces, 13 ounces less than a full-size 1911. Combining light weight with a 3-inch barrel and short grip makes them easy to carry and conceal. Attention to every detail is another reason Kimber quality is unsurpassed. Machined bevels at both the front and rear of the Ultra Carry ejection port ensure ejecting brass reliably clears, avoiding jams common to other brands. All Kimber pistols feature a match grade barrel, chamber and trigger. Ultra Carry bull barrels are fitted directly to the slide, keeping maximum weight forward to reduce recoil and speed sight recovery time between shots.

I would prefer to keep everything together and just sell as a lot to make it easy for me, but I could break it up if the deal is sweet enough. There may be a few other misc bits lurking around here somewhere, as you can tell it is a lot of stuff. Make me a REASONABLE cash offer, or cash + firearms Buy the whole lot for a reasonable price and I'll throw in a nice pair of Wagner brake calipers that are very accurate. Please make it obvious in your subject that you are a person. Also, please don't lowball me, I'm not desperate to sell my gear and you will most likely get a rude email back if you insult me by offering less then 1/4 of what this stuff is worth."

This is an original Microtech that was hand made in Vero Beach, Florida before the company was sold to the Microtech company you know today. It was a Christmas gift from my mother who took my brother and I to the small factory and got to watch the owner build it in front of us, so instead of carrying it daily I never left home with it because I didn't want to loose it. I loved watching the faces of my friends because they could not figure out how I magically opened the blade without moving my hand.  

It has a lifetime warranty that is transferable to the new owner. I actually just took advantage of the warranty and sent it to them so they could sharpen the blade and make sure it's in perfect condition to be sold. This particular knife is a collectors item because it was one of the last ones made by hand. If you are a knife collector you won't want to pass this opportunity up because you will probably never see a Microtech that was handmade by the original owner again.

SP-101 3 IN BARREL STAINLESS SHAT MAYBE 20 TIMES. HAS MORE KNOCKDOWN THAN A 357 AND MORE PUNCH. ALSO HAVE 4 BOXES OF AMMO THAT GOES WITH IT.. READ BELOW ON THIS ROCKET       The new .327 Federal Magnum offers muzzle energy twice that of .38 Special +P loads, and velocities comparable to a 125-grain .357 Magnum, with 20 percent less recoil in its hottest version. Designed specifically for use in lightweight small-frame revolvers, the .327 Federal Magnum allows a six-round cylinder compared to five-round capacity for similar-sized .38 Special and .357 Magnum guns, with the added benefit of chambering .32 S&W, .32 Special, and .32 H&R Magnum loads as well. Based on a higher-pressure loading in a 1/8-inch longer .32 H&R case, the .327 Federal Magnum will initially be available in three versions: a Federal Premium 85-grain Hydra-Shok Low Recoil Personal Defense loading, an American Eagle 100-grain Jacketed Soft Point, and a Speer 115-grain Gold Dot.



From a 3 1/16-inch revolver, the 100-grain Soft Point .327 Magnum load develops 100 fps more velocity than a 125-grain .357 Magnum from a four-inch revolver, and delivers only 35 ft/lbs less energy. The recoil of the .327 Magnum 85-grain Personal Defense load is less than half the recoil of a 125-grain .357 Magnum. 



Subjected to the standard FBI protocol tests for effectiveness through barriers, the 115-grain .327 Magnum load reaches 15 inches in bare gelatin, 16 inches through heavy clothing, 16 inches through plywood, 14.5 inches through wallboard, 13 inches through auto glass, and 20 inches through single-layer vehicle body steel--all with substantial bullet upset ranging from .40 caliber (steel) to .60 caliber (auto glass)."

There is 1 little scratch on the receiver, but that is it.  Here is what was said on the internet.  ""The Remington Nylon 66 is the roughest, toughest, most trouble-free 22 automatic made. Nylon makes the action virtually jamproof (Key parts glide on 'greaseless bearings' of long-wearing nylon.) There's actually no need for lubrication.  One of the best 22's ever made.""

Gun was set up with wild hog hunting in mind hence the lit reticle scope.  Cant see black cross hairs on a black pig.  

This rifle has had 1 box of shells through it.  These were used to sight it in, and eventually take two different pigs.  I have about two bullets left out of the original box.  I would have more bullets in the box but a prospective buyer asked me to verify whether or not it jammed.  I shot two clips through it this past weekend without any hiccup.  Nice barely used gun.

Comes with stock sling mounts, extra clip and the scope pictured.

I found several blogs discussing the wonderfull merits of this gun.  Its true they dont make them like this any more.

Made in Belgium when quality and reputation stood for something.

The Challenger .22 Caliber Pistol was introduced in 1962 and ceased production in 1985. 

This is a fine shooting and functioning well made gun.  An absolute dream to shoot.  Big front blade sight makes it easy to hit 50yrd plus targets.

Condition of the gun is like new condition.  This is the one you will pass down to your childrenâs children.

Comes with the one clip pictured.

The generator is a Kurz and Root Brand 4 wire three phase and the motor is a strait six cylinder Waukesha made for Massey Ferguson. The unit does not run as of now and I make no guarantees that it will. The oil was clean colored the last time I checked it and the motor was set up for Nat. Gas so I would imagine the engines internals are clean, however I make no guarantees of the units functionality. The price of scrap is high right now and Im sure the copper windings in the gen head are worth quite a bit. The unit is very heavy, when I loaded it with a skid steer to bring it home it was all it would do to pick it up. I have limited resources (no tractor, etc.)  to load the unit where it is now so you should plan accordingly and bring your own way to load, I will assist as much as possible and have a winch to pull it on a trailer but you need to bring a way to roll it on the deck. If seriously interested I can provide model numbers, pics, and specs on the unit. Im only interested in trading for the firearms and items listed below or 500 cash, please don't contact with other offers for trade. I would be glad to answer any questions and share what knowledge I have on the unit. This unit might be a good project for the mechanically inclined or the inclined scrapper, I just have no use for such a unit or the time to mess with it."

Is a like new Ruger M77 Mark II heavy varmint rifle, This sale or trade is for just the rifle alone, None of the extra accessories are included, But I may be willing to sell some things seperately, Or include some if the right deal comes along...

The rifle is a Ruger M-77 Mark II heavy varmint bolt action in 22-250 Rem. calibur, It has a 22"" heavy tappered match grade Varmint barrel, A milled hammer forged receiver, That is factory milled for Ruger style scope rings, It also has a factory hand lapped & polished bolt assembly, A fully checkered walnut stock, Factory installed sling swivel studs, And a factory installed one inch rubber recoil reducing buttplate, It also has a hinged lower floorplate to quickly unload the internal box magazine, This is the top of the line varmint hunting rifle that Ruger made, And cost over $800 dollars new a couple years ago...

The rifle has a very low round count of just a few round put threw it, Just to sight in and aline the scope, So it is still in like new condition and is very accurate, But with a bad knee it is hard to get out and go hunting, And this baby just sits in a safe when it should be out being appreciated...

So, I would like to trade it for a really nice Stainless 1911 style pistol in ( 9mm, 40 S&W, or 45acp ), Like a ( Springfield, Kimber, Colt, STI, or Sig ) worth around the $750 to $800 price range...

I may consider other kinds of handgun offers also, But I am mainly into single action semi auto pistols, And double action big bore revolvers ( .357 magnum and up ), And should be worth around $750 plus range, I am pretty current on moist gun values, So please no lowballers or cheap trade offets, Unless you plan to add in any of the cash difference...

I am an Ohio resident in the North Eastern corner of Ohio, Mainly looking to trade FTF with other residents in Ohio with proper state photo ID...

So let me know what you have to offer in trade and we can go from there, The worst I can say to you is no thank you, Or lets talk about what you have to offer, And if I am interested in your offer, I would want some pictures of it to look over, And before I commit to any trade I would have to look it over in person..."

It fires great and I love it, I just found a shotgun that I would rather have so I can hunt. I just cleaned it up and made it look nice and shiny! It has the wood stock and forearm. The only reason I want to sell it is because I want a hunting gun/home defense shotgun. It's a blast to shoot, literally and this price is a great deal.
Email for information if you are interested. I can take some pictures if you are interested as well. This is a really great deal and I want to hook someone up with a great gun at a great price."

This ammo was banned from importation in the early 1990's due to the steel core, and it makes this ammo highly collectable.  I tried to take numerous pictures, so you know what you are buying.  A couple of comments...

1) I have the original, wooden crate, and you can have the crate if you're willing to pay to ship it.
2) I cut the nose off of one of the bullets to show the steel core and then pulled the bullet to show the boat tail.
3) Shipping costs will be approximately $20, but I'll give you exact costs if you're a serious buyer.

Essentially everything but the forged, not cast, receiver was replaced. I never used it much so it has a low round count. The bore is excellent. Some of the white/yellow stuff in the pictures is old tetra grease.

Here is what Futon did:
Polytech Upgrade: Replace Hammer & sear, complete bolt 7790186 TRW ZJ, Op Rod 7267064 HRA, rear sight complete, NM flash suppressor without bayo lug (The was a ban on.), NM front sight, reparkerized, op rod spring, NM spring guide, gas lock, op rod guide & pin, as system, connector lock, barrel, buffer, hammer pin.

Upgrade to medium weight barrel â marked Fulton Armory, NM gas system, NM aperture (rear sight), NM trigger. It was put in a GI fiberglass stock. The hole on the rear right is the missing naughty bits.

The barrel used was new, not a GI part. Two 20 round mags and two 5 round mags are included. It also has a leather Turner saddlery NM sling, the M14 tool and a hard case.

It has a Bushnell Sportview scope and mount. This had been on it before the conversion. It screws into the receiver and has two points that tighten against a ridge on the receiver and is solid.

I know anybody can say âLow round countâ on a shot out barrel. Iâm willing to work with you. A gunsmith could check throat erosion or I could meet you at a range. I live and work south of Denver but am easy about doing a FTF meeting."

This is a J.Stevens model 620.  It was manufactured between 1927-1940,,,I cannot pinpoint the exact year.  Savage Arms bought out J. Stevens in 1919.  It is a 32"" barrel.  The walnut wood on this relic is in amazing shape.  There are no major scratches.  The only problem I have is when I load more than 3 shells in tube, it will jam.  Tube will hold 5.  Tube needs a new spring.  I even have the part number, and a new spring is under $10.  I decided to buy something else, something with an interchangable choke.  This is a fun one to own, a piece of history, and not a hunk of junk.  Its in darn good shape!  I will take best offer."

There were about 6 other serial numbers after that.  The bluing is all original but a little faded, there is no bare metal, wood is in great shape with the exception there is one hair line crack behind the receiver.

We install and test mounts, rings, hardware and scopes from specialty suppliers on Marlin rifles to develop the best combination of scopes, mounts and rings at equitable prices.

Kit components are purchased from Aim Sports, New Century, Leapers, TRW, Fastenal and other sources. In some cases, when we canât find a fully satisfactory mount, we modify the mount hardware to improve the function and quality of the application.

All of our kits are âNo Gunsmithâ which means there is no drilling, tapping, grinding, cutting, bolt bending, or modifications to your rifle required to mount the hardware. In some cases, an installation might require the removal of a factory sight. Allen wrenches are included with some mounts, but you may need a screwdriver, wrench or some simple hand tools to complete the installation. All installations are completely reversible to restore the rifle to its original configuration.

The following listed scope kits use aircraft quality aluminum Picatinny rails fitted to Marlin Flat Top receivers which are used on most Marlin and Henry center fire rifles. The Picatinny rail attaches to the receiver with steel screws. Medium height one inch aluminum rings secure the scope to the Picatinny Rail.

All of the scopes we sell have lifetime warranties from the respective manufacturers. Mounts, rings and misc. hardware are warranted by us for 90 days.

Has only been fired about 6 times.  The matte finish coach guns are getting harder to find as from what I read, they don't make it anymore. They only make the nickel and blue, but not sure, just what I read. I know I have looked on Gunbroker and auctionArms and have only seen a couple of these on there, the rest were mostly blue and a couple of nickel. Last one on gunbroker sold for $430 if you want to check it out. This gun is really nice and has been sitting in my gun safe as I'm not much for shotguns. I would rather have a pistol so if you have a decent pistol you might want to trade, let me know. I can trade the shotgun and some cash for the right pistol. Thanks"

I will listen to offers, but will most likely ignore any low balls. Please do not offer me $200 you will be wasting your time and mine. There is a scratch or two as this is a used rifle, but it is in very good condition (I cannot rate the condition as a book would, I just know it looks very good to me). It comes with a small Simmons scope attached in the same color, as seen in the picture. It will also include 2 factory Ruger magazines as well as a 30 rounder.
