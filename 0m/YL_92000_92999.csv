Ruger LCP w/ CT laser. 2 mags. both with 1"" pinky extensions. I also have .5"" extension and flat mag base. I will include my Desantis Superfly pocket/IWB holster and a leather belt holster. It is in excellent condition. No scratchs or scuffs. It has a polished feed ramp.

I purchased this last summer (from a local gun shop) for something that was easier to carry than my Glock 23. I can say that this thing is a dream for concealed carry. It is so comfortable that you forget that you have it. And with the laser you can put a round right where you want it. Laser is set to be dead on at 15ft. 

This is a post recall LCP. I have put about 50 rounds through it at the range and then broken down and cleaned each time I took it to range. 

I don't have a problem with some traveling for the right deal. I can include all of the .380 ammo that I have. Probably 100-175 rounds of various personal defense rounds and some range ammo as well.

Gun is used. Decent Condition. Wood is in great shape. Gun shoots well however slide lock is broken and needs replaced. I don't have the time to repair it but the part should cost around $20 or so to fix. 

I have recently had a lot of inquires to this gun and I need to clarify...the only thing that is broken on this gun is that the slide lock usually does not work. It occasionally does, but the part is worn out. Simply put, the slide doesn't lock most of the time when you chamber a round. A working shotgun would lock so that you couldn't pull back on the pump action (without pressing the release button) after the round is chambered. With this shotgun you can, and that needs to be fixed for the gun to be fired correctly.

Only took it out to shoot 4 times. I cleaned every part of it every time, and even when I don't shoot it I clean it once a month for maintainance. This gun was my baby.

Reason: Parents are moving, and I need to get rid of all my gun stuff and rifle. I need to use it to pay for rent and finish college. 

The great thing about this deal is that it literally comes with everything you could need. I bought the rifle plain, then I bought all the accessories and furniture I wanted on it, until I was satisfied. I poured SO MUCH money into it, and now I need to get rid of all of it as soon as possible, so it's going cheap. I really wish my parents weren't moving.

Specs: 
-Chrome lined barrel
-Tapco G2 trigger
-straight, uncanted sights
-Factory side rail mount

ALL THE FOLLOWING COMES FREE WITH RIFLE
Comes with: 
-Red dot sight
-Aluminum quad rail (rubber rail guards included) (equipped)
-Strap. (can be made to single point or double point)
-Magazine release assist (So you can drop the magazine with your trigger finger, like an AR)
-Side mounted rail (for mounting accessories over receiver)
-American made black synthetic stock (equipped)
-Double stacked 10/30 magazine (From Cold war shooters) (Looks like a 30 rd magazine, but it's plugged to hold only 10 rds. Fully legal)
-10 rd. double stacked polymer magazine. (both magazines are very reliable)
-polymer tactical pistol grip. (NOT ATTACHED, but comes with screw and nut to easily attach it. all you have to do is screw it in when you are out of state or have a mag lock)
-used bayonet
-cleaning rod
-Magazine carrier pouch
-Slant muzzle break
-Soft Carrying case with padlock

EXTRA FURNITURE (that also comes free with the rifle)
-Original wooden forend, and stock
-Tapco fusion forend (with hidden rail)

Price: $600. for this price, you basically get everything you need, and 3 sets of forends, 2 stocks, 2 mags, rail, cleaning rod, a sling, and red dot sight. 

For it to be legal in california, the pistol grip will not be attached. It has no magazine lock, so it accepts detachable magazines. The reason is because I anticipated moving out of state. But it comes with a pistol grip if you want to shoot out of state, unhandicapped. 

I would prefer not to have to ship. Offers from SD county, or LA. I'm willing to make a trip up to LA, only if you are certain about buying."

The PMAG (Polymer MAGazine) is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO, M-16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact Cover for storage, and an easy to dissasemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. PMAG utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance. 

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine. 

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact Cover can now be snapped onto the Floorplate when not in use to prevent possible loss. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color. 

Made in U.S.A. 

Features: 

• Impact and crush resistant polymer construction 

• Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding 

• Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability

The standard military design of the Western Hemisphere for decades, Bushmaster’s M16 Type Rifle incorporates all current design developments for unsurpassed durability, reliability and accuracy.

    * The A3 “Flat-top” Upper Receiver incorporates a Picatinny configuration mounting rail allowing easy attachment of most accessory sights, scopes, or optic devices.

    * Bushmaster M16 A3 Rifles feature a narrow profile A2 Government type barrel (.670"" diam. to .610 diam. under the handguards – accepts the M203 Grenade Launcher) for reduced weight. Barrels are Hard Chrome lined in both Bore and Chamber to aid in removing powder residue and copper fouling, to increase muzzle velocity, and ease chambering and extraction – effectively doubling barrel life if regular maintenance procedures are observed. An A2 “Birdcage” type Flash Suppressor with closed bottom is fitted to compensate for muzzle climb and reduce dust signature when firing from the prone position. The barrel, and all critical steel components of the rifle, are manganese phosphate coated for protection against corrosion and rust.

    * Pistol Grip and Buttstock are molded of thermoset composite – buttstock features a storage compartment for small parts or cleaning gear.

It has been in my family for many years but, due to some financial circumstances, I find myself forced to sell. I'm not an expert in such matters, but I'd rate the gun approx. 85% in finish and 95% in function (I've only had it to the range a small handful of times in 10 years and have had three failure-to-eject using cheap ball ammo). There is some wear shown in the bluing on the outside of the gun on the slide, but overall it's in fantastic shape for its age and could easily be made perfect by a bluing/restoration specialist. It is being sold with one original magazine.

Below is a link containing a lot of information on the particular model (including fun facts like General Patton used to carry one in WWII). As per the standards described on the site, the gun was manufactured between 1918-1921 and would make an excellent piece for a collector. The same model listed on Gunbroker without reserves are priced between $650-$1100 but I will take the best reasonable offer. I know there are some people out there that like to email and offer 50% of the asking price-- if this is you, please save both of us the trouble and don't do it. I do have some things I need to take care of, but I will not just give the gun away.  In addition, I will consider partial trades of subcompact semi-autos (KelTec, Ruger, etc) or even possibly a Derringer.

Please don't hesitate to email me with any questions, specific picture requests, etc. If, for some reason, I cannot get the pictures to load on the ad I'll be happy to email them to you.

Thanks a lot!
