This is high quality brass not steel ammo and is re-loadable so if there is a ban you can reload the brass!!! This is much better ammo than the majority of junk others are posting. They are trying to get 5 to 10 ten times what their average ammo is worth. This is barely marked up for high quality ammo.

Message me number or email and lets meet San Antonio face to face. Ammo is scarce for AR15s right now. Can't find it anywhere online and this is good stuff.

This is high quality brass ammo for your AR-15. Don't spend a ton of money on an AR then skimp and get crap on the ammo. This is also re-loadable unlike all the steel crap most are selling and if there really is a ban this brass will be very valuable for reloading.

And a s the saying goes: “A revolver never lets you down!”  

I'm a private collector and, as part of a multi-gun lot in a recent auction, picked up an excellent .38 Special revolver.  It doesn’t fit in with the rest of my collection, so I’m offering it for sale, but not before testing it thoroughly at my local range. It is in great shape; is spot-on accurate; and will be an excellent, low-cost self-defense or carry gun for a new owner.  

The revolver is a Llama Ruby Extra, made in the 1960s in Spain by the Llama-Gabilondo y Cia company to compete globally with Smith & Wesson’s Model 10 as a police issue sidearm.  This Llama has features that actually make it nicer than the Smith & Wesson police gun, including a grooved backstrap for a better grip and a grooved top strap to cut down on haze in the sight radius.   I don't own a Model 10, but do have a S&W Model 64, the stainless version of the Model 10.  One of the photos shows the Llama and the Model 64 side by side for comparison.  

The Llama Ruby Extra sold well to police departments in South America and the Philippines but this one must have been shipped directly to the US as it is not import-marked.  The bore/lands/grooves are in great condition and the gun has just a trace of finish wear at the muzzle, so it seems to have spent more time in a sock drawer than a holster. 

Face-to-face sale not possible, but I’ll ship to a FFL-holder/firearms retailer near you for $20 or deliver to an FFL-holder in the NW Chicago suburbs for free.  Payment by money order or personal check is okay; just enclose a copy of the FFL license with your payment.  Item will be shipped only to the address on the license.  I have an FFL (03) license (the “curio and relic collector” license) and will send a copy of my license when shipping the gun.  Make sure your retailer is okay with accepting a shipment from an FFL (03) holder 

Just the Llama is for sale at this price.  The gun stand, Model 64 and bore light are for illustration only.

I know this is a tricky listing, but it seems people need to be roped in or they just ignore things that are there to help them. The purpose of this listing is to give those that want it a link to contact their elected officials to share their feelings on the upcoming A W B. If you feel the need to use the link and protect your second amendment right then do so. However, if you do not then leave it at that; do not flag this posting because someone might want the link. During my time using this sight I have seen many things that needed flagged, yet I did not. The main reason I did not was due to the fact that I know others might want what was listed. For example, overpriced guns, overpriced knives, and overpriced ammo. I simply understand that just because I will not pay the price does not mean others will not. Thank you for your time and I hope this post reaches enough people that will do what is needed to protect the second amendment!! Here is the link please use it and save our right to keep and bear arms.    http://www.congress.org/congressorg/mail/?alertid=61046526&type=ML"

On to the watch, it's a Rolex GMT II, model 16710 serial #656xxxx, produced 1980. This watch is very good to excellent, band has minimal sag/deflection.

And, as the saying goes: “A revolver never lets you down!”

I'm a private collector and, as part of a multi-gun lot in a recent auction, picked up an excellent .38 Special revolver. It doesn’t fit in with the rest of my collection, so I’m offering it for sale, but not before testing it thoroughly at my local range. It is in great shape; is spot-on accurate; and will be an excellent, low-cost self-defense or carry gun for a new owner. 

The revolver is a Llama Ruby Extra, made in the 1960s in Spain by the Llama-Gabilondo y Cia company to compete globally with Smith & Wesson’s Model 10 as a police issue sidearm. This Llama has features that actually make it nicer than the Smith & Wesson police gun, including a grooved backstrap for a better grip and a grooved top strap to cut down on haze in the sight radius. 

The Llama Ruby Extra sold well to police departments in South America and the Philippines but this one must have been shipped directly to the US as it is not import-marked. The bore/lands/grooves are in great condition and the gun has just a trace of finish wear at the muzzle, so it seems to have spent more time in a sock drawer than a holster. 

Face-to-face sale not possible, but I’ll ship to a FFL-holder/firearms retailer near you for $20 or deliver to an FFL-holder in the NW Chicago suburbs for free. Payment by money order or personal check is okay; just enclose a copy of the FFL license with your payment. Item will be shipped only to the address on the license. I have an FFL (03) license (the “curio and relic collector” license) and will send a copy of my license when shipping the gun. Make sure your retailer is okay with accepting a shipment from an FFL (03) holder

This is a WW2-era (early 1940’s) 9mm Browning Hi-Power.  It was made for Browning by Fabrique Nationale (FN) in Belgium for the German army.  The Nazi eagle appears on the slide, frame and barrel.

This is a blued gun, and in excellent shape for a vintage gun.  All parts are original and in perfect working order.  The slide, barrel and frame all have original matching serial numbers.  This is a rare WW2 Hi-Power with tangent sites, which allow for quick and easy distance adjustments.

Also included is a black leather flap holster.  I'm not sure if it is an original WW2 holster or not, but I can send you pictures so you can see if it is or not for yourself.

The various marking on the gun read:
FABRIQUE NATIONALE D’ARMES DE GUERRE
HERSTAL BELGIQUE
BROWNING’S PATENT DEPOSE
WaA140
(Serial Number) 130379

According to one writer (http://www.acant.org.au/Articles/GermanBrowningHiPower.html), the serial number on this gun places its production date on or before 1943.

The 14-round magazine appears to be an original, but is not the best: it looks like someone removed and welded back on the bottom of the magazine.  It still works fine and additional magazines are easy to come by.

This was my grandfather’s for many years, and came to me about ten years ago.  The story from him was that a friend of his in Redmond, OR took it off ""a dead Nazi"" during the war and brought it home.

I have put about 100 rounds of 115 grain 9mm ammunition through it without any problems.  I don’t have a need for it anymore and hope it will find a happy home with a collector who appreciates fine vintage guns like this.

FTF, cash transaction ONLY in Salem, Oregon.  You must be able to legally purchase this handgun.

I can email more pictures if you’d like.  Call or email to set up a time to pick it up.

Asking $900 obo.

It was made for Browning by Fabrique Nationale (FN) in Belgium for the German army.  The Nazi eagle appears on the slide, frame and barrel.

This is a blued gun, and in excellent shape for a vintage gun.  All parts are original and in perfect working order.  The slide, barrel and frame all have original matching serial numbers.  This is a rare WW2 Hi-Power with tangent sites, which allow for quick and easy distance adjustments.

The various marking on the gun read:
FABRIQUE NATIONALE D’ARMES DE GUERRE
HERSTAL BELGIQUE
BROWNING’S PATENT DEPOSE
WaA140
(Serial Number) 130379

The 14-round magazine appears to be an original, but is not the best: it looks like someone removed and welded back on the bottom of the magazine.  It still works fine and additional magazines are easy to come by.

This was my grandfather’s for many years, and came to me about ten years ago.  I have put about 100 rounds of 115 grain 9mm ammunition through it without any problems.  I don’t have a need for it anymore and hope it will find a happy home with a collector who appreciates fine vintage guns like this.

FTF, cash transaction ONLY in Salem, Oregon.  You must be able to legally purchase this handgun.

I can email more pictures if you’d like.  Call or email to set up a time to pick it up.

Asking $900 obo.

When the upper is locked onto your grip frame, it is solid as a rock.  There is NO SLOP or looseness.  This is a non NFA non FFL item.  You can change the charging handle to either side if you want.  Has a factory installed full rail system and collapsable AR stock.  Also comes with the AR carry handle/A2 sights and forward sight post.  The forward grip-handle is a 5 position push button lockable style that can be removed with an allen wrench if you like.  The quality and feel of this is outstanding.

Nosler Custom Brass was developed to complement their line of custom bullets. Each lot is weight-sorted to provide consistent measurements and capacities for accurate loads and features a Nosler head-stamp. Before shipment, Nosler chamfers and deburrs the case mouths and deburrs the flash hole. Fully prepped and ready to load upon receipt, each piece of brass offers consistency in trimmed length and neck wall thickness. This brass is new and unprimed. This is not loaded ammunition.

This is the ultimate in AR weaponry. Ask ANYONE in the business and they will tell you this is at the top of the food chain.           It is brand new, unfired, and comes with everything as pictured. The Patriot Brown SPR was the hardest color to get before the rush and is now virtually impossible to find. LWRC just last week announced it will no longer produce the color cerakote finish versions and only push out black to keep up with demand. This rifle will be worth MUCH more with or without the possible ban.   ** This will go on to auction site if not sold locally and in person by month's end.**

$4500 includes everything you see plus 2 additional 30 rnd mags. Serious emails only. 

**Will meet in person only ( Metro Atlanta ), no shipping, cash only or I will take bullion at that day's spot price. Please no crazy trade offers as there is not much I would take versus keeping it. **

This is one Bad A$$ rifle.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FACTORY SETUP:
LWRC M6A2 SPR Semi Automatic Rifle, 5.56 NATO 14.7"" Hammer Forged Spiral Fluted Barrel with Pinned Flash Hider, Magpul ACS Stock, Magpul MIAD Grip, SPR-MOD Railed Handguard, 30 Round Mag, Gas Piston, Skirmish Sights

""The SPR features our enhanced fire control group, a Magpul MIAD pistol grip, and the new Magpul ACS stock. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The M6A2 rifle can be used in various roles from close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas, an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters."""

Alright so basically this vehicle was given to me by a good friend. He bought it and very shortly after a family member passed and he ended up with a brand new car. He purchased the vehicle with no title but did complete a bill of sale. 

All power windows and locks work. 2 keys. No radio. The windshield has a decent sized spider web crack on the driver side, The outside and inside passenger door handle is broken off but is not a very expensive part(s) to replace. The car does have some exterior damage but nothing major. I do have the corner light in the car and I will be remounting it before the sale. The car runs fine and will come with a pretty new battery. A/c needs to be recharged as well but the heater works. This isn't a perfect car but is a pretty neat daily and is a gas saver. 

Looking to sell asap, somewhat obo, hit me up with a reasonable price and I more than likely won't turn it down

SPECIAL ALERT UPDATE– YOUR ACTION REQUIRED SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES BILLS TO RUN RANGES OUT OF BUSINESS AND BAN 80% OF YOUR GUNS

MESSAGE FROM COMMITTEE DEMOCRATS: “Eliminating law-abiding gun owners is a good ‘first step’ towards a ‘civil society.’”

Votes on HB815 and HB1263 were split along party lines in the Senate Public Health Committee Wednesday night with the committee Democrats voting 6-4 and 6-3 to send the bills to the full senate. If these two bills become law, they will resulting most, if not all ranges in the state going out of business as well as the banning of ALL semiautomatic rifles, pistols and shotguns as well as banning all pump shotguns and rifles. 

In comments made during testimony, committee Democrats stated plainly that HB815 and HB1263 were “first steps” and that these bills have as their objective the creation of a “more civil society.” In other words, elimination of lawful gun owners is a required first step for creating a more civil society. Of course, there was no mention of the impact of eliminating criminals. 

HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ON THURSDAY: 

1. Call Senator Dave Syverson at REDACTED and tell him “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263. 

2. Call Senator Shane Cultra at REDACTED and tell him “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263. 

3. Call Senator Christine Johnson at REDACTED and tell her “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263. 

4. Call Senator Carole Pankau at REDACTED and tell her “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263. 

It is very important that you praise these Senators for their support. 

The ringleader of the effort to shut down shooting ranges and take your guns away from you is Senator Dan Kotowski. You may wish to call him at REDACTED and politely explain to him that, as a law-abiding gun owner, you do not appreciate being treated like a criminal and that you oppose any efforts to regulate shooting ranges, ban semiautomatic firearms, or ban standard capacity magazines.

URGENT ALERT – BAN ON GUN RANGES AND BAN ON ALL SEMIAUTOMATIC FIREARMS ON THE MOVE IN THE ILLINOIS SENATE

YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED 

A pair of nightmare bills is on the move at this moment in the Illinois Senate. 

These two bills would: 

1. Run all gun ranges out of business by imposing heavy fees, imposing special staffing requirements, warrantless searches of ranges and customers, unlimited unannounced “inspections.” 

2. Ban all semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns as well as pump action shotguns. 

Here are direct links to the two bills:

It doesn't have 10 lbs. of mall ninja crap on it, no lights, lasers, or lawn ornaments hangin off branch catcher rails. Just a strait, light, fast, intuitive gun. Weights 5.5 pounds empty. Has the Sig Sauer red dot optic with YHM riser. Side sling with quick snap attached to gas block and rear six point stock, Easily changed for length and left or right hand shooter. Top of the line Rock River built lower, DPMS built strait side upper. That's right, nothing to get snagged up on the side, the military doesn't even suggest using a forward assist as it more often binds a bolt worse than ""assists"". No brass deflector or bolt door, this gun is simple and reliable. Never have had a jamb, and, as a modern M4 should be, a jamb is to be cleared with the charge handle. Gun has standard GI trigger and integrates a captured trigger pivot. 3 prong break, on a non chrome lined barrel. NO CHOME? Do you know that a non chrome lined barrel is more accurate? And if not shooting corrosive ammo there is little cleaning difference. Sig red dot has 11 brightness settings, still has box, lens cover, and all tools. Drum is Norinco, the rare two tone, very sought after 120 rounder, it is new in cosmoline bag. 2 GI 30 round magazines included, as is 150 rounds of 62 grain target grade Rimrock ammo.

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.

Buffer tube conversion kit. Perfect for setting up a stripped lower to use with the SSAR-15, or if you want to use the Slide Fire Stock but currently have a non-collapsible stock on your AR-15.

Contains all the parts and tools necessary to convert an AR-15 with an A2 fixed stock to a six position buffer extension compatible with the SSAR-15, no special tools needed!

SSAR-15 SBS Stock (Right Hand)

It comes with a holster and a double mag holder of which we bought an extra. http://m.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?r=view&i=422726 
Here's the link to the S.A XDM 40 which has a match grade trigger and barrel. This is where we bought it a month ago. The 9mm barrel and extra mags and 500+ rounds of 9mm ammo obviously didn't come with this package. Because of the proposed ban in high cap mags and semi autos these are flying off the shelf! As you can see they are sold out. I have to see how many boxes of 9mm ammo we have and what we have into it all before setting a price. Silver or cash will be accepted. If you have something special in the way of long guns we may consider it plus cash or silver. The wife just can't hold a pistol up long because of pinched nerves between her shoulderblades or she would keep it as it's so nice. We aren't in any hurry and will keep it over taking a lowball offer as the mags and gun will all gain in price as we get closer to the ban should one come about."

This gun is hard to find and vary in prices. I saw one in gun store in del city off sunnylane and theywtheywanted nearly $1000 for it which is a crime. Im looking more to trade cause I enjoy trading with people, but I am taking an international vacation this yr so money could be useful. I will be honest I paid $679,  $730 after tax for this gun so If I sell it im going to get what I paid minus the tax. That will save u about $50 from buying it at th e store. Again this obe is brand new. Comes with 10rounds of pdx home defense and 20 rounds of number 4 shot. I also have a little universal nylon holster for it. Its great to keep scratches off.

SPECIAL ALERT UPDATE– YOUR ACTION REQUIRED SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES BILLS TO RUN RANGES OUT OF BUSINESS AND BAN 80% OF YOUR GUNS

MESSAGE FROM COMMITTEE DEMOCRATS: “Eliminating law-abiding gun owners is a good ‘first step’ towards a ‘civil society.’”

Votes on HB815 and HB1263 were split along party lines in the Senate Public Health Committee Wednesday night with the committee Democrats voting 6-4 and 6-3 to send the bills to the full senate. If these two bills become law, they will resulting most, if not all ranges in the state going out of business as well as the banning of ALL semiautomatic rifles, pistols and shotguns as well as banning all pump shotguns and rifles.

In comments made during testimony, committee Democrats stated plainly that HB815 and HB1263 were “first steps” and that these bills have as their objective the creation of a “more civil society.” In other words, elimination of lawful gun owners is a required first step for creating a more civil society. Of course, there was no mention of the impact of eliminating criminals.

HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ON THURSDAY:

1. Call Senator Dave Syverson at REDACTED and tell him “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263.

2. Call Senator Shane Cultra at REDACTED and tell him “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263.

3. Call Senator Christine Johnson at REDACTED and tell her “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263.

4. Call Senator Carole Pankau at REDACTED and tell her “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263.

It is very important that you praise these Senators for their support.

The ringleader of the effort to shut down shooting ranges and take your guns away from you is Senator Dan Kotowski. You may wish to call him at REDACTED and politely explain to him that, as a law-abiding gun owner, you do not appreciate being treated like a criminal and that you oppose any efforts to regulate shooting ranges, ban semiautomatic firearms, or ban standard capacity magazines.

URGENT ALERT – BAN ON GUN RANGES AND BAN ON ALL SEMIAUTOMATIC FIREARMS ON THE MOVE IN THE ILLINOIS SENATE

YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

A pair of nightmare bills is on the move at this moment in the Illinois Senate.

These two bills would:

1. Run all gun ranges out of business by imposing heavy fees, imposing special staffing requirements, warrantless searches of ranges and customers, unlimited unannounced “inspections.”

2. Ban all semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns as well as pump action shotguns.

Doesnt come with any chokes this older guy(my father lol!) Told me one barrel has a built in full choke and the other is either improved or modified I cant remember. So I guess they are built into this shotgun. Im not an o/u guy I just received two of these in a trade and gave one to my father for Christmas.  This gun is technically new(never been shot) even though u can tell it is probably 6-10yrs old. HastHasthe dual trigger as well. I thought it would be cool to trap shoot with the same gun with my father but he lives in tulsa so its hard to do that."

If you own a semi-automatic firearm or detachable magazine, they may be banned, taxed, and registered and you could easily become a felon unless you act NOW

Anti-gun legislators led by Senate President John Cullerton and backed by Governor Patrick Quinn (D) substituted and passed sweeping draconian gun and magazine bans in the Senate Public Health Committee today.  House Bill 1263, amended to include a ban on many commonly owned firearms passed in this committee by a 6 to 4 vote.  House Bill 815, which was amended to include a magazine ban and shooting range restrictions, passed by a 6 to 3 vote.  Additionally, amendments have been filed to remove the hunting exception and could be introduced and considered on the Senate floor tomorrow.  These actions prove once again that Chicago politicians seem more focused on creating new classes of criminals out of law-abiding citizens than dealing effectively with their current violent crime problems.

New amendments have been introduced which add some specifics to the time limits for registration of previously owned firearms and magazines, and set the fees to register firearms and magazines. These amendments will be heard in the Executive Committee tomorrow morning at 11am. Both bills are expected to be heard on the floor of the Senate tomorrow afternoon for their third and final vote, and this is where the real fight will take place to maintain your Second Amendment rights and defeat Senate President Cullerton's anti-gun agenda.  It is imperative that you contact your state Senator IMMEDIATELY to express your opposition to House Bills 815 and 1263 and any additional anti-gun amendments.

Among other things, House Bill 815 would:

- Prohibit anyone without a FOID card from using a commercial shooting range, which in many cases would make it impossible to introduce new shooters to the safe and responsible use of firearms.

- Grant the State Police broad discretion to impose design, construction and operation standards that could shut down most commercial shooting ranges.

- Ban possession of magazines and other feeding devices that hold more than ten rounds of ammunition.  A ""grandfather clause"" would require registration by owners of such devices and give the State Police discretion to impose and charge fees.  Registration would require ""proof of ownership"" that could be impossible for most people to provide, and even registered owners could not transfer magazines within Illinois, except to an heir or a licensed dealer.  Transfers of ""grandfathered magazines"" would have to be reported to the ISP.

- Violations of this magazine ban would be a felony.  Failure to report theft or loss of a magazine would be a misdemeanor until the third violation, which would be a felony.

House Bill 1263 would:

- Ban, at a minimum, all detachable-magazine semi-automatic rifles and pistols. Remington 7400 deer rifles, Ruger 10/22 squirrel guns, Glocks, 1911s, etc. This ban would include about 80% of handguns now sold in the U.S.

- Possibly ban all semi-automatic rifles and even revolvers or single-shot pistols with the capacity to accept muzzle brakes or compensators.

- Ban ""assault weapon attachments,"" so possession of a thumbhole stock, a pistol grip,or a fore-end (a ""shroud"" that ""partially or completely encircles the barrel"") would be a crime even if you didn't possess a firearm.

- Ban all .50 BMG rifles.

- Contains ""grandfather"" provisions that would require registration by owners of devices and give the State Police discretion to impose and charge fees. Registration would require ""proof of ownership.""

-  Create felony penalties for violation of this ban on guns or attachments.

- Create lost and Stolen penalties that would criminalize victims of gun theft.



Anti-gun politicians are attempting to sacrifice your constitutional rights as a scapegoat for the criminal acts of violence in Chicago by gangs and drug dealers.  Don't let them succeed in banning your firearms or magazines as an excuse for stopping criminals from misusing them.  Criminals -- by definition -- violate laws, especially gun control laws, including often: murder, rape, robbery, drug-dealing, gang violence, firearm theft, carrying concealed firearms without a license/permit, federal gun-free school zones. They do not obey gun bans, register their firearms, or get subjected to any gun control schemes (like the lone state ban on carrying concealed firearms for self-defense) that only affect and penalize law-abiding citizens like you. Your telephone calls TODAY will determine the outcome of this very serious assault on your Second Amendment rights.

The NRA-ILA will continue to send legislative updates as details become available.  However, it is of the utmost importance that you act NOW to stop this gun and magazine ban.  Call your state Senator IMMEDIATELY and express your opposition to banning firearms or magazines and urge them to vote against House Bills 815 and 1263.

Retail price: $2,000. 
This course is fast paced and exciting. The four day curriculum includes almost forty hours of training crammed into four intense days - there's very little down time! You spend many hours on the range performing live-fire exercises in addition to learning dry practice drills. You also attend several dynamic and thought-provoking classroom lectures. You will have an introduction to tactical training, and then you will have an opportunity to ""clear"" a live-fire shooting house simulator. Front Sight's unique teaching methods will bring you to the highest level of training offered by any training school in the industry. Even if you've never shot a gun before, or if you've been shooting for years, you're skills will improve dramatically. After completing the course you will have a complete understanding of the defensive handgun and a skill level that surpasses many of those who carry a gun for a living. Your gun handling, marksmanship, and tactical skills will be better than they've ever been and you will be able to safely and easily draw your weapon from a CONCEALED holster and fire two,sighted shots to the center of a target 5 yards away - all under 1.5 seconds!
For complete information on this course go to the following link: http://www.frontsight.com/courses/defensive-handgun-training-course.asp
I've taken several courses at Front Sight. Every time I've been on the range there's been law enforcement, military, and corrections personnel as well as private citizens on the range with me. My experiences at Front Sight have always been positive, so I purchased lifetime memberships for myself, my wife and my six children because I trust and believe in Front Sight! When we arrive at Front Sight we are treated with the utmost respect - in a friendly, supportive, and caring manner - by the absolute best trained, most consistent, and most effective instructional staff in the industry. Simply put - Front Sight provides the finest firearms training in North America!
You don't need to be an experienced shooter to take the course. I brought my 19 year old daughter who had never handled a BB gun, let alone a firearm. Upon completion of the course she understood basic tactical principles and had multiple opportunities to use her newly acquired skills under the stress of simulated, lethal encounters.
Friday-to-Monday...or Tuesday-to-Friday: You choose which portion of the week that's best for you to train.
Lecture Topics Include: Use of Deadly Force and the Law; Color Code of Mental Awareness; Stopping Power; Civil Liability, Concealed Carry; Course also includes Supplemental Lectures on Shotgun and Rifle topics
Firing Range Drills Include: Loading and Unloading; Grip, Stance, Sight Picture, Sight Alignment, and Trigger Control; Presentation from Ready and Holster; and Target Engagement from Arms Length to 15 yards under Time Pressure. Malfunction Clearing; Speed and Tactical Reloading; Tactical Training Simulation using Realistic Targets in Shoot/No Shoot Scenarios; Single Elimination Shoot-off, and Distinguished Graduate Skills Evaluation..Training starts at 8:00am each day and ends after 6:00pm each day.
Paperless Electronic Certificate: Your training certificate cannot get lost because it is provided in the form of an ""Digital Certificate"". I will send via email a Front Sight issued paperless, electronic certificate number directly to you upon receipt of payment. It will allow you to log into Front Sight's registration page at https://www.myfrontsight.com/secure/login.php and register for your course (or you can phone Front Sight to register).

There is no expiration date on the course certificate once you purchase it.

Handgun Rentals: You can rent a handgun, holster, belt, magazines, and magazine pouches from Front Sights Pro Shop. Front Sight provides a Glock 17 in 9mm as the standard rental gun (others may be available upon request).
