The extremely rare 92SB, initially called the 92S-1, was specifically designed for the USAF (US Air Force) trials (which it won), the model name officially adopted was the 92SB. It included the changes of the 92S, added a firing pin block (thus the addition of the ""B"" to the name), and relocated the magazine release catch from the bottom of the grip to the lower bottom of the trigger guard."

I purchased them originally from HKParts.net and didn't end up using them. 

These have been used prior to me purchasing them, but they are in very good condition. Forearms show some signs of normal use (most notably the white mark on the flashlight of one of the fore ends). Both are in great working order - both were tested by me today (whether a fresh battery would light the bulb, and whether the pressure pads would work - no issues with either fore end in either test). There are no cracks/tears on the pressure pads and they function as designed, there is no corrosion on the threading or contacts of the flashlights and the bulbs work, etc. In short, they work as they are supposed to work and are in all other respects ""correct"". Batteries are not included (forearm uses two cr123a batteries).

These are for sale today on HKParts.net for $250 each, plus shipping. I will sell them for $225 TYD each or $425 TYD for the pair. The benefit here to you is the reduced price, and the opportunity to see exactly what you are buying (see the photos). 

If you wish to have them shipped to you, I will require that they be shipped to you after I've received a USPS Money Order for the agreed amount, and will ship them to you in a tracked format."

PMAG® 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE® Window, 5.56x45 Magazine

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately.


Features

Impact and crush resistant polymer construction

Taurus dubbed their .410/.45LC series revolver ""the Judge"", due to a large number of judges expressing interest in carrying a .410 load into the courtroom.

The Judge gives you options no other self-defense handgun can offer. While it is questionable whther or not bird shot fired from the Judge would be very effective against a dangerous adversary, don't forget that the Judge is also capable of firing buckshot and the .45 Colt cartridge...a proven manstopper. More importantly, there are self-defense situations where penetration of walls and/or injury to innocent bystanders standing behind the bad guy are very real concerns.

There is also a serious concern among city dwellers, who may not necessarily be firearms enthusiasts, but want a self-defense handgun for the apartment or car. The Judge is ideally suited for tight quarters and would minimize the chances of perforating the neighbors. The remaining cylinders could be loaded with .45 Colt loads in case the situation goes downhill. And let's not forget the most practical application of the ""Judge"", is that of a handy snake gun...and not just those on two-legs."

I have moved on to other carry guns and the new buyer didn't want the holster so I still have it.  Their loss is your gain.  It is in VG shape, though was my daily carry holster for 6 months, so it has a bit of wear on the leather.  Great IWB carry holster that makes the LC9 disappear under clothes."
