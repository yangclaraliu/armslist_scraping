Every time I go to the range all the instructors ask to shoot it as most have only heard of these amazing works of shooting art. This is the Sig Sauer P220 S Sport Compensated hot rod gun made in Germany with the most amazing trigger I have ever felt, adjustable sights and factory compensator. I have not put a pull gauge on it to test, but I would guess no more than 3 pounds and super crisp. The compensator makes this stay on target like no 45 I have ever seen. It's like shooting a light load in a 9mm and will knock the house down when it hits. I am fortunate enough to have 2 of these and due to all my recent purchases some things have to go so this is your chance to own a gun most others have never seen and will likely never have a chance to own. You will be the rock star at the range with this baby! These guns shoot the tightest groups of any 45 I have ever owned including my $4,600 Wilson Combat. Comes with 1 mag.

FYI - The last one of these I saw sell brought $3,800 with 3 mags.NO FFL if face to face in Wisconsin as long as you have WI drivers license and are of legal age, not a felon and allowed to own this firearm - private sale on bill of sale."

These are FMJ, 115gr with a tested velocity of 1190 fps. They are the best FMJ 9mm round I have used over the years. They are clean firing, consistently accurate and extremely dependable rounds made here in the USA. I have gone through so much the last three weeks trying to find ammo for several different calibers with very little luck. I have held these two cases and tried to find cheaper quality ammo to burn with minimal results. I have invested many hours on line as well as many miles of driving and a great deal of my time only to end up with a few boxes of TulAmmo junk for $25.00 a box. It would have taken forever and a day to locate 2000 rounds and the time and expense incurred would have made it unreal.  I don't much care if they sell or not because I cannot replace these due to the supply and demand issues and a big time shortage of 9mm and ammo period. I have some other things going and would like to fund those projects with the sale of these rounds as well as purchase some 357 Sig rounds which appear to be nonexistent or very pricey. 

I would consider selling them separate but would rather sell it all at once. If you take them both the price is $850.00 (2000 rounds) that's $425.00 per case of 1000 rounds. If you take just one $450.00 for the 1000 rounds. Please feel free to make an offer as well. Depending on the response I may just sell them by the box but will try the case first.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration! No trades please unless it's a 55 Chevy.  ;-)"

Caliber: 7.92x57mm (8mm Mauser) 
Action: Gas operated, tilting bolt 
Overall length: 45.5 inches 
Barrel length: 22 inches 
Weight: 9.2 lbs 
Magazine: 10 rounds, non-detachable 

The SAFN-49 rifle (Semi-Automatic, FN, model of 1949) was developed by the famous Belgian company Fabrique Nationale Herstal. Nicknamed the ""Cadillac"" of Battle Rifles because it was so expensive to produce. Almost Every part is robust and billet machined. It is the rifle from which the famous FN FAL rifle originated.

This particular Rifle is an Egyptian Contract 8mm Mauser. The 8mm is the equivalent to a 32 caliber bullet, making it larger in diameter than a 308 or 30.06. Additionally, the bullet of standard load is 196 grains in weight, about 25% heavier than standard 308 or 30.06 load.

The SAFN-49 is a gas operated, semi-automatic, magazine fed rifle with a 10 round magazine. It uses a short-piston stroke gas drive, with gas camber and a gas piston-tappet located above the barrel. The gas piston has its own separate return spring. The tilting bolt is linked to the bolt carrier, and tilts down to lock into the floor of the milled steel receiver. Charging handle is mounted at the right side of the bolt carrier and reciprocates when gun is fired. Magazine has a bolt catch which holds the bolt open after the last round from magazine is fired. The gas chamber features a gas regulator which also can be used as a gas cut-off, which is required to fire rifle grenades. Barrel is equipped with muzzle flash hider and a bayonet mount. The single-piece stock is made from wood and has a semi-pistol grip and a separate upper handguard. Front sight is mounted on the gas chamber and is protected by two side ""wings"", rear sight is of adjustable diopter type and is mounted at the rear of the receiver. The safety switch is located just above the triggerguard at the right side of the gun. When safety is engaged, the safety switch lever protrudes into the triggerguard to interfere with trigger finger, so the state of the safety could be inspected without the single look at it.
 The gun fell victim to the Import assault weapons ban of the early nineties, and few were available.
Century Arms bought a couple hundred and sold them as C&R collectibles, however they were Refinished and were equipt with after market stocks. This rifle is in Excellent Shooting order. Overall a Beautiful Rifle in VERY NICE condition. The Best I have ever seen that wasn't refinished.  All original, except that there was no flash hider. Sometime after I bought the gun, I found the original flash hider at Sarco and bought it."

What I am looking for:
Mosin Nagant rifles, but not the standard 91/30, they would have to be an M27, M28, M44, M38, M39, Finn, or any other UNIQUE nagant.  I am also looking for 1, just 1 really nice hex receiver Mosin, which is not too unique, I just don’t have one.  I am interested in 1 or multiple rifles. 

Also the rifle cannot be modified in any way, such as a refinished stock (refinished by you, not the Russians).  I might consider one with a scope, as long as it is the type that can be returned to original, the ones that mount on the rear sight to  be more specific.  Also, prefer matching numbers, receiver, magazine, buttstock and bolt, unless they are the more unique ones. 


Also the barrel has to be in good shape, Nagants are notorious for rusted barrels due to not taking care of them after shooting corrosive ammo.

Your message should include Year, Type, and a short description of the rifle and which type of ammo you are looking for and the round count.  I will look at the current value of both the ammo and the rifle before I agree to trade.

A sample message would be would be, 1944, Russian M44, barrel is shiny, a small ding on the stock, looking for .223 ammo, 200 rounds.

The Remington Golden Saber .38 Special +P is a Dead-serious bullet innovation. A superior bullet for when the stakes are at their highest. Designed for law enforcement and personal defense to fill the void missing in self defense ammunition, the Golden Saber High Performance Jacket successfully combines: match type accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion, and near 100% weight retention. The revolutionary hollow point bullet design features a 125 grain jacketed hollow point. The jacket is made entirely of cartridge brass, which releases energy over longer distance while mushrooming. Spiral nose cut feature permits mushrooming at lower velocity without sacrificing penetration or terminal performance. Cases are nickel plated for reliable feed, function, extraction, and are reloadable.

The iBright™ I58i utilizes 5050 SMD LED diodes, and a clear lens to maximize lumen output. The lamp can produce illuminance equivalent to that from a fluorescent tube while using less than 50% of the energy.

The lamp uses a patented solution for heat management which is designed for quick and efficient dissipation of heat from the LED chip to the air. With the reduction in heat buildup, the life span of the lamp increases, and performance stabilizes at an optimal level.

Environmentally conscious
Energy efficient and long life means fewer lamp replacements vs. standard fluorescent tube lights.

Low cost operation
Using only 9 Watts of power, this LED would cost less than $4.46 per year to operate, assuming 4500 burn hours annually at $0.11 per kWh.

Long life
25,000 hours rated life (L70)

I will be holding an NRA Basic Pistol & Ohio Concealed Carry Course on Sunday, February 3, 2013. 

This is a 12 hour, ""Basic Pistol"" course that is very hands on. It's an exciting practical course for beginners through seasoned shooters. Unlike most courses, we do not segregate the class and range time, but instead learn then apply techniques as the day goes on in a ""building block"" type of instruction. We start it simple then spend the day growing to situations and tactical types of gun handling to better prepare you in the event that any of us would ever have to use our side arm in the home or in an attack situation. 

As required by Ohio State law, the class consists of 3 core components: 8 hours NRA basic pistol training, 2 hours Concealed Carry Law and 2 hours range time.

This is a one day course: 7:30a-7:30p
 The fee is $75.00 per person paid in advance. I accept credit/debit cards, money orders, certified checks and cash. 

Includes NRA student packet, sheriffs application, lunch, bottled water, pop, coffee & donuts

Location: Father & Son Hunting Club; 2286 Downing Street, East Sparta Ohio

Next available class date:

___ Sunday, February 3, 2013

Contact me asap if you would like to attend on the 13th or if you would like to book a private class with your own group of 10 or more people. 

In preparation for class, you will need the following:
 • Handgun suitable for concealed carry; extra magazine(s) if applicable
 • Properly fitted holster (no cross draw or shoulder holsters)
 • 100 rounds of factory ammunition properly sized for the handgun (no reloads of any kind)
 • Eye and ear protection
 * Optional: Extra magazine(s) or re-loader
 • Attitude necessary to enjoy a day of learning and having fun.
 • NO LIVE AMMUNITION WILL BE PERMITTED IN THE CLASSROOM. NO EXEPTIONS !!!

We recommend that you bring your own handgun so that we can customize our instruction to your firearm since all handguns require different techniques. 
From this class you will receive everything that is needed to apply for your Ohio license through a county sheriff.

Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you! The best way to contact me is to call or text at REDACTED.

Those serial # were 534000/599000.
After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was GARRISONED BY THE SS! Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...
-an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.

I may consider a MSAR STG-556 E4 (American AUG Clone that takes AR mags) with 16 inch barrel provided it actually functions properly (I've read mixed reviews on the MSAR's). I prefere the O.D. Green stock. I would also consider a PS90 bullpup, FS2000 bullpup and a Kel Tech RFB! I am not really interested in anything else for trade, sorry. 
Now more about my FAL. It is a 16.5 inch barrel carbine Metric FAL with an Imbel upper receiver and a Canadian Miliatry lower receiver (selector is able to go all the way to the full auto position) there is no full auto sear/disconnector in stalled so it will not fire full auto and is a totally legal semi-auto only rifle! I have a total of 3 butt stocks and two pistol grips with it. The stock that is on it now is a DSA made X-Series stock. It has a full rail foregrip installed and also comes with the stock FAL foregrips as well. I have 2 20 round metric mags, a Red Dot Red / Green 40mm sight and folding front virtical grip that will come with it as well. The barrel has a removable short Belgum Flash Suppressor on it which cuts down on felt recoil and muzzle flash.
It is very accurate and hits a lot harder than any AR that shoots 5.56/.223! I shread milk jugs with it at 300+ meters! It fires both 7.62x51 NATO and .308 ammo flawlessly! I have two FAL's but I only need one and am now looking for a what I listed above only! If you have what I am looking for and want a nice rock solid flawless functioning pre-ban Imbel FAL let me know!
The FAL is currently used by over 90 countries as their main military battle rifle and is known as The Right Arm of the Free World for a reason! If you wish to buy it instead i'll need what the AUG A3's / PS90 / MSAR's / FS2000's are going for. It does me no good to sell it outright and not be able to pick up an AUG. I have a video of my FAL being shot so that you can see it in action! Thanks for looking!"

This is a complete kit. One pistol, 3 mags (only comes from the store with 1, we bought 2 more at $50/ea and they're damned near unobtanium right now), documentation, and an action lock. The pistol is cosmetically excellent but the inside of the slide has some light colored areas where the anodizing is wearing some. Round count is about 1200, which for a .22 is roughly like saying ""one weekend of playing around"". Feed it CCI MiniMags and it runs perfectly. Feed it dirty, sticky Walmart ammo and it'll have a failure to eject about once every 50 rounds. Always clears perfectly with a single rack of the slide. Hey, it's made by Walther, and we all know they're picky about ammo. 

I love my centerfire M&Ps and this was supposed to be my cheap practice gun. For whatever reason, I failed to bond with this gun. I can't say there's anything wrong with it, I just don't love it so it has to go.

We've got $500 in the gun and the mags, so I'd like to get $375 out of it since you won't have to pay tax or transfer on it."

Specifications Length 8.70 inches Width 1.66 inches Weight Empty 6.4 ounces Weight Loaded 2.02 pounds Description MAG5-60 The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.
