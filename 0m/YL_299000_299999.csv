The gun is in excellent shape having been fired only a little. I'd grade the finish at 99% overall without any rust, pitting, peeling or cloudiness. The mechanics are in excellent shape with good timing and lock-up. The bore is new. The high quality holster and belt were made by R.M. Bachman of Old West Reproductions. The holster is a copy of the vintage holster appearing on the cover of ""Packing Iron - Gunleather of the Frontier West"", and is fully lined. The belt is extra wide for comfort, features 32 cartridge loops, and is marked for a 45"" waist.The gun and holster make a very nice package indeed!"

Has had less than 1 box of shells put thru it, and I am the only one who’s ever shot it. It shot well, no jambs and no misfires.

Action is smooth and it has the Lyman receiver sight and upgraded front sight.  This was a Camp Perry gun (according to the old timer I got it from)  All I know is it shoot really well.  I am clearing out some guns I don't shoot anymore to fund a new project.  There are two scratches on the stock (see picture) and couple of small rust spots on the underside of the barrel.   I have just kept them oiled and left them alone because the bluing on the rest of the gun is so nice I didn't want to screw it up.    SN is 1510839 and from the way it shoots it could be a match rifle.  I know some of these are worth a tidy sum but have no way to know if this is one of those or not.  I have been tempted on several occasions to just to tap the receiver and scope it but couldn't bring myself to do it.

This is a Henry US survival Rifle. the whole thing comes apart and can be stored in the butt stock. from closed up to firing can be done in only about 30 seconds.  Another cool feature about this gun is that it FLOATS, that's right it floats. with everything in the butt stock or fully put together you can drop it in the water and it will bob up and down like a buoy. It is in average condition and still works as it should.
I bought this for taking out on my boat but no longer need it.
Would be a great SHTF type bug-out gun or for hiking and camping because it is so light weight and can be packed up so small.
The reason Im selling is because times have gotten tough and the toys are the first things to go.
This is also a Great conversation piece too, everyone whats to check it out.

Midwest said that the blanks were left over from the Winchester factory in New Haven, Connecticut when it closed several years ago. These stock blanks are dry and ready for machining. The darkening that you see on each end of the stock blank is wax that was applied at the factory to prevent the end grain from overly drying.  Waxing is very commonly used to protect high-quality stock blanks.  These blanks are in excellent condition and have no spits or cracks. They are great for many woodworking projects as well as for fabricating your own gunstock. They measure approximately 15 3/4""x 5 5/8""x 2 1/2"". Price is $25.00 dollars for all five blanks.

I'm thinning the herd and selling a nice H&R Carbine Classic chambered in .45 Colt, HX prefix serial number.  Features include 20"" blued barrel, case colored receiver, and checkered walnut stocks with nice figure.  I bought the gun new and added a Williams FP-H&R-TK peep sight with target knobs.  In that time I've only taken it to the range twice and shot about 70-80 rounds of mild reloads using lead bullets and Unique powder.  The gun rates 97% with only the lightest signs of use, I'm pretty sure I have the box and paperwork as well.  The sight alone retails for nearly $90 but I'll sell the entire outfit for $400 FTF or $425 shipped to your FFL.  Not interesting in parting it out or trades at this time.  I commute to Lexington daily so can meet there during the week for a FTF.  This gun is listed elsewhere so for fastest response, email me at overunderhunter at yahoo dot com."

It has black rubber synthetic and has a 6-shot cylinder.  Excellent condition and it would be a great addition to your Ruger collection or as a regular shooter (great simple home defense firearm also).  

Ruger revolvers have a reputation for lasting forever.  Bore is bright and shiny and cylinder locks up very tightly.  Accuracy is excellent.  It is always cleaned after each trip to the range - very well cared for.  Included are 40 rounds of Ultramax ammo and about 100 empty shell casings (in case you reload your own .38 special ammo).

I am asking $290 FIRM (cash only please).  I am selling because I am reducing my firearm collection and this needs to go to a good home.

About 100 rounds through it. I took the Bolt hold-open out and replaced the modified hammer with a regular Tapco G2. I'll include the modified hammer and bolt hold-open if you want to install it though. Mag latch has been filed down so that it can accept any standard AK-47 magazine. Mags lock up real nice and tight. Tapco SAW pistol grip and Arsenal polymer NATO-length stock.

I aquired this rifle on a trade and it had been modified by a few individuals before I aquired it.  This is for shooting and thats about it.  I don't expect it would have much value as a vintage WWII rifle.  If you want to take it hog hunting great, use the action for a rebarrel(my orginal plan) great!  to sell on Gun Broker as the ""gun that protected hitler"" not so much. 

So, anyway, The stock has been cut, and the sights removed and the bolt has the handle turned down.  I have full lenth bedded the stock, added a limbsaver to cover the filler that is in the butt of the stock.  Added a Leupold base and rings and zeroed it with your ""run of the mill $80 scopes""  I don't know the brand, it holds zero and was part of another trade, so on it went.  

I have the remainder of a 340 mil-surp box of ammo to go with it.  I would guess it is close to 250 rounds.  It shoots accurate.  In the 10 ring at 100yds until the barrel gets hot and it starts to wander a bit. I would like to get a 22LR pistol to let my boy start shooting it.

It works as a shooter as is great.  The base, rings, and action along with the turned down bolt handle also would be a fair trrade for anyone looking for a mauer based custom."

The ASAP Ambidextrous Sling Attachment Point allows a range of motion greater than 180 degrees, enabling true ambidextrous weapon manipulation for both left and right handed shooters. The ASAP replaces the standard AR15/M16 carbine stock receiver end plate, providing a tactical advantage by minimizing snagging and facilitating easy transition to and from weapon and reaction side shoulders. The ASAP works with Single-Point type slings with snap hook style attachments such as the Magpul MS2 Sling. Made from precision cast black manganese phosphatized steel, the ASAP is compatible with both mil-spec and commercial-spec carbine receiver extensions (buffer tubes). The ASAP has been proven to withstand stress tests of over 300lbs. « less"

LaRue Handguard Rail 9"" LaRue Tactical 9.0"" Handguard LT15-99.0 inch free-floating handguard with LaRue Locking System. Excellent choice for short rifles in the 10""-16"" range. The 9.0's length stops just past a carbine-length gas block, providing true free-float. Larue's two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. LaRue handguards also include integral QD sling-swivel sockets at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, Larue's Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures."
