Model: 05719
Grooves/Twist: 5 RH
Turns: 1 in 18.75 ""

See photos... gun is in very good condition. Crimson trace grips are sighted in. 

Why am I getting rid of it? 
A.) I am a shooter, not a collector. If I find myself not shooting a gun, I trade or sell. I love my automatics and am just not a revolver guy (Did I mention this gun has not been shot a whole lot?)  
B.) I want to raise money for a SOCOM upper** for my AR to hunt with = a great price for the gun. 

Look on Armslist and you will see $550 is a good price even without the CT laser grips which cost $225 new. 

Comes with speed loader, holster, lock (not shown), orig. box and instruction manual. 

The date of manufacture is 05/06/2009 - spent most of its time since then in the box waiting for an owner who will appreciate and use it. 

**If you happen to have a RRA socom upper you want to take this in trade towards with some cash added from my end... I'd be delighted to chat about a deal as long as the value of my revolver is in line with the asking price or reasonable. (i.e. revolver plus a couple hundred depending on condition etc.)

If you are a reasonable, fair and honest person, you need read no further. 

===================================================

When I first came on Armslist I sold a gun or two and bought a couple with no problems. Beginners luck! At that time I would come across ads with fine print like I am about to write and think... ""Wow, what a grumpy attitude.""

Since then I have had my time wasted over and over by people who boldly make offers and as soon as they are accepted disappear or begin modifying them. 

You are free to make whatever offer you feel is fair and we can talk about it. But, as a matter of principle, once I agree to an offer, I will not budge an inch. Period. 

Please don't make an offer you don't have the money to cover. I just don't get it. What is the point?

If you offer a fair price and I accept it, don't just assume I would have taken less.  I don't tend to dicker around a lot. 

Please do your research before making an offer. I am not offended when someone contacts me and says, ""Hey, I can buy this from www.acmeguns.com (or whatever) for $XXX."" Prices vary and recently I found I really was asking too much for a gun given what they currently sell for elsewhere new. I adjusted the price. However, please, please, please make sure the price you quote are for IN STOCK guns. Also make sure you add in transfer, shipping and handling fees if they apply. Anyone can put a cheap price on the tag if they are going to recoup the discount on the way out the door. Just saying... don't get in too big of a rush to say you can get it somewhere else cheaper when you really cannot. 

I prefer FTF deals. I will absorb no part of shipping including my gas. (Plan on adding about $35 to the price)  I will not send until I have money in my hand. No exceptions. If you send a check, it has to clear before I ship. Sorry but that's the deal. 

If you want to offer a trade, send clear pictures of your item(s) to REDACTED  Please understand that my goal in considering a trade will most likely be to obtain something I can get MORE money (MORE than $550) to apply to the purchase of the SOCOM upper.  So don't be offended if I say no to an otherwise ""fair"" trade, okay? (Why else would I go to the trouble of doing a trade for something I have to re-list etc?

BOTTOM-LINE All I hope for is that folks will be fair and act responsibly. I can promise you this, once I say, text or email the word DEAL ... that's it. I was raised that your word is your bond and I have been offered better deals after accepting an offer and it doesn't turn my head. Once I sold a rifle and then discovered the sight on it was worth over half my asking price by itself. I should have done more research ... my bad... out the door it went. Somethings (like your name or character) are more important than money but hey, not all of us were raised the same and I have plenty of faults of my own. 

Thanks for looking and all the best to you."

FOREARM FRONT SLIP SIGHT

Rugged Steel Construction; Deploys Fast For Instant Emergency Use

Heavy-duty, steel construction makes these emergency front flip sights the tactical shooter’s choice for LE and military tasks requiring a compact, backup, sight system of superior strength and dependability. Deploys easily with the flick of your thumb; disengages down, out of your sight path when not in use by depressing the spring-loaded pushbutton. Extra thick, protective ears guard against blows that could potentially bend or break the sight post or aperture. Solid clamp with large crossbolt provides rock solid attachment to Weaver or Picatinny rail systems. Knurled and slotted, quick-release thumbscrew makes sight easy to install/remove. Forearm Front Flip Sight is the shortened version of the Gas Block Front Flip Sight for use on tactical handguards with accessory rails. Provides the proper sight regulation by placing the sight post approximately 1-3/8"" above most forearm rails. All steel construction. Includes standard sight post.

SPECS: Steel, Mil-Spec phosphate coating. 1"" (2.5cm) long, 1½"" (3.8cm) wide, 1½"" high when raised. 2.5 oz. (71 g) wt.

Factory peep sight. Bluing all there but a little faded. Bolt handle chrome mostly there but worn. Excellent grouse rifle or use to teach a new shooter ! Made in the 30's or 40's. I don't know when as they didn't have mandatory serial numbers before 1968. Made when rifles were machined steel and had wood stocks ! Well cared for. Very good condition.

Cons: This rifle while nice is not 100% original. 1. The butt plate is not original. Length of pull may have been shortened a smidge. Doesn't feel shortened, but why else change the butt plate ? 2. Someone evidently machined the barrel down to pencil thin in front of front sight at the muzzle for about 3/4"". Doesn't hurt anything but it looks unusual. I can't figure out why or who but it looks professional. No tool marks, bluing matches perfectly, and excellent crown. 3. Missing front sight hood.

You can see a video of me shooting it (unsupported but still mostly hitting) 100 + yrd 10-inch steel targets @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGRjjrxKbG8&feature=plcp (If Armslist removes the link, just email me and request and I will send it.) I have hit 12"" round target at 200 yards... it is a pretty amazing rifle. 

 The reason I am selling is I have other 7.62x39 launchers and I am raising money to buy a RRA SOCOM 458 upper so trades would have to be for something that I could sell for more money and why would you want to do that? :-)  

I've got this thing priced to sell so no wiggle room on the price. Cash only.

NOW BEFORE CONTACTING ME... PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...

===================================================

When I first came on Armslist I sold a gun or two and bought a couple with no problems. Beginners luck! At that time I would come across ads with fine print like I am about to write and think... ""Wow, what a grumpy attitude.""

Since then I have had my time wasted over and over by people who boldly make offers and as soon as they are accepted disappear or begin modifying them. 

You are free to make whatever offer you feel is fair and we can talk about it. But, as a matter of principle, once I agree to an offer, I will not budge an inch. Period. 

Please don't make an offer you don't have the money to cover. I just don't get it. What is the point?

If you offer a fair price and I accept it, don't just assume I would have taken less. I don't tend to dicker around a lot. 

Please do your research before making an offer. I am not offended when someone contacts me and says, ""Hey, I can buy this from www.acmeguns.com (or whatever) for $XXX."" Prices vary and recently I found I really was asking too much for a gun given what they currently sell for elsewhere new. I adjusted the price. However, please, please, please make sure the price you quote are for IN STOCK guns. Gun dealers can put any crazy price they want on OUT OF STOCK GUNS! Also make sure you add in transfer, shipping and handling fees if they apply. Anyone can put a cheap price on the tag if they are going to recoup the discount on the way out the door. Just saying... don't get in too big of a rush to say you can get it somewhere else cheaper when you really cannot. 

I prefer FTF deals. I will absorb no part of shipping including my gas. (Plan on adding about $35 to the price) I will not send until I have money in my hand. No exceptions. If you send a check, it has to clear before I ship. Sorry but that's the deal. 

If you want to offer a trade, send clear pictures of your item(s) to REDACTED Please understand that my goal in considering a trade will most likely be to obtain something I can get MORE money (MORE than $550) to apply to the purchase of the SOCOM upper. So don't be offended if I say no to an otherwise ""fair"" trade, okay? (Why else would I go to the trouble of doing a trade for something I have to re-list etc?

BOTTOM-LINE All I hope for is that folks will be fair and act responsibly. I can promise you this, once I say, text or email the word DEAL ... that's it. I was raised that your word is your bond and I have been offered better deals after accepting an offer and it doesn't turn my head. Once I sold a rifle and then discovered the sight on it was worth over half my asking price by itself. I should have done more research ... my bad... out the door it went. Somethings (like your name or character) are more important than money but hey, not all of us were raised the same and I have plenty of faults of my own. 

Thanks for looking and all the best to you."

The 6944 is a very unique S&W for certain - only 512 were produced; yes, only 512 in existence. It's built from the 669 and 69xx Series platform. It's intended as a DAO but in reality, it's a 1/2 DAO. The Slide must be racked to half-cock the Hammer and the Trigger will not fully cock or release the Hammer; the Slide must be racked to chamber & fire the first round. It functions as a true Semi-Automatic for subsequent shots. Very unique and rare pistol. You just won't see another in a long, long time.

Finish is 90%, function is perfect, no failures of any kind with more than 300 rounds fired. Chambers the very inexpensive 9mm Makarov round, available even at W#Mart.  About the gun:

It was the military-issued sidearm in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the CZ 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous. The vz. 82 was the first service pistol to feature both these features. The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore. This replaces the traditional lands and grooves rifling design with a rounded, smooth polygonal pattern which has a more ""hills and valleys"" appearance.

I am including the original military leather flap holster, with cleaning rod and lanyard. There is (1) spare magazine in addition to the one in the gun. Both are genuine military issued 12-round magazines.  I am also including one custom made IWB black leather holster, molded to fit the CZ82 and a brown leather belt slide, also molded with a thumbstrap retainer.

Finally, I am includingm more than 630 rounds of assorted factory 9mm Makarov FMJ ammo new in factory boxed.  

The holsters and ammo have a value of $250.

I prefer to sell the package deal, but if you want only the gun, let me know and I can try to work something out.  Located in Spartanburg, not looking for any trades, swaps, or barters.  Email for more pics or questions."

It has the old school look and the center stone or solitare is small at only

Two jewlers that looked at it and said they had nothing of that quaility in their stores said back in the 40's and 50's jewelers had alot better diamonds to choose from. So if your thinking of popping the question and want to do it with style with a old school throwback ring that is beautiful instead of the standard 1 K solitare thats poor quailtity but the jeweler would never tell you that than this is it. I one Karat diamond of this quaility would be a 20,000 dollars stone. Please call or text Bill at REDACTED

With ability to rapidly change calibers, barrel lengths and stock
configurations, the Bushmaster ACR adapts to varied conditions like no
rifle that has come before it. In minutes, without tools, it will go from
5.56mm to 6.8mm to 6.5mm by swapping the bolt head, barrel and magazine.
With an exchange of stocks, barrels and accessories, it transforms from a
close quarters weapon to a designated marksman platform. Simply put, the
Bushmaster ACR is the highest evolution of modular rifle utility. This
rifle is built specifically for law enforcement and tactical applications -
with Bushmaster's unrivaled standards for durability and precision. They've
nearly doubled barrel life and reduced maintenance with the addition of an
innovative protective coating. This is also featured on action components
for dramatically reduced wear and enhanced operation. For the ultimate
blend of strength and reduced weight, they used rugged, high density
composite for the hand guard, lower receiver and stock. The heart of the
ACR is their gas piston operating system. It's torture tested and proven
reliable in the most brutal conditions on the planet. From the magazine
release and fire selector to the non reciprocating charging handle,
ambidextrous controls optimize user effectiveness. Add Bushmaster's
hallmark commitment to quality down to the slightest ingredient, and you
have a platform that's a natural fit for any operator and every mission.

 Bought a full sized duty spec gun and can't really afford to keep the Glock as well.
The only flaw of any kind on the gun is a small amount of the black finish has been rubbed off of the edge of the aftermarket extended slide release due to almost daily holstered carry. Other than that the gun is as new.

NOTE: Aimpoint not included in this auction!  (I might sell it additionally, haven't decided yet.)  

Smith Enterprise installed: quick bolt release ($60), over receiver optics rail ($275), Vortex flash suppressor ($60), Gas port HK style front sight ($75), etc.

USGI op-rod

All bolt internals replaced with USGI components ($90), as per US Army field manual recommendation (Springfield's commercial bolts have had horrible internals for over 20 years. I've personally had one fall apart on me during use due to insufficient spring tension)

USGI fiberglass stock w/ metal flip-up butt plate and internal cleaning kit storage area

K-something polymer cheek-piece ($60) - I tried about a half dozen different stock configurations, including wood, the SAGE-EBR system(too heavy), and several cheek pieces on the USGI stock.  I like this one the best.  It's rock solid and doesn't move around, is field adjustable, and comfortable enough to not be annoying.  I tossed the springfield stock and went with the USGI fiberglass.  It's light, durable, and doesn't expand with moisture. Not very pretty, though -- plain brown.  I keep meaning to dura-coat it, but haven't gotten around to it.  

Spec-Ops quick-slide 3-point sling ($35).  I've tried 4 different slings, and bounce back and forth between this one, and the thick M-249 2-pt sling.  This one is decent, better than most for left/right transitioning.  Better if it had a quick-release.

Rifle shoots great, better than the south african ball that's all I can afford these days. [sigh]  Regrettably, I need something I can teach the kids to shoot without breaking the bank.  Just can't afford this girl any more.  She comes with 3 USGI 20 rd. mags with Magpul grip loops.  I have some USGI contract 25 rd. mags, but they seemed kind of finicky, so I put them in a box somewhere.  If you want them, I'll rummage around and see if I can find them, but I don't trust them.

They took some of the better features of the larger FNP-45, such as a larger safety/decocker, larger mag-release, and a handful of other internal changes to the older fnp, and called it the fnx.  The mags are, regrettably, not interchangable.  

14+1 capacity, I have 3 mags.  FN has not gotten around to putting Tritium in their sights yet, and no-one makes a tritium night sight for these things yet.  The best I could do is one of the multi-layer light retaining compounds like HK is using.  Not as nice as tritium, but a lot better than the old phospho stuff from the 90's. 

She's in perfect condition, had maybe 200 rounds put through her.  A bit large and hard to carry, though.   Includes a Crossbreed Supertuck IWB holster ($135), and 43 rds. of .40.  I'm a little guy, and while I can conceal it fairly well with the Crossbreed, it gets a bit uncomfortable after about 6 hrs.  

Trigger is better than the HK, maybe not quite as smooth as a good sig P229, but close.  DA/SA with a positive safety/decocker, like the HK type 1 trigger group.  I've never had it jam on me, but an inexperienced friend had consistent problems, so I suspect it's susceptible to limp-wristing.  We would hand it back and forth, without a mag change.  It would jam with him, but never on me, so that's the only thing that makes sense.  All things considered, I trust it myself at the moment, but not to give to my wife."

This gun is a powerful tack driver/very accurate with its heavy bull barrel and will drop a deer off its feet no problem with the 243 Winchester round. Condition of the gun is very nice and clean almost like new still. Bluing and wood look excellent. Has the laminated stock. Gun is cleaned inside and out ready to be used. Only used a few times. I cannot use a rifle where i go hunting-Only shotguns so here it is for sale. Ideal for a smaller person or a younger hunter. Excellent choice for a deer rifle. This is not the youth model-The youth model stock is a little shorter.

I have lowered the price on this gun more than a couple times and $175.00 is the absolute lowest i will go. I have twice that into this gun.

The scope in the photo is a Bushnell but is a banner model that i put on another gun after the photos. I have since put on the Bushnell Sportview scope and that is what is included but i did not retake the photos but i have compensated this on the price.

Priced to move-Price is $175.00 firm 

If you see this ad then it is still for sale. Thanks.
