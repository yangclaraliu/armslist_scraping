This Is the original Desert Eagle in .357 before the 50AE  version ever existed. Yes its not nearly as powerful as the 44 or 50, but have you priced a box of 50 compared to 357? what im trying to say is that this is much more pleasurable and cheaper to shoot.....and no it doesn't shoot 38 special if that's what you were thinking. This thing is in almost 100 percent condition, and functions flawlessly....its been a safe queen. I just put 20rds down the tube last weak to make sure its all good....it is. And i cleaned it, I'll show you how to take it down if your interested. 

Anyway it will come with two 9rd magazines, that's all.....I don't have the box. Shoulda held on to that...oh well. Hindsight is 20/20. I'm Mainly looking for high-end 1911's, and custom or collectable firearms. I have a weakness for S&W performance shop firearms. 45acp is king in my book.

I'm only interested in selling it if you want to pay the Blue book price.....even then i'm much more interested in a trade. I'll trade down in price ( for the right gun) if you make up the difference."

225,http://www.armslist.com/posts/425225,For Sale/Trade:  1959 Winchester Model 12; Price Reduced for Quick Sale!,"Hamburg, Buffalo, New York",$ 275,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 4, 2012",Shotguns,Winchester                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"If you've always wanted to own an American classic pumpgun--and a Winchester at that--here's your chance.

And since I've dropped the price to $275, this is a rare opportunity to do so without busting the bank. Try finding ANY American-made pumpgun with real walnut stocks, polished and blued steel throughout, and no plastic internal parts for anywhere near $275.

This Model 12 is a field grade 12 gauge with a 2.75-inch chamber and 28-inch modified barrel. Serial number dates it to 1959, the pinnacle of Winchester's production in New Haven for the Model 12. Everyone knows what happened to Winchester quality after 1964, and this gun stands as a testimonial to the last of their great guns from the good old days. Sadly, they don't make them like this anymore.

Please see my photos below. I'd be happy to send additional photos, too, if you specify exactly what you'd like to see.

All numbers match on the gun, it is 100% original, with no modifications or alterations, and it cycles and shoots fine. The action racks straight and smoothly, with no binding or play, although it could probably benefit from a  thorough breakdown and cleaning. The wood is tight, straight-grained black walnut and is free of any cracks or substantial wear and shows only a few minor scratches and dings from field use and some loss of finish on the grip and near the black plastic Winchester buttplate. 

The bluing is in good shape throughout the gun, except for the left side of the receiver and the left breech end of the barrel, which have a few areas of shallow pitting where some surface rust was removed--and a good bit of the bluing--on the left side of the receiver. Likewise, there is a narrow line of shallow pitting on the left side of the chamber and extending up about 8 inches into the barrel. I suspect the gun may have been put up at one time on its left side while it was still damp, and moisture caused the rust on both these left-side exterior and interior surfaces.

But these are purely cosmetic flaws. This is still a perfectly functioning Model 12, ready for any use you have for it. Given its blems, it would be a great Model 12 to shoot when you don’t want to worry about exposing a prettier gun to rough conditions or weather. It cycles perfectly and has that unmistakable heft and balance that made the Model 12 THE legendary American pumpgun. If you've ever shouldered and swung a Model 12, you know exactly what I mean.

This gun would make an excellent pheasant gun or even a good duck gun for jump shooting or hunting close over decoys. It would also be a good candidate to have its barrel cut down and serve as a home defense gun. The Model 12 got its start as the original trench gun in WW I, and this one could certainly fill that role again with the right barrel length. Or, of course, with a honing of the barrel and a rebluing, it could be restored to factory-original condition. Or you could even swap out the barrel completely, as vintage Model 12 barrels with mirror bores are plentiful and cheap on Ebay. 

But I’ll leave that choice up to the new owner. I’m offering the gun for $275 cash or trade value--especially toward a vintage side-by-side double in 16 or 20 or a bolt-action centerfire in a deer caliber. I might be open to other guns in trade; just let me know what you’ve got, and I’ll let you know whether I’m interested. But if I’m not, remember, cash always talks.

Gun is located in Hamburg, New York, 20 minutes south of Buffalo and off the NYS Thruway. Please reply to this posting with any questions or to arrange a time to see it.

Thanks for looking."

Because of some of the emails that I have been getting I guess I need to also put in that this is not an Italian reproduction but a real Hatfield made in America. That is why I have started the price where it is. I appreciate your offers but try to make them somewhat reasonable. I am flexible with the price but not by a few hundred dollars.

Glock 19 FDE (Flat Dark Earth) with ""born on date"" of 3/3/2012 from the Glock Factory. I purchased in April and took to the range only a couple times. Less than 300 rounds down the pipe. It is in FLAWLESS working and cosmetic condition. It has Talon grips on it as pictured but these can be removed easily and leave no residue on this mint gun.

This gun includes 5 15rd magazines and 1 33rd magazine (all factory glock mags, all mint condition), factory box, paperwork, lock, rod+brush, everything that comes with a brand new glock.

I am mostly looking for a trade with an AR-15, 1911, shotgun, revolver, just something else to play with. I can add cash (or you add cash) dependent on the deal. 

I am in no rush to sell and will not respond to low-ball offers. 

I am located in Charlotte and buyer will need to provide proper paperwork/documentation to complete a legal sale/trade at an FFL.

Glock 19 FDE (Flat Dark Earth) with ""born on date"" of 3/3/2012 from the Glock Factory. I purchased in April and took to the range only a couple times. Less than 300 rounds down the pipe. It is in FLAWLESS working and cosmetic condition. It has Talon grips on it as pictured but these can be removed easily and leave no residue on this mint gun.

This gun includes 5 15rd magazines and 1 33rd magazine (all factory glock mags, all mint condition), factory box, paperwork, lock, rod+brush, everything that comes with a brand new glock.

I am mostly looking for a trade with an AR-15, 1911, shotgun, revolver, just something else to play with. I can add cash (or you add cash) dependent on the deal. 

I am in no rush to sell and will not respond to low-ball offers. 

I am located in Charlotte and buyer will need to provide proper paperwork/documentation to complete a legal sale/trade at an FFL.

“Why yes, that’s really five shots.” Tell your friends it’s genetics. Fact is, when it comes to precision, there’s no finer pedigree in the industry than Remington® varmint rifles. And with the introduction of our new Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint, staking claim to our legendary accuracy is a more attainable feat than ever.

Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

KEY FEATURES:

Newly designed SPS Varmint stock with vented beavertail fore-end
Sling swivel studs included
26"" heavy-contour barrel (0.820"" muzzle O.D.)

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its dark earth Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

It is chambered for the .380ACP cartridge.  It looks like a scaled down version of the full size Beretta 92 used by our military and many police departments.  The entire top of the action opens up when the slide is pulled back, just like the Mod 92.  This makes jamming very unlikely.
   This Beretta pistol is in like new (collectable) condition and comes with the original box, two sets of original Beretta grips (black plastic and walnut w/ checkering), and two magazines.
   This would be a perfect home/self defense gun, especially for your wife, daughter, or girlfriend.  She'll love you for getting her such a stunning beauty... and for wanting to keep her safe.
Small enough for CCW... yet large enough to easily control and shoot accurately under stress.  Face to face only.

I've got 3 Mosin rifles for sale complete with accessories (bayonet, sling, 2 ammo pouches, and cleaning/accessory kit) that each have their own box that they shipped to me in as well. These are very nice rifles compared to what I've seen in the local shops around here plus it's about the same price you'd get at a discount online place only you get to see it first. The bores on all of these are sharp but will need cleaning as they come with free cosmoline.

Details on the various rifles:

1. 1943 - This is most definitely a war time stock. Deep dark colored shellac with the usual slight flaking and wear you'd expect on the war time stocks. No refurb mark on the stock at all. Has an unusually beefy looking trigger and a few faint stock cartouches still intact. Kinda my favorite of the bunch because it has the ""been there"" look on the stock but the metal is in excellent shape.

2. 1942 #1 - Also a war time stock but much lighter finish and none of the war time flakiness in the shellac. This one has a few stock repairs. Lots of various stamps on the stock along the hand grips and a light circular cartouche on the butt.

3. 1942 #2 - This one wears a refurb stock with the [/] mark on it. Still has the protective tape soaked in cosmoline on the hand guard from the refurb process. Couple of numbers stamped on the stock on this one.

Hard to beat the Mosin for a fun to shoot and affordable rifle. With surplus ammunition it is by far the least expensive big caliber to take out to the range.  If you have any questions please let me know... I am a C&R license holder so I will need to get your info for my log book and prefer to have a bill of sale for us both."

This is the good deal   take a look around! I'm losing on this, my loss is your gain!

Back Story: This was my first real guitar that I bought in HS I saved up all summer  (7 bucks an hour).  I sang a lot of Lullabies, and got many a lady with this guitar. It's filled with good energy. That being said,I don't play anymore it's been sitting at my parents house for years collecting dust. The guitar has no major issues minor ding and by minor i mean MINOR and the case is the same. Come by and play if you want.  The pick up sound great as well as the amp. I'm really sad to be losing my first guitar. The reason I am selling is because my car broke down and the repair rather expensive. That's what I get for buying a Saab... Saab story.  


Thanks and have a nice day!

Yes its not nearly as powerful as the 44 or 50, but have you priced a box of 50 compared to 357? what im trying to say is that this is much more pleasurable and cheaper to shoot.....and no it doesn't shoot 38 special if that's what you were thinking. This thing is in almost 100 percent condition, and functions flawlessly....its been a safe queen. I just put 20rds down the tube last weak to make sure its all good....it is. And i cleaned it, I'll show you how to take it down if your interested. 

Anyway it will come with two 9rd magazines, that's all.....I don't have the box. Shoulda held on to that...oh well. Hindsight is 20/20. I'm Mainly looking for high-end 1911's, and custom or collectable firearms. I have a weakness for S&W performance shop firearms. 45acp is king in my book. I'm also on the prowl for a nice UZI, preferably IMI. I may be able to scrounge up some cash for the right trade. Let me know what you have...Mutigun trades are welcome. I'm only interested in selling it if you want to pay the Blue book price.....even then i'm much more interested in a trade. I'll trade down in price ( for the right gun) if you make up the difference."
