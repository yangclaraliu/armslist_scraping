Got it new, shot it once before the conversion, and twice after.
No issues at all, all mags, even the 20rd drum have cycled perfectly for me. It has the Gogun Twisterpuc (medium) installed to help cycle anything including Walmart target ammo.
I did the conversion, and think I did a pretty good job, it was not my first.
All the furniture is Tapco in green except the forward grip, it is black. The trigger group is also tapco, but has the Tromix conversion done.
The trigger guard and zombie killing muzzle thing are both from Mississippi Auto Arms, I don't know what brand. I didn't like the weird looking Tromix guard so went with one that looked more like an AK. I re-installed the bolt hold open device, a lot of people don't because it is a bitch to put back in. The empty rivet holes were filled with metal rivets, not the plastic ones. The paint job looks 100%. I used a flat black engine paint that is durable, and easily re-paintable. I can let you know what kind if you buy it, it's in my garage. I know it sounds cheap, but it works great. A lot of the conversion forums speak very highly of it.
Comes with the original furniture, 5 SGM (Surefire) 12rd mags (4 still in packaging, promag 20rd drum, and original 5rd factory mag.
Asking 1500obo.
Not really sure where to price this. I am seeing new ones unconverted at 900. It has 350 worth of mags, and all the conversion stuff cost around 250-300. I think 1500 is about right. Cash only I am buying a Desert Eagle from another forum member and need every bit of it."

250 OBO Used Hi-point 995TS Carbine 9mm. Has 1-10 round mag, red-dot sight and the old (ugly) stock. Rifle is good shape other than a little cosmetic stuff, shoots great, never a jam with 115 grain FMJ rounds, shoot all day for cheap and these guns are a lot of fun for plinking, more so than any .22 IMHO. 

I called a few shops, seems these things sell locally for around 350+ new. I'm in no hurry to sell so don't waste my/your time with low balls and I won't travel to Ohio to deliver. I may consider trade for a high capicity 9mm pistol or a pocket sized .380, but I'd rather just sell.

The M202 is the bull barreled ""duty model"" that is used by security forces in the Philippines.  The design is that of the Colt Police Positive which was used by police departments in America for over 40 years.  It's a decent gun, looks good, and accuracy is great.  I also have a like new Uncle Mikes Super Belt Slide Law Enforcement holster that will be included.   The picture is a stock photo of what it looks like, but is not the actual gun.

Burns/Cuts/Melts,"South OK, Oklahoma, United States",$ 700,"Listed On: Saturday, May 21, 2011",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a brand new Wicked Lasers Spyder III Arctic 1 watt blue laser. Right off the bat, I'll tell you that you can go on to Wicked Laser's website right now and order this very laser for $299.99. However, I won't take anything close to that. The FDA (yes FDA) has put an import ban on any handheld laser above 5mw. This particular laser is 200x more powerful then what current import allows. Actually getting your hands on one of these is VERY diffcult. I'm a GM for UPS and even with my connections in customs, it still took me 6 1/2 months to get a hold of mine. From what I'm told 85% of these are seized.

However, once you DO have one, they are pretty incredible. It will burn or melt most things dark colored. You can cut through plastics, light cigs, pop ballons, start fires, etc. The beam is so powerful that if you pointed it straight up in the air, no only can you see the beam the entire way up, but the only reason it doesn't hit outter space is because our inner atmosphere diffuses the beam. If you were at sea, and pointed the beam straight out infront of you, the only reason you aren't able to see it past a certain point is because of the curvature of the Earth.

I understand this isn't what you typically see, so if you have any questions feel free to ask."

In response to the need for smaller and lighter tactical sights, Aimpoint is proud to introduce the new Micro T-1 electronic red-dot sight. Built to offer the same battleproven ruggedness as larger Aimpoint sights, the Micro T-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon.

This new compact sight is suitable for use on rifles, carbines, shotguns, submachineguns and handguns. The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics. The Micro T-1 weighs in at only 3.6 ounces, and comes complete with a patent-pending integral Picatinny mount that is keyed into the sight body to absorb recoil.

The Micro T-1 is a 1X (non magnifying) parallax-free optic that features a 4 minute of angle (MOA) red dot for fast target acquisition. No tools are required to zero the sight, as the top of the caps covering the windage and elevation screws fit directly into holes on the adjustment screws to make the adjustment. The Micro T-1 is waterproof to 25 meters (80 feet) and tough enough to stand up to the worst field conditions. Optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, the Micro T-1 features a manual adjustment switch with 6 night vision compatible settings and 7 daylight settings (including one extra bright setting for use in desert sunlight or with laser protection filters). Aimpoint s state-of-the-art ACET diode technology allows the Micro T-1 to operate continuously for over 5 years on a single CR-2032 battery.

It’s in very good condition – both barrels are clean with shiny bores and the receiver/magazine tube has been professionally duracoated in “tactical-black”. The set includes:

Hogue full length stock
 Hogue tamer pistol grip
 GG&G single point sling mount
 Magpul MS2 sling
 * Note, I’ve only used the single point sling with the full stock. I have the pistol grip configured with a standard sling (also included).
 18.5 in barrel
 28in barrel (can accept chokes – comes with imp.cyl). This is the new ported model, purchased this yaer.
 TacStar side saddle
 Laserlyte tri-mount rail installed on the magazine tube

The tamer grip works well and is much better than the factory pistol grip for shooting heavy loads. The Hogue stock fixes the oddly long standard Mossberg LOP and puts it at around 13in. The bolt is clean and this model has the honeycomb slide, which is very solid. I’ll toss everything in a browning black+tan soft 52in case. 

Trades? Possibly a very clean or new ruger 10/22. Other than that I am just looking to reduce clutter in my safe. I already have a go-to boomstick and this one usually just sits there looking pretty. Also, I’m not really into clay sports anymore. 

Price is $300 - I’ll drive 45min from Buffalo to trade or sell. Nothing out of state please."

There was the first private owner before the pawn shop owned it and he bought it for big game and immediately changed his mind for a bigger gun and sold this to Owasso pawn. I took my time and inspected it before I bought it and it appeared like it hadn't ever been touched before. I've personally shot 1 box of shells through it to sight it in. Other than that I've never hunted with it or used it at all. It's in spectacular brand new shape but I just don't have a need for it.

The barrel is topped by a Rock River muzzle break and surrounded by 13 aluminum Troy free floating rail. It's also got a Stag Arms bolt carrier group with enhanced bolt.  I was originally built this as a varmint rifle but I've decided to use a different platform for that purpose. I'll take $775 for the rifle, or you can make a SERIOUS offer.  Look, there's $700 worth of stuff, just in the upper, so don't offer me $500 and think it's a serious offer, it's already a heck of a steal at $775!

716,http://www.armslist.com/posts/139716,For Sale:  New Slide fire / bump fire AR-15 stock,"Green Bay, Wisconsin, Ohio, United States",$ 349,"Listed On: Sunday, May 22, 2011",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Shoot faster than you ever thought possible! ATF approved and legal! Must see the amazing video of how this product works to believe it. Designed for use with your AR-15 rifle with collapsing buttstock. A conversion kit is available for solid/fixed stocks.

The Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to Slide Fire more safely - offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere!

Please note this is a bump fire device that significantly increases your trigger pull speed, but does not convert your gun into a machine gun. Folks these really work well and are not a gimmick and we have tons of happy customers some buying  several units for their collection of  AR15 rifles.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire - this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them.  Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly hold the firearm.  In addition, as a result of the shooter having to push forward to discharge each round, they are able to correct their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward in an unsafe direction.

In principal the SSAR-15 functions very similar to the Gatlin or crank style firearms.  When operating a firearm that uses a crank - the operator's arm moves in continous motion.  The operator moves the crank clockwise and a round is fired.   The operator continues to move the crank forward to discharge another round, and so on....  With the SSAR-15; the operator moves the upper assembly forward to discharge a round.  To discharge the next round the operator must again move the upper assembly forward.  Just like when using the Gatlin systems; a semi-auto firearm equipped with the SSAR-15 will never fire automatically.

The SSAR-15 is designed for use on all AR-15 .223/5.56 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube.  There are no permanent modifications or gunsmith required to install the SSAR-15. 

By removing the factory pistol grip and replacing it with the provided Interface Block - the SSAR-15 simply slides onto the buffer tube; replacing the factory adjustable stock.  All tools required to install the SSAR-15 are provided.

Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, BATFE Approval Letter, and Installation / Operation Instructions. The unit is for right handed use only .

Free shipping! No Credit Card fee charges!!

Sorry no shipments to California at this time due to state regulations.

The stock function with calibers other than 556 Nato/.223 but will not function with .22LR.

This stipple job was done right and follows the factory grip pattern. For those not familiar with this type of custom work, it's like putting skate board tape or grip tape on your gun except it never peels or wears out. It also insures you retain positive control of your weapon no matter what. You can literally coat your hand in oil and still get a good grip on this pistol. 

Pistol comes with everything shown and functions flawlessly. I got it on another trade, have played with it and now want something different. It chewed through 100 rounds of 9mm with zero failures or issues and would make a great carry conceal gun as it has no magazine safety( means you can fire it without the mag in)has a second strike trigger, and skinny profile, with good sights( rear are adjustable) for such a small pistol.
I had this pistol listed for 375. BUT the market has spoken and it is apparently not worth that as I still have it.. so don't hesitate to make an offer. I am not going to give it away, but will entertain all offers. Will be more open to a trade than cash.."

The Modelo 1895 represents a transitional period in cavalry sword design where the curved slashing swords of the Napoleonic period moved towards a straight lance like blade. Its grip, shaped to the human hand was a unique innovation for its time. The Modelo 1895 retains a slight curve while it has been lengthened from previous models. 

This sword has a lovely patina, intact wooden grips, and a bright sheath.  Sheath has dings, which is normal for this type of construction and consistent with age. Sword has light pitting, and has been coated with Renaissance Wax.  Sword serial number is 31095.

It also comes with a factory hardshell carrying case, A two sided ammo/earplug carrying cup, Plus it has all of the factory paper work and maintenance safety manual, Including the factory warranty cards that are blank and have never been registered...

This is the harder to come by 9mm version of this pistol, That is more accurate and more controllerable than the 40S&W models which can be found every where, I also find that the 9mm models seem to cost a little more than the 40 calibur ones do, This is proablly because they are more desirable with less felt recoil and better accuracy then its bigger calibur brother, And proablly because they are also harder to come by then the forty cals are, As I paid $589.95 plus ( Tax, Title, Out the door ) for it new, For a total investment of just over $625 dollars, So please don't try and lowball me...

For a compact pistol this baby is surprisingly accurate and hides out really good, And can be use as a single action pistol as well as a double action pistol, And with the use of a factory magazine spacer sleeve, A full size Beretta 92fs hi-cap magazine can be used in it..."

These pistols were built at the Brigade, Division and above levels.
 This is a brand new very late 1945 made Remington Rand.It still retains  99% of the original finish. This is made clear by the burnishing marks still visable when the serial number, and the ord wheel were stamped after the parkerizing was applied. ( This may be the only GI pistol that I have seen where you can see the entire Ord wheel ) The slide has zero side to side play. There is no play of the barrel inside the bushing, and the bushing requires a bushing wrench to remove it from the slide. All of these add up to a VERY consistent shot to shot performance.
 The trigger breaks at 3 1/2 pounds like a glass rod....crisp. Original trigger has been adusted for zero over travel, using a set screw tapped into thr trigger.
 The hood of the original High Standard barrel has been fitted to the slide and has zero downward travel. The barrel has been throated and polished ( as well as the feed ramp ) to accept semi wadcutters, as well as round nose cartridges. The front strap has been stippled in the typical Military fashion, for a better shot to shot grip.
 Air Force style front sight and Triangle adjustable on the rear.
 This pistol would cost over two thousand dollars to build today, plus it is a piece of WWII history to boot... You will not buy a more accurate pistol . There is nothing left to do except shoot it..!!
 FFL required outside of Oklahoma. ( OK drivers lisc. required ), CCR ok too. No shipments to Cal.  $35 Priority mail from my FFL to out of state buyers."

I prefer a P2000SK but would settle for a P2000 or even a USP compact. I would also enjoy a Glock 36 but if you have any other sub compact Glock let me know what you have. I would absolutely love to get my hands on a two toned OD green Glock so if you have one that you're getting rid of, that would have priority over other glocks even if it's not a .45 like the Glock 36. I had an OD Glock 19 once and I miss it. I have a full sized HK USP .45 that has a little wear on the blueing but is worth over $700 as I have been told by my local gun shop and I have been offered $700 a few months ago, but that was before I had a CCW in mind. If you have a P2000SK or P2000 and would like to trade I would still give you a decent amount of cash. Say, my USP + $300 for a decent P2000SK. If it's a Glock it would have to be a straight trade even if the Glock has night sights or what ever you throw in. I may need some cash from you as well if the Glock is not a NIB weapon and has no accessories or anything to match my HK's value. It depends. Email for pics and also please send pics of your weapon. As I said before I won't be home until August but we can make the deal when I'm home (if you're not in a hurry to sell or trade the gun) or we can work something out sooner, if you really need cash. Email me for details if you're interested. Thank you for your time. God bless"
