Bought it very recently. Wanted it as a hunting rifle. After much debate I think it's a great rifle but not my cup of tea. I paid $1390 for it plus $50 shipping so I'm selling it for $1440 which is exactly what I've invested - and I'll gladly prove that to you. Please do not ask me what my bottom dollar is or if I'll take blah for it.

An FFL will need to be involved in the transaction even if you are local. I will pay for the FFL. Any shipping will need to be on your dime.


FAQ: Why do you need to go through an FFL, that's stupid, you suck, etc.

Answer: I want to go through an FFL so that the transaction is properly recorded and a background check takes place. I try to do the things that I think everyone ought to do and if every gun exchange involved a background check then I believe the country would be better off. I've gotten countless angry and even hateful emails just because I want to go through an FFL so before you send yours please think about what a fine world we would live in if every action from every person passed the same simple test: ""what if everyone did that""?"

A VERY DESIRABLE AND COLLECTIBLE MANDOLIN . . .

EARLY 1970s ALVAREZ
 F-STYLE MANDOLIN
 IN EXCELLENT CONDITION

Here is a beautiful Alvarez F-5 style mandolin from the early 1970. There isn't a lot of information available on these models, but they have grown in popularity due to their elaborate ornamentation and generally nice playability.
 This one features a gorgeous sunburst finish, a two-point body with a solid spruce top with f-holes and plain-grained maple back, rims and neck.
 The neck is white-bound and topped with a 30-fret rosewood fingerboard with very block abalone inlays. There is also an adjustable rosewood bridge, and the pickguard is bound plastic pearl. The headstock is probably the nicest element of this mandolin, with four-on-a-plate tuners adorned with pearloid buttons, and an abalone vine headstock inlay that really stands out. The tailpiece cover also features an engraved fern and ""Alvarez"" logo.
 Inside the mandolin is an ""ALVAREZ HAND MADE"" hot stamp.
 This particular mandolin was made in Japan.
 Again, for the money you simply can't beat these Alvarez mandolins from the 1970s, and they don't come up for sale very often so grab this one while you still can!"

It has a scope, with scope rings attached. A laser bore sight for .223. (3) .223 five round magazines, and (2) .222 five round magazines.
Also comes with 140 rounds of .222 Remington.
Has a 1:14 twist, which prefers the 55gr loads, and fires milsurp 5.56 well.
Valued around $775.
Only reason I'm wanting to trade is because of the craziness for .223 at this time, and I just picked up another bolt action, so the rifle fills a role I have filled in other ways.
Very little interest in cash, just trades. 


I also have an Mtech crossbow rated at 80 lbs, if I recall. It's all set up, and hardly used. Shoulder injury doesn't allow me to use it anymore. The bolts for it have been lost in a move, so the $100 dollar value is closer to $75.
Not expecting to get much for it, just hoping it can sweeten a trade.

I value my privacy, so if I don't get back to you anytime after 4PM, I'm not interested in your trade. I just don't want to send my email out to people I don't want to do business with.

It also has dual hammers. Everything functions, from what I can see but I would not recommend firing it because of the age.

There is not a lot of information on the gun using the internet - only single barrel shotguns show up in most searches. Either the gun is extremely rare or some other markings have been worn off. What I did find:

""The Columbia double barrel shotgun was made by Simonis, Janssen & Dumoulin who were Belgium gun makers from 1884 to 1905 were sold by Henry C. Squires.""

I can not attest to the accuracy of this though. There have been several Columbia named firearms companies over the last 150 years.

Overall I would say the shotgun is in pretty good condition considering its' age.

This would make a perfect mantel piece. Feel free to send me an offer. If you are a collector and have some information on this gun to share it would be most appreciated.

First is a Hanover Arms Company side by side 12 gauge shotgun. $85.00 o.b.o.

Exposed ""rabbit ears"" hammers and double triggers. It was made between 1890 and 1920 in Belgium. It has 30"" barrels and locks up tightly. Some pitting in the bore. The forearm is solid and also snaps in place firmly. It has a metal buttplate on the stock. The stock has a deep rich patina. There is a sliver of wood missing from the insetting of the right hammer group but it is not a functional problem. I have shot the gun. 95

Second is a Hartford Fire Arms Co. side by side 12 gauge shotgun. $85.00 o.b.o.

Exposed ""rabbit ears"" hammers and double triggers. Lock up is a little loose but I have shot it and it is still a functional gun. Great inexpensive security piece. With the external hammers you know if the gun is cocked and locked. Looks great on a wall as well. Great piece of history and a great conversation piece. Bore has some pitting as well, wood is heavily patinated and the steel is a little pitted in spots but uniform in color and charachter.

Wall hangers, shooters, future sawed offs or Numrich candidates. Their future is up to you.  Take them both for $150.00 Email me for extra pictures.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers, LOL. Look at my other ads, also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop or professional gunsmith, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Do not ever fire any gun if you have any doubt about it safety, functionality, or ammo/caliber match. Always consult a professional to be better safe than sorry.  Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

Not gas carbine, this is a piston rifle.  What is the difference?  Well, instead of gases pushing the bolt carrier group back, an actual piston does the work, keeping the dirty gases to a minimum in the upper chamber and allowing for a cleaner operating rifle.  I am selling the complete factory package.  This is a must have to any collection and because of RUGER's quality, you can expect this rifle to be the envy of your friends.  Truth be told, next to my Daniel's defense ($2500), this is the finest rifle I have ever purchased.  It is solid, perfect milling/workmanship.  The attention to detail is impressive.  Very solid bolt carrier group and the operation is smooth and solid.  (Nothing less from Ruger!)

This comes with a 12"" free float handguard, adjustable gas block, and is competition ready.  No need to purchase extra parts, barrel nut tools, vise blocks, gas blocks, etc.  Just bolt on your accessories and you have an awesome rifle.  Whether you want to compete in 3-gun, at the range, or on the farm, this rifle is something to consider. Or if you just want to put the fear of death into that boy trying to date your daughter, look no further.

It has all matching numbers, except the magazine and the stock is re-stamped with the matching number.  The upper hand guard is the heat shield variety (Not sure if any of them came that way.  It may have been added by someone).  The wood stock finish appears to have been partially stripped down.  It is not shiny and looks to me like it has been hand sanded as if someone was going to refinish it.  It has a CAI import stamp on the barrel.

The Russian SKS is by far the best one.  They are infinitely superior to the cheap Chinese ones.  The Yugos are ok, but they are too long and do not have chrome lined barrels, so most are worn out.

In today's market $575 is a really good price, so don't bother offering less.   The POS Chinese ones with press-fit barrels are going for that.  I'm not interested in any trades.

This gun is for display purposes only unless you plan on doing a semi auto conversion or have a SOT and a letterhead. It has had the firing pin and open bolt stop removed, so it will not fire in its current state, however, those parts are included because you'll need them to do the semi conversion if you choose to make it a functioning firearm. It will function with the parts reinstalled or by running the action with the charging handle for demo purposes. 

The semi auto conversion tutorial is available on line as well as the semi auto firing pin and FCG. 

This gun was built from an original demilled unfired Polish parts kit and is a Russian design. It can fire manually with the butterfly trigger or also by remote firing solenoid (included). It has the trumpet flash hider and the barrel extension to be fired from an armored vehicle. 

It comes with 250 links and a 25 round display link with fired brass in it. Also, 2 original ammo cans. 

I planned on buying an original tripod and displaying it in the corner of my shop, but plans have changed and floorspace is at a premium. 

As display guns that are completely welded shut and have no internals, these sell for 1600, and as a functioning semi auto they run around 2600-4200(the SGMT and PKT variety bringing the full 4k) depending on the rigging. My loss......

I would love to get my hands on a lever or slide action .22 that can handle the spread: short, Long, and Long Rifle.

I would prefer a beater but a shooter, so to speak. I'm not looking for the prettiest thing. Cracked stock, missing parts, rust, etc can be worked around. It would be great if the muzzle/bore was tight, but bubblegum happens and sometimes people clean them from the wrong end

$300 is about my cap and I can travel +/- a 2 hour radius of Portland/Oregon City, or if it's a takedown shipping would be great, too. Open to trades, but I don't have anything particular in mind to barter with...

I'm open to Winchester, Marlin, Henry, Rossi, etc, prolly others not coming to mind.

Open to advice, too. If there happens to be some elusive pawn shop or small town gunshop somewhere stockpiling these or something, let a guy know!

Also, I'm NOT interested in the shorty ranch hands with the big looped levers. A fine gun, I'm sure, but not interested.

If this finds the right eyes, well thanks in advance.

it does take chokes I BELIEVE, however.. it does not come with any. i looked them up on gunbroker and it seems there is a set or that individual ones run between 30-40$ i also found 1 barrel for this particular gun and they wanted 400$ and also the one gun that was listed on there that was similar to mine was asked of 600$ however the only difference between that one and mine is i would think mine is much nicer due to the fact it has the very beautiful engraved artwork on both sides of the reciever. i am asking only 350$ due to the fact i need the money, you can reach me at 1REDACTED. i belive 350$ is fare price."

 Roughly 500 rounds down the pipe so its just broken in. No issues with function, fit is very nice too. Comes with original box and paperwork, 3- 10 round magazines, and a fobus OWB holster. It also has night sights which are very bright. It does have some minor handling marks and a small idiot mark, I am the second owner and this was on there when I got it. I love the gun and its a lot of fun to shoot but really want to move into a more traditional 1911 in 45 ACP. I do want to stay with the commander size but will consider officer models as well. Trade value is set at $900.00 and I am willing to negotiate with all perspective traders. Please no wheel guns or rifles I am only interested in 1911 handguns. I can add cash for up trades or ammo and will accept cash for down trades.
 Please do not offer any low ball offers, and if your interested in trading then be honest about it. If I agree to meet please stick to your word, if your just thinking about trading the please dont waste my time or yours, wait until your ready to trade to make a offer. I am ready and available within a few hours notice anywhere in Hampton Roads but I do expect the meeting spot to fair to both parties."
