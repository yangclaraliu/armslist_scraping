22,http://www.armslist.com/posts/736022,For Trade:  Collector custom electric guitar Cobra Shelby autographed Jarrett,"Northend.., Colorado Springs, Colorado",Offer,"Listed On: Friday, December 21, 2012",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is an extremely rare opportunity to own an unique item. First off, the electric guitar was made by Jarrett Guitars, 50 guitars were scheduled to be built in the limited, but only 40 ended up making the production run. Commemorative Series and this is guitar number #19 in the series, serial number CSX2002-34 . The Guitar comes with certificate of authenticity from JARRETT GUITARS, CONNECTICUT USA. A rare piece both for collectors and players, and an extremely unique piece for Shelby Cobra fans. 22 frets, humbuckers, 3 way selector switch. Volume and tone controls push/pull to split the coils in the humbuckers. Set neck with pearl inlays, and custom Shelby Cobra graphics. If you Google this guitar and read the Harmony Central reviews, you will discover just how amazing this guitar really is. This guitar has lived it's life in it's case which is included. The guitars sold in the 4k-8k range due to the limited number made and have never seen one that was autographed.  It was played one time by a professional musician to get feedback on the quality, which as expected, was very impressive to him.

As for the autograph, being a '68 Shelby Cobra GT-500 owner I have attended several events at Boulder's ""Shelby American Collection"" museum. Mr. Shelby signed this at one of the annual Christmas benefits (December, 2007) and all monies collected from the benefits were donated to help operate the museum and to the Carroll Shelby Foundation (http://www.cscf.org/). As such it comes with a certificate of authenticity from them. I had Mr. Shelby inscribe it to me and my name can easily be removed with just rubbing alcohol because the inscribed signature was done with a Sharpie and since the guitars finish has several layers of clear coat built up on it, the Sharpie couldn't have penetrated through the finish. I am the original owner of the guitar and have owned it for 7 years. I have rarely come across these guitars and have never seen one that has been autographed. As you know Mr. Shelby has passed away and therefore I wouldn't anticipate a signed example making it to the market..

To get an idea of value's you can check out these current auctions for similar guitars, first ones aren't autographed, second one is but a different type. It's just to give an idea, I don't need any insulting low ball offers, I paid a lot of money just for the opportunity to own this rare guitar...

Im selling my LWRC M6A2 that I bought less than a month ago brand new. This is a gas piston AR-15 and one of the best on the market. It out competes ACR/SCARs and other piston driven ARs.
These guns have been out of stock for a long while so I had to go through a family member and past worker of LWRC to get ahold of one and waited a long while to get it. 
About 100 brass cased rounds fired through it. 
Comes with everything a new one would. - $4,500
No accessories included. This is just the gun and original packaging. I just increased the price by $800. Sorry, but I had received numerous offers for $3,700 so that price was just too low considering this is the best AR-15 on the market and they are about to get banned and they're out of stock everywhere else. Mine is basically brand new as well.

Price is non-negotiable! Dont waste my time or yours on any other offer. 

PMAGS - $25 each (for the window ones and regular ones)
GI Mags - $20 each
FSC 556 Compensator (Best on the market) - $150 
- Orignal flash hider is included in the rifles price along with everything else a new one comes with

I have a 2007 Suzuki GSX-R 600 for sale. 12,400 Miles (Near mint Condition) I can no longer ride due to my Disability, hate to see her go. 

Its the most desirable color combination, Near mint Condition, Has a few, very very small blemishes here and there from normal use. She runs very strong never had any problems with her at all. Always garaged and stored properly, This bike runs amazing, looks amazing and handles amazing.

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

The 6.8 Remington Special Purpose Cartridge was designed by some fine folks in the US military and the Remington Arms Company. The design purpose of this ""special purpose cartridge"" was to make up for the perceived deficiency of the 5.56 NATO round in its role as our standard combat caliber. Often expressed in terms of external ballistics, barrier penetration, knockdown or stopping power, etc., the different measures of performance were to be exceeded with a new AR-15 compatible cartridge From the civilian shooter's point of view, the 6.8 SPC cartridge is a step up from the .223 in one major regard: it is a legal caliber for hunting big game with an AR-15 rifle. For deer and black bear sized game, it is proving to be outstanding in this capacity. For hunting hogs in TX and other areas where hogs are a problem, the 6.8 SPC is second to none."

Eisenhower Commemorative that I'm looking to sell for the best reasonable offer, or will trade for firearms that I will shoot and don't just sit in the case and get taken out occasionally to show it off.

I'm not sure how big the run was.  The only one's besides mine I've seen reference to were number 28 and 76.  Mine is number 42.  These were built by Springfield for the American Historical Society using National Match guns.  I believe the issue price was $1,995.

I'm interested in a variety of guns, but I'm partial to 1911's or other auto's.  Maybe wheel guns, but it would have to be something unique.  I'm also into AR15's, G3's, H&K 93's, AK's, or the like.  If I were to take a shotguns as trades they'd preferably need to be more tactical in nature as I don't hunt or target shoot much anymore with a shotgun.

This is a beautiful piece, was never shot by myself or the previous owner, but does have handling wear from being shown off over the years."

oh wait...I am kidding.  Just waiting to see how many emails I get from people saying I'll take it before reading the entire ad.  Funny how the gun community will completely cannibalize itself at the drop of a hat. People selling $700 ARs for $1500...but its ok ""given the current situation"".  What IS the current situation?  Its nothing right now.  No laws have changed, the president is powerless to make any order--he is not allowed to per the Constitution (even though I suppose he has already stepped on that several times), and the congress & senate have their heads so far up their asses they don't know which way is up.  I can bet the same people crying about prices too are the same who would have no problem ripping someone off too.  Oh--just to be clear--I aint cryin about anything.  See I was smart and saw the writing on the wall last year and bought & stocked up when prices were mostly fair and gun-owners weren't screwing each other.  You know why gun laws are about to change?  Cause the majority of gun-owners are no better than the Occupy Wall street @ssholes who stole, ripped off, and raped people when they got the chance.  I'll hang on to my guns and ammo.  I won't rip people off for a quick buck, and I sure won't buy anything more now cause there are way too many idiots out there now. Good job people, you've screwed yourself."

REVISION: In your Email to me: Include WHAT you are interested in, and WHAT you are offering. Again, I do not want to be flooded with calls, so sending me an Email saying ""Please CALL ME ASAP"" is not going to happen. I just can't be tied to the phone. I'll pick the deals / offers I am interested in and will reply, but I need the above before I can even reply. Thanks.
==========

I know, it sounds too good to be true, but I expect to meet face-to-face for any deals that are ultimately made. I actually don't know if I want to part with anything, but decided to throw in and see if I can take advantage of the ridiculous feeding frenzy while there's still blood in the water. If the offer(s) are too good to refuse, I'll sell (or trade). If not, I'm happy to keep every single thing I own. I'm not hurting for cash so there is no desperation on my part to liquidate, so... here goes.

I'm only going to communicate via email as I don't want to be endlessly tied up on the phone. If something pans out, we'll talk. I'm open to trades, and they don't need to be restricted to gun-related items. I have a wide range of interests (see below). An absurd cash offer might pique my interest, but it'll have to be silly (which most stuff on here apparently is), and there just CAN'T be that many INSANE people in this world."

Designed specifically for lightweight mobility, speed of target acquisition, and potent firepower capability - the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine delivers. This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military Colt M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30.5 in (77.5 cm) in length and weighs only 6.8 lb (3.08 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's Law Enforcement Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection."
