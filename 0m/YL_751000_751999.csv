The SA-93 rifles are dressed in a wood stockset, while the SLR-95 wears polymer. These rifles have original chrome lined hammer forged barrels and Bugarian milled receivers, some of the best. Chambered in 7.62x39 and will accept all AK mags. A must have if you are into milled receivers or are looking for a base for an AK47 build.

P.S. - If you are reading up on reviews, you may see some indicating that the safety selector is a 180-degree switch. This must have been for earlier generations, as the one I have features a traditional 90-degree safety selector as any other AR has. This rifle is nearly 100% identical to an M4 in terms of weight and features, with only the forward assist and bolt release being cosmetic features. Great rifle to train with for cheap!

NOTE:(I will upload more pictures when I get back home, the one I just uploaded is one I previously snapped with my phone to show someone and does not include everything described. I will take pictures showing the mags and case etc...when I get back home on the 26th)

This .308 (or 7.62x54 NATO) rifle has only been shot 60 rounds and is in great shape and includes (2) 20 rd and (2) 10 rd mags (these are factory FN mags, I still have the box they  came in) and these mags alone are selling for crazy prices of $150-$200 each IF you can find them. This is the true 20"" HEAVY barrel. There are people selling ones advertised as a heavy barrel and either they don't know the difference or they are being deceitful so be vey careful with others as they are both fluted.  This has a scope (will update with specific model, cannot remember but cost several hundred $) and a nice bipod that is foldable. It has the original hard case, three cheek pieces and three butt plates and paperwork. I am selling this week as a package deal for $2000 cash or Paypal with 3% added, but I prefer cash. 

I am located in south-eastern Ohio and can meet you this week (by Friday) somewhere between you and me if it is reasonable, I prefer a face to face sale with an Ohio, WV, PA, MI, IN or KY resident because my state law allows me to sell to Ohio or neighboring states resident without paying an FFL to transfer it or the hassle, but if the buyer is from another state we can adjust the price accordingly. It is your responsibility to know your state law before contacting me, I will also make sure you are able to purchase this in your state.

Added after listing:
I forgot I have some ammo I will be selling too. I have 13 boxes of the load they use for factory testing, Federal Gold match 168gr and three boxes of 165gr Hornady. I will be asking what I have in them, $500 for the Federal (I paid $36 each plus tax) and $100 for the Hornady (paid $32 plus tax) so I would sell all of them for $600 either with the gun or AFTER I sell the gun."
