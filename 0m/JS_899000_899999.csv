After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was GARRISONED BY THE SS! Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...

the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
These are the reasons why it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.

pistol is in near unissued condition and a prime example of strain on axis weapons fabrication late in the war, with tooling and machinery marks throughout, it comes with one extra original period magazine. - 720 620 78 84 call txt"

The top one is a model 15-3  combat masterpiece .38 spl.  nickel plate with target features with magna grips.  made '71or'72.  bout 97% org. condition.  comes with pouch and holster if wanted for the asking price.  Both guns have not been shot much and were night stand guns from what i was told.  The second gun is a nickel pre-model 33 regulation police on the 'I' frame.  made 1925 and in the .38 s&w (short) caliber.  The trigger and hammer were hard chrome plated I believe from the factory but has flaked off mostly..hardly notice it.  I think the finish is org. because of the sharp lines and is in bout 95% cond. and the grips....all parts numbers match.  Getting hard to find like this.  Also comes with half box of vintage ammo and silver sack it was stored in.  $475 each or $850 for both. Matt REDACTED.

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price.  

Tacticool Buffer Cylinder adds value to this firearm as well.  For a little pistol carbine, the Kel-Tec SUB-2000 has quite a kick.  It's so fun to shoot, it's easy to go through a few hundred rounds, and you'll be feeling it in your shoulder tomorrow.  Now, there's a simple and inexpensive solution that eliminates over 30% of the felt recoil.

SUB-2000 Bolt Tube Cover
The cheek weld to the steel bolt tube is a source of some discomfort.  The heavy bolt recoils inside the bolt tube which is in contact with the shooter's cheek.  The steel bolt tube is also a good thermal conductor, transferring heat or cold into the shooter's cheek.  The bolt tube cover insulates the shooter from the shock loads and temperature extremes, greatly increasing the comfort when shooting the SUB-2000.  It also provides a tough rubber armor for the bolt tube, making it an even tougher little go-anywhere, do-anything carbine.

SUB-2000 Operating Handle Cover
The steel operating handle isn't very ergonomic, and pulling back the bolt to chamber a round or verify the chamber is empty can tweak your finger.  The SUB-2000 Operating Handle Cover is a quick and easy way to increase the comfort and make the SUB-2000 friendlier to shoot.

Good luck finding another one in tan. It is slightly used with only about 100 rounds through it. It is extremely well taken care of. Included with the RFB are 5-20 rd. FAL mags, a speed loader, and of course the sling. I also have a Harris Bipod available for purchase with the RFB if interested. 

RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.

This ammo was made at the Lake City Plant (Federal) for the US Military in 1987 as indicated by the Headstamp ""LC-87"" The tracer elements do expire over time, so there is a chance that some rounds may not trace, but the ammo will function the firearm and shoot well just like any other FMJ ammo.  The tracer element does not affect the ballistics. You will certainly still get rounds that trace so use with the same caution in regards to brush or grass fire dangers that you would use with any tracers. Tracer ammo can start fires. 

This ammo is compatible with AR 15's with barrels designed for 5.56 ammo.

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

Both pistols have drift adjustable rear sights, and left side target style thumb rests.

Finish on pistol ""A"" is about 98% or more, there are no cracks on the stocks. Has a thin (looks like brass) insert pinned in front sight.  I've estimated this pistol shipped from the factory in the early to mid-fifties, but I have not had it documented.

Finish on pistol ""B"" is about 92% or more, showing possible holster wear on the muzzle and slight wear on some sharp edges along the leading edge of the frame.  There are no cracks on the stocks.  The frame has the word ""Lightweight"" engraved in script. I've estimated this pistol shipped from the factory in the mid to late-fifties, but also has not been documented.

I've owned these pistols for over 30 years, and while I have collected High Standard semi-auto pistols, I've never taken the time to learn about their history.  Also, unfortunately there are no cool stories to go along with them.  Other than test fire and verify function they have been safe queens.  

FTF - Legal to buy and own handguns, meaning 21 or older.  Would prefer to sell them to an enthusiast.  Asking $1,000 for the pair.  I do not have any other items to go with them. Not interested in any trades at this time."

It has a 16"" Voodoo Barrels midweight barrel. The barrel is melonited inside and out. This treatment is not a plating but rather a treatment that adds incredible durability, lubricity, wear resistance, cleanability, and corrosion resistance. Glock calls it ""Tenifer"" and JP calls it ""QPQ"". The barrel is threaded with a flash hider and uses the softer-recoiling mid length gas system. Accuracy is guaranteed to 1 MOA. 

Internally it has a great trigger and a melonited bolt carrier group. This will make for higher durability and easy cleaning. 

Upgrades include Magpul MOE handguard, 6-pos buttstock, and grip. The flattop rail holds a flip-up adjustable rear sight. You can mount a scope in front of it. It also has a nice ambidextrous safety. If you want me to make any changes to it I can at actual cost. I have all of the tools.

Includes a Teflon coated 30-rd magazine and a green 30-rd Magpul Maglevel window mag. 

This price is what it is worth to me, so I'm firm on it. I'm not really interested in people sending me emails telling me what they think I paid, or why I should sell it to them for that even though I drove to the stores every day and they didn't, not to mention the hour wait and stupidly high sales tax. I also included a Maglevel mag, which has sold for as high as $100 during this madness. If you want to roll the dice on getting one later, that's fine; my price for rolling the dice is $1850, and for any less I'm fine with enjoying it myself. If there's someone out there without an AR that wants to make sure they get one, then we should talk.

Buyer must have permit to purchase or carry permit. We could also meet at a dealer if you want to do a transfer. 

I can meet in Burnsville or Bloomington. 

Payment is cash or credit card (3% card fee). 
Please email me your name and phone number if interested. Thanks!"

S & W only produced the 3904 during 1988-1990 and they fell from favor when the double stack magazine craze was in full swing.  Now that many people are carrying thinner and lighter pistols, some of the older retired models are once again gaining favor.

We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Up for sale is a Glock 36 in .45 Auto. I purchased this gun new from Cabelas in 2010 and it has served me as my primary carry gun since. I recently switched to the Glock 26 in 9mm and no longer have a need for the 36. Absolutely nothing wrong with this gun, no dings, never been dropped and just normal wear from practicing on the range (thankfully have never had to use it but I trusted my life with it). If you know your Glock's you'll notice the wear mark on the top of the barrel and you can judge the usage from that. The gun only came with 2 mags but I purchased a 3rd and will include it here in the sale. I also have several extras detailed below including some expensive personal defense ammo. I carried the Hornady TAP for the longest time but recent reviews from tnoutdoors9 on YouTube steered me to the Federal ammo. The Federal stuff is running over $30 after tax if you can even find it. This Glock runs every type of ammo hollowpoint or FMJ; I have never had a failure to fire or failure to feed. It is a lot of caliber in a small package. Mags hold 6, so you have 6+1 in the pipe for carry.

Sale includes:

- Glock 36 Handgun
- 3 Glock brand magazines (2 are original to the gun)
- Factory included magazine loader
- Factory included cleaning rod
- Factory included nylon brush (very lightly used, I cleaned with a jag and Ballistol after every use)
- Factory box, manual, papers, sealed fired casing, child safety lock
- Blackhawk CQC Holster (Approx $35 value)
- Partial box of Hornady FPD +P 230 gr ammo
- Partial box of Federal 230 gr Hydra Shok

For those not familiar with the Glock 36, here is the manufacturer specs - http://us.glock.com/products/model/g36

Price is $500 - You can make me an offer but I am pretty firm. You will need to show me your DL + CCW or Permit to purchase.  I would like to transfer via FFL if it is acceptable. I will pay the fee.  Element Arms in Becker is preferable but I would do Atomic in Bloomington or anywhere that is reasonable distance from Minneapolis."

As the title states, I am looking to sell my hard to find 14.5"" Spike's Tactical Elite Mid-Length Rifle. This rifle is ambidextrous, as you will see from the parts selected below and the pictures. This is a top-shelf build and the complete rifle is Spike's Tactical. All the parts used to complete this project are top shelf and the rifle was only fired to zero the Magpul BUIS and the EOTech 512, which comes with the rifle. The parts used will be listed below. Reason looking to sell or trade, well because I want to go a different direction, maybe with something not as fancy. I am a law enforcement officer and need another rifle to take the place of this one. However, don't take that to mean I will take junk. I would prefer a FTF, but willing to ship to an authorized FFL, which I will check. Also, please be sure it's legal to own this rifle where you live as it will come with high capacity magazines, a bayonet lug, and a telescoping rear stock. This rifle is non-NFA. It's a 14.5"" barrel with a pinned and welded Spike's Dynacomp to bring length to legal minimum of 16"". I do not wish to break the package apart. This may be cross posted, so first ""I'll take it"" followed by a PM or Email wins the day. Be advised guys, this rifle cost me a lot as well with the current market.  Thanks for looking
