I shoot .5 inch groupings at 300yards with this rifle and 1 inch groupings at 600. Rifle is sighted in. This is a good rifle for someone who wants to do high powered long distance shooting effective up to 1000 yards (ten football fields) and higher.

Buying the rifle: since maryland law does not require sale of long barreled rifles (18inches and above) to be registered, to sell privately I would have a bill of sale for both of us to keep and I sell it to you out of good faith that you are not a felon. This is legal, I called state police and checked. So basically you give me cash and I hand you the gun. It's that easy in case you were unfamiliar with the transaction process.

Asking 1000 with scope, you can choose to have or without the scope as well for 800. Best offer. Thanks

Do not contact me if you have had felony charges in the past. I may check up on criminal history if I feel I need to."

61,http://www.armslist.com/posts/615061,For Sale/Trade:  Complete reloading gear package,"Thornton, Denver, Colorado","$ 1,200","Listed On: Wednesday, October 17, 2012",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I no longer have the spare time to partake in reloading, so I'm offering in trade the following reloading gear package.

1. The Hornady Lock-N-Load AP Progressive Press This press is capable of loading rifle and handgun cartridges with ease.

The press comes complete with the following items:
* Lock-N-Load powder measure
* rifle and pistol metering assemblies
* case activated powder drop and linkage
* cartridge catcher
* large and small primer pick-up tubes
* 5 Lock-N-Load Bushings
* Original Documentation


Also comes with extra Shell Case Retainer Springs & three shell plates:
* #45 - 45 ACP & 45 Winchester
* #16 - 223 Remington
*  #8 - 9mm



2. The Hornady Lock-N-Load AP Progressive Press Automatic Case Feeder is the perfect addition to your Lock-N-Load AP Progressive Reloading Press. The case feeder features the highest torque motor in the industry, and an extra large case bowl. This case feeder transforms your Lock-N-Load AP into a fully automatic press, enabling you to load hundreds of rounds per hour.

Also comes with every case feeder plate available:
* Large Rifle Case Feeder Plate
* Small Rifle Case Feeder Plate
* Large Pistol Case Feeder Plate
* Small Pistol Case feeder Plate


3. The RCBS Trim Mate Case Prep Center helps to make the tedious tasks of chamfering, deburring, primer pocket cleaning, military crimp removal and flash hole deburring quick and effortless.

Includes:
* Large and Small primer pocket brushes
* Chamfering head
* Deburring head
* Small and Medium case neck brushes
* Packet of dry neck lube Operation Performed: Chamfering, deburring, primer pocket cleaning, military crimp removal and flash hole deburring  Features: 5 Gear driven heads for effortless case preparation.  


4. RCBS Automatic Case Trimmer. The low RPM motor delivers plenty of torque and the spring fed cutter requires no pushing or feeding pressure so , cases are trimmed accurately and squarely. The spring fed cutter also allows reloaders to have their hands free while trimming so they can deburr cases or do other tasks helping to speed up the reloading process.

Pilots Included: 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 35, 44 and 45 caliber pilots. 45 caliber pilot is primarily designed to work with pistol cases but will also work for rifle calibers.

5. Lyman Case Tumbler

Regarding the condition of the gear:

All of the gear is in excellent condition, without signs of wear or any defects. I have reloaded 3000 rounds using the Progressive Press. I have trimmed 500 cases using the automatic case trimmer, and used the case prep center for the same 500.

Aside from the powder dust inside of the powder measurer, this gear appears as it did from the day I bought it. I'm ex-military and keep all of my gear in meticulous condition and properly maintained.

It would cost you well over $1450 to go out and buy this gear individually."

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

They are individually crafted by a wood artisian and each is unique.

Various woods (cedar / hickory / maple / walnut) lengths and carvings. Most have the ""Wood Spirit"" carving but I have one ""Big Foot"" hickory unit left too. That one wasn't photographed. It's a slight, but definite variant of the Wood Spirit face.

An excerpt from the scriptures, Book of Browning

In the beginning was the 1911, and the 1911 was the pistol, and it was good. And behold the Lord said, thou shalt not muck with my disciple John's design for it is good and it worketh. For John made the 1911, and lo all of his weapons, from the designs which I, the Lord, gave him upon the mountain.

And shouldst thou muck with it and hang all manner of foul implements upon it, and profane its internal parts, thou shalt surely have malfunctions, and in the midst of battle thou shalt surely come to harm. And as the ages passed, men in their ignorance and arrogance didst forget the word of the Lord and began to profane the 1911. The tribe of the gamesman did place recoil spring guides and extended slide releases upon the 1911, and their metalsmiths didst tighten the tolerances and alter parts to their liking, their clarity of mind being clouded by lust.

The artisans did hang all manner of foul implements upon the 1911 and did so alter it that it became impractical to purchase. For lo, the artisans did charge a great tax upon the purchasers of the 1911 so that the lowly field worker could not afford one. And the profaning of the internal parts didst render it unworkable when the dust of the land fell upon it. And lo, they did install adjustable sights, which are an abomination unto the Lord, for they doth break and lose their zero when thou dost need true aim. And those who have done so will be slain in great numbers by their enemies in the great battle.

And it came to pass that the Lord didst see the abomination wrought by man and didst cause, as He had warned, fearful malfunction to come upon the abominations and upon the artisans who thought they could do no wrong. Seeing the malfunctions and the confusion of men the Lord of the underworld did see an opportunity to further ensnare man and didst bring forth pistols made of plastic, whose form was such that they looked and felt like a brick, yet the eyes of man being clouded, they were consumed by the plastic pistol and did buy vast quantities of them.

And being a deceitful spirit the Devil did make these plastic pistols unamenable to the artisans of earth and they were unable to muck much with the design, and lo these pistols did function.

And the evil one also brought forth pistols in which the trigger didst both cock and fire them, and which require a 'Dingus' to make them appear safe.

But man being stupid did not understand these new pistols and did proceed to shoot themselves with the plastic pistol, and with the trigger cocking pistols, for lo, their manual of arms required great intelligence which man had long since forsaken.

Yet man did not repent of his evil ways, but continued to gloat over these new pistols blaming Satan for the negligent discharges which they themselves had committed. And when man had been totally ensnared with the plastic pistol the Devil didst cause a plague of the terrible Ka-BOOM to descend upon man and the plastic pistols delivered their retribution upon men. And there was great wailing and gnashing of teeth in the land.

Then seeing that the eyes of man were slowly being opened and that man was truly sorrowful for his sinful misdeeds, the Lord did send his messengers in the form of artisans who did hear and obey the teachings of the Prophet and who didst restore the profaned 1911's to their proper configuration, and lo, to the amazement of men they didst begin to work as the Prophet intended."

Inherited from my father whom inherited it from his father. Don't ask me how/why he had it other than he was originally from Boston.

Had it inspected and appraised by three different FFL Dealers and they ranged from $800-$1000 although bluebook showed high being $495.  They said they have never seen one in this condition.

The reason for their appraisal was that it is in EXCELLENT condition. To my knowledge and their inspection, it has only had 10 rds through it and isn't even broken in.

Includes two 32 round magazines.

Barrel Extension unscrews although I have not done so.

It is semi-auto and perfectly legal as-is in Oregon as a pistol. I would prefer FTF. If it goes out of state, you are responsible for making sure it is legal in your state. I haven't sold out of state and I'll charge extra for headaches.  Will not sell to states that don't allow this firearm, so save both of our time by not asking me to.

Would prefer to sell to a collector.  The gun is going because it doesn't fit in my collection. Will consider trades but the trade deal has to be worth more than $700, especially AMT AUTOMAG .30 Carbine, Ruger Mini 30, Bolt Action 7.62 x39mm or several revolvers/lever action guns.

Even though the Moss 500 cruiser is less expensive new, I would trade for that. you can text or call 720- three six nine, seven eight one seven, or email through armslist."

This gun has had less than 50 rounds put thorugh it and is currently sited in for 200 yards.  I am selling this gun because I haven't taken to hunting as much as I thought I would.

This may be your last and only chance to get a beautiful specimen of the M1 Garand. Consider $1,595 as the starting point for your offer.

This is one of the Colt 1911al ORM .45 pistols.  All Colt and all original. Great shape, doesn’t appear to be shot much.  Hasn’t been tinkered with. I took it out once and it proved to be very accurate and had no issues with anything I fed it. All internals look great, the locking lugs are very sharp. Comes with the original Colt box and two magazines.
Asking $650 OBO.
Thanks."

I have an 88 Yamaha Virago 1100. It is in decent shape for its age. I havent had it long, put it back together and took it to the shop where they cleaned the carbs and replaced the battery. The turn signals dont work correctly right now, not sure if it is the relay or if the wires have been crossed. i do have the owners manual which has a wiring diagram in it. i dont want to sell it but we are moving in the next 2 months and I do not have the room to work on it and am only looking to get my money back out of it.





Looking to sell a 99 Ninja 250. It has been in storage so it will need some work. It was running before it was put in storage but it needed the carbs cleaned. It was in the same physical condition when I bought it to fix up for the wife but I dont have room and she never got her permit. We are moving and wont have room to take it with us.

748,http://www.armslist.com/posts/615748,For Sale/Trade:  HI-601VT GPS/GSM tracker,"Fountain, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 250,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 17, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"With HI-601VT GPS/GSM tracker, one can track, remote control, tapping any object globally in real time by using any regular SIM card (with one phone number), any regular phone (home phone, mobile phone, smart phone, etc.) and any local mapping software or Google Earth. No any special software needed. Because HI-601VT is small in size and main unit come with the big capacity rechargeable battery, it is also very suitable for personal tracking. On the HI-601VT, one can press the “panic button” and HI-601VT will instantly dial back to the preset telephone numbers (can set three numbers in different priority).

With the optional car kit accessories, car control cables, micro-phone, moving sensor, one can remotely control certain functions:

Car control cable sets: To stop the car oil and electricity from any phone.
Micro-phone sets: to hear the voice from HI-601VT side.
Vibration sensor: HI-601VT will automatically dial back when the moving occur.

HOW HI-601VT works: Unlike most GPS/GSM tracker using the GPRS communication in SMS message in none-real time mode and require control station (require monthly fee) or Internet access, HI-601VT no need any control center and special software. Since it is point to point solution, it is also no need to check the object from the Internet. wherever one can make the phone call, one can track the object and see the moving from any mapping software in real time. 

Just like you call someone and he tells you where the object is and shows you where he is on the mapping software. HI-601VT provide non-stop and continue real time tracking without time limitation. Just like you talk to someone over the phone as long as you can."

759,http://www.armslist.com/posts/615759,For Sale/Trade:  Haicom HI-602DT GPS+GSM Realtime Tracker,"Fountain, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 225,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 17, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"HI-602DT uses the most unique DTMF technology via GSM voice channel to send back the real time GPS location data directly to another phone.  The user can track any moving object live on the map without Internet access and a call center in between (Tracking is free of charge with no need to pay any monthly subscription to a service).  Unlike a traditional SMS tracker that only sends an SMS with a GPS position to the cell phone and user has to manually key in the location digit by digit to get only a dot on a map, HI-602 continuously sends back real time location data.  This facilitates route tracking on local GPS or Google maps.  You can actually watch the vehicle movements live on a map similar to a car navigation system. 

Unlike the traditional GPRS tracker which needs to send the data continuously to an IP server (and keep consuming battery power), HI-602DT can go into sleep mode to reduce power consumption. With a regular re-chargeable battery, HI-602DT can stand by for almost five days which makes it very suitable for personal tracking. For example, simply put the small tracker into a child’s backpack during the school week, removing it for recharge over the weekend. It is ideal for personal security and most importantly, parents don't  need to pay monthly fee after purchasing the unit. 

User can insert any local GSM SIM card (or pre-paid SIM card, etc.) making it only necessary to pay a phone call charge when tracking is in use.  Also, by setting up three priority call back telephone numbers inside HI-602DT, user can press the SOS button and the tracker will immediately send a SMS with GPS location to the preset numbers. User can also activate the Geo Fencing function so that the tracker will send a SMS warning when the tracker leaves a preset designated area. The Geo Fencing function is also very useful for security purposes to

monitor movement of your property. For example, the tracker will automatically inform you with a SMS message when your car is out of a preset designated area.


NEW: Now with moving sensor! Increased the standby time when object is not moving much.

Advantages:
•Extremely low power consumption with up to 5 days stand by time•Suitable for all types of tracking applications: GPRS AVL, DTMF Global security, personal tracking •Two way voice communications•Very small in size•Expandable and flexible vehicle control functions: live petrol/power remote cutting, Vibration sensor and bugging•With HI-602 GPS/GSM tracker, one can track, remote control, tapping any object globally in real time by using any regular SIM card (with one phone number), any regular phone (home phone, mobile phone, smart phone, etc) and any local mapping software or Google Earth. Special software is not required.•GPS receiver is small in size and main unit come with a large capacity rechargeable battery, making it also very suitable for personal tracking•On the HI-602, one can press the panic button and HI-602 will instantly dial back to preset telephone numbers (can set three numbers in different priority)•With the optional car kit accessories, car control cables, micro-phone, moving sensor, one can remotely control certain functions.  Car control cable sets: stop the cars fuel and electricity from any phone •Micro-phone sets: to hear the voice from HI-602 side•Vibration sensor: HI-602 will automatically dial back when the movement occurs•Unlike most GPS/GSM trackers that require GPRS communication via SMS message in non-real time mode and require control station (monthly fee) or Internet access, HI-602 does not need any control center or special software•With point to point functionality, it is not necessary to monitor the object via the Internet.  Wherever one can make a phone call, one can track the object and see the movement from any mapping software in real time •Just as with a live telephone conversation, HI-602 provides non-stop and continuous real time tracking without time limitation
Optional Car Kit
User can also connect HI-602DT to all kinds of optional car kit accessories so that the user can globally control the vehicle petrol supply or electricity by pressing few buttons from any phone. 
For example: By connecting the optional vibration sensor, the tracker will also actively warn the user when there is any movement on the vehicle. 
By connecting the microphone to the car kit box, user can remotely tap the conversation from any phone. 
By connecting the optional HI-SDL data logger dongle, the travelled route will be logged anytime even if the tracker is not doing the real time tracking."

I just looked in the bottom of my closet and there sat this container of .45 ammo that I've never seen.  I've never owned a 45 caliber weapon in my life; therefore, buy this from me so I don't have to buy a .45 to shoot it with.
