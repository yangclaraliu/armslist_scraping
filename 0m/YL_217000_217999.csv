This sight has never been used and was only removed from the box for pictures. Below are the specs from the Aimpoint site. The sight has an MSRP of $860 so you are saving a ton of money. Check out the sights selling on ebay and you will see they sell for much more than I am asking.


Aimpoint® CompM4
High or low battery compartment
To accommodate our customers, the CompM4 series of sights are available in two versions:
The CompM4 offers a high battery compartment. This is the product shown her.
The CompM4s offers a low battery compartment.  Follow link to see the CompM4s.
In all other aspects, the Aimpoint CompM4 and Aimpoint CompM4s are identical.
We choose to present these 2 sights separately on the website as they do look different.

Complete and ready to mount
The CompM4 sight is shipped complete with a QRP2 mount and standard AR15 spacer. These sights also come equipped with a killFlash® anti-reflection device and MILSPEC rubber lens covers.

Integral mount
The CompM4 sight features an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring, and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of weapon systems.

Designed for 3rd generation night vision technology
The CompM4 sight can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility.
The performance of CompM4 sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.

The clearest, brightest image possible
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).

Ready for use around the clock
With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 sight is ready for round the clock use.

Unique features of the CompM4
High battery compartment

Unique features of the CompM4 and CompM4s
Compatible with every generation of NVD
ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery
Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery
7 NVD settings and 9 daylight settings
QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation and lower the risk of snagging on other gear
Mount base is keyed into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil
Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring required.
500,000 hours of use on NVD setting
2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
Matches perfectly with Aimpoint® 3XMag
Unequalled light transmission
Front lens opening is threaded for addition of killFlash® anti-reflective device
Submersible to 150 feet (45 meters)
Vertical spacer included
Type classified as the U.S. Army’s new M68CCO
Improved adjustment caps are easier to remove and protected against impact
Can be used with a carry handle adapter for use on all M16 rifles
Mechanical switch for speed and reliability

Standard features for all Aimpoint® sights
Unlimited field of view
Parallax-free and unlimited eye relief
Unaffected by extreme weather conditions
Rugged, durable construction
No hazardous materials
No laser emission that could be harmful to your eyes

It is designed to maximize the impact of a defensive blow to an assailant during any ""Use of Force"" situation where the discharge of a firearm may not be viable or possible.

 This product features a tapered strike edge designed to enhance any sidearm magazines effectiveness as a defensive strike tool. The system can also be used in any situation where striking with the base of the weapon is required. Such as striking the window of a vehicle to remove an unconscious victim.

 We feel that our product adds several levels of improvement to any sidearm. This includes, but is not limited to; ease of removal of the magazine from a weapon (even in inclement weather), protecting the magazine from impact damage in ""drop and discard"" reloading situations and if a firearm related attack persists or critical weapon malfunction disables a weapon, this product can be used to inflict a devastating defensive blow. The product allows the magazine itself to remain as a weapon even if it is removed from the sidearm. For law enforcement, we hopes to provide this defensive product to officers as an equalizer in hand to hand combat with a larger opponent.

The grain and pattern in the wood is gorgeous!  Overall length is a hair over 8 inches, blade length is 3 and 3/4 inches.  This knife was designed for skinning, and has a broad blade with a clipped point, and a spot for your thumb on the back of the blade.  It is stamped ""DARBY 96"".  I bought the knife in 1996 intending to go Elk hunting some day, but that never happened.  The knife has been stored in a pouch, not in the sheath.  Knife includes a simple black leather pouch sheath that came with the knife.  I purchased the knife from Mr. Darby back in 1996 and met him personally at the Janesville Knife Show on several occasions.  He has since retired from knife making and currently lives in Indiana."

This is a random pattern damascus blade forged by Chuck at his home in Weldon, Illinois.  The guard is nickel silver, and there is a single red spacer between it and the handle.  The handle is a great piece of stag that has some real gnarly character.  I purchased this knife directly from Chuck back in 2000 to go deer hunting with a friend.  The friend canceled, so I never got to go deer hunting.  The handle has a mosaic pin in the base.  Overall length is about 8 inches (from tip to tip, a little over 8) and the blade is 3 9/16 inches long.  Blade is stamped ""Chuck Hawes, Maker, Weldon, IL"".  Chuck differentially heat treats all of his damascus blades.  He hardens the whole blade, and uses a torch to soften the blade spine a bit, making for a tougher knife.  This knife has never been used, and comes with a padded, zippered storage pouch."

     Notes: The company of Bul Transmark was founded in 1990 by a group of gunsmiths and shooters who have experience in both military and competitive areas.  They do not often sell their products in the US, due to the restrictions of the Brady Gun Bill (though this, of course, may change in the future with the demise of the Bill this year).  The Impact is one of these pistols; it is a polymer-frame weapon also known as the Impact Hi-Cap due to the size of its magazines.  The weapon has multiple safeties, including an automatic firing pin safety and a manual safety catch.  The Impact is relatively small weapon, despite the magazine capacity.

     In 2002, Bul began marketing an improved version of the Impact, called the Cherokee.  Though designed primarily for military and police use (they are, in fact, used by several military and police units worldwide), they are also having minor sales success on the civilian market.  Like the Impact, the Cherokee uses a modified Browning operation, and most of the design changes have to do with the use of higher-strength polymers in the construction and a more ergonomic shape.  Original production Cherokees were “one size fits all,” but starting in 2006, more improvements were made.  The Cherokee now comes in a standard frame and the “G-Frame” Cherokee, which uses a wider grip for shooters with large hands.  (A by-product is that the G-Frame versions can also accept a shoulder stock, attacked to a hole in the bottom of the grip. The standard model does not have this hole, nor is the grip wide enough to put such a hole in it.)  In addition, a MIL-STD-1913 rail was molded into the dust cover of the 2006 Cherokees.  There is also Cherokee Compact; although G-Frame versions exist of the Compact, the Compact still cannot accept a shoulder stock.  Currently, Cherokees are chambered only for 9mm Parabellum; no word has been given on whether or not other chamberings will be made available in the future.

That has been taken care of ever so gingerly.  There is not a scratch on her.  Her name is Delilah, which is non-negotiable.  



I am the first owner of the gun and the only one to shoot it.  She has not been passed around like a...well you know what I'm saying.  There have only been 200 rounds fired through her, all Winchester White Box, including 25 rounds of Winchester JHP.  She has been taken down to the frame before the first firing as well as after each of her two range sessions.  Overkill?  Sure, but I she is cleaner than yours and it gives me piece of mind when I know its clean and functioning properly.    

Included in this are two factory magazines from Dan Wesson, the factory case, and all other accompanying paperwork. I will also include all the rounds that I have purchased for this gun since it is my only .45
-100 rounds of Winchester White Box
-25 Rounds of Winchester JHP
-20 Rounds of Winchester PDX1s

I have had no problems what so ever with this gun.  Like every other gun, it is definitely accurate.  What is different is this is a Dan Wesson, please see the pics showing the finish.  The Kimber Raptor I had before this pales in EVERY SINGLE WAY.  

I have tuition bills coming so I need help.  If you can get me a job I would be more than happy to give you a discount! If you need feedback I have great feedback from guys on the SigForum where I have sold a couple of firearms.  

Yes, your instincts are right....this gun is better looking than any 1911 in your collection, and yup your math is right that's about $100.00 worth of Ammo.  

Here is a link to some pictures (I can take specific pictures if you like, just ask, but no fetish pictures you creepers) as well as a link to the Dan Wesson website:

WTT Beretta 92G

    I took this pistol in trade and gave it to my son and he loved it. We went to shoot yesterday and after shooting it he did not like it so much. He has very small hands. Much smaller than mine and he didn't feel he was controlling the pistol well enough because he just couldn't get a good grip on it. After handling some other pistols he has decided he would like to have an XDM preferably in 9mm but .40 might be alright as well. His preference is for a 4"" or 3.8"" but he will settle for a full size. To trade the XDM must have all the back straps and the speed loader with it and preferably the other gear also, however it is not a requirement to have the holster or mag carrier as they are junk and will need to be replaced anyway but it would be nice.

    This Beretta is a state police trade in the proof mark is easily visible in the pictures. Its manufacture date is 1992. It has factory Trijicon night sites. Before I gave it to my son I sent the slide into Beretta and had the tritium tubes replaced so they are nice and bright. I have seen many of these trade ins but this one is by far the nicest I have come across. Other than the rounds we fired at the range the other day I would be surprised if it had been carried or shot much if at all. Anything in these pictures that looks like a flaw is simply due to the flash from the camera.

this rifle only has a 100 round box of ammo run through it
it shoots excellent and is accurate. it has diopter sights that are pretty easy to get a good sight picture. put a good scope on it and it would be a tack driver.
if you would like a scope i have one that i used only one trip to the range, it is a norin 2x6x28 rifle scope with accessorie rails and a mill dot reticle that you can turn on a red light ill let it go for 140.00. if you buy it and the rifle ill let it go for 650.00

it is a really nice ar rifle in 22lr inexpensive to buy ammo and shoot all day long

It is designed to maximize the impact of a defensive blow to an assailant during any ""Use of Force"" situation where the discharge of a firearm may not be viable or possible.

 This product features a tapered strike edge designed to enhance any sidearm magazines effectiveness as a defensive strike tool. The system can also be used in any situation where striking with the base of the weapon is required. Such as striking the window of a vehicle to remove an unconscious victim.

 We feel that our product adds several levels of improvement to any sidearm. This includes, but is not limited to; ease of removal of the magazine from a weapon (even in inclement weather), protecting the magazine from impact damage in ""drop and discard"" reloading situations and if a firearm related attack persists or critical weapon malfunction disables a weapon, this product can be used to inflict a devastating defensive blow. The product allows the magazine itself to remain as a weapon even if it is removed from the sidearm. For law enforcement, we hopes to provide this defensive product to officers as an equalizer in hand to hand combat with a larger opponent.
This product is currently available for 1911 and GLOCK with more models coming soon.

From the BlueBook:  DALY, CHARLES: JAPANESE MFG. : SHOTGUNS: O/U

In the early sixties, C. Daly guns were manufactured by the firm of B.C. Miroku in Kochi, Japan. This Japanese gun manufacturing company has produced guns for many companies, Browning being the biggest current customer. Miroku guns are high quality with excellent fit and finish. Many of them are highly engraved and are fine examples of the gunmaker's art. Charles Daly Miroku Guns are becoming quite collectible in some areas. Their production ceased in 1976.

Rifle is a perfect secondary, where you might have to make a longer shot on a hog or deer, where your regular rifle is dialed in on 200yds keep this dialed in on 500 so you can make sure you get a clean kill.  Or for the occasional big game hunter that doesnt want to spend 3 grand on a high end africa style rifle.  also is great if its raining and you dont want to take the rifle your granddaddy gave you out to hunt.

When you see the Gettysburg 1863 Revolver, designed after the classic Colt Model 1860 Army Revolver, you'll know why it earned the respect of soldiers on both sides of that conflict in July, 1863. 

Feeling its solid weight in your palm, you'll begin to understand the confidence of the Confederates who carried it up the slope of Cemetery Ridge, into the heart of the Union defenses. 

Listening to the smooth click of the hammer, you can also visualize the Union officers taking aim to protect that three-mile-long defensive line, desperately trying to hold the Union together. If this battle was lost, all could be lost, and they knew it. 

Studying the detailed, 24-karat gold scenes on the cylinder, you can feel the agony of these two seasoned and capable armies in a bloody battle to decide the future of our nation. 

Like anyone who has thrilled to the story of America's Civil War, I know that accounts of the Battle of Gettysburg inspire powerful images and emotions to this day. Still, no book or movie can bring these emotions to life as powerfully as just holding the Gettysburg 1863 Revolver."

I have a unique offering. Here is a beautiful condition Gen 2 Glock 19 compact 9mm. In my opinion, these are the best shooting, best looking Glocks ever produced.

In case you aren't familiar with Glocks, these Gen 2 models without finger grooves are highly desirable. Personally, they fit my hand much better than the newer models with the finger grooves. Guys spend hundreds of dollars sending their newer model 19s off to have grip reductions in order to mimic the look and feel of Gen 2 Glocks.

This gun in particular was produced on June 28, 1994, and I believe it to have 500 or fewer rounds down the pipe. I have NEVER experienced any type of malfunction in the 300+/- rounds I have sent down range.

I do not have to sell this gun, I am just looking to shuffle up the safe a bit. With that being said, don't bother with low-ball offers or silly trades such as Jennings, Lorcin, or Hi-Point. 

A bill of sale will be required, and I am happy to complete one for you on a trade. Proof of OH residency and age in the form of a drivers license or CHL will also be required. CHL holders will be given preference on this gun.

Included in sale is original Glock Tupperware, pistol, and original 10 rd Magazine. I have a 15 rounder available also if the price/trade is right."

Anybody educated on this revolver understands it is a ""forever gun"" it will out last you your children and most likely their children. Since I am the orginal owner I will require you sign a bill of sale and provide your drivers license #, if this is a problem, I don't want to do business with you. I am willing to provide all my info at point of sale/trade as well. 

***Comes with everthing pictured + factory box, factory grips ( houge rubber grips installed in pics)manual, etc. Holster is a Galco leather cowhide pancake, I think I paid $60 for it.

I don't really need to sell or trade( I do this strictly for kicks and it is cheaper than buying everything new..) I did buy this one new as they are near impossible to find used.., just have to many .357's and I have since moved to a .40 for concealed carry, so please spare me the low ball offers( if you can help it) Ha!

one last thing, there are a few scratches, but they are so minor that I could not get them to show up in the pictures, and could easily be buffed out, if one was so inclined to do so..

This is the 20th Anniversary unfired commemorative edition 9mm pistol that comes in a Oak Display case and the stand to display it at an angle.  It comes with a 15 round magazine and is serial numbered like the military model...M9-05-1278- 

It has nice walnut grips and gold embelishments on the slide stating :The Second Decade 1985-2005 Beretta USA Corp. - Accokeek, MD"" on the left side &"" America's Defender Beretta M9 - 92FS Cal. 9mm Parabellum"" on the right side of the slide. 

It comes in an oak presentation case with glass top and has a place for 5 brass medallions in the case - 1 for Air Force, Marines, Coast Gaurd, Navy & Army. I do not have the medallions.  There is also a two sided ""con"" medallion - one side says ""Pround Member United States Armed Forces with the American Eagle & American Flag.  The other side has United We Stand Defenders Of Freedom & has the 5 Armed forces listed:  Army - Marines - Navy - Air Force - Coast Gaurd.  The brass label in the case says ""Beretta M9 America's Defender - 20th Anniversary Edition - The Second Decade 1985 - 2005"".

This is a "" One of 2005"" pistols. It has post and dot sights and fancy, deluxe walnut wood grips. The grips have very beautiful grain to them.  This is a one of a kind investment that would really add significance to your collection.  It is very much useable also, so it could have a dual purpose."

For your consideration is a Remington 870 shotgun, built to outlast, outperform, and out-shoot all others, and with style. This 870 fires 2 3/4"" as well as 3"" Magnum loads. It can also carry up to 6+1 3"" shells. The barrel is a heavy walled Remington Police barrel, and the metal trigger guard, as well as the changing out of MIM parts help make this the most robust and reliable 870 available. It is equipped with the following:

*Receiver is nicely parkerized and says ""Remington Model 870 Magnum"" on one side. This receiver's mag tube does not have dimples like the Express models do, therefore allowing mag tube extensions without any modification.

* 18.5"" Remington 870 Police barrel with Improved Cylinder bore and adjustable rifle sights.

* Custom fitted and permanently attached steel heat shield

*Trijicon 3 dot night sights (still light up well)

*Military grade synthetic ribbed forearm

*Remington Mariner/High polished nickle/chrome action tube assembly and forearm nut

*Remington Mariner/High polished nickle/chrome shell lifter.

*Chrome police bolt assembly

*Milled police grade extractor from Remington (this shotgun contains zero MIM (Molded injected metal) parts unlike the 870 Express shotguns

*Cast metal military/police grade trigger guard/assembly


*Upgraded anti-walk trigger assembly pins that won't bump loose from recoil

*2-shot Remington Mag Tube extension

*Factory Mag tube extension barrel clamp

*Wilson combat extra power magazine spring for improved reliability

*Wilson Combat High Visibility magazine follower improves feeding and makes it easier to see that the magazine is empty.

*SpeedFeed III Tactical Magazine pistol grip stock holds a total of 4 2/34"" shells (2 on each side of stock)

*Sling swivel studs installed in stock and barrel clamp

*Includes factory Iron Sights if you so prefer to install them again in the future.

Mechanically this shotgun is pristine, the bore is bright and shiny, there is zero rust, and this is the most reliable shotgun you can get with such unique and incredible craftsmanship."

Made in the USA. Like new with original box.  Shot 100 times to sight/break in and one Antelope hunt (neck shot at 417 yards). Comes with 100pcs brass, RCBS dies and a Weatherby Mark V wood stock.  The brass is twice fired as I bought it once fired.  The stock is a second that I free floated the barrel and bedded the front lug.  My winter project was to refinish the stock but it really isn't that bad.  I am going to a 7mm Mag so this needs to find a new home.  I also have  various odds and ends bullets left over from when I had a 25 WSSM that I'll throw in (Berger and Barnes).  Also included is a set of Talley 1"" one piece rings/bases
