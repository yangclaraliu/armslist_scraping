Comes with one 10 round mag, and everything you see in the picture. Plus whatever extra parts I have, such as an extra bolt for the pistol grip (in case you want to use a different one), original forearm, sight adjustment tool.

This gun has only seen about 200 rounds through it to sight in a red dot, which turned out to be a piece of garbage and that's where it went. As for the rifle itself, it performed flawlessly.

The reason for selling it is that I need to fund a car restoration project I've undertaken. I've built this rifle for myself and spared no expense at getting the best parts. There's no way anyone can replicate this rifle for the price that is listed. 

Thanks for looking.

It is the RS model which has the traditional rounded trigger guard [makes it easier to find holsters for it] and straight front strap. It has a very light and hard to see idiot mark from the PO, and with the way these pistols field strip, it is hard to put the idiot mark on it. I tried getting a pic of it but would not show up on my camera.

Asking $775

The frame has been modified to a Glock 27 grip length.  This gun will accept g27 g23 and g22 mags. 
I realize this sort of mod is a niche thing.  I love it cause I can carry a compact frame with a longer slide and barrel for more accuracy.  Shoots so much better than the g27 and it pretty much the same size.  
No box or papers and it comes with only one mag show and its a g22 mag with a grip spacer installed.

These are a year and a half wait now...and not looking to lessen anytime soon. 
The SKS is a Chinese Parade (Police Dress?). Orignial woods stock, 10 round fixed magazine with spike bayonet. (inclouded).
The addons are the Shernic Bullpup stock, an SKS Magadapter (takes tapco 20 round mags with duck bill removed - straight in straight out mag changes like an AR) 4 tapco magazines are included. 2 modified for adapter, 2 stock 20rnd (I havent Modified them yet but this can be done with a dremel and modified mags as a template in about 10 minutes for both)
The front tri-rail is in place however, the rails have not shipped form shernic as they are behind production. I will pass them on if they come, but i bought a MagPul MOE 3 inch section and am going to use it instead. It too will come with rifle. 
So for this price you get the original stock, mag, bayonet, Chinese chest rig and NC star stripper clips, plus the 4 tapco mags (20 bucks a piece-modified were 25 a pece), sks mag adapter (100 buck new), Tri-rail mount, MOE rail with mounting hardware and all the pieces to adjust and work on or remove the Shernic kit. 
The total cost is pushing a grand. I have put around 300 rounds through SKS total since i bought it 11 years ago. It was meant to be a knock about gun but it sat in my closet till i put the Shernic on it. Now im back to not playing with it since i bought an MSAR bullpup. 
Trades i may consider are low end AR 15 in 223 or 5.45x39.
Will entertain other assault rifles in those calibres or in 7.62x39 or 7.62x25 or whatever. If you have good ar for trade i can add an EOTech 512 brand new (bought for this rifle cost me 450...you have something that catches my eye...ill toss it in). Im pretty easy goin so dont be afraid to offer something interesting.Selling cause i am  merely looking to move onto new toy."

SS109 is ""armor piercing"", in other words, light armor (helmets, body armor, etc.). However, it is not ""cop killer"" ammo like some say. It is probably the best all around ammo. V-max is an expanding varmint ammo that works good to disable anything. V-max is by-far the best ammo for killing or disabling something or someone. Ball ammo is is a full-metal jacket plinking ammo. The ball ammo is so cheap because it is assorted bullets (Lake City, Federal, Speer, etc.). Tracer is good because you can see it when you shoot it (day or night), and whatever it hits gets a hole burned in it after the tracer hits. Lethal. 

SS109 and Tracer are all Lake City components (casing, primer, bullet). 

All ammo is 5.56 Lake City brass casings with boxed primers (so the primers will not fall out or become dislodged). All ammo is loaded with 844 military powder to spec. (except Tracer, which is 844T).

All Ammo comes in a standard 50cal ammo can.

All ammo is commercially loaded and guaranteed. NOWHERE will you find this kind of quality ammo for this price!

The Smith uses a 38 S&W cartridge it is a model 4 best I can tell it was produced in the very early 1900's I have a case and a box of bullets to go with it. It was called a ""lemon squeezer"" because of the safety grip on the revolver. It is a 5 shot and considering the age it is in great shape very tight and fires well. The grip is made of a hard rubber. It does have a small chip in the underside of the grip that has been there since I purchased it 20 years ago. It is not noticeable unless you look at the bottom of the gun."

Shock 30g for 11ms                        It is a Multi-purpose Aiming Reflex Sight made by ITL Optronics. It has 4 recticle sizes and a built in IR laser that is zeroed with the red dot.  This is the standard optic used by the Israeli army on the Tavor and TAR 21 but has been used overseas by our guys on their M-4s. I had it mounted on my AR and loved it but decided to go with something with some magnification.  This is not some Chinese no name piece of junk, it is a genuine MARS sight.
I can email pics if interested.
 I am more interested in trades but would sell it outright for the right price. Let me know what you have, I'm willing to throw in some cash if you've got something nice.
No shipping please, local sale only. I'm willing to drive a little to meet you halfway."

The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity.   It has been carried a lot, but fired very little, just enough to break it in and make it very reliable.  It's in excellent condition.

The KEL-TEC P3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made.   It's mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel.  The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor.  The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer.  After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

I bought the rifle about a month ago as kind of an impulse buy. The rifle has only been shot one time when I took it out and put exactly 100rds through it. Included in the price is a Burris AR-332 prism sight that's very nice. It's designed specifically for AR-15 rifles. It is a fixed 3X magnification sight with a CQB (close quarter battle) reticle, that is composed of a circle with a crosshair inside for close range shooting but it also has series of five verticle dots which when the center dot is sighted in at 100yrds each subsequent dot is accurate in 100yrd increments out to 500yrds. The scope is green or red illuminated and with the unique reticle it is very versatile for all types of shooting.

Also included with the rifle are 3 magpul P-mags two of which are the new window mags that let you see how many rounds are remaining in the mag., magpul mbus flip up rear sight, magpul MOE pistol grip, the original bushmaster hard case, an Allen soft tactical rifle case, sling, and all factory paperwork. The price is firm so serious offers only please, I don't have time to respond to a bunch of low ball offers.

I've got a little over $1700 invested in the rifle and included accessories. The rifle retails for $1295 and the scope for just over $400.

 135 rounds have been shot through this rifle in total, without any mishaps.

The rifle has swivel holes molded into the stock, and the front one is broken off due to the use f a heavy bi-pod at the range, and me letting the muzzel raise and fall during recoil. Nothing outside of that would make the gun appear a used. Gun gets cleaned after every shooting trip, and is well maintained. 

You also have the offer to get the rifle with either the stock 3-9x40 scope,
or a Barska Illuminated Target Dot 6-32x50 scope that you can see in the link below

It is an early Shinosky model from the 1990's. 
Mr. Shinosky designs and creates some of the most beautiful custom knifes available. This, again, is a very early model he created without the use of gold, mother of pearl, or any exotic stones or metal. It's rather plain for a Shinosky knife.
I can't get a picture to do it any justice, it must be seen in person to be truley appreciated for it's intricate detail and engraving. Mr. Shinosky's engraving is so sought after, that he has taken on engraving of $10,000.00 - $50,000.00 instruments in the N.E. US.
I can e-mail you these pics, you can then enlarge them and get a better appreciation of this fine custom knife."

22,604 miles. This vehicle as seen in photos was running when purchased by me in the middle of 2011. It has not been started since. The battery is strong and engine turns but the gas lines have not been connected since the accident. Frame, forks, rims, handle bar are not bent. Accident appears to have been a lay-down and slid on right side - not an impact.

Has a ""Certificate of Destruction"" which means ""as is"" it cannot be tagged for street use in FL. Use it for parts or project. Basically the transmission & engine would have to be swapped into another frame if wanted to tag it and use it in FL. 

$650 

4 photos at very bottom show some road rash.

The ""HSGI"" Drop Leg Magazine Carrier - Single is the smaller version of the Drop Leg Magazine Carrier - Double. Built off of HSGI's Proven Diamond Mesh Platform, it maintains a firm and comfortable grip around the leg with little or no movement. It's features include: 1-Universal Magazine Pouch which will allow the operator to carry various types of magazine. For example: 3 M-4, or 2 AK, or 2 .308 magazines. It may also may carry 2 M-4 mags with coupler, or 1 M-4 mag along with a 1 M-18 Smoke Grenade. This pouch has adjustable shock-cord retention, hook and loop and side release buckle closure as well as a silencer strip for quite opening of flap. The interior of the pouch has a stirrup design to separate magazines, except AK mags. This also allows to stagger the mags for easy extraction of magazines. This unit includes 2 standard size (double stack) pistol mag and 2 extended (1"" taller) pistol mag style pouches to carry longer items such as mag-lights and folders. These pouches have the same hook and loop with silencer with side release buckle closure as the UMP. The belt hanger is adjustable to fit the drop length the user desires. Being that this subload is smaller there is no option to carry a knife sheath behind the rifle mag pouch. The single 2"" leg strap uses ( field replaceable) shock-cord for the leg strap retention rather than elastic which fails after a period of time. Constructed of 1000 Denier Cordura nylon, sewn with 135/138 bonded nylon threads. Constructed and made totally with products from in the USA. Has HSGI Lifetime Warranty."

I am looking for a 308/243/7-08 in a Remington700 or model 7, Winchester 70 or 670 or a Ruger. I mainly want it for the action so the barrel condition is not a major issue as long as the rest of the gun is good.
