Its the most desirable color combination, Near mint Condition, Has a few, very very small blemishes here and there from normal use. She runs very strong never had any problems with her at all. Always garaged and stored properly, This bike runs amazing, looks amazing and handles amazing.

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards 
SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year.
 This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.
 The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select
 one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change
 everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance."

This Rifle is optics ready or can come with the removable sights pictured with it. Comes with a 7 or 10 round magazine (your choice) and functions excellently as a semi-auto. Extras are available. 
This Rifle will be posted for several days and you can e-mail me your highest offers. After we've got all the offers it will go to the highest. If an offer is high enough I may stop this short and sell it to the first person that can meet with that cash.
I will take partial trades so please include what item you have and all applicable info (condition, etc.) along with the cash you're willing to add and I'll consider it with the others. 
When you fire this gun it's immediately obvious you're not behind a normal AR-15 in 5.56. It's got a kick to let you know there's a 50 cal bullet headed downrange. It is manageable though and is similar to shooting an auto 20g shotgun or maybe even lighter than that. It is a blast to shoot and this one works perfectly. Enjoy!"

Mounted on rifle, never used...sold rifle do no need scope.
Nikon Monarch 8-32X50ED SF....
Perfect for extreme long range hunting and target shooting.
Monarch Scopes were developed to give shooters increased versatility and superlative performance with virtually any type of rifle, in any caliber and in any imaginable hunting situation.
The Nikon 8-32X50ED SF is the first rifle scope to incorporate Nikon's exclusive and legendary ED glass. Nikon ED glass delivers superior sharpness and color correction for unmatched detail resolution. While still maintaining the American-preferred one-inch diameter main body tube, Monarch Riflescopes where developed to not only provide the shooter with a big, bright, sharp sight picture, but at the same time minimize the overall length of the scope-and maximize the mount ring spacing capability. The resulting line of rifle-scopes pushes the envelope of optical performance with Nikon's lead-and-arsenic-free Eco-Glass lenses and trademark Ultra ClearCoat anti-reflective multi-coatings, is fast-handling, pleasing to the eye and very importantly, allows for mounting on virtually any rifle-even magnum-length actions.

Nikon Monarch Rifle Scopes come standard with a locking side focus parallax adjustment. Nikon's easy-to-reach dials allow the user to quickly focus from the shooting position, in addition to the enhanced ring spacing, the new scope design includes the monarch eye box design with its impressive 4-time zoom range and a very comfortable 4 inches of eye relief that remains constant throughout the power range without sacrificing field of view. The Nikon Monarch 8-32x50 ED SF Matte Rifle Scope's massive ocular lens also delivers both a large high-resolution sight picture and the maximum field of view corresponding to each power setting. As an additional convenience feature, Nikon Optics has placed rear-facing magnification indicators on the zoom control and included a quick-focus eyepiece on the eye box."

The gun comes with it's factory issue pancake holster and an IWB holster designed to fit it as well, the IWB lost its connective belt straps so you will have to attach new ones with button clasps and a couple strips of leather. There is the factory hardcase, manual, and cleaning brush and one speedloader with some dummy rounds that i'll of course add in.

Matched Pair Youth Rifle/Shotgun

22 Long Rifle w/18.5"" Blued Barrel, 410 Gauge w/22"" Blued Barrel, Black Synthetic Stock, Youth Match

The Rossi Matched Pair has set the standard for 2-barrel guns. This combination long gun package is unequalled, having been recognized as the best 'youth-size' gun and a top notch 'full-size' backpack take-along. We start with one of our popular single shot rifles, then hand fit a shotgun barrel to create the Matched Pair. The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range. Change Barrels Faster Than You Can Change Your Mind To change barrels, make sure the firearm is unloaded. Loosen the front swivel and remove the forend and swivel. Open the action and insert the barrel, replace forend, tighten the swivel and you are done and ready to shoot. One screw, one minute, no tool, no kidding!

One of the icons of this class of weapon is the Springfield Armory M6 Scout Survival Rifle. 

The Springfield M6 Scout covers a variety of needs in both normal and emergency situations. Improved and updated from the original U.S. Air Force M6 Survival Rifle, the Springfield M6 Scout is a tough, reliable rifle you can depend on. 

Minimal moving parts 
Extreme durability 
Simple operation 
Exceptionally Reliable

The M6 was a standard component of survival kits for Air Force aircrews beginning in the 1950s through the early 1970s. The upper barrel is chambered for a .22LR round. The lower barrel is chambered for a 3"" .410 shotgun shell. 

The hammer is manually cocked, the barrel is manually selected and an oversized trigger accommodates easy firing – even with a gloved hand. 

An ammo magazine built into the stock, and secured by a locking cover, holds an emergency supply of .410 shells (4) and .22 cartridges (15). 

The M6 Scout features a folding stock which is easily detached via a quick-release pivot pin. An M6 breaks down in less than 5 seconds to a very compact overall length of 18"", providing easy storage on a boat, small plane, tractor or recreational vehicle (check local laws regarding storage). A specially designed trigger guard allows conventional finger firing, or full hand firing while wearing mittens or heavy gloves and weighs about 4lbs. 

This one is in very good condition. I do not have a case for it but they are available online at http://www.bodermansports.com/Firearms/Springfield_Armory/M6_Scout/m6_scout.html .

If you are looking for a survival weapon, the M6 should be at the top of your list!

I have a Glock 22 for sale. The gun is in pristine condition and has all the manuals, 3 15rd mags, night sights MH3 factory installed with the Glock logo on them. I still have the original Glock casings so you'll see that the gun was manufactured in 2008 and I've shot not even 500 rounds through it.
Like I said the gun is in perfect condition and I haven't seen one like it yet, here or on backpage that's I'm why firm on the price. We will only meet at a local police station, either metro or Henderson PD, preferably Henderson because that's where I live, where you can transfer the weapon under your name. I need the money for Xmas and please no low balling.
You can text/call me at REDACTED.

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

Removable hood on front sight with semi-buck horn style fold down rear sight.
Receiver grooved to accept dovetail 3/8"" rings.
Very nice walnut stock and far better than normal trigger for this vintage.
Shoots very well, .5"" groups (for me) at 50 yards, could do much better with
someone who shoots more stable.  All in all it is accurate for woodchuck hunting and deadly to 125 yards.

This is very accurate.  I can shoot dime sized targets at 25 yards and it is 100% effective for pest control.

The scope is an older BSA Air Essential 3-12x44 AO (adjustable objective).  Currently it is mounted with a set of 2 piece mounts.  If you want this scope with the rifle it will come with a 1 piece air rifle style high mount that will accept up to 50mm objective scopes.  This mount has a stop pin to keep the scope from moving.

Made with the strong Mauser 1898 action, this is a very rugged and trialed by fire weapon. This rifle sports a C.P. Goerz Berlin 6x Scope, with brass hardware. It is mounted to the rifle by the way of claw mounting which requires no re zero after attaching and detaching the scope, as long as your adjustments on the knob weren't touched its good to go.

Live fired only a handful of times by myself its pretty accurate and superbly scoped by the original builder. Great groups at 100 yards, and I'm pretty sure you could take her out further but I have no long distance place too shoot at ;)

It's been my reenacting rifle for about 5 years now and it is taken care of, but sports a ding on the bell from being dropped or knocked into something. It's purely cosmetic and is hardly noticeable unless staring down the rifle from the front. It does NOT effect the scope's visibility or anything else. Scope is also pitted, but it was made in 1910 and I don't know what people expect from a scope thats 100 years old and survived both world wars....

It is a waffenampt rifle and so are most of its parts, and the stock has a flat butt plate as per early pattern regs. NICE Waffen marked stock with H for HEER or Army. Has a non-catching mag plate so you can open and close the bolt without having to hold down the floor plate, as per early war reg. Comes with reproduction sling for a 98k mauser, and cleaning rod (original).

I'm really needing the cash too fix my truck, but I can take trades, $1000 or Best Offer"

I really don't know where to even begin pricing the gun as new with the scope and mounts there is about $3500 in it. Obviously to ask even $3000 for it would be crazy.

Well I am cleaning out the safe a little bit for Christmas.  Wife says I have too many AR-15's.  I have four for sale and they are all a little different.  All uppers are State of the Art Arms uppers.  All lowers are NFA Lowers (Polymer Lowers made out of the same material glocks are made out of).  Weigh about 2/3 the weight of a normal AR lower and have a fantastic trigger pull (no side movement and very crisp.  All AR's have 6 position stocks and all of them come with either a colt or Okay 30 round magazine.

All AR-15's are brand new and have never been fired.  All AR-15's have the following:

--Chambered for 5.56 Nato/223
--16"" barrels
--M4 feed ramps
--M16 bolt carrier group
--one railed aluminum gas block (hidden on quad railed uppers)

These are getting impossible to get and wait times are ridiculous.  I may be open to some trades but cash is king considering the wife wants some of my guns gone.  Prices are also pretty firm as I don't know if I will ever be able to replace these with the direction the country is going in."
