As set up, it is nearly identical to the M-16 A4, a common DMR (Designated Marksman Rifle) in use with our nations military.  Has fired around 300 rounds and has minor handling wear (as much as you'd expect it to have from the few range trips it has had).  Is in great working condition, I just wanted to explain that while it is in excellent working condition, it is not new.  It is a SAA lower, Surplus Ammo & Arms (whom used to manufacture for Armalite and Spikes before going into their own business).  Upper is a Rock River Arms.  Has KAC M5 rail system, the same in use with our US military which retail for around $390 by themselves.  Also uses a Troy flip-up rear sight, which sells for around $100-140.  Comes with the Magpul ladder rail protectors (with cuts for light and pressure switch) and P-Mag as seen.  What you see in the picture comes with the purchase (unless we negotiate otherwise).

Details:  20"" HBAR 1/9 twist, chrome-lined barrel, 5.56/.223, A2 buttstock and grip and front sight, flat-top, KAC M5 RIS, Troy rear flip sight.

Any questions, or offers feel free to contact.  Am willing to negotiate in price and meet location (best offers obviously get preference).  *Greatly* preferring cash on this one, but will consider full/partial trades *only* if they are decidedly in my favor (fiber optic ACOG's, M1A, what have you got?).  Mostly looking to raise funds for my next project but would have trouble turning down the right trade.  Thank you for your time, and have a great day!

This rifle shoots great and eats any ammo you feed it. I've run everything from crappy import surplus up to 175gr match ammo. It's lightweight for a 20"" 308 AR. Weighing in at 9lb 7oz without scope. Very well balanced with little recoil.
I'll include 1ea C-products 20 round mag (pictured) and 1ea Magpul 20 round 7.62 Pmag that's been Duracoated in matching FDE color.
Will also include the original Remington box, hard case and all paperwork.

This is not a safe queen, so the finish is a little worn on high spots and there are a few nicks and scratches from use. Overall, the duracoat is holding up quite well and looks great.

The price as pictured with scope is $1300. If you do not want the scope and rings, the price is $1050. I prefer cash, but may be interested in a full or partial trade for high-quality firearms or optics.

Included is the soft case and rail covers. 1350 FtF. These rifles are getting harder and harder to find for under 1500. Email me to make an offer.

ONLY trades I would be interested in is for an Arsenal AK plus appropriate cash, or a very nice AR15 with a chrome lined barrel plus appropriate cash.

Also, the rifle has a removeable stainless muzzle brake installed. The end of the barrel is threaded to accept the brake or thread protector if you want to shoot it without the brake.

This is a CZ 75 SP-01 that has been modified for close quarter combat. It has been fitted with a scope mount weaver rail. There is a reflex sight set to 50 feet mounted on the back of the rail, and a mini laser sight mounted on the front that sits below the line of sight of the reflex sight. The reflex uses ambient light to project a red dot (so no batteries needed). The pistols iron sights are true dot night sights for use in low light settings, and the pistols laser can be used in low light to even greater effectiveness. The pistol comes with two 19 round mags, and there is a spare detachable 16 round mag clipped to the front underside picatinny rail that can be released by a simple button push. This front mag makes a combat reload very easy when a spare mag is needed quickly. The pistol is more accurate than I am, and all means of sighting are pin point accurate as well. The pistol fires hollow point +P ammo with no issues, and as CZ's are notoriously well made (with some of the best metal of any pistol in production) there is little issue with wear and tear on this weapon with a ""heavier load"". The pistol has been fitted with after market hogue grips for comfort and better grip, as well as a metal guide rod. The adapter for front mounting the spare mag is very hard to find and not made or sold in the US any longer. Please let me know any questions you might have, I do this as a hobby and only enough rounds were put through it to test the firearm and help zero in the different sights (around 100 shots fired)"

This is a good solid piece of hardware. I had it out at the range on 5/22 and was hitting 5"" targets at 50 yards. This SW99 is chambered in .40, and is especially fond of Winchester SXZ 180gr JHP ammo.

This sale is for the gun and mags only, I do not have an original case or other accessories. 

If you contact me and I do not respond quickly it is either due to that being a secondary email address or you have low-balled me an offer. Questions and realistic offers will be responded to, even if it is with a polite ""No thank you"""

Verified by Remington on the phone and stampings on barrel are correct. It is the more desirable BDL with hinged floorplate. It also has the decorative ebony forend and ebony pistol grip end on the factory decorative walnut stock. The butt plate is the metal 2 screw. Nice condition especially considering its age. Shoots great tight groups and has nice rifling. Took it to my Remington certified pro armorer today and he said it was good to go and was impressed. It was very windy but we proceeded anyway. First he put 2 in the center at 30yds just for reference before we hopped in the truck, then he shot 3 shots at 350 yds still in bad wind. 2 shots half inch apart and the 3rd about 4 inches away. Even with the bad wind, I was impressed as he was. We were using 180 grain Remington Core-lokt so it was not the high dollar stuff nor the best selection. The Bushnell Elite 3200 scope Is 3x9x40 I believe. It is adjustable and works perfectly and smooth. The rifle has an old school leather sling that has brass rivets and looks great and period correct on the rifle. Rifle bolt action and ejection is great, even at low speeds. You do not have to be rough with it. This is not a desperation sale. 925obo. Please send any questions or offers. I may even consider trades(or a couple of them if needed) but would rather sell. Here is some more about the scope. I will even include a little ammo, God bless.

However, once you DO have one, they are pretty incredible. It will burn or melt most things dark colored. You can cut through plastics, light cigs, pop balloons, start fires, etc. The beam is so powerful that if you pointed it straight up in the air, no only can you see the beam the entire way up, but the only reason it doesn't hit outer space is because our inner atmosphere diffuses the beam. If you were at sea, and pointed the beam straight out in front of you, the only reason you aren't able to see it past a certain point is because of the curvature of the Earth.

I bought a Browning Silver Stalker 28"" Dura touch at JAX in Fort Collins back in February.  I've taken up competitive shooting and just bought a Citori so I need to sell this gun to help pay for that one.  I bought it for $1,100 so I am asking $900 but I will consider a reasonable offer.  It has not been shot very much and it includes 3 chokes (Full, IC, and MOD) and I also had a gunsmith install a HiViz comp sight so that's $60 right there.  If interested, I can also provide a breakdown case for $50."

Has night sights and comes with one mag. I don't really want to sell it but I need to move and need money for that.

$450 is the lowest I'll go. It's got holster wear but otherwise it's in great condition on the inside and on the frame rails. This is an excellent deal.

I have several smokes available, prices are as flexible if you have an offer or trade:

ALS CS Smoke  -  $100, 1 left
ALS CS Rubber Ball  -  $150 (SOLD!)
Deftec Triple-CS Smoke  -  $200

ALS CS Grenade  -  Identical to an M18 colored smoke grenade, has a burn time of approximately 30 seconds and gives off a dense cloud of teargas.  The grenade body will be hot afterwards, and is not safe to handle and has a fire risk.

ALS Rubber Ball  -  identical to the regular smoke above, but without a pyrotechnic charge.  This one does not heat up and is safe to use indoors or in dry brush, and is immediately safe to handle afterwards.

Def-Tec Triple-CS  -  This one has three separate charges, each with a 20-30 second burn time.  You throw it high into the air, and the fuze separates the three charges for a wider area of dispersion.  Essentially similar to throwing three CS smokes at once, but in a grenade only barely larger than a single grenade (still fits in normal smoke or flashbang pouches)."

This is one of them.

KKF (Kurt's Kustom Firearms), a well known operation in Florida (sadly no longer with us due to a motorcycle accident a few years ago) made many of these custom uppers.  I have one of the first.

Built on a M4 flattop AR upper, Kurt took a new 16"" Bulgarian AK-74 barrel (chrome lined and designed from the ground up for the 5.45x39 cartridge) and mated it perfectly to the AR upper.  He drilled a gas port in the midlength position as well.  We then took a Young's National Match chrome bolt carrier, key, cam pin, and firing pin and got an Alexander Arms .221 Genghis bolt - AA did the first 5.45x39 uppers many years ago, and these bolts are top-notch.  

A YHM Phantom flash suppressor, YHM Spectre Length Diamond FF handguard, adjustable gas block with midlength gas tube, Badger Tactical charging handle, and Magpul MBUS sights rounded it all out.

I've got about 400 rounds through the upper.  Other than when I screwed around with the buffer weights and springs, it functions flawlessly.  I am including a Spikes T2 tungsten powder buffer and CS blue extra-power spring with it since this is the combo that runs most reliably.  Accuracy is incredible - honestly, I'm shooting 2-3 MOA with this using surplus spam can ammo - yeah, that good.  Must be the Bulgarian barrel.

I am also including another adjustable gas block with midlength tube - this is a railed block in case you decide to swap the other one out - I switched them out because I wanted to use rail-height BUIS sights.

Meticulously cleaned and maintained.

Now, there are some scratches and dings here and there, mostly on the gas block from my ham-handed attempt to remove it without using something to keep the tools from marring the metal - I've filled it/covered it with black marker and honestly it doesn't look too bad.  The replacement gas block doesn't look as bad.  I haven't ""set"" the set screw yet as some people may want to tweak the gas settings - but my suggestion would be once you find the sweet spot, use some blue loctite and set the screw so it doesn't move its way out after lots of rounds.

I am including (12) 30 round mags - 4 of them are Gen 1 C-Products mags, 8 of them are Gen 2 C-Products mags.  All work flawlessly, thanks to the upgraded springs and white followers in them - honestly, they work great and I've had NO problems since I upgraded them.

I've got close to $1150 in this upper and accesories and mags.  I'm asking $750 for the entire kit and caboodle.  Might consider trades, though I'm not really in need of anything right now other than good 5.56 ammo, maybe some optics/red dots - who knows?

If you are local (Central FL) I can meet you and unload some ammo on you as well - $150 per spam can of 1080 rounds.

Also have a complete lower (Stag) that I might sell as well - has Foliage Green MIAD full pistol grip, CTR stock, all internals.  Will do a package deal for the upper and lower.

Also have a Vortex SPARC red dot optic that I can include for $175 as well."

No more looking around trying to find the parts or wondering what tools are needed.  The ""Complete Kit"" comes with everything listed below:
SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, Interface Bock, Mil-Spec 6-Position Buffer Tube, Castle Nut, H2 Buffer, Carbine Buffer Spring, End Plate, Hex Key, Spanner Wrench, Instructions, and BATFE Approval Letter.
Slide Fire Solutions ground breaking ""Slide Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide the ability to Slide Fire safely - offering a new element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere!
Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire - this new radical design enables the operator to shoot as quickly as desired without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them.  Unlike when traditionally bump firing; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to firmly hold their rifle and maintain complete control at all times.  In addition, as a result of the shooter pushing forward to discharge each round, the operator is able to correct their point-of-aim for each shot and prevent recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction.
In principal the SSAR-15 functions similar to the Gatlin system.  When operating the Gatlin system the shooter operated a crank in a circular motion to discharge a round.  Every 1/5 of a rotation a round would be fired - the shooter would then have to continue forward another 1/5 of a rotation to fire the next round, and so on;   With the SSAR-15; the operator moves the upper assembly forward to discharge a round.  To discharge the next round the operator must again move the upper assembly forward.  Just like with the Gatlin system; a rifle equipped with the SSAR-15 will never fire automatically.
MADE IN THE USA
    * Available in Right and Left Hand Models
    * Winter Trigger Guards and some Sling Plates may not be compatible
    * SFS recommends installation of Complete Kit be performed by a qualified gunsmith
Note:
The SSAR-15 is NOT a mechanical device.  It does not perform any automatic functions, and does not increase a rifles rate of fire.
The SSAR-15 is a rifle stock.  It requires the shooter to activate the firing mechanism for each and every round that is fired.
At any time - if the shooter fails to apply forward pressure to move the firearm back into the firing condition - the firearm will not fire.

I'm going to be conservative and say this weapon is in NRA Very Good condition with a heavy lean toward the Fine side. I've seen several others rated Fine that are in a lot worse condition than this one.
This is number 538955 with an acceptance stamp of 1892.
All the typical markings for this gun are present.
It has 6 groove rifling.
The bayonet/cleaning rod is included, but the rod ends are long gone.
Unit markings on the stock are a large ""22"" with a smaller ""12"" below it. The numbers show traces of yellow paint.
On the other side of the stock is marked 22 Sep Co. I believe this is an Ohio National Guard/Militia unit. Any info on this would be appreciated.
The family legend was that it went up San Juan Hill, but of course we'll take that with a grain of salt until the actual unit can be ascertained.
This weapon is a relic and can be shipped within the US for a considerable fee.

Slide Fire Solutions’ ground breaking “Slide Stock” technology and ergonomic design provide the ability to Slide Fire safely – offering a new element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere!

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire – this new radical design enables the operator to shoot as quickly as desired without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them.  Unlike when traditionally bump firing; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to firmly hold their rifle and maintain complete control at all times.  In addition, as a result of the shooter pushing forward to discharge each round, the operator is able to correct their point-of-aim for each shot and prevent recoil from pushing the firearm’s muzzle upward in an unsafe direction.

In principal the SSAR-15 functions similar to the Gatlin system.  When operating the Gatlin system the shooter operated a crank in a circular motion to discharge a round.  Every 1/5 of a rotation a round would be fired – the shooter would then have to continue forward another 1/5 of a rotation to fire the next round, and so on….  With the SSAR-15; the operator moves the upper assembly forward to discharge a round.  To discharge the next round the operator must again move the upper assembly forward.  Just like with the Gatlin system; a rifle equipped with the SSAR-15 will never fire automatically.

MADE IN THE USA

  * Available in Right and Left Hand Models

  * Winter Trigger Guards and some Sling Plates may not be compatible

  * SFS recommends installation of Complete Kit be performed by a qualified gunsmith

Note:
The SSAR-15 is NOT a mechanical device.  It does not perform any automatic functions, and does not increase a rifles rate of fire. 

The SSAR-15 is a rifle stock.  It requires the shooter to activate the firing mechanism for each and every round that is fired.

At any time - if the shooter fails to apply forward pressure to move the firearm back into the firing condition - the firearm will not fire.

I am looking for a nice Semi-Auto hand gun (no 22's). Please don't ask me if I would trade a Hi-point even. Not saying anything wrong with them, but I just don't like them myself. 

If you have something else to trade (of equal value) , just send me an email. I would rather trade then sell, just wanting a fare trade."

More about the gun from Benelli: The Benelli M2 Field is the workhorse of the semi-auto Benelli shotguns, with the speed of a thoroughbred. Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the M2 12-gauge shotgun and 20-gauge shotgun are built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism. The Inertia Driven® system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12 gauge cartridge, from 2-3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums.Benelli engineers have also adapted the ComforTech® recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48% and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the shooter back on target up to 69% faster than with any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new ComforTech® system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you will ever shoot."

It is a 1968 commercial model with the Government slide (Colt mfg these every so often and this was one of the years).  I welcome anyone to take it in and have everything verified if they are interested, I have done this with a local 1911 collector to be sure I was selling is what I thought I was as many times people swap stuff out on these older guns.  I am looking for a cash offer or a trade for an AR-15 or a 1911 framed .40S&w for my wife.  I purchased this as a ""safe gun"" and thought maybe one day the value would increase.  The value decreased a bit with the economy like everything else so my loss ( a big loss) is your gain.  This would make a great shooter so I figured someone may appreciate it more than me.   I love Colt 1911's but have fallen in love with the performance of my para ordnance's (I know, I know, but for me they just feel and perform better) That said, I don't shoot my Colts all that often anymore.  I have already thinned the herd and this will be the last to go. This is a great opportunity for someone who wants an old Colt to own one.

Sorry, for the manufacturer, there was no LRB option, so I picked the one that matched the part set and the stock - the closest option IMHO.

It has the quad-rail flat-top front sight so that any optic you mount to the flat-top upper will not be obscured by the front sight.  This quad-rail allows the mounting of virtually anything you would like to it, from lasers to lights to custom sling mounts (either bottom or side mounts).  You can also mount the pop-up front and rear iron sights on it as well. 

The upper has a Picatinny rail system with numbered stations so that if you remove an optic, you can easily replace it at exactly the same spot.

Of course it has the flash suppressor that doubles as a compensator since the bottom is solid instead of having openings in it.  This also keeps the muzzle blast from kicking up so much dust if you are firing it from the prone position. 

THIS WEAPON IS UNFIRED.  I bought the lower and upper separate and put them together myself.  I did this because I wanted an upper with a quad-rail on the front sight to go with the flat-top rail system on the upper, and I couldn't find all of that on any gun under $1000 that was pre-assembled. 

This is my personal AR, but I am willing to part with it because I need the cash.  I am only asking $750 for it.  If you have any questions or want any other pics, please let me know.
