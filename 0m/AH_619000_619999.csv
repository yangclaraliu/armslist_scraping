Are you looking for a tough as nails pistol in a big bore caliber that can take whatever you put it through? This is it.....

This is a like new Taurus pt101p. It is chambered in .40s&w. This is exactly like the beretta 96 but built alot better. It will swap with a ton of beretta 92/96 parts and can use the beretta 96 mags with a small modification to the mag. I own several beretta 92's and 96's and then i did the research. The beretta has plastic internals (even the guide rods are plastic!) where as the Taurus is all metal. Taurus bought the factory, the machines and the patents for the m9/92/96 series and made them better with metal internals and the safety/decocker on the frame instead of the slide. Brilliant! But anyways, about the gun.......

This is the ""p"" series that holds more than the original pt100/101. (will also accept the 18/20/30rd mags) It has had no malfunctions at all since i've owned it! Comes with the white 3-dot adjustable night sights , 2-16rd mags, Hogue rubberized grips, the rail underneath for a light/laser, the factory box with manual, factory keys to the taurus locking system and the original purchase reciept. This is a dependable, trust your life to it, end of the world pistol that has been taken very good care of and is a blast to shoot. Has been kept clean and oiled and it was cleaned/oiled at the range right after shooting. I dont want to sell it but I need to get a 9mm (looking for a Taurus pt92/pt99 but you never know) and something else (cash, a shotgun, a rifle etc.). My wife and I are smaller people so the .40 is a little much. That is the only reason i am selling/trading it. 

REDUCED!!!.......$475 cash price but would rather trade.  Face to Face in Tulsa only, will not ship. Must be a NON-FELON, have a valid drivers license and be willing to sign a bill of sale/trade.

Wanting cash but might trade for a Taurus pt92/pt99 9mm and a pt22 (.22lr) or a 12 gauge and some cash or a 357 and cash or the mossberg zombie 30-30 and.....?.....

It is in like-new condition, with less than 50 rounds through it. It works perfectly, no jams. It is built around a Pre-Ban Colt 16"" flat-top upper on a Mega Arms forged lower. It has a 6-position stock and a C-Products 10 round stainless steel magazine. The lower parts kit is DPMS. The pivot pin is DPMS, not Colt. The original box for the Colt upper will be included, although I don't have any of the original Colt paperwork. Also, please note that this takes AR-15 style mags (in 7.62x39, of course) and not AK-47 mags. High-quality, US-made, stainless steel magazines made by C Products Defense are readily available this rifle for in 5, 10, and 30 round capacities. In fact, I have some of each, and you can have them for what I paid for them.

The Colt upper is in original Colt configuration, although it wasn't always that way. I had replaced the Colt front sight/gas block and gas tube with a custom gas system (I can provide photos if you'd like). I had also replaced the Colt flash hider with a PWS recoil brake. I have removed all those parts, though, and reinstalled the Colt parts. However, there is now a small set screw mark on the barrel and you can tell the front sight pins were taken out and reinstalled. There are also very minor marks (rubbed edges, really) on some of the Picatinny rail slots from where I once mounted a scope and, later, a rail riser.  Still, the whole gun is in excellent condition and looks virtually brand new.

I am also selling the many accessories I have for this gun, at the cost I paid for them 2-3 years ago. These include a UTG soft case, several C-Products magazines (various sizes), a Harris sling swivel/bipod adapter, a UTG bipod, a Tapco recoil pad, a Daniel Defense heavy buffer, an NcSTAR ACOG clone scope with integrated laser, an NcSTAR red dot sight scope, a Yankee Hill Machine rail riser, a Midwest Industries low-profile gas block, an MGI regulated/adjustable gas tube, a custom grip, a PWS recoil brake, a Brownell's stock wrench, a couple spare Olympic 7.62x39mm bolts, a spare DPMS lower parts kit, and a UTG adjustable rear sight. Almost all of these are brand new, the rest are like new.  Email me if you are interested in any of these, as I have a comprehensive list with prices, links, etc.

I'm asking $999 plus actual shipping for the complete rifle or $749 plus actual shipping for just the upper. These prices are firm, as I am not willing to lose money on this if I don't have to.

I will only sell this to someone who has legitimate feedback on eBay or Gunbroker or long-standing forum activity on a gun forum.

I am not interested in any trades whatsoever."

Rifle has less than 100 rounds through it and has been cleaned before and after shooting. I still have the original box and paperwork and a bill of sale will be provided. The white on the engravings is nail polish and should hold up (has on my xdm) but can be easily removed. Would trade for a 5.56 complete flat top upper like the one thats currently on this rifle.

I have a few things for sale, first I have two used 17 round magazines for a 9mm Beretta 92fs. I'm not sure on the brand because they have no markings but I have used them on several occasions at the range and they work just as good as the original Beretta brand. Next I have a used Hogue wrap around rubber grip with finger grooves also for the Beretta 92fs, it may fit other models. Next I have a used right handed Galco Miami Classic shoulder holster in the tan leather for the Beretta 92fs, it should fit other models as well. Next I have a used right handed black generic dropleg holster for fullsize pistols. Last I've got three HK USP 40c magazine floor plates. Two of them are used and one is new. These items are used but in good working condition. Items may show some wear from usage but in good working order. 
Prices are as followed:

9mm mags - $15 each or $25 both - **SOLD**
Hogue grip - $15 - **SOLD**
Galco holster - $120 **SOLD**
Dropleg holster - $20
HK floor plates (all 3) - $20

All prices are OBO + shipping and paypal fees (If applicable)

 I will try to add photos on here but last time I posted something I had trouble uploading them but either way I can send pics upon request. All Items are For Sale only, not looking for trades unless you've got a right handed Galco miami classic 2 shoulder holster in the tan leather for an HK USP 40 compact. I'd rather meet up in person but if someone needs an item shipped, I could do that too but buyer pays for shipping and 4% paypal fees. Anyone interested can contact me at my email REDACTED or by phone, preferably text, at REDACTED. Thanks for looking at my listing.

Owned the gun 1.5 years. It shows no evidence of holster wear; the stainless is wicked hard on this gun. It has never failed to feed, fire or eject - not once in 600 rounds I've put through it.

Note that this gun has a decocker and a safety, and the 800-series guns are hammer-fired - so if you don't like striker-fired guns, this one is for you.

I have the box, one 13-round and one 17-round magazine, the manuals, a brush, a magazine loader.



The gun is compact (3.5"" bbl), and very flat for a double-stack magazine-fed gun. The trigger pull is crisp in SA, and the DA pull is long but smooth. It's very safe to carry and so comfortable and light that it is perfect. It's really been a gem, but I fell in love with a Turkish beauty and have been carrying her instead ever since.

The top rail is 2pc full length, from flash hider to charging handle. The forearm is a floating (doesn't touch the barrel) 4 rail that is heavily vented. It also has 3 rail covers so you can hold it comfortably without an attached grip. It has a deep flash hider (like the flaming pig). The bolt carrier has the longer rear rail to keep the bolt action more reliable over time. The AR-15 forward assist works. This lower is legally a handgun. I can sell that also if you want it. Maybe $775 for a complete firearm.

I took it out and test fired it's first 20rds. My 9.5"" upper kicked like a small mule & was a fireball. This one at 7.5"" rides VERY smooth to the point I thought the first round was a misfire. My friend shot better with this than his own .40cal handgun and said it was because the .40 kicks harder. It's an amazingly smooth shooter. But my (ex!) girlfriend doesn't get to keep it so I'm selling it.

These 454 Alaskan's are hard to find and expensive when you do (ask me I know !)

I bought it to take Elk Hunting due to bear problems (Grizzly) in Idaho but a health problem and hip problem will now keep me out of the hunting fields.

Cost of gun at purchase was $860.00 plus tax here in Idaho but will take $800.00 if you want to buy it outright.  Would consider trading for something I can shoot at the range, or carry as a concealed gun.  I do want this Alaskan to go to a fellow Idahoan not out of state."

Tight barrels to receiver and opens closes good, matching numbers (receiver, barrels, forearm piece).  I bought at a public sale, and have not fired but believe it will. Condition is fair overall, as the pistol grip area wood is cracked and loose (looks to have been pinned some years ago already) but all there for possible rework, gluing, beading. The barrels are short...about 24"", choked at about open and modified to open. Barrel finish is poor, had heavy rust in some places, shows pitting from a previous owner's gross negligence in proper oiling. Forearm piece looks good. Locks and receiver below average but definitely restorable. This gun has much potential for possible restoration, and is an excellent gun if you needed parts....I just saw a forearm piece similar to this one sell on eBay for just over $200.  That said, I want $350 cash and carry for it. Dealers welcome, may consider Winchester .22 Lever rifle or a .44 double action magnum pistol in trade. Located in Aiken, SC 29803."

It is $1,300 new. It has very very slightly been used, because I am still in college and dont have time. That is why I am selling it. 
It has been kept in a hard case and not in a basement. Cleaned frequently and has cycled only around 200-400 brass cased rounds and no steel cased rounds. 
It comes with a hard case, original manual, original magazine, original box, and lock. Everything a new one would. 
This is the 22 inch barrel model. There are no signs of wear on it besides on the casing reflector where it is meant to have contact with the ejected casings.
If you are interested in the scope I will give a significant discount to the person who purchases the rifle. The scope is a Barska 6-24x44mm illuminating reticle scope. It has a lifetime warranty and is in brand-new condition. Comes with everything a new one would including all the packaging, sun shade, wipe, lens covers, manual, etc. $250 new.

The HK USP 40 is in great functional shape and shows minor holster wear. The Glock is in great functional shape as well, there is very minor holster wear on it, but you would have to look very close to find it. The HK comes with one 13 round factory magazine and is $525. The Glock comes with installed Metrolight Tru Dot night sights, 2 15 round factory magazines, and factory plastic box. The price for the Glock is $450.

I can meet this afternoon or early evening in Raleigh or anywhere off 40, between there and Winston Salem. I will need to see your NC concealed carry permit or I can take a NC purchase permit, plus valid ID.

Both are all matching, the scope mount on the PEM is stamped matching to the rest of the rifle. Both are 1943 Izhevsk's, and have outstanding bores, plus they shoot great. The PEM gets about 1.5"" groups with standard Russian copper-wash surplus ammo, and the 91/30 gets about 3"" (both at 100yds.). The PEM is a reproduction, as they no longer made PEM sniper rifles in 1943, however it was very nicely done and there are no visible import marks. I am looking to trade these two rifles (together) for something new, as my Russian mosin collection has grown a little out of control, and since I already have 2 other PEM's (one being an original Tula), I figure I'd offer it up for someone who wants one but doesn't want to pay $3k + for an original or wait to have a gunsmith tackle it. I haven't seen many PEM's (original or repro) pop up on the web for a long time, so once this one goes, that may be it for a long time. 

Here's a list of things I am looking for:
- Finnish Mosins (M91's, M27's, M28's)
- FAL 
- Romanian PSL
- An AK variant (such as a Yugo M72, no WASR's)
- (2) Unissued Yugo SKS's (I can throw a little cash your way too)
