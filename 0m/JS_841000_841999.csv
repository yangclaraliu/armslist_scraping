I have a Simmons scope 3-9x40 mounted on it. Also going with it is a ammo holder that velcros on the butt stock, and the rear site that was removed.  You can see in the pics that it has been used and enjoyed. These are great rifles.  It shoots great and kicks like a mule.  If I didnt already have a newer one hanging on my wall, I'd be having the finish redone and keep it. You just dont run accross these Winchesters much anymore.

I've assembled the Dangerous Game Machine Rest, and attached the shooting bench platform. I'm selling at my cost. I paid dealer cost & shipping. 

Cash only. Firm on price as this is new and at dealer cost. 

The Dangerous Game® Machine Rifle Rest uses Nitrogen filled compression dampers to absorb the recoil. If the rifle rest is firmly anchored to a solid bench, the gun will return to battery after every shot. Since the compression damper absorbs the recoil, in a manner similar to your shoulder, there is no need to worry about damage to stock, bedding or recoil lugs. This is in sharp contrast to other products that require extensive realignment after each shot and offer more resistance that is manageable for the structure of the gun. Equipped with one light, one medium and one heavy, factory calibrated, compression damper. There is no equal for sighting in or load testing. By using the remote hydraulic trigger release, the rifle rest eliminates any human induced motion contamination. Achieve a tight group without the discomfort of recoil.

Attach bench platform to shooting bench with C clamps for solid shooting platform.

Smoothly handles everything from a .223 to a .416 Rigby, including .50 BMG."

In all seriousness I have a Beretta 92G. That means decocker only instead of the usual decocker/safety. Pretty sure it's a Police trade in as it's got quite a bit of finish wear on it and older night sights. IIRC the sights are dated 05, but they still shine enough to be useable.

Pistol has new Elite hammer installed, new factory D hammer spring, and new factory recoil spring. If you aren't familiar with Berettas this means it has a fancy looking hammer from a higher end 92 and a double action only hammer spring so the DA pull is lighter. It's ugly, but shoots like a champ. Comes with 4 15 round mags, 2 I think are phosphate coated .mil mags and 1 10 round mag. I think the 2 .mil 15 rounders are CheckMate, the other 2 15 rounders are factory Beretta, and the 10 rounder is Mecgar.

It's been 100% reliable through the 300ish rounds I've shot through it. Shoots great, I'm just moving in a different direction.

What I'd like? A long slide Glock, whether that be a 17L, 24, 34, 35, whatever. Just want the long slide.  Might be interested in Glocks that aren't 9mm.  Also interested in .357 revolvers, those aren't gonna be banned BUT HIGH CAP SEMIS ARE PANIC TRADE YOUR GRANDPA GUNS FOR THIS EVIL ASSAULT BERETTA

I have a used Bulgarian Arsenal 107F. I bought it used a couple months back. It has normal wear associated with an AKM. I've only put about 100 rounds through it to sight and check for function. It has no issues holding ~3"" groups at 100 yards. It is the folding stock model. It folds for easy storage, but still has a comfortable cheek weld unlike wire folders or under folders. 

I have installed a Texas Weapon System Dogleg Generation II scope rail and peep sight. The addition of the peep sight and extra sight radius makes for much easier shooting at distance. Ultimately, I planned to scope this, but I want to go a different direction now. Also included is the original sight, serial numbered dust cover, and original recoil guide in case you want to remove the TWS Dogleg.

Included with the rifle is 500 rounds of Herter's ball ammo, 12x 30 round magazines, 2x 20 round magazines, VTAC sling, and wire sling loop. The magazines are a mix of Chinese, German, and Eastern European. The 20s are Hungarian, I believe.

I was originally going to sale this rifle, but then the gun control debate intensified. Since the price gouging has gotten ridiculous, I am offering to trade. This is my only AK and I would rather be stuck in any potential next ban with an additional AR for parts and magazine commonality."

As a standalone product, the rapidly-convertible MS3 allows an operator to leverage the maneuverability of one-point attachment for direct action, or two-point attachment for stability. Single-hand adjustments and quick-release, positive-locking hardware provide flexibility and durability in a truly adaptable sling system.

Used in conjunction with the Magpul ASAP® plate (sold separately), the MS3 enables seamless transitions into an array of shooting positions without getting bound or fouled. The MS3 concept allows switching from Weapon Shoulder to Reaction Shoulder for shooting around corners, under vehicles, or to minimize exposure. The MS3 can also increase operator survivability by keeping the weapon in the fight in case of injury to the operator's shoulder, arm, or hand.

The MS3 incorporates several new features over its predecessor, the MS2, including all new Magpul designed and built hardware as well as improved webbing for greater durability and compatibility.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly.

The RFB is a 308 caliber front ejecting, fully ambidextrous, bullpup rifle with an 18"" barrel. It is a very compact and innovative design.

Like most of my rifles that I have recently purchased, I have only shot this one once, and that was to zero the optic.

The Trijicon ACOG does not come with the rifle. I can include it for what it would cost me to replace it. I did not remove it for the photos because I do not want to re-zero it. 

As you can see in one of the photos I have added a Kydex cheek weld on the buttstock. 

I no longer have the original box as I never intended to sell this wonderful rifle. 


The following is the description from the KEL-TEC website. RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"", 26"" and 32"" will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available."

It has a 20” round barrel, chambered in .38-55 with a full length magazine tube, walnut stocks, Crescent butt with a steel butt plate & the receiver is case colored. The barrel is stamped Special Smokeless Steel & the last patent date is August 1, 1893. The top of the receiver says Marlin Safety & the upper tang is marked Marlin Model 1893 with the “old style” writing containing John Marlins initials. The rear sight is a folding adjustable Marbles, the front sight is unmarked. The barrel retains almost all of its original bluing, all stampings are clear & legible, there are a couple of small pits & some minor handling marks. Some “pipe wrench” marks exist near the receiver & an extra dovetail in the bottom just forward of the fore end cap. The mag tube has turned Patina, the receiver & lever still show traces of case color in the right light. A little pin head pitting is seen on the receiver upon up-close inspection. The stocks have nice grain & still have traces of varnish. The wood fits proud to the metal & does not look to have ever been sanded. The forearm is in great shape but the butt stock has had some wood screws added to repair a crack. The repair is very old & there is no movement. Mechanically sound; loads, cycles, fires & ejects with no issues. The bore is INCREDIBLE; mirror bright, shiny & flawless! The holes in the upper tang are factory drilled & tapped for a tang sight, the plug screws are absent. Known issues: it does not hold ‘half cock”, I am not sure if is supposed to. My research indicates that the “smokeless” barrel stamping did not start until 1895 & the forearm appears to be for an octagon barrel. This plus the pipe wrench marks & extra dovetail suggests that the barrel has been change somewhere along the line. All in all, this is a great looking Marlin 1893 Rifle that is 116 years old & still in working condition with an excellent bore. Best of all it is in .38-55!   For an Extra $55+shipping I will add a box of shells.  I would be interested in trading for a Marlin lever actions in .32 Spec., 308 Marlin, or .32 rimfire calibers.

It took many trips to gun shows to find a beautiful wood like this with all matching numbers. These Russian SKS rifles are no longer made and the current gun shows do not carry the original SKS guns as we used to know them back in the 1990's.
