Thanks.

I have for sale 55 Rounds of 8mm ammo (I believe this is turkish military surplus) manufactured in 1950. This is original, unfired/not reloaded ammo. 
All 55 rounds are on their original stripper clips. The fabric bandoleer this ammo was packaged in is not included.

This is the remaining 8mm ammo that I have left over from a German k98 Mauser that I recently sold. I fired multiple bandoleers of this ammo through the Mauser over the years I owned it and the ammo was 100% functional.

This has been stored in a USGI ammo can on its original stripper clips. 
The ammo is $30 Dollars for all 55 Rounds, if you can use it. 

I will not ship ammo due to USPS restrictions, so you need to be willing to meet me in the O'hare area for FTF. You must have a valid FOID card and display it at purchase."

This item is considered a firearm and is subject to the same ownership provisions as any rifle. You must sign a bill of sale.

The SP-223 lower is made of 7075T6 billet, and is type III hard anodized black with Teflon coating. Our lower has features like no other lower on the market. Some key differences of the SP lower are the oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, large front grip, and a nice beveled mag well opening. The oversized, built in trigger guard allows the use of a thick winter glove. The magazine release area has been designed to allow quick and easy access to the release button from any position. Also, the mag well is wider and elongated in the front for a sure grip as well as having a large beveled opening for fast, smooth mag changes. An upper receiver tensioning screw is located under the grip, and it also includes a captive detent spring to retain the rear takedown pin."

This rifle is in good condition free of rust and pitting, the bore is good with good rifling. It looks like the forearm was cut back, as it should have gone toward the end of the barrel. This was done some time ago to give it that sportier look, like the winchester & remington. 

This model was made from 1941 to 1945 and when Italy surplused these, they went with the M1 Garand. 

Overall length is 46 inches, barrel length 27 inches. I have not shot this but everything functions, from what I understand the caliber is 6.5x52.

Hill reportedly took a trip to Japan in 1960 in order to find and ship home a specific species of bamboo he found most suitable for his needs, and I understand that the Hill Company still uses this species in the
bow’s construction to date. The belly and face of the Big Five bow are both backed by glass.
The bow that I am offering was made in 1974 (one year before Mr. Hill passed away) and is set up for 70 lbs. at a 29"" draw length. The bow itself is 70 inches long. Because it was custom made for me it sports...""Custom made for My Name"". This is painted on and could be easily removed. I used the bow to hunt whitetail for a few years so there are some superficial scratches (nothing deep). I would recommend having a bowyer make a new string as the one I have is frayed in places.

I am asking $375 or will trade for the right pistol or revolver.

You are welcome to check it out in person.

Waited a year for this to become available and finally just received it last month, it is a brand new Spikes Tactical ST-15 (AR15), never been fired, M4 style flat top with 6 position collapsable stock. Mid-length gas system and 16"" chrome lined barrel. Spikes are known for being super reliable and accurate rifles out of the box with great fit and finish, and there is a long waiting list to get your hands on one. They are highly desirable and thats why it takes forever to get a new one and they are selling for over $2000 right now on gunbroker. This is not some walmart s&w, bushmaster, or dpms, each and every Spikes rifle is built by craftsmen with tight quality control and attention to detail. You will find absolutely zero negative comments about them anywhere and they are the choice of many law enforcement officers that are in the know. Dont take my word for it, research it yourself and read some reviews. Kills me to sell it now after it finally came in only a month ago but I need the cash for another vehicle and that is the only reason why I am even considering it. I would also consider trades up or down with cash on your part or mine for a decent reliable and fuel efficient vehicle. Prefer something like a toyota truck but open to any offers, just depends on what you have. Looking to work with someone to come up with an arrangement that satisfies us both, or just sell the rifle outright. If you have an extra vehicle you dont need that doesnt have any serious problems and want to get yourself a higher end AR without spending a dime, maybe we can make a deal that helps us both out.

*I do not have the BCG for this rifle. I gave it to my brother as a Xmas gift and there is nothing I can do about that. The rifle is new in the factory hardshell case, never been fired, but I DO NOT have the bcg. If anyone wants to supply their own bcg and get my new Spikes rifle, $2000 is what it will take. The price is firm. As you can probably tell, I really do not want to sell this rifle."

He is the only person to win 196 archery field tournaments in succession. 

The Howard Hill Company of Hamilton, Montana, is and has been offering Hill-style longbows for many years. The particular model which I have for sale was their top-of-the-line Big Five model. The Big Five,
according to the literature and information given by Mrs. Betty Ekin, friend of Howard Hill and, along with son Craig, operator of the Howard Hill Archery Company, was patterned after the famous “Sweetheart” Hill's favorite bow.  The construction of ths bow is constructed of laminated bamboo per Hill’s design. Hill reportedly took a trip to Japan in 1960 in order to find and ship home a specific species of bamboo he found most suitable for his needs, and I understand that the Hill Company still uses this species in the
bow’s construction to date. The belly and face of the Big Five bow are both backed by glass.
The bow that I am offering was made in 1974 (one year before Mr. Hill passed away) and is set up for 70 lbs. at a 29"" draw length. The bow itself is 70 inches long. Because it was custom made for me it sports...""Custom made for My Name"". This is painted on and could be easily removed. I used the bow to hunt whitetail for a few years so there are some superficial scratches (nothing deep). I would recommend having a bowyer make a new string as the one I have is frayed in places.

It is a limited production factory built Spikes Tactical upper in 5.45x39 (AK74) caliber matched to a brand new complete milspec PSA GenII forged alloy lower receiver with 6 position stock. These are unofficially referred to as a ""AR74"" and are a very smart buy due to the similar caliber ammo they take which is plentiful at a much lower cost. It has a top quality Lothar Walther barrel ($375 alone) and complete corrosion resistance treatment on all components, plus a Spikes Nickel Boron bolt carrier group ($275). It is specifically designed to chew through cheap surplus 5.45x39 ammo that is widely available and still only costs about $180 per 1080 round can right now. You will save approximately $400 - $500 per 1000 rounds compared to .223 / 5.56, so buy the time you have purchased 3 or 4 of the 1080 round cans you have saved the entire cost of the rifle. After that it will continue to pay you back by saving you another few hundred bucks on every 1000 rounds compared to the same amount of .223 / 5.56. Even if the price does come down on 5.56 it will never ever be anywhere near as cheap as 5.45x39. This makes it affordable to stock up on ammo for your AR15. You can stack it deep in sealed cans and have a lifetime supply for that price, plus shoot 3-4 times the amount of rounds (in a better caliber) than your buddies can with their AR15s for the same cost. You can even afford to waste err I mean shoot your ammo using one of those SlideFire stocks with this rifle if that is your thing. 

The 5.45x39 has a very flat trajectory and nearly identical velocity to 5.56, but tumbles violently on impact due to bullet design (as opposed to cleanly passing straight through like 5.56 can). It produces much more devastating wounds, and over-penetration is less of an issue with this caliber. Some people prefer it for home defense due to that fact alone. 

This is by far the cheapest military spec'd ammo there is. This limited production Spikes Tactical Corrosion Resistant upper has the following features: Spikes Tactical Nickel Boron NiB Bolt Carrier Group, Melonite coated inside and out Lothar Walther Barrel with Nickel Boron M4 Extension, Melonite coated F-marked FSB, Melonite coated Gas Tube w stainless steel roll pin, and Melonite coated A2 Flash Hider. I saw a video recently of a guy that shot 7500 rounds of 5.45x39 surplus ammo through one of these Melonite treated uppers over the course of 1 year without ever cleaning the rifle. When he finally did there was zero corrosion present due to the Melonite finish. 

If interested and serious please include a phone number in your reply to contact you on. 
Price for the complete rifle is $1500, or I would sell the upper separately
I also have a 1080 round can of ammo for it for another $200

This particular pistol features a 4"" barrel, along with tritium night sights - perfect for use as a carry pistol or for target shooting.  Pistol comes with everything that came with it (see photos) - that is, Sig Carrying Case, manual, lock, pistol, and two Sig 8-round magazines.

RIFLE FACTS:  I'm a retired Marine and over the past 4-5 years, I began collecting pistols and rifles (thanks to ""you know who"" now running the show).  In addition, I was aware of some Marine Special Ops units who were carrying the Sig Scorpion models exclusively as their favored side arm and I've heard nothing but superb feedback about this pistol, in particular, its accuracy.  So I purchased this model 6 months ago, but never got to fire it, and it's been sitting in the box.  The pistol sports a nice natural earth tone design to it, along with gorgeous snake-skin style pistol grips (see photos).  The sights on this pistol are high quality tritium night sits.  It comes with 2 Sig 8-round mags.  It's not an easy model to get, so if and when they do come in, they disappear rather quickly.

REASON FOR SELLING:  Unfortunately, due to other reasons, I must now scale back my collection and I'm substantially thinning out what I have in the rifle and pistol department.  I'm not necessary eager to sell this pistol because of the way it looks, feels, and from I understand, it's potential operational firepower.  But I must do so in order to scale back.  My loss is your gain.  I'm selling this Sig for the exact price I paid for it (minus tax) - and I'm NOT gouging the price in order to take advantage of current guy-buying scenarios.  

PRICE: $1025 Cash (Please - no checks or trades). I prefer a local sale due to convenience, but will sell out of state - however.....out-of-state buyers will have to pay for shipping and insurance to the FFL location up front. Local sales will require a formal bill of sale be made out, along either an up-to-date pistol permit or a concealed carry permit.

METHOD OF CONTACT: I'd prefer that you NOT text me. You can reply to this Ad, or better yet, it's best just to call me on my mobile, which is: REDACTED any time between 9 AM and 10 PM daily EST (North Carolina). Ask for ""BEN"".

I have owned this since new.  I bought it in 2008 have put 520 rounds through it since then.  It has functioned flawlessly and is a joy to shoot.  It produces very nice groups with typical 55 grain rounds thanks to the faster twist.  It has a some very minor cosmetic handling marks, a few white marks on the top of the barrel, some marks on the receiver rail from a scope mount, and the standard ejection port nick of a AR that has been fired.  It is otherwise flawless.  I just picked up a upper that is more suited for the bench shooting that I like to do, so I need to sell this to help pay for that one.

RIFLE FACTS:  I'm a retired Marine and over the past 4-5 years, I began collecting pistols and rifles (thanks to ""you know who"" now running the show).  I purchased this pistol roughly a year ago and fired less than 75 rounds through the gun.  This is a tack driver - superb for personal carry.  It shoots very tight groups and I love the sights on this model.  I purchased the P239 tactical model in order to have a high quality tactical smaller pistol, should the need arise.  It has an extended, threaded barrel (for silencers or whatever).  I then purchased a set of Hogue after-market combat grips (see photos), and yes, the original grips are still in the box.  Since the pistol came with the standard 8-round mags, I then also purchased 6 additional extended 10-round Sig magazines.  And as you know, Sig magazines are ridiculously expensive.  I'm selling this pistol and everything you see here for roughly $150 less than I paid for it (when everything thing is figured in).

REASON FOR SELLING:  Unfortunately, due to other reasons, I must now scale back my collection and I'm substantially thinning out what I have in the rifle and pistol department.  I'm not necessary eager to sell this pistol because of the way it looks, feels, and shoots.  But I must do so in order to scale back.  My loss is your gain.  I'm selling this Sig setup for far less than I paid for all - and I'm NOT gouging the price in order to take advantage of current guy-buying scenarios.  

PRICE: $900 Cash (Please - no checks or trades). I prefer a local sale due to convenience, but will sell out of state - however.....out-of-state buyers will have to pay for shipping and insurance to the FFL location up front. Local sales will require a formal bill of sale be made out, along either an up-to-date pistol permit or a concealed carry permit.

METHOD OF CONTACT: I'd prefer that you NOT text me. You can reply to this Ad, or better yet, it's best just to call me on my mobile, which is: REDACTED any time between 9 AM and 10 PM daily EST (North Carolina). Ask for ""BEN"".

MY LOCATION: I live in the small town of Fuquay Varina, NC, which is a 30 minute drive south of Raleigh, NC off of Highway 401S.

Here are the photos - please note:

1.  1st Photo - shows everything with box, etc.
2.  2nd Photo - shows the pistol with the standard 8-round magazine inserted.
3.  3rd Photo - shows the pistol with the extended 10-round magazine inserted."

If you absolutely have to have these and want me to ship them they are full price all the way up and buyer pays full shipping cost. Also, I WILL NOT SHIP TO BAN STATES, obviously. I can however ship to any ban state (EXCEPT CALIFORNIA and NEW YORK) as a rebuild kit for your already existing low capacity magazines. The rebuild kits are sold individually for the full price + $5.00 each to convert to rebuild kit, no matter the quantity. Contact me for further information about shipping/handling costs and any questions concerning the rebuild kit option.  Sorry to everyone in the ban states, but that's the way it works.
If you don't like it, TELL YOUR SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES!!!

Thanks For Looking - God Bless!"
