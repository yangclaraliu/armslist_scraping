It was the off duty weapon for a cop friend of mine and, as he says: all the good shots are still in it and it was only dropped in donut shops and bars.   It was my first carry piece too - but I will say that this is a CCW if you're a big guy - it is a full size gun.

I have the factory 11 round mag and a pre-ban aftermarket 13 round mag.  I also have the original box and manual for it.  It has 4 year old tritium rear sights but the front is a plain blade.  No, I have no idea what he was thinking doing that.

The gun is in good shape, but it's been carried and shows it. It's been shot, too, but not excessively in competition.  I find the trigger good, but I'd say it was closer to the Glock than to my Gold Cup.

I am cleaning out my gunroom and selling stuff I don't fire, so I will entertain reasonable offers, but cash only, no trades. I am not trying to just move the pieces around.

If you are local and have a CCL or a pistol permit we can do this face to face. If you are local and don't have a CCL/permit we will do it through an FFL. I will ship to your FFL (at your cost) if they'll hold the gun until I get cash."

I’ve a couple of guns that really don’t get much use anymore and I’m trying to consolidate my calibers/magazines. 

1. Taurus 24/7 Duo-tone in  .45 acp with 2 magazines (12 rounds each) – I bought this gun new almost 2 years ago on a whim, it looked sexy and a .45.. Ive probably put less than 200 rounds through it; it has a little holster wear mostly in the form on a few light scratchers. The first hundred or so rounds fired flawlessly, the second 100 were giving me some problems with the extractor (common with Taurus) but it looks like it’s been resolved with a thorough cleaning of the extractor and not using Blazer aluminum cased ammo.

2. S&W SW9F in 9mm with 2 magazines (one 17 round and one 10 round) – I picked this one up a while ago because it was a 9mm to save some money on ammo (I’ve always been a 40 cal glock guy), but it doesn’t shoot like anything else I have, even though this is the model that Glock sued S&W over some years ago. It’s got a bit if a heavy trigger pull, but other than that, it’s a great gun. Simple and functional. 

3. Norinco/Hawk 982 – This a Chinese clone of the Remington 870 and will accept 870 parts, other than the barrel and I believe the forend may be welded on, not sure if that can be changed out. I have too many shotguns as it is and this guy gets the least use. 5+1 rounds with ghost ring sights. It has a little wear, but functions perfectly. 

Trades – I’m really only interested in trades at this time, partial +/- cash on either end of the trade depending on how many guns and what they are, you know the deal. 

Email is the best way to get in contact with me, I work in an office and I’m in and out of meetings most of the day.

Nosler and Barnes. I did lose the elevation cap to the scope but I have yet to lose zero because of it and I have not ever lost zero in the scope. Some wear on the muzzle and bolt knob but other than that I say the finish is 95% and bore is excellent rifling strong and bore is clear of any defects.

The tactically-correct pushbutton tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on. [NSN: 6230-01-381-3292]

After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated modifications based upon Germany's Mauser Karabiner 98k. Although similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. They are usually easily identified by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well.

It has the chromelined barrel and original Romanian receiver. It also still has cosmoline present throughout the rifle. All parts are matching as far as I can tell.

I believe that it is unfired except for any test firing, as the barrel also had a decent amount of cosmoline inside until I swabbed it out thinking it was fouling. 

The action is extremely smooth for an AK. While probably not on par with a milled receiver, it is still much smoother than Arsenal's I have handled.

The furniture is in excellent shape, which is rare, with no scratches, or mars to the finish. There are a couple light dings, but again nothing has gotten past the finish.

The metal is standard parkerizing, with some marks as was normal on the firearms, even new ones as this is.

Comes with one 20 round magazine (it is a bit shorter than any 30 round 5.56 mag)

You can read a Manufacturer's description of the handgun here:

http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p250-compact-digital-camo.aspx

This model is more expensive because it is digital camo and has night sights. The MSRP on it is $855. I bought this gun new, I have NOT fired ANY rounds through it. It is still brand new as it came from the factory. The pictures I post are of the actual firearm. The handgun comes with original box, two (2) 15 round magazines, and everything that came in original box.

I will consider all respectable bids. Please do not email me unless you are serious. This is a great pistol, I don't need any more 9mm's which is why I am selling this one. I searched for this pistol, and most of the online company's were out, and I'm not sure Sig is making the Digital Camo version anymore (but I can't verify). FTF only.

The black Yamaha is a custom built blaster that has had the engine totally rebuilt and punched .30 over. Full chrome fmf exhaust front to rear, new shocks, maxxis tires with fox beadlock rims are new also. To much to list over $5,000 in this build let's just say the only thing original is the frame. The other quad is a Yamaha warrior which has over $2,000 invest into the build. Both quads are as close to new as possible just a fraction of the cost. I am selling these quads as a package deal two from the price of one. Just want them out of my garage can't stand even looking at them. Someone will get a steal of a deal. You can keep both or sell one and have a free high performance quad. The choice is yours. 1st $2700 takes them both!!!!

I bought it brand new & mounted a Bushnell 3-9x40 scope with Iron Sighter rings.  It has been in my safe ever since, only coming out every once in a while for a wipe down and a boresnake being run through the barrel.  It has never been fired at all.

I do have the owner's manual and 120 rounds of ammunition.  The UPCs aren't on the ammunition boxes - I cut them all out when I bought them because they all had mail-in rebates going on.  The ammunition consists of 40 rounds of Winchester 100 gr Power-Point, 40 rounds of Federal 100 gr Power Shok and 40 rounds of Remington 100 gr Core-Lokt.  I will also include 2 Snap Caps for training.  It would make a great rifle for younger shooters or smaller statured individuals.  It's hard to find these youth ADL rifles anymore!

Sorry, but I will only sell face-to-face to a resident of Ohio.  I will not consider trades of any kind.  I will not travel outside of the greater Columbus area to perform the transaction.  Just wanted to get that stuff out of the way.

Thanks!"

Know what you're buying here.  The Lorcin .380 is a very simple firearm, but not one that was built to last.  With a little tinkering and babying, it can feed and group pretty well.  But no amount of babying will change the fact that the slide is made from injection-molded zinc alloy.  It may last 200 rounds, or 2, or forever.  

Buy it to fill out your eclectic collection, buy it as a gag Christmas gift for your dad who only shoots 1911s, or buy it to take to the range and run it into the ground (wear a mouth guard).  Just don't bet your life on it.

I have a perfect Bersa .22 Firestorm up for trade only.  I have several other .22's and just do not use this one much - so I thought I'd try and see if there is something else out there.  I am mostly interested in a 9mm., 380 auto or maybe a .32 auto.........  I know firearms well, including their values, and I will know if you are trying to fool me - so no B.S. please.

This Bersa is in perfect condition - not one scratch on it.  It has the nickle slide and comes with 2 - 10 rnd. magazines, original box, lock and papers.  I will also include  300 rounds of un-opened CCI Stingers and/or $$ if need be for the right deal.  I found the stingers, velocitors and yellow-jackets to shoot best from this pistol.  The round count is around 500-600.

Please reply with a good description of your offer, approximate round count and at least one GOOD picture.  I can send more pics of the .22 if you like.  Give me a day or so to reply.

I will ask that you have an Ohio I.D. and that you sign a bill-of-sale for my records only.

Thanks for looking."

You can read a Manufacturer's description of the handgun here:

http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p250-compact-digital-camo.aspx

This model is more expensive because it is digital camo and has night sights. The MSRP on it is $855. I bought this gun new, I have NOT fired ANY rounds through it. It is still brand new as it came from the factory. The pictures I post are of the actual firearm. The handgun comes with original box, two (2) 15 round magazines, and everything that came in original box.

I will consider all respectable bids. Please do not email me unless you are serious. This is a great pistol, I don't need any more 9mm's which is why I am selling this one. I searched for this pistol, and most of the online company's were out, and I'm not sure Sig is making the Digital Camo version anymore (but I can't verify). FTF only.

WTT: Taurus 24/7 Duo-tone (,45 ACP), S&W SW9F, and Norinco/Hawk 982 (870 clone)

I’ve a couple of guns that really don’t get much use anymore and I’m trying to consolidate my calibers/magazines. 

1. Taurus 24/7 Duo-tone in .45 acp with 2 magazines (12 rounds each) – I bought this gun new almost 2 years ago on a whim, it looked sexy and a .45.. Ive probably put less than 200 rounds through it; it has a little holster wear mostly in the form on a few light scratchers. The first hundred or so rounds fired flawlessly, the second 100 were giving me some problems with the extractor (common with Taurus) but it looks like it’s been resolved with a thorough cleaning of the extractor and not using Blazer aluminum cased ammo.

2. S&W SW9F in 9mm with 2 magazines (one 17 round and one 10 round) – I picked this one up a while ago because it was a 9mm to save some money on ammo (I’ve always been a 40 cal glock guy), but it doesn’t shoot like anything else I have, even though this is the model that Glock sued S&W over some years ago. It’s got a bit if a heavy trigger pull, but other than that, it’s a great gun. Simple and functional. 

3. Norinco/Hawk 982 – This a Chinese clone of the Remington 870 and will accept 870 parts, other than the barrel and I believe the forend may be welded on, not sure if that can be changed out. I have too many shotguns as it is and this guy gets the least use. 5+1 rounds with ghost ring sights. It has a little wear, but functions perfectly. 

Email is the best way to get in contact with me, I work in an office and I’m in and out of meetings most of the day.

This technology offers pressure relief at inhalation and exhalation to make BiPAP therapy more like natural breathing.

This machine is basically new. I could not use a machine and chose to have a surgery for my sleep apnea. The machine has less than 2 hours use on it. Asking $600 ('gift' PayPal or USPS money order) or a firearm trade (for a right trade can meet as far south as Fond du Lac on US41), which is is about half of what it costs for a base (unlike this deluxe one) model. Link to website: www.bipapautomseries.respironics.com 
The Respironics BiPAP Auto M Series combines auto adjusting pressure delivery with the breath-by-breath pressure relief of Bi-Flex. Machine has Encore Pro SmartCard technology. Bi-Flex softens airflow at inhalation and exhalation, making breathing more natural and comfortable for patients. In Bi-Flex mode, patient-adjustable pressure relief is provided at the critical stages. BiPAP Auto M Series Bi-Flex Humidifer uses Bi-Flex pressure relief technology to provide CPAP humidifier therapy. This technology offers pressure relief at inhalation and exhalation to make BiPAP therapy more like natural breathing. By tracking each breath, Bi-Flex delivers pressure relief at three critical points in the breathing cycle: the transition from exhalation to inhalation, the transition from inhalation to exhalation and during exhalation.
