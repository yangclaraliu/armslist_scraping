It has never even been removed from its shipping box, and is completely untouched. It is chambered in 7.62x39 and includes 1 steel 30 round magazine, 4 polymer 30 round magazines, and a polymer 42 round magazine. All of it is new and never fired. These guns have dried up on the primary market and are getting exceedingly scarce on the secondary market, and now Obama has stated that he will be banning weapons of this nature. Get it while you can, no wait and no paper trail other than a bill of sale for my records.

Cash is king, so let's haggle. I am only interested in trades for 5.56 ARs or 7.62 AKs in new or like new condition. I will also sell it with a single 30 round magazine for $1000.

Local face to face cash deal is highly preferred."

New semi-automatic AR-15-style rifle developed with the predator hunter in mind
Free-floating button-rifled 0.680"" Muzzle OD ChroMoly barrels with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy
Fluted barrel design reduces weight and promotes rapid barrel cooling

Receiver-length Picatinny rail for adding optics
Ergonomic pistol grip
Fore-end tube drilled and tapped for accessory rails
Legal for hunting in most states

The barrels have a custom match hybrid chambering that uses the tighter .223 SAAMI Spec headspace from the shoulder of the chamber to the bolt face. It has the longer “Leade” or throat that will accommodate the 5.56mm ammunition so it can be used without developing higher pressures as in a .223 caliber chamber that have a shorter “Leade” or throat.
Both 5.56mm and .223 caliber ammunition can safely be used in the rifles.
The 1:9 twist barrels will stabilize bullets from 40 to 75 grains.

The lower has seen about 100-200 rounds. I would say it is in very good condition showing signs of normal usage and storage. It has a mil-spec lower parts kit installed. I put on a NJ compliant buffer/stock kit that I had laying around for that I wanted my spikes buffer kit that was originally on it. The stock is NOT collapsable and maybe annoying for those in non-ban states, but it does work flawlessly if kept on. The lower is ready to go! All that is needed is a complete upper receiver.

I will be shipping it myself and not through an FFL so make sure your dealer is fine with that before purchase. I will also entertain any OFFERS whether its a trade or $$$ amount. I have seen these lowers stripped and complete on other sites going for a good amount so please make only reasonable offers. Thanks!"

(Or, as the Chinese would call it, 54式手枪).  It shows no wear from carry or use but doesn’t fit in with the rest of my collection, so I’m offering it for sale.  

This gun was made in the 1950’s by the state armory in the Peoples Republic of China (Norinco) for the Red Army.  It is a faithful copy of the Tokarev pistol designed by China’s then-ally, the USSR, with exception of an added safety to allow cocked-and-locked carry (never carry an original design Russian Tokarev with a round in the chamber).  

This gun is lightweight and well-balanced.  I’ve not fired this gun, but the ammunition choices are said to be varied and even quite fun!  Conventional 7.62 x 25 ammo is available from most of the major internet ammo sellers.  But you can also get green or red tracer ammo for low-light shooting.  Although the Type 54 is dated by contemporary military standards, this is said to be the most popular handgun among organized crime figures in Asia as the ammo available overseas is hot enough to defeat body armor.  

Face-to-face sale not possible, but I’ll ship to a FFL-holder/firearms retailer near you for $20 or deliver to an FFL-holder in the NW Chicago suburbs for free.  Payment by money order or personal check is okay; just enclose a copy of the FFL license with your payment.  Item will be shipped only to the address on the license.  I have an FFL (03) license (the “curio and relic collector” license) and will send a copy of my license when shipping the gun.  Make sure your retailer is okay with accepting a shipment from an FFL (03) holder

 I am currently taking offer on my Bushmaster Carbon Carbine, It is a flat top receiver with quad rails, adjustable stock, and foregrip that turn into a bi-pod with a push of the button. It has only been shot maybe 10 times. It is like brand new. Like I said I will take reasonable offer only, no low ballers you know how much these are selling for. You must be able to pick up in person face to face in the Decatur, Shelbyville, Mattoon area. You must also have a valid Foid card and wait 24 hours after we make a deal for delivery. Please dont waste your time with low ball offers. Serious Inquiries only, I do not have to sell it...Thanks for looking at my post...

In this pic, the foregrip/bi-pod had not been added yet...Also, I plan on keeping the red dot on it unless I get a really good offer I may include it..."

I'm a private collector and, as part of a multi-gun lot in a recent auction, picked up an excellent .38 Special revolver.  It doesn’t fit in with the rest of my collection, so I’m offering it for sale, but not before testing it thoroughly at my local range. It is in great shape; is spot-on accurate; and will be an excellent, low-cost self-defense or carry gun for a new owner.   As the saying goes: “A revolver never lets you down!”

The revolver is a Llama Ruby Extra, made in the 1960s in Spain by the Llama-Gabilondo y Cia company to compete globally with Smith & Wesson’s Model 10 as a police issue sidearm.  This Llama has features that actually make it nicer than the Smith & Wesson police gun, including a grooved backstrap for a better grip and a grooved top strap to cut down on haze in the sight radius.  

The Llama Ruby Extra sold well to police departments in South America and the Philippines but this one must have been shipped directly to the US as it is not import-marked.  The bore/lands/grooves are in great condition and the gun has just a trace of finish wear at the muzzle, so it seems to have spent more time in a sock drawer than a holster.  

Face-to-face sale not possible, but I’ll ship to a FFL-holder/firearms retailer near you for $20 or deliver to an FFL-holder in the NW Chicago suburbs for free.  Payment by money order or personal check is okay; just enclose a copy of the FFL license with your payment.  Item will be shipped only to the address on the license.  I have an FFL (03) license (the “curio and relic collector” license) and will send a copy of my license when shipping the gun.  Make sure your retailer is okay with accepting a shipment from an FFL (03) holder

I have a Marlin 336, Lever Action chambered in 35 Remington. This is a good round, its a grown up 30/30. Has a Bushnell scope ""Banner model"" with see through scope rings. I also have one full box of ammo and a 3/4 box of ammo. This round kills deer and hogs easy (out of state hunting). Also comes with an Aluminum Gun Case that will hold two guns that is Passenger Airliner approved for traveling.
I like this gun and I dont need to let it go, I also dont need any money so it will take a trade that really catches my attention. Im interested in.....

SKS

AK-47

Bolt Action rifles in .222, .223, 22/250, or bigger

maybe a hand gun....depends on what it is

Ruger 10/22 but must be all dressed up!

Maybe a 12 guage double (side by side) + another firearm. 12 guage would need to have short barrels, not sawed off only factory.

The Marlin 336 in 35 sells for $350-$400 with out a scope. This price is what they were selling for before all the ""hysteria"" and its what it is still selling for.

I know what this package is worth and I will not trade for a lesser value.

The ammo alone is $30 a box, I will say this is not a cheap gun to shoot."

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you

I have received some feedback from members on this website that are happy to share there opinions and what they have paid for this gun in the past.  They refer to what is going on as panic.  Maybe that is true but I live in the reality of what is actually happening.  Why are they all hanging on to there firearms that they got such great deals on?  Because the reality is they may not be able to replace them.  I feel the same about the guns I am selling.  This price is what it is worth to me and if someone else feels the same or wants to make a reasonable offer I am glad to consider it.  Thank you"

Copy and past this letter  or draft your own to the link below either way DO it PLEASE   

Greetings,

Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.

We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.

If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others.

Thank you,

This is all speculation on my part of course because this rifle does not have any manufacturers markings or import stamps. It does have the very early ""red"" fiberglass stock. Typical of issued SKS rifles, this one has some finish missing in places which I have close up photos of, and there is no visible pitting in the bore. I have a second bayonet that I will include."

I am also including a Pro-Mag 50 round magazine to complete the look!!!

Description from website: It's amazing how close the resemblance is... These kits can turn your Ruger 10/22 into almost an exact replica in appearance. Of course your gun retains the original semi-auto 22 LR function, but it'll LOOK completely different. The quality is excellent: parts are made from billet aluminum, steel, and oil finished American walnut. No changes to your original gun are needed... Just bolt the kit together onto your Ruger 10/22

 This includes the replica receiver extension and hardware, rear peep sight (long), buttstock, rear pistol grip, front pistol grip, and fake ""Cutts Compensator"".

Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems.

Rock River rifles are hand-made in Colona, IL, and are individually fit and assembled with some of the best attention to detail and the tightest factory tolerances in the industry. These are some of most reliable and accurate service rifles available, and they are sold out everywhere, with no supply in sight. Get one while you still can.

These are the last two RRA rifles in my safe, and they will sell fast. They are new and unfired, in perfect condition. Each gun comes with three magazines, including one USGI steel and two Magpul Pmags, and I'll throw in two boxes of new .223 ammo.

I am a private collector in Fort Collins, not a dealer. Face to face deal, with no paper, no waiting, no drama. I'll need to see your CO ID or CCW, and you must be legal to own / possess firearms. No criminals, thugs or shitheads, please.
