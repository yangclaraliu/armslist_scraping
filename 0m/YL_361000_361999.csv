It originally came with the black synthetic stock (which I still have), but it was too short for me, so I bought the ATI adjustable folding stock with pistol grip. It has since been painted digital urban camo with duracoat, and looks great. Also has the SOCOM accu-strut on the barrel. It really does improve the accuracy and tightens up your grouping. Has a UTG bipod on it as well. Primary Arms Red-Dot sight.  It comes with 3 ruger factory 20 round mags, and original stock. 

Round count is around 200. Only about 100 of those with the new stock installed. 

The serial number dates it to around a 2008 build date. 

It's a great shooting gun, but I've had my fun with it, now I'm looking for something different.

Here's a breakdown of what I have into the gun as a reference:

Gun itself: $650
Stock w/ custom duracoat paint: $275
Accu-Strut Socom barrel stablizer: $120
UTG Bi-pod: $20
Primary Arms M-4(Aimpoint Clone): $100
Spare Ruger factory 20rd. mags: $30 each

I have right around $1200 into this gun. I don't expect to get all of my money out of it, but at the same time, I'm not going to give it away. I'm no longer looking for trades, I'd like to sell it to help fund a boat project. 

Looking for $900 or best offer. I think this is a very fair price compared to other mini-14's that I've seen."

It originally came with the black synthetic stock (which I still have), but it was too short for me, so I bought the ATI adjustable folding stock with pistol grip. It has since been painted digital urban camo with duracoat, and looks great. Also has the SOCOM accu-strut on the barrel. It really does improve the accuracy and tightens up your grouping. Has a UTG bipod on it as well. Primary Arms Red-Dot sight.  It comes with 3 ruger factory 20 round mags, and original stock. 

Round count is around 200. Only about 100 of those with the new stock installed. 

The serial number dates it to around a 2008 build date. 

It's a great shooting gun, but I've had my fun with it, now I'm looking for something different.

Here's a breakdown of what I have into the gun as a reference:

Gun itself: $650
Stock w/ custom duracoat paint: $275
Accu-Strut Socom barrel stablizer: $120
UTG Bi-pod: $20
Primary Arms M-4(Aimpoint Clone): $100
Spare Ruger factory 20rd. mags: $30 each

I have right around $1200 into this gun. I don't expect to get all of my money out of it, but at the same time, I'm not going to give it away. I'm no longer looking for trades, I'd like to sell it to help fund a boat project. 

Looking for $900 or best offer. I think this is a very fair price compared to other mini-14's that I've seen."

After speaking with someone from FN, more information has come to light about this particular Hi Power, and my earlier information was deemed incorrect.

This pistol is from one of the first production runs out of FN after Liege was liberated from the Germans, assembled from parts produced under German occupation but with all Liege/Allied markings (no German stamping of any sort). Based on the serial number, it was probably produced in late '44 or early '45. Smooth top slide, no rib, GI sights. Serial number is A60xx -- rare four digit with A series prefix.


I'm in no hurry to sell this as I don't really need the money or the Glock, this is just for my fun.

Includes one serial number matching 13rd FN (extremely rare type magazine with split tongue baseplate), two 13rd FN OEM mags, and two 15rd MecGar mags, Spegel style grips and original WWII grips, Israeli 1911 holster modified to fit the Hi Power, and a Hunter leather holster."

Izmash is where Mikhail Kalashnikov works to this very day....so this is considered a ""true AK""...not some Chinese knock off.  This is 100% Russian AK quality.

Ok. So let me start off by saying if you want these guns, dont lowball me. Dont waste my time or yours. I dont have to sell, just throwing my hook in the water. For instance, the scope mount for the VEPR cost 130 after taxes alone. Taking no trades unless your gun is unfired, and that is a slim chance.

Wanting to get 2400, may go a little lower. If you have such a problem with the price, dont email me. All this stuff is new, so I want to get what I paid for it.

Awesome pistol, shoots great, I just don't use it much and so it's time for someone else to have some fun.

The PLR-22 pistol is chambered for the popular and economical .22 Long Rifle cartridge (.22LR). It is based on the 5.56mm NATO chambered PLR-16 pistol and shares many parts including the grip and front and rear sights. The PLR-22 is not a simple conversion kit, it is a standalone firearm chambered for the .22LR and is designed for target shooting, plinking, or small game hunting. The PLR-22 and SU-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.

The rear sight is adjustable for windage and the front sight is adjustable for elevation. An integrated picatinny rail on top will accept a multitude of sighting options. The muzzle end of the barrel is threaded ½""-28 to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake. A 26 round semi-transparent magazine is included and it will accept magazines designed for the Atchison M-16 conversion."

The good.. Shotgun mechanically is in good shape, bores are bright with no dents or bulges, action locks up tight, screws are not buggered up.  The stocks are walnut and are not cracked or damaged in any major way.  It works great and mechanically seems in fine shape.

The bad...  The shotgun does show lots of use and improper storage resulting in thin bluing with much of the case hardening is gone.  The barrels have spots of surface rust over maybe 10-20% pf the barrel resulting in surface pitting (nothing too deep but ugly).  The wood is black walnut with much of the finish worn at the wear points, the butt plate has been replaced with a rubber pad that was fitted oversize (larger then the stock).

Shotgun works and shoots fine, it is a dependable shotgun.  Looks wise it's sort of ugly, wear seems  honest and not from abuse, I want to stress it is not new looking.  Can meet up in Leitchfield area

I have fired 85 bullets through it without a FTF or FTE, then cleaned/oiled and put it away.

I like to shoot all my weapons, and I shoot .22's.

The weapon comes in its original case, with two mags, a load-assister, and trigger and breach locks.  For those not familiar with the P95, it has an ambidexterous safty for off-hand or left-handed firing, and is Ideal for mid-sized hands.  

I payed right at 400.00 for it from a local retailer, so i figured it will be worth close to that.  I am looking into the tactical realm of .22's, so Tactical handguns or rifles is what I would like to trade for."

Most of the old H&R top-breaks you see have nickle plating that is in rough shape from decades of use and abuse.  This one is a rare blued version and belonged to a friend's great grandfather, and I don't think he'd ever even fired it.  This revolver has been sitting untouched in a drawer for the better part of a century.  It is in beautiful shape.

I oiled the springs and took it to the range last month, and it is a reliable piece with surprising accuracy at 30 feet.  This revolver is lightweight with a short 3"" barrel, light recoil and is ideal for a novice shooter with small hands.  Kicks less than a .38 Special and has the approximate energy of a .380 ACP, but unlike the popular polymer .380 subcompact automatics this will never jam.

100 rounds of LRN defensive ammo and 40 rounds of FMJ range ammo are included -- all new manufacture Fiocchi which is a top quality clean burning commercial ammo.

Will not ship.  Not interested in trades.  Will meet within or close to the greater Denver Metro area.  If you are a dirtbag or a gangbanger don't bother replying as I reserve the right not to sell to anyone I don't like the looks of.   Thanks."

The NVMT 3x42 Laser Riflescope™ merges a powerful 3x42 monocular with a detachable eyepiece, rifle mount and laser pointer to create a truly versatile night vision unit. The adjustable laser pointer's beam acts as a target acquisition guide when the unit is mounted to your riflescope and ensures precision while shooting. As with all monoculars in the NVMT series, the NVMT 3x42 has excellent light amplification performance, amplifying visible light several thousand times, and an exclusive Pulse™ built-in infrared illuminator that expands viewing range and minimizes battery drainage. Fully multi-coated optics decrease glare and improve light transmission to provide an excellent viewing experience while the compact and durable Rubber Armor body is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand or in a pocket, yet rugged enough to withstand use. Yukon's NVMT Riflescope is perfect for airsoft, varmint control, paintball or any other night gun sports that require a short range, night vision scope. The NVMT 3x42 Laser Riflescope is backed by Yukon's Limited Lifetime Warranty."

Has six shot cylinder and six inch barrel and fires DA/SA.  Pistol is in excellent condition and very inexpensive and fun to shoot.  Serial number indicates that it was made in 1948 and has the original ""buntline"" grips.  Colt pistols are extremely well built handguns and this one is no exception.  Collector value has been been significantly lowered due to the pistol being re-parkerized.  All in all, a really nice gun great to learn on or just shooting tin cans.  I understand that the economy is in the crapper, but I don't want any trades, just cash, no lawaway plans, etc.  Just need the money.

20"" HEAVY BARREL (Mossberg) 
Unmarked (unknown) A2 upper on Double Star lower
DPMS lower parts kit
6 position M4 stock (UTG brand, Mil-Spec tube)
Typical A2 flash hider
Comes with one magazine

This is a project that someone requested, but I never received payment upon completion. Just looking to get my money back. Not looking for trades (MAYBE trade with boot, but don't count on it)

This is a BEAST and weighs in at about 9LBS unloaded.
No chrome on BCG or barrel lining.
Chambered for 5.56 NATO with Mil-Spec headspacing.
Would make a great target gun! I would love to give it to one of my children but it's way too long and heavy for them. Practically a bull barrel under the hand guards, slightly smaller between the front sight and muzzle brake.
Only fired 30 rounds through it to test for function upon completion of assembly.

First 620 bucks can have it. No lowballers, I spent over 570 bucks on the parts, used specialty tools and gauges (about 500 dollars worth of tools, mind you), and spent many hours taking my time on this build. I highly doubt you will find one like it in your local pawn shop for the same price.

Up for sale is a like-new limited edition Walther P22 22lr semi-auto pistol.  This is a limited edition Brushed chrome with stainless steel slide. Not your run of the mill p22 that sells for less on-line. Shoot a .22 and look good.  What makes this fun to shoot is that every time you pull the trigger, it's only costing 3 cents per round.  I laugh when I'm at the range and everyone is shooting big calibers, and they marvel at others shooting big calibers.  But in the back of their minds and mine, every time their guns go boom, .30 cents to .95 cents go up in smoke also. Don't get me wrong, I have big caliber guns also, but after shooting a few rounds of those, I fall back on this .22 and just shoot endlessly. I've had my fun with this gun. Now you can too.

Looking for a tactical rifle somewhere between an sks (too cheap) and a SCAR (too expensive) prefer .308 size round over .223. Semi autos only. No sniper rifles. I believe that leaves me with these three. IF you happen to know about something I am missing just ask. Those ugly long .308 ""battle rifles"" won't work either.  No kit guns.

It wasnt tight when we got it and upon messing with the latch, spring went flying.  Bought the gun for $429, holster for $40, and the ammo for $30.  If I could get $350 from the gun, I'd be happy. Ill provide the number for Charter arms and they will give you a spring and you could put it in if your feeling adventurous, or have a gunsmith do it.

GLOCK INC                    Model G19    

The 4th Generation Glock ""Safe Action"" brings revolutionary design changes
to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately
apparent is the multiple backstrap design of the frame, which can be
instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands. The surface of
the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame scientifically designed,
real world tested. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly
substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine
catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters.
The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory
attachment.

I am open to other calibers as well, but I don't have any of these two at the moment, so these are specifically what I am looking for.  Manufacturer and bullet weight/type is not important, as they are for punching paper in practice.  If you would like to sell the ammo for less than what I can buy it for on line or at the store, shoot me an email.  I must be able to pick up the ammo within 10 miles of the newer Wally World in Jacksonville, or at a location in between Jacksonville and Richlands, as I drive that way frequently.

***INTERESTING STORY AND HISTORY TO GO WITH THIS RIFLE / SHOTGUN COMBO***

I am not the original owner of the firearm, but I did receive it from a family friend when I was younger. The individual who had the firearm before me spent a summer hiking Wisconsin's Ice Age Trail and other connecting trails in Wisconsin. This firearm accompanied him on his journey, as he spent many nights camping in the wilderness along the trail. He selected this particular firearm due to its ease of pointing and carry, reliability, correct size and maneuverability, combination of rifle and shotgun, survival-rifle style, and its easy tool-less disassembly. At one point during his summer of hiking, a pack of aggressive wolves surrounded and cornered him. Presenting this firearm and firing a single shotgun blast from it, he was able to subdue and scare away the aggressive pack of wolves, and entirely credits this firearm with saving his life.

This rifle is in Like New condition, includes 1, 5rd mag. Scope is a RedHead 4-12x40 in excellent condition. No box or paperwork. Will not last long!!

The R17F rifles has the AccuTrigger, a revolutionary design that will forever change the way shooters expect triggers to function. The AccuTrigger gives the shooter the flexibility to set the trigger pull to individual preference without have to pay a gunsmith to adjust it. Also, even when adjusted to its lowest setting, the AccuTrigger is completely safe and cannot accidentally discharge during normal use from being jarred or dropped when maintained and adjusted as intended. A newly designed teardrop safety is an additional feature on rifles with the AccuTrigger. It provides for better acquisition of the safety button and operates smoother and quieter. Enhanced accuracy is another benefit of the Savage AccuTrigger, is the crisp, clean light trigger pull allows the shooter to maximize the accuracy potential of the rifle.

The 37.00 doesnt include shipping anywhere in the lower 48 states that is an additional 3.00, but Ill sell it locally for 35.00 cash. For people paying and shipping, I take Paypal. I am currently in the London-Corbin area most days of the week, but I do travel to Richmond pretty regularly, so I can deliver up there if needed you'll just have to wait till I come up next. Lexington isn't a problem either."

I would estimate this gun has around 150 rounds through it and is in like new condition. 
2011 Trijicon night sights (target model)
Extended slide stop and magazine release
Comes with (1) 15rd magazine, and (2) 10rd magazines. 
The gun comes with all of the paperwork, test brass, etc BUT DOES NOT COME WITH THE GLOCK FACTORY BOX... 
The test brass is dated 3/14/11

I was under the impression that the Exo finished glocks and AR15 BCG's where just marketing gimmicks, but I am truly impressed with the lubricity of this finish! 
It is especially noticeable when hand cycling the slide, very little noise and friction is produced. 

The EXO finish itself is like a tan/stainless steel color (but mostly stainless). I am honestly not a huge fan of 2 tone handguns, hence the sale. 

I am looking to either sell outright for $500, obo, or trade for a Gen 4 Glock 19. 

Buyer must have PTP/PTC and be willing to sign a bill of sale. 

Thank you for looking"
