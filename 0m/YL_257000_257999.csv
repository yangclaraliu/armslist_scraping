I have 3 extra 13 round Sig mags I'll sell for $20/mag.  A great deal considering the cheapest you can find them on the web is $32/mag plus shipping.

Please don't contact me with idiotic offers.  Those who know Sig Sauer know this handgun is over $800 new in some parts of the county.  With the extra gear (DeSantis Pro Stealth $38.95/Hogue Grips $16.99) this package is a steal. Nothing wrong with the firearm, just thinning the herd to go a different route.

I was thinking about buying it from my friend, but decided I like my 1911's short and really don't need it.  That being said, I did some research on this thing and overall the reviews are good.  Apparently they are quite accurate (very accurate 75-100 yds, and acceptable out to 150+).  I even read one account of a guy shooting groundhog plates at 225 yards using a bit of Kentucky elevation...

Anyway, the unit retails for $349, Ultradot is $159, so $500 retail on the package.  The price is $400, and you can negotiate with him.

I’ve got a couple of guns that really don’t get much use anymore and would be happy to trade for something I would use.  Trades only +/- cash depending on what it is. I’m not hurting for money, so don’t bother with lowball on the spot cash offers, thanks! 

1. S&W SW9F in 9mm with 2 magazines (one 17 round and one 10 round) – I picked this one up a while ago because it was a 9mm to save some money on ammo (I’ve always been a 40 cal glock guy), but it doesn’t shoot like anything else I have, even though this is the model that Glock sued S&W over some years ago. It’s got a bit if a heavy trigger pull, but other than that, it’s a great gun. Simple and functional. 

2. Norinco/Hawk 982 – This a Chinese clone of the Remington 870 and will accept 870 parts, other than the barrel and I believe the forend may be welded on, not sure if that can be changed out. I have too many shotguns as it is and this guy gets the least use. 5+1 rounds with ghost ring sights. It has a little wear, but functions perfectly. 

Will trade for: Things I’d trade for: -Entry level 1911 (RIA or something along those lines) -Kel-Tec Sub2000 in 40 S&W Glock configuration -Berretta Strom Cx4 in any caliber -Some sort of tacti-cool .22lr -Other pistol caliber carbines. AR-15? Let me know what you got, I may be interested in something other than I have listed."

346,http://www.armslist.com/posts/257346,For Sale/Trade:  Custom SOHAH Style CVC Ballistic Helmet with Faceshield,"Bremerton, Seattle, Washington",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 27, 2011",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Selling my ballistic helmet to fund a new one due to different needs. This helmet was made using a thick DH-132B ACVC shell, which was drilled for multiple mounting positions for the chinstrap, as shown in the photos - allowing for completely flexibility in fit and comfort. It includes a Crye NAPE pad rated for level IIIa, size Large/XL. The shell is lined with ACH velcro discs, and comes with a full set of ballistic pads that can be positioned and removed according to user needs. The chinstrap is a standard MICH 4-point harness, extremely rugged and stable. In the back of the helmet is a goggle retention strap for use with eyepro or a cat eyes headband. The entire outer surface of the shell has been refinished in a desert/arid ""snakeskin"" camouflage pattern using similar color tones and blends as Crye Precision's Multicam pattern for the most effective camouflage possible in arid or temperate environments.

The helmet shell is rated above the ACH with a ballistic V-50 of 2,250fps. It is above NIJ level IIIa, but still not rifle-proof at level III. This helmet offers the best ballistic protection available short of the Crye Airframe, and the shell design allows the use of almost any hearing protection or communications headset - I have used it comfortably and effectively with Peltors, Surefire, and Howard Leight.

Also included is the Gentex ACVC Mandible faceshield, which does not have ballistic properties but provides excellenbt grille-style facial protection against debris and impacts. It mounts to the helmet with two quick-detach clips so it can be removed easily when not needed, and does not interfere with the other features of the helmet.

$500 For the complete setup, send me all cash offers or trades for consideration.  Will include overnight shipping on my dime."

When I moved from Cheyenne to Murrels Inlet my ""Friend"" carefully wrapped three of my pistols and ""CAREFULLY"" place them in an igloo cooler. Then the Igloo was place in the back of a pickup truck for the trip across country.

 The damage is limited to one side of the barrel. The weapon fire great!! would make a great hog gun. I chose not to try to fix it with cold blue so that the next owner can fix it as they wish."

This particular one however, has had the full conversion done to it, making it back to the original formation instead of the imported sportical form that TGI imported them as. The Conversion consists of the old stock being taken off, trigger group being moved forward then the following parts being added; Tapco grip bolt and nut, Tapco G2 single hook trigger, trigger plates, ATI ergo Grip, Tapco Stock, old trigger holes filled with allen head machine bolts and nuts, then black alumi-hide is used to refinish the over part of the receiver and parts where the the conversion was done. Then to top it off, I will also include a 10rd SGM Tactical LLC magazine and factory accessories still in the baggy from Izhmash. I Did NOT PERMANENTLY MODIFY THE GAS PORTS! If you want to shoot low brass, cheap shells we recommend buying the low brass reliability gas system kit. If you modify the ports you end up chipping the chrome lining of the barrel and it will start to erode the more you shoot it.
 Also included is chaos quad rail , colapsable stock, chaos door breach, two 12 round mags and 1 5 round mag, and original cleaning kit.  this shotgun has only had 2 boxes of ammo run thru it so its basicly brand new!

The AP-9 was an inexpensive, simple to manufacture 9x19mm pistol, designed to capitalize on the market of the Intratec TEC-9 series of guns in the 1980s. It was manufactured by AA Arms and distributed by Kimel Industries, Inc of Indian Trail, NC. The AP-9 became widely available in 1990 and continued until 2001, however sales dropped off and cosmetic changes had to be instituted as a result of the Clinton Assault Weapon Ban of 1994 (officially known as the Omnibus Crime Bill 1994).

 Many people confuse the AP-9 with the TEC-9. 

Externally they are similar but there are many small differences, the most obvious being the front sight and the shape of the receiver. Both guns can load and use the same magazine."

These do not come up for sale very often, do not miss your chance!


Up for grabs is this beautiful and very rare Thompson A5 lightweight. 2000 of these were made and are very hard to come by, this one has a 3 digit serial number. This one was made by Auto Ordinance (no Kahr junk) in West Hurley New York in September of 1975. The pictures you see below is the gun I have for sale, note the forward hand grip: it is NOT an AOW as it has a total factory length of 27” and there is no way to affix a stock to this. It has perfect wood and nice bluing, although there are a few very minor safe rubs.  This one came with a 13” barrel, it also comes with (6) 32rd stick mags. I am looking for $1700 cash but will consider reasonable offers. 

I prefer face to face in the greater Tampa Bay area with valid FL ID however I will ship this to the lower 48 states (from my FFL to yours) for $40.00.

The Benelli SuperSport is the ultimate choice for a fast 12-gauge shotgun or 20-gauge shotgun for sporting clays. These two Benelli shotguns are truly “speed guns.” The SuperSport’s ComforTech® recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum and it’s doubly fast. And the ComforTech® system’s special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition. When one clay often separates the winners from the losers, the SuperSport and Sport II, with their superior reliability, faster recovery time, lower recoil and denser shot patterns, are almost like having an unfair advantage."

If you are not familiar with this gun, it is a single/double action with a thumb safety.  It is very safe to carry loaded in that you can half-cock the hammer and put on the thumb safety.  It holds 6 in the magazine and one in the pipe, and is slightly larger that palm-size.  It carries easily in a pocket.  It is a terrific concealed carry gun for both men and women.  At 5-7 yds, I have found it to be very accurate in spite of it’s small size.
