I dont know how old it is, It came on the rifle when I got it. A few dings and blemishes on the furniture, nothing shocking. There is very light surface rust here and there on the barrel, should come right off with a good cleaning. The bore is EXCELLENT! It just sits wrappd in a red blanket unless im doing some long distance pest control. Ill tell you, this thing is accurate!  I used to shoot through the open end of  a beer botle and blow the back out from 60 plus yards. All serious questions will be answeard. More pictures upon request. Ill throw in a brand new reblueing kit I got from Cabelas not that the Remington needs it.

I have an AWESOME rifle for sale.Price is OBO. I WOULD do trades plus cash... but mostly looking for cash.



It has a stag 5.56 upper. A troy TRX 10'' rail. Magpul BUS. Magpul rail covers. a NEW gas block and tube. Troy medieval. KNS Anti roll pins. Ambi safety. magpul BAD lever. BravoCO charging handle. Eotech 512. Ergo grip. Magpul MOE. KNS extended takedown pins. Magpul AFG. Y/M chrome BCG. Magpul sling mount. Magpul extended stock sholder pad. Magpul trigger guard. 6 pmags.



The rifle has seen maybe 500 rounds. Ive shot 200 out of it. It previously had the factory delta ring 6"" rail and ive since replaced it with the TRX. At that point i got brand new gas block and tube, muzzle device, eotech, charging handle, pins. And it hasnt been out to the range since then.I still have all the factory parts that i will include.



Everything on the gun is cosmetically great other than some imperfections on the barrel. The previous owner (a friend of mine) had trouble at one point or another getting the flash hider off and his barrel vice put some marks in it. they are pictured.

This rifle is awesome! but priorities are getting in the way of owning it.

These are 2 brand new Eagle 10 round magazines. They will fit Ruger 10/22 .22LR & Ruger M77 .22LR, Intratec Scorpion .22LR, & AMT Lightning .22LR rifles. 

They snap together to have 10 rounds on each end for quick loading (no need for a mag coupler). Each Magazine has a built in lever to act as an Extended Magazine Release making it easier to release the magazine, every time. If you already have an Extended Magazine Release, you may have to cut the lever off of the magazine (fully functional without it). These mags are very reliable, don't let the low price fool you, and I have had many repeat customers buying more. Save money on shipping and buy a few of them and save money on combined shipping (see my other items for a buy it now price).

You can only shoot 10 rounds and then you have to take out the magazine and flip it over to reload the other 10 rounds. California legal. 

- No Jam design 
- Constant force spring for even pressure and loading 
- 10 round capacity

It's an 18″ barreled shortened version of the M1 Garand. 

This is NOT a re-weld weapon...it is a full, solid receiver.

Ammo is Greek late-70s to early-80s military surplus 30-06, 150gr ball ammo that hits at over 2700 FPS, and includes some 240rds of black-tipped rounds that came in the bottom of one of the ammo cans...don't know what that is, but the rounds I've checked are all good with no corrosion on the brass or the EnBloc clips.

Rifle shoots straight and true, rifling is good, all internals have been meticulously gone over and the wooden stock is in great condition. Comes with a Garand canvas rifle sling. I've put maybe 300 rds through her...most likely less, but I'm rounding up.

Selling to fund a .308 AR build I'm trying to complete before Election Day...just in case ;-)

Asking $1400 for the Garand and all 800rds of 30-06 already in the EnBlocs, bandoliered and in the ammo cans...with Garand 30-06 going for $0.94/rd plus shipping from Cheaper Than Dirt/SportsmansGuide, not including the EnBloc clips or the cans, you're looking at a rifle for about $500.

That said, not planning to separate the rifle from the ammo unless the rifle sells first. Go ahead and make a REASONABLE offer...the worst I can say (or maybe will say!) is no.

The FNX offers all of the features that dedicated handgunners want. The ergonomic polymer frame has a low bore axis for less felt recoil and improved control. The grip panels are checkered and ribbed for comfortable, non-snag carry. Interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt the FNX to your hand size. The profiled stainless steel slide has cocking serrations front and rear and the 4"" hammer forged stainless steel barrel delivers pinpoint accuracy. Ambidextrous operating controls make the FNX perfect for competition or personal defense. Every FNX is made in the USA.

This weapon comes with everything seen in the picture except the bi-pod. Lets go over some of the details shall we? 

This Model 12 has had some work done to it. I am not certain of where the work was performed but I will describe it to the best of my ability. 

The rifle has a free float barrel with glass bedding. The barrel is threaded and has a machined muzzle brake that is almost seamless. The rifle also has an aftermarket fully adjustable trigger with a very clean pull. I'm not certain of the brand on the trigger, I believe it is either a Rifle Basix or Timney. 

The rifle also comes with a Burris Black Diamond 8x32x50 long range scope. The scope is held in place with a Ken Farrell 20 MOA steel base and Burris Signature Zee steel high rings. It also has comes with a sunshade.

Correct original H&R op-rod, original H&R 4 groove barrel. All parts have been gauged by me and fall well within original military specs. Weapon exhibits very minimal wear on all metal surfaces. Barrel throat/ crown all have a mirror shine w/ absolutely no nicks or dings. Stock is original but more worn as to be expected, but still much nicer than most I've seen. Cartouche marks are faintly visible but there, normal service wear is apparent. after close inspection, no cracks/ dings that hinder structural integrity to the action/stock lockup. Front barrel band is very tight as should be, and front hand-guard is loose as needed for proper operation. Rifle has been completely stripped, cleaned, oil/greased and inspected by me with high quality CLP/grease. Always babied and is not a range toy by my decision to uphold the value. Weapon is most certainly a tack driver and operates as one would expect. Never fed anything but M2 ball surplus ammo. Rifle is without a doubt one of the finest M1's I have came across. A very fine piece of history and example of American Craftsmanship. Being what this weapon is, I am in NO HURRY to let this beautiful piece go. Will trade for weapons in comparable price ranges, looking mainly for AR type rifles. Love all military/precision weapons as well but must again be of comparable value.

I would be willing to take AR15 lower receiver for a pistol or a lower in any caliber to continue building rifles/pistols....Cash on your side would be needed along with the lower receiver..

If this is still up then the ammo is still available. So again do not respond by only asking if it is still for sale..If you see the ad then it is for sale.."

It's been out for practice sessions a few times and carried as backup when I think I might need more than a speed loader (like trips out of town). Light enough to carry all the time, plenty of snap with +P's. Trust me, you don't want a .357 this size. I can't do pictures . IF YOU CAN BUY ONE for less, just do it, don't tell me about it. It's a very good gun and I would recommend it regardless of where you buy it. For REAL LIFE USE BUY QUALITY AND PRACTICE!! When a cheap toy goes ""click"" at the range, who cares? In life, NO!

What is important to me is that the weapon shows no signs of pitting or rust. Also weapons that do not have matching numbers decrease its value significantly. I will pay more for special ""Dragoon"" and other specialty weapons. 

I can pick these up at Cabelas for $100 (gun, bayonet, accessories) and have my pick of the lot. I just don't like to drive 3 hours to get a new weapon. However, I am not willing to pay exorbitant amounts of money just for convenience. These weapons are valued at between 80-125 dollars. Please don't send me an offer with a $300 price tag; I won't buy it unless it’s a Dragoon with a hex receiver and in immaculate shape.

The firearm is in excellent condition and it was purchased in February of 2012.  I purchased it from Bills GS in Robbinsdale as a certified pre-owned from Sig Sauer.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with the gun, the reason I am selling it is to put the money towards a new vehicle.  It has been kept inside the case at all times (excluding when I shoot it at the range).  I can't justify keeping it if I only shoot it every few months.

I have fired 300 rounds of Federal American Eagle through it.  It has a DA/SA trigger which is extremely smooth, only the 1911 is smoother in my opinion.  It also has a rail in case you want to mount a flashlight on it. 


If you are interested in the firearm or you have any questions, feel free to contact me. I would love to give this gun a new home where it would actually be used..

Midwest Defense Institute believes that self-defense is a universal human right, and that quality training for personal protection does not have to come at a high price.

Most training classes in the state of Minnesota charge fees that are prohibitively high for many citizens, especially when considering the added cost to file an application for a permit to carry. Some instructors have made ""affordable"" classes, but having sat in them, we can say they sacrifice quality to achieve that low price point. Our goal at Midwest Defense Institute is to provide you with quality training at an affordable cost. We strive to do everything with the best quality we can provide, and focus on a positive, professional, and educational experience in our classes.

All of our instructors are NRA certified and maintain their skills with continuous training and yearly recertification to ensure we offer the best possible training for you.
