Description: 
The Caracal pistol was first shown to the public in 2007. It was designed by the team of European small arms designers, led by Austrian W.Bubits, who previously participated in design of the Steyr M pistol. The Caracal pistols are manufactured in UAE and already in use by military and police forces of several Middle East nations. These pistols also available in several European countries for commercial sales. To prove reliability and durability of Caracal pistols, these guns were submitted for official trials under NATO, German Armed Forces and German Police testing protocols, and Caracal pistols successfully passed all these trials.

Caracal pistols are available in two basic versions, Caracal F (full size) and Caracal C (compact), which are internally similar but have different dimensions and magazine capacities. Caracal pistols are short recoil operated, locked breech weapons that use modified Browning-type locking system with tilting barrel. The trigger is of double-action only type, striker fired, with patented pre-cocked striker system, which allows for low bore axis placement. No manual safeties are provided, but guns are fitted with automated trigger and firing pin safeties. Pistol frames are made from impact-resistant polymer, barrels and slides are manufactured from carbon steel. Double stack magazines hold 18 rounds of 9mm ammo. Pistols are offered with standard fixed sights of with proprietary 'Quick sights' with coloring inserts. An integral Picatinny rail on the frame, below the barrel, allows for easy installation of useful add-ons, such as laser-aiming module or tactical flashlight. Other accessories, designed for this pistol, such as detachable shoulder stocks, forward grips, red dot sight mounts etc are available from manufacturer.

I'm selling because it is a little wide for my hands so I'm looking to buy a 1911 that would fit me better. I purchased this gun used so I don't know the exact round count, but personally I've put 300 rounds through it and have not had a single failure.

An ideal concealed carry handgun or one for the glove compartment or the nightstand if there ever was one. Add to that the legendary Beretta quality and you can't go wrong.

When I say almost new, if this pistol has had 20 rounds put through it, it'd be a lot, you'll want to consider it as being in its break-in period.  Bluing is 100%; no nicks, dings, scratches, etc.  Minty is a term that comes to mind.

It is virtually in perfect condition, and has been kept primarily in a lock box inside a safe for over 28 years.  It's been fired less than 150 times.  It comes with three total clips, and an authentic H&K belt holder for two of the clips.

Now there is PRVI AMMO and it is only 98gr which is the latest ammo found for this pistol on line, this ammo makes a popping sound when used, but it is OK for plunking.

This is a real fine piece of history, there will come a day when this pistol will be a rare collectors item, especially in the excellent condition as this one is. There are pistols like mine for sale on line the only problem is they have the name of the suppler stamped across the frame, makes it look ugly. 

The Nagant Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire.

The Nagant was chambered for a proprietary cartridge 7.62, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile to be suppressed at 1000fps (an unusual ability for a revolver designed in 1895). 

If you would like to take a closer look and buy this Russian 1895 7.62 Nagant Pistol, call REDACTED or reply by e-mail.

The two pictures are stock photos, the pistol you will receive is exactly the same if not better.
The picture of the ammo is the way it comes from the arsenal, one box fits into the pouch on the holster.

Only 100 rounds through it.

Very great shooter .. The following is from another website describing gun.... The model 96/17M wears a light profile 18-½ inch barrel that measures .553 inch at the muzzle. The rifle has a deep blue/black metal finish and an attractive birch stock with a smooth carbine style butt plate. The trigger pull  released with four and three-quarters pounds of pressure. The magazine holds nine rounds of .17 magnum ammo, and is of the excellent rotary design. Ruger’s rimfire rifles have the best magazine design in the industry. Most competitive .17 magnum rifles have a box magazine that looks like an afterthought, but the Ruger design fits flush with the bottom of the stock, and has about an eighty percent capacity advantage over most box magazines. The barrel wears a set of adjustable open sights, and is also supplied with a scope mount base that attaches to the pre-drilled receiver.Any question just ask...

Argon purging puts waterproof and fogproof performance on the agenda, and advanced fully multi-coated optics raise an eyebrow when crystal clear, tack-sharp images appear in the crosshairs. Look for all this and more in a riflescope you'd expect to cost quite a bit more-but doesn't. We can live with that.
3.5-10x50 riflescope is ideal for big game, predator/varmint, muzzleloader, slug shotgun, and long range applications. V-Plex reticle is the single best all-purpose hunting reticle intended for a wide variety of hunting applications.

No synthetic stock or scope mounts. Comes with the standard tool kit, oil can, sling, and bayonet. Rifling is strong, hasn't been counter bored. I've cleaned off most of the cosmoline, but after 20 rounds or so, you'll notice it to start bubbling out of the stock from the heat.

Along with the rifle, I have about 1,000 rounds of 54r. 
400 Rounds are the regular FMJ surplus, still in the brown paper.
About 67rounds of Silver Bear soft points, still in their box.
Finally, about 600 rounds of Czech ""low recoil"" rounds, info here: http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinAmmo013.htm
It's really fun stuff, basically it makes your Mosin feel like a .22. It's great for anyone who likes shooting, especially kids. 

Basically I'm asking $100 for the rifle and $0.20 a round. I'd like to sell the rifle and ammo together, so I'm not lugging around one or the other. Even if you just throw the rifle out, it's still only $0.30 a round. 

I'm in Austin and will meet anywhere within 30 minutes or so. If you want to meet on a range, I'd prefer Lonestar over Reds, but I will go to either. I;m going to require a valid TX Driver's License at the time of sale."

The gun itself has a good bore, a little wear on the finish from use, and is a traditional DA/SA with a left side, slide mounted, hammer drop safety. It does have an exposed hammer that is factory flush with the rear of the slide for carry and the first double action shoot. It also has a magazine safety, so the gun will not fire with the magazine removed ala the Browning Hi-Power. It has an aluminium frame for lighter weight. Capacity is 7+1. 

Overall this is a fine concealed carry (or open carry) gun in the proven .45 ACP caliber. Built to the same standards as the larger 3rd generation Smith & Wesson .45s, this gun will feed any type of cartridge design. The sights are a 3 dot arrangement and are easy to pick up for fast shooting. While it has a shorter barrel, I was able to keep a beer can moving out to about 20 yards from an off hand position. 

Straight across trades I would be interested in are:

3rd GEN Glock 19 (w/ night sights prefered) and a like amount of mags(give or take)
 Smith & Wesson Model 66 w/ 4"" barrel
 Smith & Wesson Model 586/686 with a 4"" barrel
 Beretta Model 92 Inox
 Possibly a 3rd GEN Glock 23, with the same features as the 19 above, but I am not a big fan of the 40 S&W, so that would be my LAST preference. Maybe other handguns that I can't think of offhand, so let me know what you have. 

AS far as a cash price I will do $550 firm. I'm selling this as a package, so it all goes for one money. FTF transactions only. I can meet in the OKC area Mon-Fri, and in the SW OK area on weekends. 

I can get more pictures for those interested. First PM saying they want it gets it. Thanks for looking. I hope everyone has a good weekend. Take a minute to reflect on why you have that extra time off..."

I'm selling my Browning BT-99 trap gun.  Just bought a BT-99 Plus and now she's expendable. Shoots great.  This 05' BT has invector plus choke tubes on a 34"" barrel. I will include 3 tubes with it: Mod, IM, and Full.   The barrel is overbored to .741 which most will agree produces consistent and tight patterns, while also contributing to lower chamber pressure and reduced recoil.  She shoots softer than any of my other break open guns.  The breech bolt locks up tight, and the lever is pointing right of center.  The bore is shiny and has been well maintained.  Has 2 beads on the vented rib. There are no signs of rust or wear on the gun.  Would say its mint, with the exception of a small nick, the size of a piece of rice, that i took an extreme closeup picture of.    Great overall gun.  Serious buyers only please.  Email me for more pictures. I have more high quality pics to share.   No trades.  Thank you,  Mike."
