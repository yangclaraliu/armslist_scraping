The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge.
     The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns.
     The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens.

Polished internals, lightened trigger pull, Will trade for Glock 34/35 only. Other trades will not be considered. 300 rounds fired through this gun. Must be an Oklahoma resident with a photo ID. 

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72"" bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ's corrosion resistant black polycoat fi nish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.


The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also
found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005's IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

I am the original owner of this gun and it has had approximately 800 rounds fired through it. It comes with the original Colt box, Colt Safety and Operators Manual, Colt Firearms Authorized Repair Station Sheet, Warranty Card, Colt Companion Safety and Marksmanship Brochure, and NRA Card that came in the box. The gun also has a Springfield Armory KwikComp National Match Compensated Barrel, Videki Speed Trigger, Wilson Combat Beavertail Grip Safety, Ambidextrous Safety, Blued Steel Flat Backstrap, Millett Mark I Fixed Combat Sights, as well as all the original Colt factory parts. The hammer has been bobbed, action job for a crisp 3 lb trigger pull, and slightly widened ejection port. All the parts and the gunsmith work was installed and performed by professional gunsmith, the late Tom Pridmore. The gun has never been holstered so the only wear is from firing the weapon and from disassembly/assembly from field stripping to clean the gun. If you have any questions or would like to see other pictures, please contact me."

Apparently influenced by the Walther PP in design, the Vz.50 had several differences in safety and disassembly. In the early 1970s the basic design went through minor face-lift, and the ""new"" design received the designation of Vz.70. Many Vz.50 pistols were refurbished to Vz.70 standard, with different finish, grip panels and a slightly different safety lever. New Vz.70 pistols were also manufactured between 1970 and 1983. After the replacement in service of the older Vz.50 and Vz.70 by more modern 9mm Vz.82 pistol, most were sold as surplus, as Cz-50 and Cz-70, respectively.

The Vz.50 (commercially sold as Cz-50) is a compact pistol of all-steel construction, firing the relatively weak 7.65mm ammunition. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed. Magazines are single stack. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. Vz.70 (Cz-70) pistols are similar, with minor differences in the finish, shape of the safety lever and grips. Manual safety is a lever at left side of the frame, behind the trigger guard. To set on safe: pull the lever down; if the hammer was cocked, it will be automatically brought down to rest. To disengage safety: push the lever up; a red dot will appear on the frame.

I would like to get $1400 for the rifle.  If you are serious about a trade please layout what you are willing to trade.  If it is something I am not interested in I will just politely decline.  I am not really looking for rifles or small caliber pistols under 9mm.

I don't need holsters or ammo to be part of the deal. I am very aware of what these guns are worth, so please, no smoke and no mirrors.

Paint was done with Krylon satin finish, all moving parts and serial number properly covered during the process and all moving parts CLP'd afterwards.  100 Rounds prior to paint, 300 after paint, no misfires.

The retail for everything new is over $700, I would like to recover half of what I paid.  These are getting harder to come by after they lost their lawsuit to HK.

I picked this up on 5/7 and have never put a round down it. All I did was to clean all of the packing grease Taurus slathers on for shipping from it and lube it with some quality Slipstream lube.  Got it home and realized I overextended myself on the credit card.  It was marked $642.95 and I paid more than that out the door, but you can take it off my hands for $600.  It has really nice walnut grips that are a combination of European stipple and American checkered blended from corner to corner with a Taurus Bull Head logo in the center, very nice looking.  Also comes with the stock black plastic grips if that is more to your liking. 2 blued 8 round mags with bumper pads, blushing wrench, cleaning rod and keys to the Taurus safety system lock included as well. Like I said its brand new. Slide action is very smooth. 

Some pics of the pistol and also of my receipt so you can see that it was bought when I said it was from an actual dealer and this isn't some gun show purchase I am trying to pass on.

The stock on this rifle had camo tape put on it (along time ago).
Two problems arose while removing the tape.
1) The gray color (mostly around the checkering areas) is ""sticky"" glue residue left by tape.
This caused no harm and I am in the process of removing it.
2) The tape removed some of the actual finish from the surface of the stock.
Long story short..... the wood and checkering are in good condition but some of the finish is gone.
The metal shows wear also.
$325 cash or I will add cash on a trade for a quality handgun.
Be reasonable though, I'm not going to just give it away."

Bought this last week, since I was always curious about the 21SF.  

I was specifically looking for the SF-Glock rail version which is harder to find locally--  Tried it out. (Glock rail version is much easier to find holsters for, vs. the Pictinny rail version- which won't fit molded holsters)  I have larger slim hands with long fingers and there is not enough difference for me compared to my regular G21 to justify owning both. Decided to keep my regular G21 since I have it custom tricked out for tactical.

This 21SF has usual Standard sights hicap mags, Glock do-dads and latch box.

Prefer FTF/CHL  in the Cincinnati area.

Upper is Doublestar Arms (DSA), lower is API (Aero-Precision, whom used to manufacture parts for Armalite before going into their own business.

If you're looking for a rifle that is durable, reliable, and which can put years worth of rounds downrange, this *is* your rifle. 

Barrel is 1:9 twist, optomized for 55 gr (approximately) rounds, but will still handle lighter or heavier rounds with more than acceptable downrange accuracy, and is chrome molly-coated for added durability. Upper is chambered for 5.56x45, so will easily handle either .223 or the hotter 5.56 depending on your preference. Lower is multi-cal marked, with pictograph safety selector symbols (think HK rifles). 

Will also include two USGI 30-round magazines to get you shooting sooner! Standard M-4 furniture, and can include a Rock River Arms carry-handle for an extra $50 if that's your sighting preference. Will consider partial trades, but only if they are of exceptional value because I'm really looking for more of a cash deal on this one.

The bore is clean and shinny, action lock up is tight.
 I had a gunsmith evaluate it and determined it is fully functional and is safe to shot with a lighter load.  The stock was repaired at the wrist a looong time ago. Case hardend coloring, on the action, is still very nice and I'd give barrel blueing 75%. 
 This piece is probably best suited to be a wall hanger, but could still go to the range or greet unwelcome guests.

Do you want to make sure you are covered in the worst case scenario and everything is legal?

Gun Envy offers a transfer service where you can meet face to face here in Grove City.  If you wish to conclude the sale we can take the firearm into our possession, log it through our system and back out to the receiving party.  

As an FFL when we book it into our system the seller will prove their ID to us, then the receiving party will need to complete the 4473 form and pass the Instant Background Check before receiving the firearm.

Why would you want to do this?

As a seller you want to be sure that the buck does not stop at you if something bad happens with the firearm.  Being transferred to an FFL puts the firearm on the books and records definitively that you no longer posses it.

As the buyer you want to be sure of what you are getting.  Should this firearm end up having a record, you have followed a process that allows you to push it back to the dealer and we in turn can trace back to the seller.

All in all it allows both parties to be secure in the transaction for just $10 each.  Payment can be made at the time in Cash/Credit Card by one party or split between both.

So, up for sale goes my old friend here. It's a Kimber Series 1 classic stainless. The Series I pistols are fairly hard to find and are generally considered to be superior in quality control all around. There are a few very minor imperfections (not the picture of the front strap), but at a glance, this pistol is in almost new condition. Comes with box and one 7 round blued magazine. This gun is unmolested and has a beautiful trigger with about a 4.5 lb. pull and very little if a any take up. One of the nicest factory set triggers you will ever find. Round count is unknown as I bought the gun used, but I would say by the condition of the pistol that it is well under 1000. After looking closer, I can't say it's even had a box through it. Come look at it, and you decide. Look at the pictures of the barrel. 
Price is $850 ftf in Norman. Remember, this is a Series I, NOT a Series II."

I also will toss in a nice Taurus 66 in case the value of your firearm exceeds what I have.

Here is a description of the Honda: The Honda CH250 was an automatic transmission scooter capable of 70 mph (112kph) at around 70 mpg. A highly collectible scooter today!
The various common names stem from whichever region they were distributed. Elite: North America, Freeway: Japan, Spacy; rest of the world.
It has a pedal on the right side for the rear brake, and a hand grip on the right handlebar for the front disc brake. As an automatic there is no gear shift, but the brake pedal seems to incorporate a clutch for the automatic transmission. Electric starts reliably on the first try of the switch. The radiator fill-cap is located in the handy glove box. There is plenty of underseat luggage area, and some also have a cargo box on the rear rack which also adds lots of storage space as well as a nice backrest for the rear passenger. Perfect for the family outing and bringing home the groceries.
The engine delivers plenty of power, even for hill climbing at freeway speeds. Reports in that it tends to run wide on turns but otherwise handles like a regular motorcycle but with the advantage of stepping through and not having to through your leg over. The windscreen is reported as a little low for freeway cruising in wet weather, the rider needing to pull their head down (which of course leaves your pillion wide open to the inclement weather)."

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Initially manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass.
Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

The grip of the PX4 has removable backstraps; with three backstraps of different sizes, so the actual grip can be adapted to most shooters. The frame also features a standard Picatinny-type accessory rail as a standard. Magazine capacity is 17 rounds of 9mm ammo
