It underwent FTR (factory thorough refurbishment) in 1949 at the ROF (Royal Ordnance Factory), Fazakerley, England, was rebarrelled at this time, and had minor repairs to the butt and forestocks (normal for rifles used in drill practice). The barrel is actually dated 1948, and after about May 1949 the factories started making No.4 Mk.2s and converting No.4 Mk.1s and Mk.1*s to No.4 Mk1/2s and 1/3s (it gets confusing after a while), so this rifle left the factory after refurbishment between January and May 1949. This means that there are not many rifles left that went through FTR in 1949 without going through modification to Mk1/2 or Mk1/3, so this rifle has some rarity value. (Yes, I have studied these rifles a little bit lol)

The attached scope is a Tasco Pronghorn 3-9x32 scope, mounted to the rifle with an S&K instamount with S&K rings (The scope is pretty cheap but quite tough and has reasonable optics, and the mount sells new at about $85-90).

Conditon of the rifle is very good for a 66 year old warhorse. The woodwork is in very good condition, except for some slight dings and the very minor repairs previously noted (all repairs were made by qualified British Army armourors, and they are a fussy bunch when it comes to details). The external metalwork finish is in very good condition, with some loss of the finish at the muzzle and the neighbouring endcaps, and some slight wear over the high points of the receiver, as would be expected. Bore is shiny with sharp rifling. Serial numbers are matching on the receiver, bolt, forestock and magazine.

I am asking $350+shipping. The rifle is worth at least $300, the scope mount is $90 new, and the scope was $45. I have managed to get 1MOA out of this rifle, so it is a very good shooter. Photos available at:

Occasionally, I take guns as trades towards my bikes.  I also have purchased a few myself.  Over the past year or so though, I haven't had the extra time to shoot much at all.  I don't hunt so all of my shooting is just recreational.  It is a shame to let these just sit there with such little use.  Here is what I am willing to let go.  You are welcome to make offers, but I am not money trouble and I will not give them away.  I am very meticulous with my guns and I take very good care of them.  They are nice guns.  I might take trades.  I can trade up or down for ATVs, boats, jet skis, maybe a zero turn mower, ect?  I am really not looking for any other guns at the moment except maybe an XDM.  Here is a list of what I am letting go.

Smith and Wesson 40 Sigma, 3 mags, facory paperwork, case, and lock.  I added a slip on grip to this one.  $325

Hi Point 380, 3 mags, hardcase, factory lock, the only thing I did to this was polish the feed ramp on it.  It doesn't jam up unless you limp wrist it or shoot aluminum casing through it.  Winchester White Box works best. - $200

Ruger M77 Hawkeye, .308, Less than 50 rounds through it, belly dump, Nikkon Prostaff Scope with Bullet Drop Compensator.  Super nice gun.  This set up would run between $900-$1000 new. - $750

Benelli Nova 12ga. pump, Advantage cammo, I have an extra choke with it.  This was $479 new, $400

Mossberg 500 tactical 12 ga. pump, it has a few extra on it.  I don't know a lot about this one.  Has a glass sight on it and the stock holds some extra shells.  It has a few handling marks on it as well. - $350

Ruger SR9, I paid 485 new with the extra mag.  Has 3 mags total, factory lock and case.  $425

Apple iPad 3G Wi-Fi 16GB / 32GB / 64GB  Cost  $500 USD 

Apple iPad has a high-resolution, 9.7-inch LED-backlit IPS display which is remarkably crisp and vivid. Which makes it perfect for web browsing, watching movies, or viewing photos. With iPad, there is no up or down. It's designed to show off your content in portrait or landscape orientation with every turn. And because it uses a display technology called IPS (in-plane switching), it has a wide, 178Â° viewing angle. So you can hold it almost any way you want and still get a brilliant picture, with excellent color and contrast.

Comes with 30rnd clip and alot of wolf ammo to keep you happy at the range for a while! All numbers are matching and it is in GREAT condition! It is amazeing all the attachments you can buy for this gun! I don't have to tell anyone that these guns are getting VERY rare and have shot up in value 10 fold in the last 15yrs. There is no reason this gun should ever go down in valuesince demand is getting higher every day and production has stopped. I want a good weapon that can be carried in a holster and is a bit smaller. I don't need 30rnds for self protection! I have an AK for that! I'm looking for a trade and I have a few items in mind. I'm looking for a Desert Eagle 50. or 45., A glock 45.,44 mag, a very nice colt 45. with holster and belt, or make me an offer on another type gun you think I may be interested in. I'm also interested in WW2 firearms. I'm looking for a good m1-A1 carbine, ORIGINAL German k-98 rifle with matching numbers and all German parts,Colt 1911, or whatever you have to trade I'll consider. Lastly, I collect WW2 Axis things such as uniforms, helmets, hats, and medals. NOTE: I am not a neo-Nazi so please do not think that I am sympathetic to Nazis in any way. I've had PPL contact me for the sole reason to talk about Hitler, or to call me a Nazi. Also, I know the difference between the Spanish made German eqipment so don't even try and sell that to me as original!"

This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger's Target GreyÂ® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** HogueÂ® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil."

You don't even need a license! Extremely dependable to produce results when used! I have owned the rifle for less than 1 year and I absolutely love it but I don't get to shoot it as much as I would like to due to the fact that I live within city limits. Included are two cases, one hard, the other soft as well as 2-30rnd, and 1-10rnd magazine. Just under 700 rounds (698 to be exact) have been fired through it. I have kept a log of every time I shoot it including the date, how many rounds I fire, what kind of ammo I use, and any misfires that may occur (out of 698 rounds, 1 bullet failed to fire due to bad packing). I have had no other issues with it firing or misfiring.  All custom modifications and extra accessories such as the cleaning kit, manual, and all original accessories such as the A-2 fore-grip are included.

This is the most impractical firearm in my collection and I have bills to pay so it is up for sale.

This particular Construcktion 96 was imported from China during the late 1980s and I am the second owner.  It is chambered for 9mm parabellum.  Prior owner stated he fired approx 200 rounds through it and had it in storage for the past 10 years before selling it to me last month.  Prior owner knows a lot about Broomhandles and told me if I ever have a problem to call him, and I'll provide the buyer with his contact information.  I have not fired it at the range, but I've examined it thoroughly and everything appears in excellent condition.  It feeds and ejects snap caps and I fired a primed case, so the extractor and firing pin are fine and the bolt stop looks good too.  Bore is in nice shape.  Uses detachable magazines, and comes with one 10 rd and one 20 rd.  Also comes with a leather holster that holds 2 stripper clips (included), and the original shipping carton with styrofoam insert.  The upper appears to be from an actual Mauser, the lower appears to be from Shansei Arsenal.  Serial number on the magazines and box match, but do not see a number on the receiver.

This was an impulse purchase that I couldn't really afford, and my disability makes it difficult for me to work the action on this firearm as the springs are quite strong and it is awkwardly designed.  Even though this is a functional firearm and the prior owner stated he fired it on several occasions, I would classify this as a curio rather than a shooter.  Reliability is questionable, replacement parts are scarce, and frankly the antiquated design is not user friendly and could result in an accidental discharge if mishandled.  If you purchase this firearm and intend to fire it, please familiarize yourself with the workings of the C96 (many videos online) and have it examined by a gunsmith first.     

I seldom see this style of C96 in 9mm with detachable magazines, and they typically sell for $800+ on gunbroker.  I paid nearly $600 for this, with the holster, mags, and strip clips.

I'm pricing this for a quick sale:  $475 CASH.  Price is firm.  Not really interested in trading, but I'd consider a S&W 469 or a MPA 9mm.

Will try to have pic up later tonight.

Thanks.

Maximum firepower and reliability. This model no longer in production.
     I Designed this weapon with budget in mind. This Cadillac of the AK-47 world comes complete with super high quality folding stock from Arsenal in Las Vegas Nevada. Known for producing the highest quality of AK varients, this model is imported from Bulgaria.
     This nikon red dot is not sub-par to the Eotech, just Affordable. Zero was maintained after repeated and sustained fire from the powerful 7.62 x 39 rd.  Japanese nikons are held in high regard localy, among semi-professional and sporting hunters alike.
     The varialbe intensity red dot increases the max eff range from 100 to 200 meters. The owner of this rifle can hit watermelons 200 meters away and they shoot up 30 ft into the air. Besides sheer knockdown power, this platform offers superior reliablility as compared to the ar-15 at closer distances. Most encounters happen within 100 meters in the urban setting.This is where the AK dominates,For those of you without the knowin, they happen mostly at night.This is where The queen of battle Rules. 
     The monsterous weapon light pictured has an integrated Throw Arms Lever and normally puts off a blinding 225 lumens and is in current US Military service in the middle east & around the world. 
     With the 900 lumen L.E.D. head attatched the first thing noticable (besides an eery flood like effect) is the enhanced view within your peripheral vision. Pressure switch included, fork and spoon attatcment extra;P

I won this rifle when I became a life member of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and put a scope on it expecting to make it my deer rifle. I never did hunt with this rifle but it still wears a Burris Signature Series 1.5 X 6 scope mounted with the Ruger factory rings.

Purchased used (I was told it was a police trade) on February 15, 2010.  This was meant as a home defense weapon, but now I need the cash.

Could use a good cleaning, and does show holster wear.

Well known throughout the world as the definitive Special Forces boat, the FC range, 
and specially the FC 470 is used by more elite soldiers and sailors than any other craft 
worldwide. It is the only craft of its type that has actually been used in combat in 
different theatres and comes thru with flying colors. This is a result of its unique 
patented hull shape and various floor systems that allows it to carry combatants in a 
variety of missions. The hull shape is especially important as it can get a large load on 
the plane as well as give the driver unsurpassed maneuverability in different and often 
dangerous conditions. Continually being updated for its ever-changing roles, the FC 
range is Zodiac's most recognizable military boat.

They will be available the first part of June. Very unique and powerful battle rifle. Made by hand in the USA. Reliable and Accurate (see target). Below is an article about them done by the awesome Jeff Quinn of gunblast.com. It pretty much explains everything about the rifles. Rifle only no potics, 1 20 round FAL magazine and factory box w/ manual included. Thanx for looking...........


""RFB stands for: Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. The barrel length on this RFB carbine measures eighteen inches, and the muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 threads-per-inch, so that it will readily accept muzzle brakes, flash suppressors, and sound suppressors. The carbine is equipped with a closed-bottom birdcage style flash suppressor. The barrel is rifled one turn in 11.25 inches, and has six grooves. A twenty-four inch barrel will be offered in the future and barrels can be changed out by a competent owner with the right tools. The RFB uses commonly-available metric pattern FAL surplus magazines, and comes supplied with one twenty-round mag. The magazine slides up straight from the bottom, with no tilting necessary to slam it home with the bolt locked open. There are ambidextrous bolt release levers at the rear of the magazine housing on either side, and an ambidextrous magazine release at the rear of the magazine housing. The paddle-type mag release is very easy to use. The safety is also ambidextrous, with levers on either side at the top of the pistol grip. The charging handle pulls to the rear and is released to chamber a cartridge from the magazine, and can be easily and quickly switched to either side, as the operator prefers. This RFB carbine is a true fully-ambidextrous design. Nothing is compromised for left-handed shooters, and the rifle works just as well for a left-hander as for a right-handed shooter. 
The barrel of the RFB is made from 4140 ordnance steel, and has a chrome-lined bore and chamber.Â  The bolt, receiver, and gas system are also made of 4140 steel, and the internal surfaces of the gas system are chrome plated as well to resist wear and corrosion. The bolt carrier and upper cover are made of stamped 4130 sheet steel. The grip and hand guard are made of made of a high-tech polymer, and are textured for a positive grip. The hand guard has an integral hand-stop at the lower front to prevent the support hand from sliding forward and touching the hot barrel. Machined into the barrel, just forward of the gas block is a threaded area about 1.125 inches in diameter, with interrupted threads. This threaded area is for the attachment of a forward tri-rail for mounting lasers and accessories.
The gas piston system has an adjustable regulator which Kel-Tec calls the gas restrictor cap. The device adjusts the amount of gas that is delivered to the piston, to compensate for the ammunition, weather conditions, and other variables to reliably operate the action.
The RFB has no mechanical sights, but wears a nine and three-quarters inch long 1913 Picatinny rail atop the rifle for the mounting of optical sights. This compact design results in an overall length of only twenty seven and one-half inches including the detachable flash suppressor, and an empty weight of eight pounds, nine ounces on my scale. The length of pull is fourteen inches. The very handy overall length is almost a full foot shorter than my LRT-SASS with an equal-length barrel. The RFB is also lighter, and balances very well, right at the pistol grip. The RFB carbine would serve handily where a powerful but compact weapon is needed in tight quarters.
At first, I was a bit intimidated about taking this RFB apart to examine the internals, as I have seen nothing quite like this before, but after doing so, found that it is very easy to disassemble for cleaning and maintenance, and nothing more than the nose of a bullet is needed to fully strip this carbine. There are a couple of disassembly pins in the rear, and another in the front, to access parts and to remove the bolt and carrier for access to the barrel breech for cleaning. The gas piston system is easy to clean, and is a very simple and reliable design. A small amount of powder gas is bled off through a hole in the bore, flows through the gas block, and the short-stroke piston smacks the bolt carrier directly, moving it rearward to extract the fired case and chamber a fresh round from the box magazine. The empty cartridge case is not ejected with the rearward movement of the bolt and carrier, but is held by the extractors until the bolt is moving forward chambering a cartridge. At that time, the empty case is tilted slightly upward, and is released by the extractors into the ejection chute as the bolt closes on the freshly-chambered round. It is an ingenious design, like nothing that I have ever seen before. The empty cases then slide forward, out through a hole in the gas block.
I gathered a variety of .308 and 7.62x51 ammo, and mounted a Leupold Mark 4 scope for accuracy and function testing. Ammo consisted of military NATO spec 147 grain ball and purple-tip cartridges, commercial .308 hunting ammo, and Buffalo Bore Sniper and Federal Gold Medal Match hollowpoint target ammo. With every type tested, reliability was one hundred percent. Every round fed, fired, and ejected perfectly, and the bolt always locked open on an empty magazine. Accuracy varied from good to superb, depending upon the ammo chosen. Federal Gold Medal 168 grain hollowpoint was by far the most accurate ammunition tested in this RFB carbine, grouping reliably under three-quarters of an inch for three shots at one hundred yards.Â  The military ball ammo grouped closer to two inches. Any rifle is only as accurate as the ammo fed it, and the ball ammo was from broken-down machine gun belts. It was cheap and perfectly reliable, but better stuff is needed for good accuracy. Felt recoil was mild, with no pain to the shoulder after extensive firing sessions. 
 While most bullpup rifles have heavy, long trigger pulls, the RFB does not. The Kel-Tec RFB has absolutely the best trigger pull that I have ever felt on a bullpup rifle. The release is crisp, and while measuring right at six pounds on my trigger pull gauge, it felt lighter and was easy to use, making target work very enjoyable.
The Kel-Tec RFB is a handy, reliable, and accurate bullpup rifle that packs the full power of the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge. It can fire any 7.62x51 or .308 Winchester ammunition reliably. The design is innovative, yet simple enough to work dependably. As of this writing, the retail price is $1880 US, and they are bringing that much, as demand is still outrunning the supply. However, it is a fine carbine, and there is nothing else like it on the market. It is a quality design, built with quality materials, and built in the USA. I like it."

Did some extensive research on this handgun.

The vast majority of these came in black, however this rare 38 is *factory nickel plated*, comes with a full clip of original bullets.
Along the top of the gun it says:
Manufactured By Savage Arms Co. CAL.
UTICA. N.Y. U.S.A. PAT- NOV. 21. 1905. 380
The serial number reveals it to be one of the earlier examples produced, a true .38 cal: ""7199B""
Along the side of the gun it says ""SAVAGE"" in large letters. (unlike the 32 pictured)
On the handle is the Indian head logo, and you can still read ""TRADEMARK"" on the indian's headband. Minimal wear, never shot. Could use a polishing, but otherwise it's stunning!
Apparently my grandfather was given this gun as a gift when he was a young man. He didn't particularly like guns, so he boxed it up and put it in the closet. Now it can be yours.
Asking $500 or best offer. Cash only.
Looking to sell quickly.

This is a LNIB with all the custom features plus many specified extras that I required. Their ""Competition"" Model would be their closest custom gun that they sell today that might compare with my gun.

It took 14 months to get this gun from their Custom shop, from the time I entered the order. It originally came with a 50 yard target with it in a gun vise, with (3) touching cloverleaf holes in the target. (Thats not a typo, it is 50 yards not 50 feet.) Several home moves, and 18 years later, and I can't find the target anymore; but I assure you, this will be the most accurate 1911 A1 that you will ever have the opportunity to own and shoot.

I have the Custom Built Certificate from Springfield, showing that Les Baer was their master pistol-smith that personally built this gun.

Over the years I doubt that I have run more than a box of shells through the gun. Since 1992 it has been one of my safe queens, and a gun that I wanted, not that I needed it, or shot in any competition. 

As all good things must come to an end, I am selling this beauty, and allowing another gun enthusiast to own a premier Custom Gun in absolute new condition, without the excessive long waits from a custom gun shop.

The stainless steel accessories on this all blue gun makes it really stand out, while not being too ostentatious.

This gun is 100% and since it was Custom made to my specifications, you won't find another like it.

Will ship to you or your FFL dealer for $30 by FedEx ground and insured.

I have (3) positive feedbacks over on Gunbroker.com all my transactions were done by US Postal Money Orders. 

If you have any questions feel free to contact me by email : REDACTED or by phone: 

1-REDACTED. I reside in Reno, Nevada and have lived here for the last 10 years in my custom built home. (I can't help myself, I love Custom built things)

S&W M&P40 compact...something like that. Strong preference for stainless guns in the XD's. Cash deal around Columbus, email specifics and price, maybe a pic or 2,  if you have something to sell. I'll probably end up buying new at Vances but looking to save a few $$$ on a nice used pistol for carry. No Taurus please"
