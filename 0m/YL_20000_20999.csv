MOUNT SPECIFICATIONS:

This new scope mount has been designed to provide lower ""visual alignment"" mounting for 2.5x30mm scout scopes. Solid cross bolt mounting to the rear sight base with a locking nut insures a solid and rigid installation and is a major improvement over mounting systems used in other scout mount systems. 

? New Scout Scope Mount * 
? For most 98K caliber 7.9mm (8x57) Mauser Rifles with original Mil-Spec rear sights
? No modifications to rifle required
? Easy Installation - ""No Gunsmithing"" Mount Replaces Rear Sight - Bolts Directly into Rear Sight Base 
? Hardened Matte Black Aluminum Mount with Multiple Picatinny Rail Slots - use with Weaver Style Rings 
? New One Piece Alloy Steel High Tensile Strength Mounting Bolt and locking nut - other scope mounts are made of soft aluminum and use low quality carbon steel screws which can strip the aluminum mount threads or break from the heavy recoil of this rifle 
? Allen wrenches and adjusting screws included.
? Use with Extended Eye Relief (EER) Scopes, Hologram and Red Dot Sights with long or unlimited eye relief. Standard short eye relief scopes will not work with this mount.
? Installation Instructions Included 
? Restore to Original Configuration by Removing Scope Mount and Reinstalling the Rear Sight 

? * NOTE: Other scope mounts are designed with two short bolts that screw into the sides of the mount through the rear sight base ears. With extended shooting these bolts strip out the threads in the aluminum scope mount and the mount can become loose. This new Scope Mount has been threaded completely through and fitted with a full length threaded high tensile cross bolt and locking nut that securely attaches the scope mount to the rear sight base.

The easy installation, ""no gunsmithing"" mount replaces the rear sight leaf. (Detailed installation instructions are included with the mount). Simply remove the rear sight leaf and leaf spring, then insert and bolt in the scout mount. Attach the included Weaver style rings to the Picatinny mount and install the extended eye relief  (EER) scout  scope. Restore the rifle to its original configuration by unbolting the scope and mount and reinstalling the rear sight.

Built on the legendary Model 700 action, Remington Varmint rifles are well known for being our most accurate standard production rifles. The latest evolution of our Model 700 VS SF (Varmint Synthetic Stainless Fluted) continues this prestigious pedigree.

More than just a facelift, the new Model 700 VS SF II utilizes a redesigned H.S. Precision composite stock reinforced with aramid fibers. The textured stock is colored black with green webbing and features a contoured beavertail fore-end with ambidextrous finger grooves, palm swell, and twin front tactical-style swivel studs to accommodate both a sling and a bipod. Our unique full-length aluminum bedding block provides enhanced stability and consistent shot-to-shot accuracy.

Constructed of 416 stainless steel, the 26-inch heavy-contour (0.820-inch muzzle O.D.), hammer-forged barrel features six longitudinal flutes for improved heat dissipation and additional weight reduction. The flutes are powder coated with a black finish for added visual appeal, while the rest of the barreled action is spin polished. The rifle is drilled and tapped for scope mounts and also includes a hinged floorplate magazine, a target-style concave barrel crown, and jeweled bolt.
Key Features:

    * 26"" heavy contour barrel (0.820"" muzzle O.D.) for the ultimate in long-range accuracy.
    * Concave target-style barrel crown.
    * Stock features full-length aluminum bedding blocks for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency.
    * Six longitudinal flutes reduce barrel weight and increase heat dissipation.
    * Tactical style dual front swivel stud system for convenient mounting of Bi-pod and Sling.
    * Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength.
    * Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement.
    * ""Three-rings-of-steel"" enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength."

It is my understanding that these are all the parts you can get from SA, last time I checked, you can't buy the extractor yet.  The numbers correspond to the part # in the XD manual, if you don't have one handy, you can check out the diagram at http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/FIREARMS/springfieldarmory_xd.pdf.

Unfortunately, I had to sell my pistol earlier this year and am hoping to find a good home for these brand new parts.  These are great to have on hand for backup for a competition or HD pistol (don't want to have to wait for parts) or as a complete set of what's available from SA for a preparedness-minded individual.  Here is a spare parts thread from xdtalk.com that may be helpful: http://www.xdtalk.com/forums/general-sa-xd-xd-m-talk/94824-xd-spare-parts.html.

This needs a new magazine tube and a part for the forend. The magazine tube for some reason only allows 3 shells to be loaded, I am guessing there is some burr inside the tube.

I am not sure what it is called but the two long metal arms that go from the foreend tube into the reciever might need to be replaced. I was told this is what is causing the foreend to rattle side to side.

It does have some scratches on the reciever and on the magazine tube from the loose forend. Everything else works fine, chambers fine, and shoots just fine. Magazine tube is around 40 bucks form what I found Can be easily fixed by the right person or armorer. Could be the forend tube arms are just not seated right. Asking $300 FTF Pick up in Bellevue only.

Will include original forend, shell belt, about 2dz 00 shells, and a 5.11 tactical load bearing vest. Let me know if you have any questions, PM for more pics, my apologies for the bad resolution and clarity.

Forend vertical pistol grip, folding stock, and tac sling are not included in sale.

I'm selling as used, but I'd probably consider it as new since, I didn't buy it new. It was sold to me as ""unfired"" and I just can't verify it. I've put the Colt wooden grips on, but the Black rubbers are the original grips, and the ones attached to the Python for this sale.
