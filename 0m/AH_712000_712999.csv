All original items and paperwork are included along with the box and trigger lock. Also comes with 2 extra mags for a total of 4! Satin silver finish. Saying this gun is better than new is not an exaggeration. When I bought it new earlier this year it was almost unusable. I smoothed and polished the trigger assembly, feed ramp, and slide contact points with multiple grits of sandpaper and polishing compounds. I finished with jewelers polish on a dremel tool. This helped the gun function MUCH better, but it was not perfect. I then sent it back to Jimenez who replaced the slide due to a casting defect and gave me 2 free magazines. Relisted because the first buyer backed out.

$100. Price is firm!!! I will keep it rather than go lower.
Please have a notorized purchase permit or cpl and cash.

Forgot to mention 1st time; has a new unopened extractor kit from Jimenez."

The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with a light tan finish, desert tan Hogue wraparound grip, featuring finger grooves that provide a sure grip with a defining look. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, desert tan finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights.

It is a .44 Magnum, and has the 9.5"" barrel. It's full stainless and has the Ruger rubber and wood grips which look great and also help manage recoil. It is an awesome revolver, and will certainly draw smiles from your friends and stares from people at the range.

It comes equipped with an Ultra Dot red dot scope with sunshade. This is really the perfect combination for the Super Redhawk and is a fantastic optic. I am also going to toss in a partial box of Winchester 240gr JSP.

Everything is in very good condition. The one adjustment cover on the sight has a small scuff, and the revolver has the normal Stainless swirls. It is obvious it has been fired very little. I was going to use it as a deer gun, but never got around to it with a new bow. 

I am willing to travel up to 45 minutes for the right deal. I also travel to Youngstown for work frequently.

For sale is a set of genuine SAPI plates, size Large

Description:
The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) is a ceramic plate fielded by the US military. It was first used in the Interceptor body armor, a ballistic vest. It is now also used in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest as well as the Modular Tactical Vest, in addition to commercially available ""plate carriers"". The kevlar Interceptor vest itself is designed to stop projectiles up to and including 9x19mm Parabellum submachine gun rounds, in addition to fragmentation. To protect against higher velocity rifle rounds, SAPI or ESAPI plates are needed.

Materials and capabilities
The standard plate for the Interceptor body armor is made of boron carbide or silicon carbide ceramic.  The standard plates are not given an NIJ rating, as they are tested in accordance with specific protocols for the military and not the NIJ's testing. Military testing calls for survivability of three hits from the round marked on the plate - for standard SAPI, of a caliber up to 7.62x51mm NATO M80 ball and of a muzzle velocity up to 2,750 ft/s (840 m/s). This performance is only assured when backed by the soft armor of the OTV (or any soft armor which meets military requirements for protection. The ceramic plate is backed with a shield made of Spectra, a material up to 40% stronger than Kevlar, to trap any fragments of either plate or projectile and prevent them from injuring the wearer.

The gun has been re-finished or parkerized at some point instead of maintaining its original finish.  This explains the faintness of the markings.  Also the rear sight - which has some damage is installed backward.  I post this new info in good faith because I do not want to mis-represent the gun in any way to any potential buyer. The gun is still very rare with correct parts except for the grips.  It is still collectable or has value for the individual parts.  Due to this new information, I am open to all offers above my investment.

Very rare 45 cal. model 1911 manufactured by Union Switch & Signal in 1943.  This gun is complete with all correctly parts except the wooden grips.  Correct plastic grips are easily found.  The markings and stamps are correct to include the slide, frame and barrel.  The gun does function properly but should be considered a collectable - not a shooter, because of its rarity and value.  The USS models were the only manufacturer which passed all US. Army acceptance testing.  Only the Singer models had fewer produced.

The USS markings on the left side of the slide are faint as is the RCD inspection stamp and proof marks but all are readible.  The sn, model marks on the right frame are very clear.  The barrel is correct but does show some bore wear.  The frame/slide fit is loose as was most of the issued service models.  The rear sight has some drop damage which slightly flattened the right ear. I can provide more pictures to those interested.  This gun will never loose its value and will only become more collectable in the future."

Big John picked it out for me, and it has great rifling, and will eat even the cheapest Chinese .308s reliably.

It has a homemade woodland finish that has served me well enough while its been my truck gun on the farm.  I have three twenty round mags and one five round (hunting legal) mag, a German G3 double mag pouch, and the sling that's on it. Lighter than a M1A or a STG58.

Ruger's tooling was brand new back then, not half worn out (or worse) like the 187- and later guns of the mid eighties to nineties. This is THE Mini-14 to have IMO. I found a used Choate folder later at JC's, slapped a rail on the 6 o""clock and started getting excited about this rifle. After the birdcage/H&K style front sight, 045 gas bushing, and Ultimak, this rifle shot consistent >2MOA groups, which is plenty fine for a 5.56 around my place. I used to put it up against any AR type rifle that didn't cost 2X what it did. Since their price has dropped, I've had to stop doing that. :)

I bought the Limbsaver in May, but when I got ahold of the Anarchy, I had to buy it as well. Both bows shoot great, really impressed with both bows. The Limbsaver bow has around 25 Shots in it, while the Anarchy has around 50 shots into it. I was going to go Hunting this year, but work and other things kept me from the woods this year.

Again, both are stellar bow, they are both smooth and fast bows. The Limbsaver was supposed to have a wrench come with it for the new way you're able to change the draw weight, but a simple 1"" socket works too (that's what I used), otherwise it is in perfect shape. The Anarchy has only one ding in the camo, its on the corner of the shelf, not really noticable, and of course doesn't effect anything. 

Don't need both bows, plus I have plans to get one bow that is new for 2013 from Bear as soon as my shop gets it in.
