I took it home and slapped it on the wife's AR and she decided she doesn't like it. She likes the green dot on the Vortex better. so I am offering it up for sale or trade. It works great at all times of the day (sunny) if you are using it in conjunction with a fixed front sight post. If you are using dot alone it is hard to see the dot in the middle of the day. It works perfect in the house on a backup gun/home defense weapon. This model does have the night vision settings. I am asking $200 cash or trade. If it doesn't sell no big deal it will just go on a backup gun.

Also, included is the original receipt and all papers including the owners manual.  The box is original and in like-new condition too.  Finally I bought a new Packmeyr black rubber wrap-around grip with the Hi Power that's never been out of it's original box.  In other words, it was never installed.  I've never handled the grip, only handled the box that contained the grip.

Obviously this is a collectors item including all the supporting artifacts that are included.

The 4 wheel drive in this truck works great. The motor is a 2.8 inline v6 with a 5 speed transmission. Here is the good and the bad, well at least the short of it: First the good: The truck runs and drives great. The 4x4 is strong and one of my favorites. The 2.8 inline 6 is a great motor. The dash has no cracks. New clutch. The bad: IT IS a 1986 and looks like one should, but not what a abused woods/trail, mud truck 1986 would look like. It is in decent/fair on the looks and cosmetics. (I will post pics later and can text them tomorrow if you text me). The only real problem with the truck is there is a ticking/clicking sound when running and only does it in gear (i think) It started after I put the new clutch in. It has been driven regular and doesn't seem to be getting any worse. This truck is fun to drive and these are getting hard to come by.

In my opinion of all AK-47 clone that I shot. this is alot superior in performance specially compared to ARMSCOR AK-22 and the more expensive German Sports Gun AK-47. Why? Unlike those other AK-47 clones that is so delicate of what type of ammo you can use. I use to have GSG-522 and I cant use a hollow point without have a failure to feed, on this gun anything you feed it will chew it up any brand or type of .22LR ammo even hollow point and still will perform excellent.

It comes with 2 17 round mags and 1 33 round mag.  I will leave the 2 17 round mags full of my carry ammo, that i have tested 300 rounds of, in the trade. I also have more of that ammo to add to the right trade.  The Glock has TFO Night SIghts, which are the best sights I personally have used.  It also has a 3.5 lb trigger, and a Wolf recoil spring assembly.   I am including in the trade this IWB holster, it is very comfortable and works great for carrying the Glock 17 concealed.  I have done a ""custom"" paint on my Glock. It has some rough spots but nothing that bothers me. I think its unique lol.  And if you like the boring black then you can just take it off.  It has Talon grips that i ended up painting a little (thats what the black you  see on the grip is) I was going to replace them but never did.

Main things I am looking for are an RIA 1911 9MM Tactical or GI, RIA 1911 .45, other Glocks, XD's, 

I am open to consider all firearms trades. I am a TX CHL holder and prefer you to be also, but its not a deal breaker. Also feel free to make cash offers, worst I can say is no thank you.

The Golden Hawk Magnum is the state of the art for magnum length bows. The Golden Hawk Magnum has not only proved itself a great asset for the tree stand hunting whitetails, but has become the answer for the backpacking bowhunter who demands compactness and maneuverability. The Golden Hawk Magnum has unmatched smooth draw with true magnum penetration and knock down power.

Here is a link to Cascades website where you can see the bow ( http://www.cascadebow.com/catalog/item/2765066/7528015.htm )

Current price of bow is $832.50, extra limbs are $373.69 for a total of ($1206.19), I am asking $750obo.

I am also interested in trading for firearm(s). Silver and gold coins. Ammo.

Although unnecessary due to the extreme high quality of the bow, SERIOUS buyers/traders will be allowed to shoot bow before purchase if they desire.

The 4 wheel drive in this truck works great. The motor is a 2.8 inline v6 with a 5 speed transmission. Here is the good and the bad, well at least the short of it: First the good: The truck runs and drives great. The 4x4 is strong and one of my favorites. The 2.8 inline 6 is a great motor. The dash has no cracks. New clutch. The bad: IT IS a 1986 and looks like one should, but not what a abused woods/trail, mud truck 1986 would look like. It is in decent/fair on the looks and cosmetics. (I will post pics later and can text them tomorrow if you text me). The only real problem with the truck is there is a ticking/clicking sound when running and only does it in gear (i think) It started after I put the new clutch in. It has been driven regular and doesn't seem to be getting any worse. This truck is fun to drive and these are getting hard to come by. If you come to take a look or have any questions I will be as honest as I can and have nothing to hide. So if interested give me a call/text 205-568-7609.

Also I am in Melbourne and good deals can be found at my local shop maybe north fl gets more money but my guy sells them for $950 when he gets them in. This shop is vey fair priced he does not mark up crazy like these othe guys( for example I was on a waiting list for a PMR30 and the price was $389 when if finally came in) so your 5.7 is not worth $1300 to me. If you are ready for a straight trade give me a buzz. I will pay extra if you have some ammo you want to sell"

First Line of Defense will teach you the one thing that you're not being taught through A.L.I.C.E. training or similar training programs and that's how to fight for your survival when you're face-to-face with an active shooter.

This is just how versatile our programs are.  We can take aspects of our In-Home Defense program as well as our DT program to give you a full gambit of up close and personal response techniques that actually work.

The DT program can be catered to an unarmed or armed client, so please be sure to illustrate which category you wish to train in.  If you have a group that would like to train together and you would like to train at your school, we will help you make that happen.  Please be sure that your administrators are ok with our bringing simulated firearms onto the grounds and into the buildings as NO live firearms will be allowed during our training for safety reasons.

If you are outside the Springfield / Joplin / Rolla area, please try to get a group together for training to help us keep this price regardless of the location in Missouri.

It is 1970s surplus and to the best of my knowledge is non corrosive, however cleaning after shooting surplus ammo is always recommended to prevent excess rust buildup. Ammo is brass cased and full metal jacketed bullets. Is safe to fire out of rifles chambered in both 7.62x51mm and .308 Winchester. All is in good to very good condition and may show some tarnish depending on storage and package condition. This stuff is perfect for target practice, vermin control, and plinking. country of origin is unknown but the vacuum sealed packs closely resemble those of German surplus 147gr ammo that is also sealed in 200 round packages and is non corrosive. Price is $120 per pack(only 60 cents per round). This stuff is very hard to find and disappearing fast. Don't miss the chance to stock up on cheap ammo for your AR10, M1A/M14, FAL, or precision bolt action in 308/7.62x51mm.

This gun has had 500 rounds through it, maybe. That's a fairly conservative guess, as it has sat in my room downstairs for most of the past couple years I've owned it.

I would love to hold onto it, but I am going to school in the spring and could use some extra cash. As such, I'm looking to sell (not interested in trades).

The rifle comes with the attached bipod and a very nice Redfield Accu-Range 2-7x33 scope (model #67085). This scope is worth nearly $200, and compliments the look of the rifle very well (if I do say so myself).

As for the condition of the rifle/scope -- virtually flawless. I have not used this rifle very much and it has stayed in open-air storage, being cleaned every so often. Aside from an extremely small blemish on the barrel (negligible, but I like to mention everything), I would be hard-pressed to find anything wrong with it.

So, you get:

Ruger 10/22 Tactical Hogue Overmolded
Bipod
Redfield 2-7x33 Accu-Range scope
Ruger 10/22 Clip x1
Allen rifle carrying case (also very nice)

Seeing as how the rifle retails for $569, the scope goes for $190 on several websites, and the case is worth about 30 bucks, I feel that $650 is a very fair asking price, especially considering the exceptionally great condition that everything is in. You could buy all of this in a store and likely not have any idea that it was previously owned -- I take very good care of my things.

If you're interested, please let me know.

Feel free to text me any time of the day, and I will reply ASAP: 417 - seven seven three - 0025

I will also respond to email. Thanks for looking.

The gun is chambered in .357 magnum (and thus can also shoot .38 special rounds), and has a 6 round capacity.

I've owned this gun for a couple years, and have fired about 100 rounds through it with perfect reliability (given that it's a revolver and it's a Ruger...what else would you expect).

I'm including with this pistol the following:

Nylon holster
2 Speed Loaders
Hard carry case
Trigger lock
20 rounds of .357 magnum flat nose hard cast lead 180 gr. from Double Tap Ammunition (some of the best backpacking or hunting ammo out there for purposes of defense against 4 legged predators--more info here: http://www.doubletapammo.com/php/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=21_27&products_id=336).

If you need the gun shipped I'll pay for all shipping, and the ffl fees on my end.  You'll need to cover your own ffl fees on your end.  I suppose it goes without saying that the gun must be shipped to an actual ffl dealer.

If you're local then I'll insist on meeting up at a local ffl dealer, and making the transfer of registration and title clean that way. I'll pay the ffl transfer fees for any local buyers.

Please feel free to ask any questions.  If you want more pics, or closer pics of a particular part of the gun or one of the extras just let me know.

No trades, please.

She's not perfect, but she's in really good condition.  There's a few marks on the stock from use, a little wear on the end of the barrel, and some marks where the previous owner didn't reassemble it properly at the ejection port; none of which impacts functionality.

This shotgun has been disassembled, cleaned, lubricated, and test fired by me.  It tracks great even though she's really long.  The trigger pull is great and made me feel as though I was slapping the trigger since I was used to my O/U imports that have not been tuned.

Comes with 1 choke and a brand new manual.  Sorry, I do not have the choke kit or the blue plastic hard case, which is reflected in the price.  But, Beretta has slug barrels, smooth barrels, and chokes on sale at the moment.

The usual:  Valid ID required at the time of purchase.  Military and CCW holders are preferred, they are allowed to purchase on a bill of sale.  All others will be required to conduct a transfer through a local FFL holder.  This is to protect both buyer and seller so if you're not willing to do either of those then please don't waste your time and mine.

NOTE: If you ask retail for your trade I'll expect retail for this shotgun in return."

The magazine release is ambidextrous but it is currently on the left side. The previous owner didn't supply a tool for me so I didn't bother changing it. One of the holster is custom made to fit a light, and the other is without a light. FYI test cartridge shows 2006 so that should give a rough estimate of how old the gun is. The case is not the new padded blue one but the older black one with orange color writing.There is no sign of major scuffs or damage. Other then a line on the slide ( I can supply a photo) It isn't a deep scratch I couldn't figure out what it is and got the gun like that.  The gun has sites on them but not sure what kind they are. Not looking for any trades. Cash only deal. Pistol permit of concealed weapon permit required. I will need a bill of sale signed and can provide you with a copy also upon request. NC residents we can do a FTF or I can meet any SC resident at your FFL. Shipping to any out of state FFL will be $25. All federal, local , and state laws apply.
