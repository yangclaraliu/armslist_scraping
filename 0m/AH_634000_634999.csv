In case you see the mags full or ammo in the picture....
I keep all mags filled with 10 rounds as to not destroy the springs, but do keep ammo in them,,,,,,,,,JUST IN CASE I need them (what good is it to have 6 mags if 5 of them are always empty, RIGHT?).

It is a sweet over / under that will provide many great days in the field."

Very hard to come by.

I have had my personal one for 3 years and use it daily with no problems.  Knife has a clip on the back for your pocket or belt which ever you prefer.  In the picture you'll see a pencil among the knives that way you can judge their size.  You can't call your self a true knife collector with out having a switch blade in your case.

Knives are 50 dollars a piece but will last your entire life, will be a few dollars more if I have to mail them and I won't mail them until I have your money in my hand.  Will lower price 5 dollars a knife if your buying more then one, that's after you pay the original 50 dollars for the first.

This is a serious tack driver.  It shoots sub-minute (3"") groups at 500 yards using anything I could feed it.  It is known for being one of the most forgiving rifles when it comes to ammunition.  It just shoots!  I now have a $7,000.00 custom rig and to my disappointment, the CZ shoots just as well.  I can't say enough about the single set trigger.  It can be set very light.  It blows away my rifles with the Accu-Triggers.  

It's had around three hundred rounds through it (6000 to 8000 round barrel, barely broke in) and it is spotless.  Not one mark on it and it has been cleaned meticulously and immediately every time it was shot.  None of this ""I'll clean it tomorrow"" B.S.

This Crosman multi-pump air gun, which I purchased new,  is in great condition.  Used only occasionally during the first few years of ownership, and has been in storage ever since.  It does, however, apparently need a new air seal since pumping it does not build up enough air pressure to fire the pellet.

A fine quality Winchester Model 100 semi-auto CARBINE in .308 caliber.
 It has one 4 round removeable magazine and the sling/strap you see in the photo. The scope and rings DO NOT come with the rifle. The scope mounting rail will remain on the gun.

This is NOT the rifle version of the Model 100. It is the more expensive and much better balanced CARBINE version. It is a fine hunting gun that I used recently to drop a 335 lb Missouri Wild Hog in its tracks. You can't do better than that with a 308 ! I had a gunsmith install the new firing pin that was the subject of the factory recall of the Model 100's some years back. This gun is like new and ready for your hunt.

Cash Price is $700. Cash and Trades must come close to that.  No Shotguns considered. Burer pays $45 shipping costs, and provides copy of his dealers FFL with payment.  Email with questions, please.

These are the same guns as the Rock Island Armory, just with double diamond wood grips and a better trigger. This particular gun has had the barrel throat and feed ramp polished to a mirror finish and the extractor tuned up to eliminate any of the feeding issues you typically find with the Armscor “Officer” models.

I got this gun as a trade earlier this year, the gentleman I got it from claimed to have only put a few boxes through it, and I have personally fed this little guy close to 2000 rounds. The gun does have the “idiot scratch” from the slide release after my first time taking the gun down.

I’m asking $450 for the gun with 4 mags included (2 ACT-MAG 7rd, 1 ProMag 7rd, and 1 Springfield Armory 6rd).

These are Impossible to find anymore. The Polish only made about 25,000 of these awesome rifles. And they are all but gone. We were lucky enough to find a few. 

The Polish Tantal is one of our favorite AK's
It it the only AK to have a Tri-Burst selector. These still have the selector swith on the left side tht is integrated with the safety. This gives the gun the correct look and parts.

Dear ""Chicken Shit"",  Much to your chagrin, I have already sold my other Kel-Tec Sub2000 for $600 to somebody who lives near the Michigan border, and they were tickled pink to even find one.  Have you tried to buy a Sub2000 in any caliber from any gun store lately?  they're not even available. Oh...and the BS about the $250 rifle at Beech Grove Firearms...they took one in, priced it at $250, and it was sold the next day.  But ask them when they're getting in a new one from the factory, and they'll tell you they haven't seen one for months, and can't get one.  
I have owned 3 Kel-Tec PMR 30's.  Bought each one new for $425.  Sold each one used for the following prices: $625, $650, and $700.  Before you do anymore trash-talking with me, you should spend a little more time researching the facts.  Kel-Tec (ANYTHING) these days in the way of rifles, are very few and far between.  Give me your phone number, and I'll call you when I sell this Sub2000 40ACP, and I'll let you know what I got for it.  I'll guarantee you, I'll get at least $550.

He said he had been jerked around and had several ""no shows"" so he wanted me to call before I left. I called him, we spoke and he said he was leaving too. 2.5 hours later he still had not shown up and would not answer his phone. I have no idea why someone gets off making people drive for hours for no reason but if he reposts (I had several people mark his ad as a scam and it has disappeared) I would be very wary and make him drive all the way to you! Next time he posts he may not say he is from Michigan City so beware the phone number REDACTED. I promise you he is a dick."

My father had a set of these when we were kids. He had to sell one to help pay for our Christmas one year. This year I want to make his set complete again. I can't seem to figure out the exact manufacturer but I'll tell you what I can get off of his remaining one.

It's a black powder (obviously), revolver. The cylinder is engraved with Naval ships and stamped with only the words ""patent n"". The under side of the grip is stamped with a P and a R over top one another, and the letters FIE after it. It also says ""Italy"". The only other thing I know for sure is it's a .36 caliber. So I'm posting the pics of the one he has. I can find some online that are VERY similar, but the brass is not engrave and as you can see by the pics, my dads is engraved on the brass as well. Any  help is greatly appreciated. If you have one you would like to sell, PLEASE let me know. Thanks again!"

The Taurus PT 840 semi-automatic pistol is derived from their Taurus OSS pistol, which was designed for military use. The PT 840 includes an external hammer, which was added due to customer requests. This .40 caliber pistol has a 15 round magazine capacity. The PT 840 features a checkered polymer grip, an ambidexterous 3-position safety, and interchangeable backstraps in small, medium, and large. Its ""Strike Two"" capability resets the trigger for automatic double action restrike in the event of a misfire. When it fires, the pistol will automatically revert to single action.
