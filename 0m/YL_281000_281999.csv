I'm looking to sell a relatively new North American Arms .22LR with oversized grips and a custom ""Mad Hat"" in-pocket holster. This gun has been fired a grand total of maybe 50-75 times. It's been lovingly cared for. I'm selling it for two reasons: 1) I carry my .38 more frequently and 2) I have fallen in love with another NAA product and my wife is not too keen on two NAA 22's in the family. Makes no sense to me but I must abide by her wishes to continue to live under the same roof. I'd like to sell to a SC resident for the sheer ease of transfer and the fact that FFL fees & shipping wouldn't come into play. I have absolutely everything the revolver came with including my initial proof of purchase as well as original grips. I'd like to get $200 but I would entertain reasonable offers. Please e-mail me if interested. Thanks for looking!"

Also included:
Original US Wood Grips

Original arched mainspring housing

Gun is finished in a nice military parkerizing. Round count is around 500, and the finish shows wear from carrying - mostly just shiny edges as would be expected from a carry gun. No rust at all, and no wear that would detract from its value. I'd rate the function/mechanical condition a 10 out of 10 and the finish an 8.5 out of 10.

Will consider trades for an XD Tactical 45 ACP, other 45 ACPs like a Glock 36, HK, etc. Will also consider trades for a classic combat 357 such as a 3"" Model 19 or similar. Will also consider any trades on high-quality handguns or rifles."

I have 2 marlin model 50s. These are 22lr's open bolts. Open bolt semi autos are no longer produced. These rifles were produced around 1934, less then 5000 were produced. Each rifle comes with a magazine, this is very rare because a lot of these rifles were turned into full autos when it was legal, so people that own the rifles as NFA full autos will purchase the rifles then keep the magazines or just purchase the mags. One rifle is in perfect shape the other one was modified by the previous owner, the second rifle does not have all the parts. These rifles are semi auto and are c&R that means that they are cash and carry with proper id."

 The Star Model PD is a compact and lightweight semi-automatic pistol which was manufactured from 1975 to 1990 by the firearms manufacturing company Star Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A., located in the city of Eibar in the Basque region of Spain.[1]

The Model PD can be loaded with six .45 ACP pistol cartridges in the detachable internal magazine, plus one in the chamber, and was very popular with police and civilian users in the self-defense and backup gun role, especially in the United States.

The Star PD improved on its predecessor (Star Model PKM) by using a low-profile adjustable rear sight and by removing material from the slide and other small changes. These modifications, combined with its aluminum alloy construction, resulted in a slim, compact, lightweight and relatively powerful pistol, revolutionary for the time. As it also bore an external resemblance to the well-known M1911 pistol, the gun sold very well in the U.S. until it was replaced in 1990 by the Firestar M45."

It's nearly impossible to find the original gray SL8-1 in good condition, this firearm is no longer imported. $1600 obo, cash only.

Designed and engineered to deliver exceptional shooting performance, the SL8 is a favorite among European target shooters, due in large part to its modular construction and free-floating bull barrel. A short Picatinny rail mount is standard and allows accessory optics to be easily added. Made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process, the SL8-6 barrel ensures accuracy and long life. The ergonomic and clean lines of the HK SL8-1 are functional and modern, giving the SL8-1 the look and feel of a 21st century firearm."

Full custom S&W model 10-7.  This gun has been converted over to a double action only PPC gun.  Internals have been worked over for a very smooth and light trigger pull.  Barrel swapped out to a bull barrel.  Aristocrat adjustable sight rib.  Rear of frame stippled for added control.  Hammer spring changed out to a J-frame coil for lighter/smoother trigger.  All work performed by Travis Strahan of GA, most likely sometime in the 1980's.

18.5 bead sight barrel, +2 mag tube extension (I believe ATI), Knoxx Recoil Reducing buttstock, 6 Shot side Saddle on receiver, and I have the side saddle that goes on the Knoxx stock (I believe it's called the Power Pack or something).

The details:
I pounded out the magazine tube dimples myself. So far, haven't had an issue with them.

I had to cut about an inch or so off the back of the Knoxx forend so it would cycle properly. Without cutting it, the side saddle got in the way. I melted it with a torch and sanded a bit so it looks as close to factory as I could get it.

I don't have any of the original furniture. I'm not sure where or who I gave it to, but it's no longer in my possession.

BATTLEGRIP TMModel BGV-MK46 foregrip was designed, engineered and manufactured with one achievement in mind: to offer improved functionality in a foregrip that can withstand the toughest combat weapon applications.

From the very start, our grip was developed for use on the M249 / MK-46 family of weapon systems. This heavy, belt-fed SAW is called upon to operate in hostile environments, often with CQB tactics that punish rail mounted foregrips. We knew if our product could survive this challenge, it would also be ideal mounted on lighter weapon families such as the M16 / M4.

Absolutely like new with a ton of extras. A very good copy of Glock technology but tiny in size. Very high quality fit, finish, and machining. NOT like a Keltec. This particular model is the one with actual 3 dot sights, not the just released cheaper one with the slide machined with little nubs for sights like a Ruger LCP. I have fired exactly 38 rounds through it and it has been flawless (10 Speer, 28 Winchester FMJ). Comes with the list of accessories below.
This was my wifes gun that sat in the safe and was never carried. Holster shows minor cosmetic wear on edges, I used this for a few months with my personal DB380 that sold a few weeks ago (not nearly as nice as this one). I am the original owner.

22 rounds of Winchester FMJ- $5

Gunsmithing

Let EFI, LLC's experienced gunsmith keep your firearms in top working order! Our specialties include Sig Sauer Pistols, AR15/M16 Series, UZI, 1911 Pistols, Remington Rifles, and HK 90-Series. Otherwise, we offer accurizing, customization, repair, and refinishing services for most types of Title I and Title II firearms.


Engraving

Whether you need a quick turn-around for engraving your receiver for a short-barreled rifle, or you would like a custom graphic on your gun, EFI, LLC can meet that need. Price will vary based on number of characters or complexity of graphic.


Parkerizing

EFI, LLC will take your firearm, disassemble it, inspect all parts for wear and advise you if any should be replaced to keep your firearm in good working order. We will then remove the current finish and any contaminants, and prepare the surface using a grit blast method that allows for a stronger finish to be applied. After the parkerization process is complete, we will again inspect, clean, lubricate, and reassemble your firearm. Both zinc and manganese parkerizing are available.


Consignments

If you would like to sell a gun then consign it with us! Our consignment fees are some of the lowest in the business - just check out our consignment agreement.


Custom Rifle Builds

EFI, LLC designed the bolt-action Precision Strike rifle system and the semi-auto Rapid Strike rifle system for professional shooters. We guarantee at least half minute of angle accuracy* from every one that we deliver. Options include custom barrel lengths and a variety of caliber choices. The rifles are available with an airline-approved hard case, scope, bipod, cleaning system, tools, and a sound suppressor (where local laws permit).

Firearm photographer Oleg Volk recently profiled one of our Precision Strike rifles in .338 LM on his blog. You can see what he has to say about it at http://olegvolk.livejournal.com/922647.html and http://olegvolk.livejournal.com/924824.html.

*Accuracy guarantee for a trained shooter using quality ammunition from a fixed position.


Transfers

Title I Firearms: $5

Title II Firearms: $25

No, those aren't typo's. We really do charge just $5 per Title I transfer.

I've also put on a compensator and an extra set of Hogue grips. The gun shoots like a dream and the compensator really does a lot for reducing recoil.

964,http://www.armslist.com/posts/281964,For Sale:  AR Upper,"Friendswood, Houston, Texas","$ 1,200","Listed On: Friday, January 20, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my brother's AR upper.  This was used on 2 different tours of Baghdad, and has about 1000 rounds through it.  He bought the upper from PK Firearms prior to the first deployment, and added in accessories afterwards.  From there, he just checked the M4 lower out of the armory, and used this upper for the duration of both tours.  I'll try to be as thorough as possible for the description, please email me with any questions.

It has the Daniel Defense rail assembly, and is very similar to the 10.225"" uppers found on the PK Firearms website.  The charging handle is slightly over sized for easier racking of the bolt carrier group.  This barrel is free floating, and has a standard A2 flash suppressor, rather than the ones pictured on their webpage: http://www.pkfirearms.com/Daniel_Defense_Custom_Uppers/156/c

He mounted a Surefire flashlight in a 1"" Weaver mount to the front.  This is a Surefire 660 Classic Model.  It has the pressure-mount input, and it has a tape switch for remote-control.

He is running an Aimpoint Comp M2 w/ 2MOA dot and 2x magnifier.  The optics are very clear, and the knobs all work flawlessly.  As you can see, the front cover is still there, however Baghdad stole the rear cover.  Both could probably use a replacement anyways, and I just found them for around $40 online:  http://www.militarywarfighter.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=Aimpoint-12223-12224&gdftrk=gdfV21636_a_7c75_a_7c4662_a_7cAimpoint_d_12223_d_12224.  

The mount for the Aimpoint is an Aimpoint QRP, same as this one here:  http://store.a51tactical.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=2085&cPath=250#googlebase

The standard military ""Grip Pod"" Bipod fore-grip is still mounted to the front, these are about as rugged and durable as it gets.  Brownell's has them for $150, but I think that is a little high, so let's call it a $75 value.  I believe this one is a GPS2, as it has steel reinforcements in the legs.  I have one on my personal AR-15 Upper, and I doubt you will find a better one out there:  http://www.grippod.com/

There is a sling adapter on the left side, probably some sort of military issue, no idea there...  

Also, there is a rear sight assembly.  One of the viewers on here sent me a message saying it was a military issue rear sight.

This gun is in great shape, all things considered.  
So, there ya go...  Please get patriotic and open up your wallets.  My brother has retired after 22 years of active duty in the Army, and the VA is still processing his paperwork.  In the meantime, while processing the paperwork, the VA/Army pays him nothing.  

Not interested in parting it out.  First $1200 for the upper takes it.  Emails will be responded to on first-come, first-serve basis.
