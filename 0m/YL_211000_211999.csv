I have a Lever Action Browning BL 22 which fires S-L-LR topped with LEUPOLD RINGS AND BASES and a 4x-32mm Simmons white tail hunter scope. I personally own a lever henry and they're nothing alike, the browning uses real high gloss beautiful wood, super short quick action lever throw (your hand doesnt even leave the rear stock to operate, keep your eye threw the scope on target) and is alot lighter and easier to carry threw the woods. Barrel,tube and action are in great shape, only draw is 2 small scuffs which are white because they are in the finish ( could be fixed with the right know how) caused by son who dropped it taking it out of the case.

The gun is in amazing shape and will shoot dead-on every time you use it. You can shoot all day long and your grouping won't be any larger than a quarter, if you know how to shoot. Comes with an option of two different scopes, it would be your preference or for a little extra you can have both.

I have here an UNFIRED, first production run, pre-ban TEC-9. This includes ALL of the original manufacturer accessories that were offered AND THREE 30 round mags and 1 20 ROUND MAG 
Because this is the early 1986 version before the ban it has all of the great features that the junky, neutered later models lacked such as the threaded barrel and included detachable barrel extension/F.suppressor/guard and the detachable compensator. 

Let me reiterate - this gun is UNFIRED. It is beautiful and immaculate. It includes all of the accessories included ONLY with the pre-ban model.

This is a one of a kind deal - I challenge anyone to find an unfired pre-ban TEC-9 of this quality for as low a price as this, let alone one with the original accessories eliminated after the ban.

INCLUDED ACCESSORIES: (all manufacturer original parts)

Description: ""The Earl"" is a five-shot, single action, 1860's- styled mini- revolver chambered in 22 magnum. Named after the NAA gunsmith who originally developed the product, with it's faux loading lever (which secures the cylinder pin), ""The Earl"" resembles a 150 year old percussion revolver then common in the Old West. With it's heavy octagonal barrel, top strap channel and bead front sight, ""The Earl"" could become your favorite plinker (pray for the snake, rodent, or tin can that dares cross your path!).

Only shot two boxes of ammo from bench to site rifle in.  
If you're like me, you've heard of the classic Ruger M77 Hawkey, but probably not the new hot 6.5 Creedmoor cartridge by Hornaday. When loaded with heavier bullets, cartridges such as the 6.5x55 and 6.5-284 are capable of greater muzzle velocity due to their longer cases and larger powder capacity. 
6.5 mm (.264"") bullets, in general, are known for their relatively high ballistic coefficients, and have seen success in rifle competition. 

The 6.5 Creedmoor is capable of duplicating the trajectory of the .300 Winchester Magnum while generating significantly lower recoil.  Creedmoor has recently developed an outstanding hunting bullet for the 6.5 (see links bellow for more info)  

This Ruger M77 Hawkeye 6.5 Creedmoor is the classically styled, bolt-action rifle with barrel and receiver in Hawkeye Satin Blued finish, and a slim, rounded profile American Walnut stock with satin finish and extensive cut-checkered grip and wrap-around checkered forend.

The rifle is sited in with a Nikon ProStaff 3-9x50 Riflescope.  The Ruger Mark II Rifle is an accurate, reliable, and easy to shoot rifle. It is built to deliver at the target range, and doubles as a good hunting rifle for anything up to whitetail.  Excellent condition.  Unbelievable accuracy!  (again, see links below) 

Thanks for looking
