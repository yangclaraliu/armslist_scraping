If you like 1911's, Colts and 45 acp .... this may very well be the firearm for you.

You will need to show me proof that you are a Ohio Resident as I will you. By responding to this Post you are confirming you are at least 21 years old and can legally own a handgun.

I will NOT respond to any ridiculous offers (i.e. ""I have a Glock I will trade"" or ""how about a S&W revolver and $200""). Feel free to make an offer. Please do your own homework and make it a fair (to us both) offer. I am Not pressed for time and do Not need the cash so I will continue to list the 1911.

Factory Box
This weapon is designed to be usable at all ranges of combat, against all infantry targets.
 To be most successful when using this weapon, you must follow these simple tips:

-For fighting targets at long ranges, it is recommended that you raise your velocity to
 200 or higher. 250 velocity is the maximum velocity you would want to use, as any higher
 will have very unreliable collision registry.

-For fast moving/jumping targets use Stages 3-4 with an active lead. The higher stages
 offer more spread, and put very high amounts of ammunition downrange instantly.

-For slow moving/stationary targets use Stages 1-2. These stages offer a minor spread
 and will allow you to conserve your ammunition.

-For fighting in extreme lag, use the CTRL Stage. This stage disables all 4 rezzer scripts
 and cuts the weapon's lag down to very low levels.

-For fighting armored targets, use Stages 2-3 while sweeping constant fire across a large
 portion of the target. This allows you to send very large amounts of ammunition at the
 target without overloading the collision detection system in the armor, making most if
 not all of your shots count towards the destruction of the target.

-Using quick, controlled bursts will allow you to conserve ammuntition while decreasing
 physics lag. This is a recommended tactic, and it will save you from having to reload as
 often.

-Setting velocity over 230 is not recommended, as it will allow bullets to go through
 objects and avatars alike without registering collisions"

This particular rifle was built with USPSA or other 2/3 gun competition shooting in mind. It has an extra long free floated hand guard that allows the shooter to grasp very close to the muzzle for very secure fast shooting. 

This build would also look awesome and function great with a suppressor, I can send a photo for an idea of or how it would look. 

Weapon Specs are: 

•	Spikes Tactical lower
•	Ergo grip / (1) FREE Cerakote painted Colt 20rd mag in graphite black 
•      Crisp breaking mil-spec trigger 
•	5.56mm 1/9 twist barrel 
•	16” Heavy profile barrel for very accurate shooting 
•	Extra long Free floated hand guard
•	Rainer Arms Xtreme Tactical Compensator XTC.

The optic shown is a NEW Vortex SPARC red dot and complements this weapon very nicely. In my opinion for the money its one of the best optics made, for $200.00 I will leave it on the carbine. Some features of the optic are:

•	One-Piece Tube 
•	Fully Multi Coated Lenses 
•	Waterproof and Fog proof
•	Unlimited Eye Relief
•	Adjustable Dot intensity with a Night Vision mode 
•	Screw-in 2xMagnifier for long distance shooting or sighting the rifle in 

I am asking $950. for complete free floated rifle (NO OPTIC!), $1150.00 for complete rifle with NEW Vortex's optic.   

This is a very good deal for a complete free floated rifle, just crunch the numbers and you see that rifles with similar specs could retail for as much as double plus sales tax or shipping if purchased from a store or dealer.

For the right offer I will sell just the upper or lower, in other words I am very flexible about what I can do with this carbine.  

I would also consider a trade for a Saiga 12 gauge, please provide photos of what you have.

This is a personal sale so there is no FFL transfer or sales tax. Within reason I will meet with you to view this carbine, I can provide more photos to your email upon request, please serious inquires only. 

Be advised, if you contact me with a “lowball” offer I will not dignify it with a response, no refunds, no returns, or no exchanges.

I WILL ONLY ACCEPT CASH AS PAYMENT FOR LOCAL WICHITA SALE.

Factory Box
This weapon is designed to be usable at all ranges of combat, against all infantry targets.
 To be most successful when using this weapon, you must follow these simple tips:

-For fighting targets at long ranges, it is recommended that you raise your velocity to
 200 or higher. 250 velocity is the maximum velocity you would want to use, as any higher
 will have very unreliable collision registry.

-For fast moving/jumping targets use Stages 3-4 with an active lead. The higher stages
 offer more spread, and put very high amounts of ammunition downrange instantly.

-For slow moving/stationary targets use Stages 1-2. These stages offer a minor spread
 and will allow you to conserve your ammunition.

-For fighting in extreme lag, use the CTRL Stage. This stage disables all 4 rezzer scripts
 and cuts the weapon's lag down to very low levels.

-For fighting armored targets, use Stages 2-3 while sweeping constant fire across a large
 portion of the target. This allows you to send very large amounts of ammunition at the
 target without overloading the collision detection system in the armor, making most if
 not all of your shots count towards the destruction of the target.

-Using quick, controlled bursts will allow you to conserve ammuntition while decreasing
 physics lag. This is a recommended tactic, and it will save you from having to reload as
 often.

-Setting velocity over 230 is not recommended, as it will allow bullets to go through
 objects and avatars alike without registering collisions"

These will be available in a few weeks but the 100% lake city will be closer to .12-.14 per piece as it requires more work and the brass costs more. Shipping is not included but flat rate is pretty reasonable. I trim the brass to 1.355 which is closer to the lower tolerance so your brass should last longer between trimmings. This brass is trimmed, swagged if necessary and tumbled so its ready to load when you get it. I would consider processing your brass for 60$ per k plus shipping, swagging would be extra.

I make typical rifle sling with quick detach swivels and 

Two/single point tactical slings with hk style hooks.

These slings are for the rough and rugged individuals who demand the most from their equipment. Like me and the folks I run with.

 I designed these slings to incorporate:

 -60+' of real 550 paracord
 -over 25' 8lb. mono fishing line (inside off weave #1)
 -3 fishing hooks \
 -1 sewing needle  sewn inside patch on webbing
 -5' sewing thread/
 -7"" stainless survival knife 
 -flint/ magnesium bar
 -compass (that works)

 These slings include what I consider to be essentials in a wilderness survival application. A fire building method, shelter building tools, a means to catch and/or hunt food, a sturdy knife, navigation tool, sewing kit, and even if the slings paracord is dismantled entirely, a sling can be made using the 1"" webbing and sewing kit included.

 Slings are typically adjustable from 30""-40"" (can be custom made to your desire)

 Three colors to choose from (for now) Woodland camo & black; black & black; pink & black.

 Prices range form $30 for just paracord sling and $45 for survival sling. Will accept paypal. Shipping for $5. More pics upon request. 

Thanks for looking and God Bless America"

I have taken this rifle on trips to 400 - 600yd
shooting distances pinging reactive 10"" steel
targets and it never fails to make me smile after
every pull of the trigger.

I commonly achieve sub-MOA results with
this 26"" Stainless Bull barrel without even
trying.  Rapid fire 200yrd shooting yields a
cluster of 10 bullet holes so close that they all
could fit within the size of a golf ball... thanks
in part to a custom made muzzle brake that
literally eliminates all recoil keeping my eye
on the target.

Never a jam, misfire or any other issues.  Solid
built, accurate and ready for action.  When it
comes to AR's, this is how I like it done.

The Mosin has been thouroughly de-cosmolined (and I mean thouroughly, stock included).  The bolt has also been polished up and all friction points smoothed to a glass finish.  Have also given it the sticky bolt cure as I do all my new Mosins.  The bore is extremely bright and in excellent shape, with strong rifling.  Has a period correct stock that has been carefully refinished to maintain any inspection cartouches.  Does not include a sling or bayonet, but does have cleaning rod.  ALL numbers match.

And, it does have the curious ""triangle 25"" stamp on the receiver directly above the serial number.  All stamps are clear including the Soviet crest.


Will send pictures by email if requested.  Serious inquiries only please.

Looking for a good used semi auto .22LR such as a 10/22, a 597, or possibly a model 60.  The less bubba'd the better.  Will also take cash offers as well.

I have an enormous amount of 7.62x54R for the Mosin, so can include ammo or cash, or ammo+cash for the right weapon.  

Will meet anywhere within a 30 mile radius for FTF transactions.  Any questions, let me know.  I can tell you anything you may need to know about the Mosin.

Thanks."

I would like $1,000 for it, it's ready to go. I'll ship to your door if in state obviously (South FL), or come pick it up! Will ship to FFL if out of state. The Eotech is not included.

Please remember something... don't believe all the BS people put up here with 'grandfathered LE only' rifles. they are all the same crap. the reason those have that is because they were built between '94 and '04 making them rather old (some still print the markings for tacticoolness). That's all there is to them. It's the same rifle and def not 'military'. this rifle is a 2009 build and very clean.

I'm an active military member (Infantry) and I take care of my rifles, especially this one since it's a clone of my M4. it has been 'GI' cleaned everytime after I shot it. runs flawlessly.


THE EOTECH YOU SEE IS NOT INCLUDED (I don't want to sell it, so if you want it so bad, you will pay extra premium). If you want that, add 500 to the asking price making it $1600 (FIRM)

I will not part the rifle! Everything stays on it except the sling&adapter and the Eotech which I'll be taking off!

If you want a no BS rifle that works and ready to hit the range, this is your rifle."

Now all AR owners can enjoy the features of the SR-556 platform, including the patent pending two-stage piston driven operating system that provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the action and vents combustion residue out of the bottom of the gas block. The four-position adjustable gas regulator allows the operator to tune the rifle to specific ammunition and rifle conditions, minimizing recoil and maximizing reliability and long-term endurance. Reliability is further enhanced by a one-piece bolt carrier with an integral transfer key. Designed for long-lasting accuracy, the chrome lined barrels are cold hammer-forged from Mil-Spec 41V45 Chrome-Moly-Vanadium steel. The carbine upper features a heavy contour, fluted barrel that is 1-3/4"" shorter and a half-pound lighter than the barrel on the standard SR-556. The 1:9 twist rate, 16.1"" barrel on the carbine features an integrally machined flash suppressor, which minimizes the overall length of the barrel while complying with ATF regulations for civilian and commercial sales. This carbine version maintains the mid-length gas system and heavy (.850"") barrel contour under the handguard, but the barrel is fluted for weight reduction and to promote barrel cooling. This upper is equipped with folding, back-up iron sights. These rugged, high-quality sights co-witness with Mil-Spec optics, and are easily removed or replaced. The sights can be folded down with the push of a button, or quickly flipped up with your thumbs. The windage adjustable rear sight includes an instantly converted short and long-range aperture, and the protected front sight is elevation adjustable. The SR-556 carbine uppers chambered in 5.56mm NATO are shipped with three, thirty-round Magpul PMAG™ magazines. These lightweight magazines feature a storage/dust cover, a stainless steel spring, and a self-lubricating, anti-tilt follower.

READ THE REVIEWS, THIS IS THE HIGHEST QUALITY BAG OUT THERE.

If you are headed to the range, you'll want to have our Range Ready bag at your side. This is the ultimate in design for carrying multiple pistols to the range with all the necessary accessories and tools. We really put our heads together to give you the ultimate in a range bag. Our Range Ready bag was designed with input from range instructors, special operations officers, patrol officers and SWAT to give you what you need when you head out for a day on the range. From the removable ammo tote with its brass collection bag, to the extra large side pocket with elastic magazine holders and a fold down cleaning station, this range bag can handle any type of range activity. There is plenty of room for hearing protection, ammo, magazines, pistols, cleaning supplies and tools. We've even included an external water bottle holder.

Durability is the name of the game with this bag. We've beefed this baby up to withstand the rigors of fully loaded range duty. We use 600-denier polyester throughout to give you a long lasting bag that can handle the weight. The carrying handles and shoulder strap are heavy duty nylon and won't fail under a heavy load. We've added plastic feet to the bottom to keep the nylon from wearing and padded all of the pockets for added protection of your valuable firearms and accessories. We use only quality YKK® zippers in our Range Ready bag and we've triple stitched our handles to bear the weight of the ammo, pistols and all associated gear. We use only heavy duty D rings for our shoulder strap clips.

The quality and versatility of the Range Ready bag make this piece of equipment an exceptional value. It is the only bag you'll need for traveling to the range with your pistols. Leave it to 5.11 to bring quality, functionality and value to our gear bag line.
