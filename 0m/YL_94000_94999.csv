This Winchester Model 12, is a 12 gauge with a 28” modified choke barrel and a 2 3/4” chamber and also it includes a Full choke 2 3/4""-- 28"" barrel as well. Both barrels are ribbed. This gun has seen very little use and is in excellent condition. It retains excellent blueing and the bore is mirror bright. The wood shows a few scratches. The gun’s serial number, 1081777, which is stamped on the receiver and both of the barrels, indicating that it was manufactured in 1947. These guns go from $800 poor condition to $1600 bucks for excellent and that price is with 1 barrel. This gun has 2 barrels with the original barrel case. This is a rare opportunity to buy a shotgun like this for a wholesale price. This gun is worth way more than 800 bucks and I will trade it for something more modern.

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals. tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble.

It serves as a brass catcher since the expelled shells are ejected downward through the magazine well. This is because the AR five seven 50 round magazine is located on top of the rifle. The lower has the capability of using typical AR-15 upper which will allow you to shoot .223 and 6.8 NATO rounds. You could even purchase other uppers to shoot 9mm and 22 caliber bullets. In all, you have the ability to shoot 5 calibers if you really wanted to. In fact, the Spikes Tactical lower in inscribed ""Multi"" for caliber instead of the typical .223. However, the firearms is equipped with the 5.7 ammo buffer. If you choose to shoot 223/5.6 ammo and switch out uppers, you must change out the included Spikes Tactical buffer.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Back Up Iron Sights  (BUIS)
With Locking Mechanical Detents

Both the front and rear sights were mounted on an AR10 build but taken off Before it was ever taken out to the range. (I guess they didn’t like the “look” of BUIS on their custom AR10)
These are New and Never used

GGG-1393T Spring Actuated Flip Up Front Sight With Trijicon Tritium Front Sight Post

 Newly Redesigned GG&G Spring Actuated Flip Up Front Sight For Tactical Forearms is the latest evolution of this terrific accessory.  Although specifically designed to provide the correct sight height when mounted on a tactical forearm, this sight can also be installed on gas blocks that are at the same height as the upper receiver.
 With just a push of a button the front sight can quickly be deployed on target. The sight not only springs into an on target position with just the push of the actuator button, but it also locks solidly into the upright on target position. Another push of the button and the lock is released allowing you to set the sight into the locked down position. The spring sight cannot be folded down without depressing the actuator button located on the left side of the sight base. This totally eliminates the possibility of accidentally lowering the sight during a tactical situation. With the actuator button located on the left side it can be easily operated with the off hand, leaving the fire control hand in the proper position.
 This model is specifically manufactured to the proper sight height for mounting on a tactical forearm or can be installed on gas blocks that are at the same height as the upper receiver. Not only is it set for use on the AR15, but will co-witness when mounted to the tactical forearm of an AR-10. The sight stem of this version folds rearward. The dovetail front is easily installed.
 To insure flexibility, we use standard military sight components in this combat ready sight. All models of the GG&G Spring Actuated Flip Up Front Sight are manufactured from 6061 T-6 aluminum and are bead blasted and hard coat anodized to provide a non-reflective, corrosion resistant matte black finish meeting mil-spec requirements. 

Trijicon Tritium Front Sight Post for accuracy in low light operations. The Trijicon tritium front sight option is the perfect accessory for police and tactical users who may be moving in and out of darkness in real time.

GGG-1005-SAT A2 Spring Actuated BUIS With Tritium Aperture

 Unique and proprietary design of the spring site mechanism allows the actuator spring and mechanical components to be captivated and therefore not be open to the environmental elements. The flip up sight not only springs into an on target position with just the push of the actuator button, but it also locks solidly into the upright on target position. Another push of the button and the lock is released allowing you to set the spring sight into the locked down position. The flip rear sight cannot be folded down without depressing the actuator button located on the left side of the sight base. This totally eliminates the possibility of accidentally lowering the A2 flip sight. Equipped with the GG&G tactile grip windage knob, adjustments are easy and precise. 
 The GG&G Spring Actuated BUIS provides the operator with an easy-to-install push button operated AR flip up sight. The Spring Actuated A2 BUIS can be used as a stand-alone sight or in conjunction with rails. It can also be used as a co-witness iron sight with most red dot sighting systems. Weighing in at just over 2.4 ounces. The flip up rear sight has full windage adjustment with standard military windage knob and windage screw. It is low profile so that when in the down position, it will clear most optics. 
 The mount body and sight stem are manufactured from solid billet 6061 T6 aluminum alloy and Type III hard coat anodized in a non-reflective black mil-spec finish to provide combat durability. All steel components are black manganese phosphated per mil-spec. 

 Trijicon Tritium inserts installed on the large aperture. The small aperture was “cut” down, by a gunsmith, to afford extra clearance for the optics on the AR10 it was mounted on. Most cases do not require this to be trimmed down but in this specific instance it did. So with it done already by a professional it should work for most all configurations.

     Also, I have a Ruger Vaquero chambered in 45 colt. Very bright rifling, the case hardening has been worn out a bit, with natural cylindar scratches from use. I have put a handful of rounds through each and they perform remarkably. This one has 390.00$ on it.

NOTE! Please understand, all legal rules apply. Before I sell to anyone, a VALID Ohio I.D. is required. Age 18 for the rifle and 21 for the revolver. Thank You"

These routinely sell in the $750 range used (check gunbroker for Kimber Hunter).

These are commonly seen in rimfire competition in the 'hunter' class.  It is built just like a little mauser.  Trigger pull is amazing, and adjustable.  I don't have the original box, but have the manual.  I'll try to find the little card that proves it shoots (All kimbers must be able to hold .4"" at 50 yards before leaving factory, with Eley Tenex, and they show the group on a card)... google it and see.

I'm selling this at such a discount because the stock is not perfect... if you look at the picture where my finger is pointing, the checkering has some nicked peaks from it falling down in the safe.  Still, this is very minor.

Search the internet, and you'll realize this is an amazing deal.  A truly ""fine"" firearm.

I bought this gun in the early '90's and still have it's original box. No holster and no ammo to go with the gun, sorry. It has I would guess around 250-300 rounds through it, some handloads, most factory. The gun is in like new condition, IMO.

When I bought it, I had the action and trigger worked on by a S&W-only gunsmith named Bob Lloyd. The double action is very smooth and the single action is crisp and clean with about a 2 lb let off.

I live in North Alabama and prefer a face-to-face trade, but it's not mandatory. Let me know what you have.

Holds 9 rounds of 2.75"" or 8 rounds of 3"" shells. This is the model issued to US army base and prison guards, and is equipped with a bayonet lug that accepts modern M-16 types. Ghost ring sights with nice, hi-viz orange front post capable of serious slug work beyond 50 yards.

I have added a really comfortable Hogue rubber forend, as well as the awesome Knoxx Spec Ops stock, which allows adjustable length of pull, and greatly reduces felt recoil. See it in action, or look it up yourself (it's the best stock you could put on this gun, and msrp is over $130);

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTOgVUf5NbI

The Knoxx also has a Hogue finger-groove grip sleeve on the pistol grip, which gives you a really solid purchase on this thing, and a six round shell carrier is properly mounted on the receiver. No box or papers, but will include a padded hard-case for $20. No trades at this time as I am funding another gun. Feel free to make your best offer. I live and work in Nashville, but will drive up to 45 minutes for deal."

I paid $1,199 + tax for it. I would still consider the gun New but obviously it is used. 
The Benelli M2 is the workhorse of the semi-auto Benelli shotguns, with the speed of a thoroughbred. Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the M2 12-gauge shotguns are built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven bolt mechanism. The Inertia Driven system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12 gauge cartridge, from 2-3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. 

Benelli engineers have also adapted the recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48% and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the shooter back on target up to 69% faster than with any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you will ever shoot.

811,http://www.armslist.com/posts/94811,For Sale/Trade:  Pair of 1911 style 9mm pistols -- PICS ADDED,"Denver, Denver, Colorado",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, February 5, 2011",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I have a pair of steel framed, Commander sized 1911 style 9mms I'd like to sell as a set. These are both Star BM pistols, SA, full hammer spur, no grip safety. These are both narrower than a Commander at about 7/8 thickness. They are also more reliable than the 9mm Colt Commanders.

Both pistols are used with an unknown round count. I'm guessing that one has had over 500 rounds through it and the other has had less than 100. Feedramps and chambers have been polished and these feed all sorts of hollowpoints reliably. Recoil springs are extra strong for hot loads, so weak target ammo like Remington and S&B may not have enough pop to cycle properly. Both run very well on Fiocchi and +P defensive ammo.

One pistol is parkerized the other is blued. The parkerized one has a stainless bushing and checkered walnut grips. The blued one has custom Bocote wood grips. I have a spare set of custom grips in white Holly.

Replacement magazines for the BM typically run about $35 - $40 each when you can find them. I have 7 magazines. 6 of the magazines are 8 rounders that run flawlessly. The 7th has a very strong spring and I can only get 7 rounds in it, but it does work. I also have the original boxes for each pistol.

The Star BM was imported from Spain during the early 1980s by CAI and Interarms, and after the import ban the supply dried up quickly and prices doubled (as with the Makarovs). Both of these are CAI imports. The Star BM is highly sought after due to its reliability and similarity to the 1911 platform.

There are only a couple caveats with the BM pistol. First and foremost, they should never be dry-fired with an empty chamber. Always use a snap cap to prevent damage to the firing pin. I will provide one snap cap for each pistol. Second, although this is a 1911 style pistol and allegedly the design of the safety makes it ""safer"" to carry cocked & locked than a Colt, I would advise against doing so because these pistols do not have a grip safety. The way most folks I know have carried them was hammer lowered to the safety notch -- this requires cocking the hammer prior to the first shot but also makes it drop safe. Of course, if you want to go cocked & locked instead that's up to you.

Both pistols, 7 mags, original boxes, and I can even throw in a couple boxes of Fiocchi (100 rds). I have a Galco LH IWB holster I could add for an extra 20. The Star BM will fit perfectly in nearly any 1911 style holster.  I do not want to sell separately so I've priced these low. FTF in or near Denver -- will not ship.

I am asking $500 for BOTH pistols. As these have typically been selling in the 325-350 range AND both have been polished to run reliably with hollowpoints this is a great deal. CASH price is firm.

I am picky about trades. Only trade I have a strong interest in would be a Ruger LCR. I have some interest in alloy framed .38s with shrouded or shaved hammers -- would even consider a new Charter Arms plus cash. Only automatics I have interest in are the S&W 3913/3914 series, although I might consider a Kel-Tec PF-9 or Ruger LCP plus cash. Always interested in good quality 9mm, 38, or 8mm Mauser ammo. Those are the ONLY trades I'm interested in at this time. I'll try to get pics up tomorrow.
