Dear Sen. M. Udall,

Thank you for your response. It is nice of you to write. But here is my rebuttal to the gun issue and I would appreciate it if this would be shared with all of your cohorts in the District of Columbia. 

Senator I do not know if you are aware of this but, when the second amendment was written, the “Designed for the battlefield” gun of the day was smoothbore flintlock musket, of a large caliber, with a .62 to .75 inch bore and virtually every American owned one. The two variants were the Brown Bess (British) and the Charleyville, a French musket used by the Americans. The government had muskets and so did the people. 

The musket used undersized tin (lead of the day) and they had to be reloaded after every shot. 

The musket of the 21st century happens to be the M16A1 carbine. So WE THE PEOPLE, HAVE, a natural UNALIENABLE right, not a privileged to keep them.

Where do you think America would be if the British would have had M16A1 carbines with 30 round magazines and our forefathers were left to fight with flintlock single shot muskets? You would be under a British occupation right now. 

Just as you and your cohorts are sewing to the American people, the British Government were attempting to interpose fraudulent British law onto the people who had no desire in partaking in the British system. People just wanted to govern themselves and be left alone. 

Guns, military or a civilian play an important role in any free society. You and your party’s gun grabbing efforts have made it so evident to the American people that you are partaking into a collective agenda knowingly or unknowingly.  The mere fact that you will go after gun owners vs. criminals who commit these mass shootings, who are on psychotropic drugs says enough. Yet the drug companies continue to hustle there garbage to every American family, maybe you’re your own. 

You will not even take a staunch stance on gang violence that has struck poverty stricken areas in the US. Most of those crimes involve guns too. You and your cohorts continually expose yourselves and your congruity to an agenda to the extent that it has become so evident to We The People. Yet your arrogance and egotism continually abnegate the facts pertaining to gun violence put out by our own FBI. 

What if our military was sent off to fight the coming war with the Muslim world and we were invaded by Russia or China?  Senator, do you find it odd that RED China is calling for the confiscation of all our firearms?  Sorry for my political incorrectness but China is a communist country, hence the term “Red China”. 

Did you know that before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japanese naval General Isoroku Yamamoto was quoted, saying the following; 

""You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass."" Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy

That is fact, the Japanese Empire was planning to come in and conquer the entire CONUS. But was deterred because of one general that knew, behind every blade of grass, molecule of air, nook and cranny, Japan would find an American armed with a firearm, whether it be a full automatic Thompson, civilian, police pistol or military weapon; Gen. Yamamoto was sure that WE THE PEOPLE would give the Japanese military an absolute blood bath. 

So the fact that you are even alive to this very day and hold the office and titles you have acquired is directly contributed to two facts.  #1 WE THE PEOPLE let you and #2 the “battlefield type rifles” you are now today at war with, owned by us peasants actually deterred one of the most ruthless military’s on the face of the planet from invading this country.   

Whether the weapons are designed for the battlefield or not senator, it does not matter. Besides didn’t you and the rest of your criminal cohorts vote for the NDAA 2012 making the entire planet including the United States a battlefield? 

Wouldn’t it be appropriate for you to allow us to own firearms in the battlefield you have created? Do you see yourself above your wage payers?   Don’t you think we need weapons to protect ourselves in the utopian “battlefield” you and other cohorts have created in this country?

Senator, do you know what communist and fascist regimes do after the confiscation of firearms? They Kill, and Kill, and kill and when they get tired of killing innocent people, they kill some more. Innocent people in mass genocides die because they had no way to protect themselves from a tyrannical group of individuals posing as a legitimate government.   

I see you visited Afghanistan. Yet you were surrounded by the same type of firearms that you and your party are at war with now. Did you feel safe? See I too have been deployed multiple times, sometimes disarmed by my own government because they didn’t FEEL the need that we should carry M4’s with us. But regardless of where you or I went in the AOR, you are assigned a crack team of body guards carrying the same weapons you want to ban.  

I challenge you to go with no guns, or maybe a 5 round magazine. What’s that? Oh no response to your and your party’s hypocrisy. That’s what I thought. 

What do you plan to tell the men and women of The Watchmen of America and US Border Guard who volunteer to interdict drugs and stop illegal immigration on the border? They are just civilians, not government, not law enforcement just the people who have somehow, in your mind, stopped ruling over you. What do you plan to tell them when your party takes away their right to repel invasions of the United States? 

They are doing what the federal and state levels are failing to do. Your party now wants to make them a criminal because they have assault type SEMI AUTOMATIC rifles to defend this nation and there precious lives. Yet to complement their bravery and service the federal government gives the same drug cartels they fight, FULLY AUTOMATIC machine guns and explosives. Your own government officials died in the line of duty as well because of this anti-gun agenda. Yet no one goes to jail, no investigation, no nothing. 

What are you going to tell them UDALL? SENATORS, CONGRESSMEN, BARACK OBAMANATION? ANSWER THAT QUESTION………………. HMMMM Silence. 

Are you going to tell them that you don’t give two shits about supporting and defending the Document YOU JUST SWORE AN OATH TO A FRECKING WEEK AGO.  That would be the most honest thing I have heard from a politician in a long time. 

I have never seen more narcissism and lies culminate in one place and in such profusion. What is wrong with you people? Have you no honor? Have you no integrity? Have you no honesty? What about a soul? Do you even have one? None of you have a clue of what it means to serve with the above set of values. All that seems to show are three.

1.	GET RE-ELECTED
2.	COVER UP MY COORUPT ACTS, IF IN DOUBT LIE
3.	GET RE-ELECTED

I served this nation for seven years. You have dishonored my service and the service of other veterans to this nation. You have dishonored the American people. You people make me want to puke. 

I declare to you this day (9th) of January, 2013 that I will find the time and dedicate my life to destroying, yes destroying your political career. I will see to it that you NEVER get re-elected to any public office on the face of the planet if you dare touch any issue pertaining to or leading to the decline of gun rights of any American Citizen or State National. 

Get your heads out of your asses. 

Very Respectfully,

Biden said today that all they can do with executive order is make changes to the back ground system,  ANY BAN, gun or magazine, MUST GO THROUGH CONGRESS.  244 republicans joined by as many as 50 democrats have already said any new gun laws are DOA in this congress. If your keeping score thats nearly 70% of the current congress.      

That said, I believe in the free market system, if you can get some fool to pay you double or triple prices then more power to you.  Be ethical though, don't keep fueling the fire by acting like these things are going to happen tomorrow or the next day when the reality is any changes are probably years away."

Biden said today that all they can do with executive order is make changes to the back ground system, ANY BAN, gun or magazine, MUST GO THROUGH CONGRESS. 244 republicans joined by as many as 50 democrats have already said any new gun laws are DOA in this congress. If your keeping score thats nearly 70% of the current congress.

That said, I believe in the free market system, if you can get some fool to pay you double or triple prices then more power to you. Be ethical though, don't keep fueling the fire by acting like these things are going to happen tomorrow or the next day when the reality is any changes are probably years away."

I know that there is a likely assault weapon ban coming up, possibly sooner now that Obama is claiming he will take some sort of action by the end of the month.

In 3 weeks time, you will be stuck with your rifle and I will be stuck with my cash and we both lose if you are trying to profit from the upcoming ban. I am certainly not desperate and will not be ripped off.
I will entertain offers until I find something fair and reasonable. I expect the firearm to be in excellent condition, with magazine(s) and rounds included in your asking price.
I have a VA drivers license and concealed handgun permit. I also have cash in hand. Please send me pics and information about the firearm you wish to sell. Do not send me pics or a description asking for offers as those e-mails will be ignored. Thanks!"

Diamondback Firearms proudly presents the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

Around 2:25 p.m. on March 30, 1981, President Ronald Reagan emerged via a side door from the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington D.C. He had just finished giving a speech to a group of trade unionists at the National Conference of Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO. 
Reagan only had to walk about 30 feet from the hotel door to his awaiting car, so the Secret Service had not thought a bullet-proof vest to be necessary. Outside, waiting for Reagan, were a number of newspapermen, members of the public, and John Hinckley Jr. 

When Reagan got close to his car, Hinckley pulled out his .22-caliber revolver and fired six shots in quick succession. The entire shooting took only two to three seconds.

The Associated Press/The Huffington Post

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday heard personal stories of gun violence from representatives of victims groups and gun-safety organizations as he drafts the Obama administration's response to the shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. He pledged that action would be taken.

""I want to make it clear that we are not going to get caught up in the notion (that) unless we can do everything we're going to do nothing,"" Biden said. ""It's critically important (that) we act.""

The meeting was part of a series Biden is holding this week to build consensus around proposals to curb gun violence after the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown, Conn. Twenty school children were killed.

The Huffington Post has obtained additional details about the meeting from a White House Pool Report. Biden, according to the report, explained that ""the president IS going to act."" The White House has determined that ""executive action can be taken,"" stated the Vice President. The specifics of that action have not yet been settled.

Biden meets Thursday with the National Rifle Association and other gun-owner groups. Meetings with representatives of the video-game and entertainment industries also are planned.

President Barack Obama wants Biden to deliver policy proposals by the end of the month. Obama has vowed to move swiftly on the package, which is expected to include legislative proposals and executive action.


Participants in Wednesday's meeting with Biden included the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence and groups from Arizona, Illinois and Wisconsin, states with spates of gun violence that garnered national attention, including the shooting in Arizona of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Also present were two survivors of the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that killed 32 people, as well as a stepfather of a victim of last July's massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in which a dozen people were slain. Attorney General Eric Holder also attended.

But as the shock and sorrow over the Newtown, Conn., shooting fades, the tough fight facing the White House and gun-control backers is growing clearer. Gun-rights advocates, including the powerful NRA, are digging in against tighter gun restrictions, conservative groups are launching pro-gun initiatives and the Senate's top Republican has warned it could be spring before Congress begins considering any gun legislation.

""The biggest problem we have at the moment is spending and debt,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said this week. ""That's going to dominate the Congress between now and the end of March. None of these issues will have the kind of priority as spending and debt over the next two or three months.""

The killing of 6- and 7-year-olds at Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School appeared to stir a deep reaction from the White House and Capitol Hill. Obama pushed gun control to the top of his domestic agenda for the first time and pledged to put the full weight of his presidency behind the issue. Some Republican and conservative lawmakers with strong gun-rights records also took the extraordinary step of calling for a discussion on new measures.

But other gun-rights advocates have shown less flexibility. The NRA has rejected stricter gun legislation and suggested instead that the government put armed guards in every U.S. school as a way to curb violence. A coalition of conservative groups is also organizing a ""Gun Appreciation Day"" to coincide with Obama's inauguration this month.

The president hopes to announce his administration's next steps to tackle gun violence shortly after he is sworn in for a second term on Jan. 21.

Obama wants Congress to reinstate a ban on military-style assault weapons, close loopholes that allow gun buyers to skirt background checks and restrict high-capacity magazines. Other recommendations to the Biden group include making gun-trafficking a felony, getting the Justice Department to prosecute people caught lying on gun background-check forms and ordering federal agencies to send data to the National Gun Background Check Database.

Some of those steps could be taken through executive action, without the approval of Congress. White House officials say Obama will not finalize any actions until receiving Biden's recommendations.

Gun-rights lawmakers and outside groups have insisted that any policy response also include an examination of mental health policies and the impact of violent movies and video games. To those people, the White House has pledged a comprehensive response.

""It is not a problem that can be solved by any specific action or single action that the government might take,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""It's a problem that encompasses issues of mental health, of education, as well as access to guns.""

In addition to Biden's meetings this week, Education Secretary Arne Duncan will meet with parent and teacher groups, and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will meet with mental health and disability advocates.

The White House said other meetings are also scheduled with community organizations, business owners and religious leaders.

HERES ONE OF MANY REPLIES BUT AND IS A VERY TRUE ! READ BELOW!
Hello Seller: 
You are right in a big way, but you mut understand that some of the biggest fans of shutting this site down are the gun shop owners. The owners I know do not like the sale of anything outside oftheir domain which is of course their little and big shops. When the sites like thee shut down the prices at the gun shops will go way up. I know, I heard them say so ""Our competition is the guy selling from his house on Armslist and %$&$, so as soon as we gonna shut em down we get more profits because everybody gotta come here."" 
Now how unethical are they? At another shop jsut before christmas a customer walked in while I wa browsing in another area and he wanted two semi-automatics because everyone is getting them. So the shop owner said okay, fill out the paperwork and we order them for you.
THANKS ANDY
UPDATE : i was going to rush out get some things i thought would be banned. a group of us 20+ decided screw that we are mostly family men and women including 6 veterans. we all sat down together most were anticipating tax returns but 9-10 of us are disabled and still we were able to scrape up equal amounts of $1000.00 each , so $23,000 in a federal express envolope signature confirmed was sent out 1 hour ago. i beleive we can fight this and win . $23,000 is a powerful statement to send and we are all life members now. please scrape together what you can and send it in. screw the wide screen or pool table etc. the fight is on . send the NRA or other gun rights advocate your anticipated tax return and help fight this unconstitutional use of executive power."

The GSG 5 is an identical replication of the MP 5, except one great thing: Its a 22 cal. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG 5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux suppressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies.

The GSG 5 is an identical replication of the MP 5, except one great thing: Its a 22 cal. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG 5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux suppressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies.

Was originally a ""Vietnam Style"" A2 with full length (22"") barrel and full stock with cleaning kit compartment in stock. Original GI cleaning kit included inside.

Since added full length UTG quad rails, UTG illuminated compact CQB scope, see thru scope mount so you can still use the iron sights as a back up, tritium front sight post (dim), ergonomic rubberized grip with spare battery compartment, and collapsible stock. I can assure you that this will produce 1 MOA or better groups at 100 yards.

With the scope and the carry handle I found I wanted to go back to the full length stock and even added a cheek rest to improve cheek weld. But,you get it all, original hand guards and stock and quad rails and collapsible stock so you can make it what you want.

So the package come with:

AR-15 5.56 with 22"" barrel
One 30 round magazine
UTG Compact CQB Scope
See thru scope mount
Tritium front sight post
Full size and collapsible stocks with buffer springs and both size buffer tubes
Full size standard and quad rail hand guards
Cheek rest
Cleaning kit
Ergonomic rubberized pistol grip and original GI pistol grip
Sling
Cantilevered scope mount (pictured in box, not installed)

Package dated 02/09.  
I am interested in trade for 30 round AK magazines.  I prefer Bulgarian AK waffle magazines circle K, but will entertain Soviet or Chinese steel unused 30 round mags.  Please no junk.
If you are interested in paying cash instead of trade I prefer to sell them all at once.  I am asking $200.00, that is $25.00 a piece.
I do have (8) unused 20 round GI MIL SPEC magazines that I will consider selling as well.  They make shooting from a bench or the prone position a lot easier.  These magazines are made by Universal Inds, Div. Simmonds. The floor plate has M16/M16A1 Cal 5.56. These are real nice. Look them up and you will discover how nice these mags are, asking price $30.00 each.
But to ensure I get an offer to trade AR mags for AK mags. I will wait a day or 2 before accepting cash offers. Unless of course you insist offering some deal I can’t resist for all 16 magazines (8) 30 round and (8) 20 round. 
Last I may consider ammo for trade, 5.56 or 7.62x39. 
I will meet FTF in Lancaster during the evening. I may consider meeting in the parking garage downtown Columbus where I park during work if the deal is good.

In a previous listing i stated i would not entertain any bs offers,,expecting most of the replys to come from someone who knew what this particular piece was .Turns out i was wrong most replys were from those thinking more of the ballpark of a new model manufactured during the 90s in wich the value being somewhere around $1000.. 
this being one of the first of its kind in excellent condition , you cant find these at all those that exist are sitting in collecters safes ,not out in the back yard being used for target practice ..Dont want to offend anyone ,But i Do know the value  and $2,000 will not touch this ,it is a collecters piece ..(this is why ive listed in antiques rather than Handguns,with the everyday cary pistols)
the last time i saw one of these that was even close to this had almost twice the SN# count and had usage marks all over ,still not a bad looking piece ,went for over 3,500 on gunbroker , i saw one a yr before that also on gunbroker sm guys got into a bidding war over and it went for $4200 ..
