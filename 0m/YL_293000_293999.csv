I had this long stroke piston upper built because I could not afforded the over priced long stroke piston available on the market today ($2500.00 to $3000.00)
I have never had the chance to shoot it and now due to financial needs I have to let it go.
I am asking what I paid (1500.00) or best offer.

2 types of pistons are available from manufactures, long and short stroke.

Shot stroke pistons are more common because they are cheaper to produce. 
Ruger, Sig, S&W, ect. All produce short stroke piston because it is easier and cheaper for them to do so. 

Why a long stroke? A Long stroke piston cost more money but are a better system. The long stroke piston is the same system that the AK47 utilizes. A low-pressure, long-stroke gas piston design keeps from ""hammering"" the bolt as the short stroke designs do. By slowing down the acceleration of the bolt mass instead accelerated it over a greater distance. The result is less shock forces on the system, longer lasting parts and reliable feeding. It's the difference between unlocking your bolt with a ball peen hammer or accelerating it on a cushion of air!

The only companies that I am aware of that produce long stroke pistons are POF and LWRC although there may be others. Both of these companies charge well over $2500.00 for there long stroke pistons which is why I had mine built.  

This Long Stroke gas piston system is rated at a 1,000,000 compressions cycles allowing it to out live the life of the rifle itself."

HK P2000. It has the V3 trigger, which is SA/DA with decocker in the rear. Caliber is 9mmx19

Comes with all original packaging, 2 (13rd) magazines, Meprolight TruDot night sights, S/M/L/XL backstraps (medium is installed), unopened HK pistol lock, original manual and box, safety lockout key, original test fired casing. See pictures. It's perhaps one of the last rollmarked P2000s before they switched the HK logo to laser etched. Never holstered.

Probably around 1000 rounds through it. I took a lot of pictures of almost every angle, so please look around. Date code is AE (04). The 3rd and 5th picture shows barrel wear the best because it's hard for my camera to pick up on it in the 4th pic. Like I said, if pictures come up really tiny, just refresh/reload this webpage. 

Located in Charlotte, NC.

Price: I would like to get $610 for it. I prefer not to ship it, unless you rather pay for shipping, due to the shipping costs (UPS/Fedex for out-of-state next day Air). I tried to ask several FFLs in my area to ship it for cheaper, but they won't do it - so for the out-of-state interests, if you can find a FFL near me that'll ship, let me know. My Zip code is 28226. No trades (sorry). The price is firm, sorry. 

Conditions: Bill of sale and purchase permit (or CHP) required, as according to NC in-state law, or through FFL. 

Have to sell it by August, because I might be moving (near/to DC) and I no longer have someone who can store it for me.

I've gotten a question about if I will sell it to SC. Because I live a mile away from the SC border, I will have to drive/ship to a SC FFL and then you'd have to pay the FFL to transfer and fill out the transfer paperwork."

But I just don't use them as much as they deserve, so I'd like to see them go to someone who can actually use them.

1: PlayStation Slim 160Gb, with everything it had straight out of the box, and I still have the box too. I also have a $20 GameStop wired controller, $30 Auvio HDMI cord, and about 30 games for it. Everything together cost me over $1500, mainly looking to trade it if anything.

2: I have a HP Pavilion dv2000 laptop with intel Centrino Duo processor & Windows Vista. It does not run as is but all it needs is a new hard drive to operate. Cost me around $550 new about five years ago. Asking $50 or best offer for it.

3: I have a PSE Mohave compound bow with removable PSE Quiver which cost me around $350 new about two years ago. Also has about another $150 in it for the Cobra sights, QuikTune arrow rest, UltraMax LimbSavers, Tru-Fire release & camo braided bow sling. It had a stabilizer on it too but I sold it to a buddy for his bow. I've only used it about 5 times for deer hunting. Looking to trade it but feel free to make a cash offer.

4: Mossberg 500A 12ga chambered for 2 3/4 & 3in shells with 28in barrel and modified choke. 5+1 capacity.

5: Mossberg International 702 Plinkster 22lr with black synthetic stock & a tasco 4x32 scope which I can take off if you don't want it. Comes with one magazine, 10+1 capacity.

6: I also have a Savage Model 24 22/410 over/under. More than likely not going to get rid of it because it has sentimental value to me, just want to know what I could get for it.

7: Two short swords hand-forged in Saudi Arabia around 1960, not sure of the exact date.  I picked them up about 5 years ago from a friends grandfather who had lived in Saudi Arabia for some time. They do seem to have seen some use but that is how he purchased them.

8: Last but not least I have a 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche with the Z66 on-road package. Bluebook value on it is around $9,000 but I'll knock $700-900 off because the grill is cracked at the moment. It'll cost about $200-300 for the parts to fix it and can be fixed by anyone who knows how to take a bumper off. Absolute lowest I can take is $7,800 or partial trade + cash that is equal value.

If you have any questions about anything listed above you can contact me by email or text me anytime day or night at 7zero4-7five4-6zero10. If interested in anything please don't hesitate to ask for pictures, I can text or email them to you. Also I can drive & meet you somewhere to do the transaction if necessary."

It is very lightly used.
Below is the DeSantis sales pitch for this holster -

 With the DeSantis Thumb Break Scabbard, the firearm rides high and is presented at an optimum draw angle. This DeSantis Holster's thumb break and exact molding, together with a tension device, allows for a secure and highly concealable carry. This picture illustrates the three-slot model. It has a single tensioning screw that applies retaining tension near the rear portion of the trigger guard.

 The holster provides for two different holster cants. The cant of a holster refers to how tilted forward from vertical the gun rides when carried in the holster. A straight-drop holster has 0 degrees of cant and so causes the gun to carry vertically. The commonly referenced FBI-cant holster has a cant in the 10 to 20 degree range. Using the upper slot on the holster will increase the cant and position it in the FBI-cant style.

Here is what Midway USA says about it:  
This high performance bolt is manufactured from SAE 9310 steel and boasts a life expectancy of more than 10 times that of a mil-spec bolt. This bolt is for use in a standard Mil-Spec Carrier and uses a standard firing pin, cam pin, extractor and firing pin retaining pin. This bolt features radiuses in all of the traditional 90 degree corners of the locking lug areas. The radiused corners help strengthen the bolt allowing it to handle high loads over a long life span."

I will also include the Blackhawk Serpa CQC holster with the trade.  Trading for a M&P 40 compact... must be in great/excellent condition... like for like trade.

If you are a fan of the Walther P99... this gun is nearly identical (there is no rail under barrel but the ""lines"" are much more rounded).  This gun has never been registered with Smith so the lifetime warranty to original owner is still valid. The SW99 is identical in mechanism to the Walther P99 with the ""Anti-Stress"" Trigger... double action with very short single action plus decocker.

I love this handgun but need to transition to the M&P 40 compact to more closely match my competition firearm (M&P Pro 9mm).  Will not consider any other handgun, so please don't ask.

May text requests/inquiries to REDACTED.  Would be willing to sell at $450 OBO.  Remember, this also includes the Serpa holster."

I almost don't want to get rid of it, but I am finding that I typically would rather either carry a larger handgun if I am wearing a coat, or pocket-carry my smaller Bodyguard 380 if it is warmer weather. The PM9 is somewhere inbetween my S&W M&P Compact and the Bodyguard 380 (huge range, I know).

The gun has approximately 500-600 rounds of various ammo through it, includes the original plastic case, and has been taken very good care of (stored properly, cleaned after/before shooting, lubricated well, etc.)

With standard sights the gun retails (used) for approximately ~$495-$600, and this one is equipt with brand-new XS BIG DOT 24/7 Night Sights (tritium inserts in for front and rear sights) (~$120) (the original sights will also be included) and also has an in-the-waistband Don Hume holster (~$30) (shown in the pictures), as well as 2 extra magazines one-6 round and one-7 round (~$40 each). Additionally I will be willing to include an outside the waistband (Black) DeSantis leather holster with thumb-break (~$55)(not shown in picture).

I believe $550 is a fair price for the firearm and all the extras, or $575 without the DeSantis holster. Face to face sales ONLY and ONLY TO NEW YORK STATE Pistol Permit Holders. (I have my permit in Ontario County)

I received the gun last year as my first shotgun. Previous seller had only put 25 shots through it in the previous 30 years. Since I received it, I have put another 300 shells through it, mainly shooting clays. It has been cleaned after every outing and performs flawlessly with little recoil. Only reason I am selling is because I have since bought a Beretta for clays and duck hunting and this gun is on the backburner. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

The Pardus features many of the same components that have made the DPMS line of rifles successful, such as the forged 7075-T6 aluminum lower receiver, .223 caliber chambering and the outstanding accuracy and reliability of every DPMS rifle, but the new rifle will be a smaller, sleeker version of the traditional Panther rifle. Tapered lines will entice shooters to pickup the rifle and examine the 16” bull barrel with an integral compensator and an overall length of 36.75”. Shooters will also appreciate the overall clean profile of the rifle, and a balanced, lightweight rifle, weighing 8.1 lbs. Looking down the barrel, shooters will notice the shortened sight radius and the comfortable grip of the 4-Rail carbine length free float tube, as well as the single rail Koelbl gas block that will allow shooters to mount both optics and iron sights. The 3-Rail upper receiver, machined from a 6066-T6 extrusion, provides shooters a multitude of mounting options with the two additional Picatinny rails on the left and right sides of the receiver. A titanium nitrate plated bolt carrier assembly completes the upper receiver, and a titanium nitrate plated trigger highlights the forged lower receiver. The new rifle also features the new Pardus buttstock, a 6-position stock with a curved and serrated buttplate and a Monte Carlo style cheek rest provide the shooter with a better comfort and fit. Hard coat anodizing and a tan coating make this rifle a custom design from DPMS.

I have always wanted an AR-15 or a rifle similar to it as I want to do My own customization to her but want something complete. I think it would be great to fire My Rifle knowing I did work to her Myself, that feeling of satisfaction that you spent time adding everything you want on her with your own hands. May sound odd to some but others of ya Im sure you get it..lol.

Eliminates Muzzle Rise; Sight Stays On Target For Fast Follow Up Shots
Heavy duty compensator designed by noted custom gunsmith and 3-gun competitor Benny Hill employs a unique internal expansion chamber that redirects some of the combustion gas out a topside gas port to virtually eliminate muzzle climb. The sights stay on the target, so you can make exceptionally fast follow up shots. Precision machined from a solid billet of high-grade stainless steel, with large side ports that vent more gas to help reduce felt recoil. Solid bottom prevents dust signature when shooting close to the ground. Perfect for USPSA and 3-gun competition where seconds count, and for varmint hunters who want the sight to stay the target when they take a shot. 

Used for less than 20 shots. Retails price is $98.00.

Two 20 round detatchable mags from Tapco that have been fitted to it but will still function on other SKS models, one is a little finicky on occasion, 12 Yugoslavian stripper clips also included. Also included is a NC star tri-rail receiver cover as well as the original, please tell me if you want the tri-rail as I'll have to find it.

Condition: 

Very good, other than a few shiny spots on the hammer and rails, the only other spot that shows that its even been shot is the head of the piston is a little sooty, Ive tried to get it off but not gone nuts on it and a good deal of it came off. Chrome in bore is superb still, Ive only put right around 100 rounds through it since I purchased it new, just enough to soak out some of the cosmoline from the bad spots. Ive been pretty good about cleaning it from tip to tail even after putting a round through it so its in very good shape. The only funky thing with it is that the pin that holds the safety spring down seems to be a chunk of allen key? It doesnt affect the feel of the rifle, I only discovered it when I took it down to clean out the grit and grease from the FCG. Very nice trigger for an SKS, pretty clean and crisp with a short travel once the dead travel is taken up, also quite light.
