This AR-15 has only been shot 10 times to sight it in, otherwise it is brand new and I am the original owner.  

The following is a list of what was installed on the AR-15 by a professional master firearms instructor and gunsmith: 

1.   Alostyr 1913 picatinny quad rail used by Armalite- $150     This is the real deal heavy duty and a very very tight fit.  I did my research on this item.
2.   Surefire Weapons Light -$250     This also comes with the Surefire brand pressure switch assembly compatible with several other Surefire products-$130 for the switch alone

4.   Atlas front sight picatinny mount for sling and weapons light-$40 
5.   Hogue Pistol Grip-$20 
6.   Two PMAGS-$30
7.   The Detachable Carry Handle-$90 

As the AR-15 sits, it is worth over $1,500 my loss is your gain.  I ran into an unexpected family problem and need to sell this ASAP.  

If you have any questions, please email me.  This is a great rifle, and I wish I could keep it.  The upper has the keyhole forge mark, the same forge mark that is used on Colt's, so it is Colt quailty upper.  

The barrel is a 1:9 twist midweight barrel with bayonet lug.

It has 20"" barrels, has the original Rossi butt plate, and is in excellent condition. A slight mark in the butt stock on the right side (see photos) but other than that nothing to report. The breech face and bores show no sign of being fired, and the gun is nice and tight. The 20 gauge Rossis are especially nice because the frame of the gun is actually sized for a 20 gauge instead of just having 20 gauge barrels mounted on a 12 gauge frame. This is a really nice gun.

These Rossi shotguns are great because they are solid and reliable, and there are no extra safeties like the unnecessary tang safety that you find on currently manufactured hammered shotguns.

Price is $475.00, plus $30 for shipping and insurance.

I have a lot more photos so just let me know if you want to see them."

Excellent bore and action, fully operationable, normal wear for 95 year old master crafted firearm. These Rifles are a very important part of American Firearms History. Remington Arms enlisted a brilliant Danish Arms Inventor, John Pedersen, to design a firearm to compete head to head with Winchester's Model 1894 lever action rifles. His invention and design of the Model 14 far surpassed the state-of-the-art of firearms of his day. Some have stated that to build and market such a rifle today would cost 3 to $4,000.00. He was way ahead of his time. The ammo is still readily available today and although there were a limited number produced in the Model 14, there are those proud owners who still insist on this being the rifle of their choice when in search of the great white tale deer and other trophy animals. Find one of these just to handle it for a few minutes and you will become a Model 14 believer !

Before contacting me please be serious in purchasing.  Now gawkers or tire kickers.  

HK MP5 SD .22LR. This is a licenced HK product.  Has HK stampings, worlds ahead of the GSG5 that is regularly seen.  Comes chambered in .22LR, cheap fun plinker with full size rifle feel, weight and controls. Steel upper, polymer lower, faux intregal suppressor, 16"" barrel. 

In very good condition.  Only wear marks are from rail mount that was on the rifle.  Extremely reliable and accurate.  Will eat any cheap ammo you can put through it.  It is not ammo sensitive like the GSG copy. Comes with 1 original magazine, instruction manual and tool for adjusting ammo velocity, though I've never had to use it.  I've run 1200fps and 1650fps ammo through it fine.  I'd expect subsonic to run fine too, but never tried it.  Break down is super easy with 2 push pins.  Don't deal with tons of screws like the GSG.  

If you are reading this ad, it is still available.

DO NOT ask me to meet you half way somewhere in a parking lot.  YOU MUST come to me to pick up. Bring a rifle bag with you, or I can throw in a basic hunting rifle bag for $10 extra.  No carrying it openly to your car.

He bought this gun brand new from Gibson's Discount Ctr on 7 Feb 1994.  I know because the receipt is still in the box along with all the original Glock paperwork cleaning brush and adjustment tools and Velcro for the Beamshot Laser.  I also looked up the date of manufacture of this pistol Dec 1993, it only took a couple of months to sell this Glock Brand new.

What is even more amazing is the round count.  He bought 100 rounds two 50 round boxes.  He took the gun out and literally shot this Glock a total of two times, just to make sure the gun cycled and it went back in the box.  I have pictured the missing two rounds, the gun will come with 98 rounds.  

This Glock is very clean for what you expect for only being shot a total of two rounds.  The new owner won't be disappointed.

More photos at request, Looking for $600/cash. Only reply if you are legal to own a firearm and I will require a photocopy of an official Colorado state id and a signed wavier that states you are legal to own a firearm in the State of Colorado.

Selling for friend and NOT looking for any trades at this time. Unless you have a Browning HighWall in .454 Casull (for me).

All Brand New Items Included In Sale:

1- ESEE AH-1 Survival Arrowhead With Factory Box and included Plastic Bag
 2- Handmade Three or Four Eyelet Kydex Sheath (Buyer's Choice)
 3- Military Dogtag Chain and Key Chain
 4- ESEE Survival Card
 5- ESEE Sticker

These are brand new ESEE AH-1 arrowheads and have only been removed from the box to mold the kydex to each blade, attach the chain and polish.
They are made from 1095 high carbon steel, which is the same steel used in many of the best knives in service today. They are also covered by ESEE's unconditional lifetime warranty. As a free service to all buyers, I will professionally hone your AH-1 to a mirror shine. This makes it a much more useful survival tool/weapon and more easily resharpened if/when it becomes dull. This honing will not mar the coating on the blade whatsoever. It simply polishes the edge to a mirror shine.

*Please note, these arrowheads will not in any way sharpen to a razor's edge without serious reprofiling of the blade. I have completely stripped the powder coating off one and reprofiled the blade and even then will not shave hair as well as most blades.*

The triangle shaped three eyelet or sqare shaped four eyelet sheaths are the available sheath shape options. I plan to have other colors available soon but at the present time only have black kydex.

There are several ways to carry your new ESEE arrowhead. The most common is like a necklace or ""neck knife"" with the provided dogtag chain threaded through one or more eyelets and worn around the neck. Other ways include as a keychain or simply dropping it in a pocket or purse secured in the sheath without the chain attached.

I included a few pictures of another optional way to carry your new arrowhead. I have one lashed to the front of my personal Becker necker. (The Becker knife, sheath, paracord etc. is not in any way included in this sale.) It is a handy way to keep it close at hand but out of the way until it is needed and since both are secured to my belt, there is little chance of losing them.

I am asking $25 for a Knoxville or surrounding area sale. If you need this item shipped, I'd be happy to ship if you want to pay for it. You could also check my ebay auction under the same name.  I have them listed for $30 with free shipping.

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

It's a heavy barrel with Walnut boot grips with S&W medallions.  No internal lock.  Made in the early '90s.  Sorry, no box or papers.

Before I get multiple emails again trying to school me that S&W never made a blued 65, allow me to explain.

You are all correct. Smith never made a blued 65; it was the model 13.  I am a big Smith collector and own many S&W's, including multiple 3"" models (not boasting, just how it is).  I wanted a 3"" model 13, but couldn't find one for the longest time.  After speaking with a master gun restorer, he mentioned that there is a new ""hot blueing"" process designed for stainless.  To his knowledge, or mine, we have never seen or heard of a blued stainless gun, but I was curious.  Keep in mind, when I called S&W about this, they said that was impossible, and couldn't be done (this is why S&W didn't blue it!).  So, I purchased another 65 and took it to my guy to see if this would work.  The gun you see before you is the result.  It turned out beautiful. Only three things wouldn't blue: the trigger, hammer, and case ejector.  Now this gun is the best of both worlds, a 3"" revolver that is blued, but corrosion resistant due to the stainless.  Also, worth noting, this process isn't permanent.  By that I mean the bluing can be removed, and you have a stainless gun back. I installed a new pair of Altamont boot grips on it, and added it to the collection.  I hope everyone is now satisified.

So why am I getting rid of it?  Well, wouldn't you know it, I found a collector's grade 13 on-line and purchased it.  So, I have this beautiful gun, but no longer is needed to fill a void in my collection.  This is why I'm getting rid of it.  Might as well let someone else enjoy it.  

So, with that being said, I'm looking for $650 firm or $700 trade.  If the ad is still up, gun is still available.  Thank you,"

It appears to be fully functional, the barrel appears to be in good shape with consistent rifling and no pitting. It is missing a small piece of the hard rubber grip on both sides. It is the hammerless safety version, serial number 87223. I cannot find much information on these guns to decipher the serial, but near as I can tell it is a 2nd model, made late 1800's-early 1900's. Patent information on the grip implies the patent on this piece ran out 1908, so it would be safe to assume it was made before that. Great collectors piece, no room in my safe for it anymore. Im going to ask $100, seems they have been bringing anywhere from $75-300 on gun broker so $100 looks good for local sale."

When last seen it looked new. Blue 6 5/8"" medium weight barrel with adjustable sights on both front and rear, I think the grips are checkered walnut, and the pistol has the factory upgrade to allow use of high velocity ammo (early models were standard velocity only). This was made in 1930, the box is long gone. The safe contains a handful of Woodsmans, so a few others will be offered later this summer including: 1948 Custom Match Target, 1966 6"" Match Target, 1968 6"" Target and a couple of Challengers and Huntsmans. All have been owned by me for 15-20 years, so are new to market.
Prices firm, no shipping, Ohio residents only, local cash sale. Prefer selling to collectors like myself as opposed to giving to dealers/ flippers.
