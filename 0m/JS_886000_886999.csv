HOWEVER: For 20 round magazines, which I like a lot; especially for at the range, laying prone, and home defense; I have no problem with plastic, and per the title of this thread, I have had no issues with thermolds. Plastic in 20 rounders is fine, because they are straight magazines, and therefor, I don't have issues with rounds tilting, and therefor don't need anti-tilt followers. So for me, the thermold 20 round magazines work great. I have been using them for more than 10 years, and have yet to have any problems with them at all. Again; I am speaking ONLY of 20 round magazines. For 30 round magazines, I only shoot USGI surplus with a Magpul Generation III follower.

If you offer under $700 or do not make it clear when you are looking to come get it, I will ignore your response. However, if we close the deal, I will provide you with a very clean bill of sale and a very nice and in-demand handgun, so we'll both walk away happy."

A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

And before I get any more stupid messages... Yes, I know what these are selling for, believe me, I've been watching. I did not buy these at retail prices, so don't expect me to sell them at retail prices. I bought these last week, for the panic pricing, WITH FFL transfer paperwork! Now I am selling them, WITHOUT PAPERWORK, slightly higher than what I paid.

I have an Anderson Manufacturing Model AM15 for sale. It is brand new, never been fired. Comes with hard case, one black 30 round PMAG. It was purchased in mid-December. Anderson makes high end AR's with a metal treatment (RF-85) that does not require oil or cleaning solvents to maintain. The treatment reduces friction by 85% compared to a non-treated oiled weapon. This also has the result of allowing the rifle to cycle faster. The fit and finish on the rifle is comparable to Rock River and other higher end ARs. This isn't a home built ""Frankenstein"" rifle that you've been seeing on here lately.  Details from manufacturer are below. http://www.andersonrifles.net/

Must be legal to own, no bad guys. Asking $1,750.00 CASH (can also do partial cash/credit card). Need to see ID for credit card transactions. 

Not looking for any trades.

Prefer to meet on the SW side of Denver in the Littleton/Lakewood area.

Bores are bright and clean. outside bluing is over 95% IMO there is some wear at the bottom sharp edges on the corners but I had to look hard to make sure it was not just a reflection. There is a very small scratch on one of the barrels maybe 1/8 inch and I do not believe it is through the bluing. The stock has a few very slight dings I suspect from being in the safe. The finish on the furniture is bright. It has 26"" barrels and mod and Imp chokes. I have not had a chance to fire it yet but I see no reason this will not fire. I have no problem keeping it as a piece of wall art, just wanted to see whats out there as I will never use it. It is a 1977

  I do get to the Cities once in a while.

Basically I would be interested in anything firearms related. Particularly a nice safe. Also PM are welcome. I might be interested in other stuff as well. Greenhouse generator etc.  I am not in a huge hurry to move these as they are not taking up much space and I am not interested in lowballs please. Some cash could exchange hands if it was interesting enough. Reasonable expectations please, I'm not interested in .223 ammo for 1.00 a rd etc Thanks for your time.


Add to the list any tactical guns for a small girl. I was thinking maybe a tactical 20 gauge. Obviously I don't intend to let this go for a 300.00 shotgun but if it was properly optioned out I would be interested. Or anything else tactical for that matter. I'll keep adding things to trade for as I think of them."

This Plains rifle is stocked with iron furniture, single set trigger. The .50 caliber 15/16"" octagon barrel is cut rifled with seven lands and grooves with a slow twist for a patched round ball. The barrel is a rich warm chocolate brown outside, and the rifled bore is bright and clean inside. This rifle has a 13-1/2"" pull, to fit todays average shooter. The rifle weighs 8.9 pounds.  The triggerguard has a spoon like grip rail, typical of those found on Leman rifles.  This rifle uses a 1820 era Ketland flint lock. The lock has a worn brown patina finish. The “full waterproof pan"" is made with rain gutters cut to drain any water away from the pan. The cock's jaws have been tipped down to throw sparks directly into the pan. The erect frizzen snaps over a roller bearing on the end of the frizzen spring, which is retained by an inside screw threaded into a blind hole in the bullet shaped spring finial. All features of late flintlocks. The trigger has a outside mounted spring. Push the trigger forward until it latches to ""set"" the trigger. This trigger must be set to cock the lock.  Fast ignition is assured by the Ampco vent liner, positioned well above the bottom of the pan, centered on the heat of the flash.  There are a few things about this gun you need to know.  The stock has a slight crack on side opposite the lockplate and a Lockplate bolt broke so I replaced it with one that works for now, but would need replaced to complete the look.  This gun has been used and expect that if you buy it.  I will also take trades on other blackpowder guns.  Bought this for $1600 5 years ago.  Open to offers and trades, even modern handgun, my price is flexible.  Can send more pictures if needed.  Willing to trade for blackpowder rifle.  Send me pictures of yours.  Would like civil war type gun."

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

 The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

XM855 ammo features a 62 grain, copper jacketed, lead core, steel tip bullet. It is not armor piercing ammunition, but the steel tip does allow it to penetrate farther than other types of ammo. This bullet will attract a magnet because of the steel in the tip, and some ranges will not allow you to use it because of this. However, it will not damage the barrel of your rifle, because the steel is entirely covered by a layer of copper.

The ammunition itself is extremely high quality, and has features not seen on other ammunition of this type. This ammo has a crimped primer, reducing the chances of a blown primer stopping a semi-automatic, or automatic rifle from functioning. It also has a lacquer primer sealant and a case mouth sealant, to prevent the internal components from being compromised by moisture intrusion.

Federal offers a weather resistant ammo can containing 420 rounds of this ammunition. Composed of 14 30-round boxes containing three stripper clips of 10 rounds each, this product is ideal for those looking to store ammo long term, but who also want to be able to access and load it quickly

i would like to sell the rifle complete as pictured but may part it out if i have too.
here is a parts break down:
rifle 330$
.250"" recoil lug 20$ not installed
20 moa weaver rail 20$
utg 3-12x40ao scope 70$
sss competition trigger 100$
reduced bolt lift kit 30$
oversized bolt handle 40$(i made it but figure it is reasonable number)
if i ship buyer will have to cover transfer fees and shipping.  if interested i could try and sight the rifle in for someone at 100 yards with a particular ammo they plan on using.  i use ""try"" as i do not know if i can get my hands on the ammo you would like to use.  i would likely have the rifle dialed in very well in under 10 shots.  i could also provide an approximate break down of what the mil dots on the scope reticle correspond to.

Now that we know that Obama is not going to take unauthorized unilateral action to ban sporting rifles, it is fairly certain no ""assault weapons"" ban will pass. Republicans control the House (and a lot of Dems are backed by the NRA as well), and even Obama, Biden, and Feinstein have all recognized that getting such a bill through Congress will be an uphill battle. 

So, please check out Gunbroker before you send me an offer to buy one for $3,000. Prices are still inflated, and I'm willing to pay more than MSRP, but they have dropped significantly since the speech last week.

The Huldra 5.56 Carbine TU-C Upper (Tactical Upper – Carbine) 16"" is a M4 profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms Piston technology and a tactical extended free floating forearm. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10” rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you more rail space for whatever your tactical needs may be. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler and longer than any other AR upper you own. This model is only available online and is not sold in stores."

PLR-16
The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

One of the six mags may have been loaded/inserted into a receiver, but still looks like new. The other five are like the day I bought them. There is ZERO rust or pitting on any of these items.

Check GB and these mags are going for $50+ each. They will fit metric pattern FALs..DSA-Century-FN-Springfeild Armory.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fl eet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the offi cial sidearm of the SEALs."

Introducing the most consistent and reliable barrier ammo on the market.
1) FLEXLOCK® BULLET incorporates two revolutionary Hornady features: the patented Flex Tip® that initiates consistent expansion every single time while preventing any clogging, and the heavy duty InterLock® band that locks the jacket and core together.
2) CANNELURED BULLET WITH CRIMPED CASE ensures no bullet setback during feeding.

3) INTERLOCK® BAND works to keep the bullet and core from separating for maximum weight retention and proven terminal performance through all FBI test barriers.
4) CORE is made of high-antimony lead making it extremely tough, delivering controlled expansion for unparalleled terminal performance consistency through all FBI test barriers. It’s also more economical than similar bonded bullets.
5) NICKEL-PLATED CASES resist corrosion and greatly enhance low-light chamber checks.

Law enforcement and tactical professionals now have a truly advanced, 21st century handgun ammunition solution that delivers the most consistent and reliable urban barrier performance ever created! The proven Flex Tip® design of the new FlexLock® bullet eliminates clogging and aids bullet expansion.

Whether you live in NY or elsewhere the same fate is coming your way - it's only a matter of time.  This current movement by left wing zelots needs to be stopped starting with New York.  You can help, regardless of where you live by first signing the petition by NYS Senator Kathleen Marcione at http://www.nysenate.gov/webform/stand-second-amendment-standing-new-york-state-senator-kathleen-marchione .  
Next, watch what the NRA is going to do about taking legal action against this NYS illegal piece of legislation.  They are currently studying the law to determine what can be litigated.  When they announce that legal action will be taken they will need financial support, and if you are serious about your second amendment rights make it known by supporting them.  It was the NRA that stopped Washington D.C. and Chicago in their efforts to strip its citizens of their second amendment rights.
If your watched Hannity on Fox this week, Wayne LaPierre stated that NRA membership is soon expected to reach 5 million, that has historically been 4 million prior to the Newtown disaster.  One of the strongest messages that can be sent to the gun ban lobby is to have the membership skyrocket well beyond the 5 million mark.  What has always been a mystery to me is that the membership for AARP is in the tens of millions, including gun owners, when this organization is blantly against your gun rights.  Time for some common sense change.
P.S.
I received an email regarding donations to the NRA that suggested using the donations to sign up friends or relatives as members.  This approach would not only provide the NRA with funds, but increase the membership as well."

I have a couple complete PSA lowers, a couple stripped PSA lowers, a complete upper receiver, a stripped upper receiver, a couple complete FA BCGs, and a couple extra 5.56 bolts that I will be selling off. If you have an interest in any or all of these parts, drop me a line. I will try and accommodate you.

Folks, I already have a dozen people I am responding to, and everyone is the same. I am not setting prices because I don't want to be considered a gouger. Please just tell me what you feel to be a fair price. If I agree, then its yours. 

I am always interested in trades but I am fairly selective. Worst I can ever say is 'no'."
