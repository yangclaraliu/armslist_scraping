Elevation Quadrant, M9, is used for the indirect laying of tank guns in elevation.  It is standard fire Control equipment for Light Tank, T24, Medium Tanks, M4, including those with a 76mm gun, and Medium Tanks T23E3, T25, and T26.  Heavy Tanks, M6 and M6A1, and Gun Motor Carriages, M10, M10A1. M18, and T71.  The adoption of this instrument has eliminated the necessity for the gunner’s quadrant, which is inconvenient for use in a tank.

The instrument, contained in a metal casting, has an elevation mechanism, scale, and micrometer.  The unit is screwed firmly to a tank mount.  It is installed on the gunner’s side of the mount, in a position convenient for use by him.


The elevation quadrant proper contains a level vial and an index and is driven by a worm mechanism.  The worm knob contains a micrometer scale which measures 100 mils at 1-mil intervals.  As the worm knob is turned, it moves the quadrant and the index along a scale measuring from 200 mils depression has been set to the correct 10mil indication.  By turning the micrometer scale further, the exact elevation or depression of the gun corresponds with the setting indicated on the scale and micrometer, the level bubble is centered."

Here are some general specs; 

Chambered in 17hmr
21"" fluted, free float barrel
1/9 twist
40"" overall length
7.5lbs without scope
Adjustable accutrigger (comes with adjustment tool still in its bag)
Since this is the 'tactical' model it comes with an enlarged bolt knob and Boyds stock. 
Custom cheek piece

All load bearing surfaces in the bolt are polished for ultra smooth operation. 

Also comes with ammo organizer. I have a habit of mixing bullet weights and cant figure why the POI shifts so much!  So .17gr on one side and .20gr on the other!

As you can see in the photos, the rifle has been duracoated (by me). 
The stock is OD green with Swiss tan and coyote tan. The barrel is a custom green. There is not a single scratch on the rifle.
If the duracoat does not 'float your boat' it can easily be removed with paint stripper and you will then have the stock black stock with black barrel. 

The rifle comes with a total of 4 magazines. 2 stock magazines duracoated and 2 10rd magazines from http://17hmrmag.com/ 

Since new it has exactly 200 rounds down the tube. 150 Hornady V Max 17gr and 50 CCI FMJ 20gr. 

EGW single piece base IS included, Harris bipod NOT included.

The rifle will easily shoot sub MOA at 100 yards. (See picture below) From my last range trip with this, it was able to shoot MOA or just over at 200 yards. 2"" (4 shot group, ran out of ammo for the 5th shot) and 2.45"", outer edge to outer edge (1.92"" and 2.36"" center to center). I am a novice shooter at best, an experienced marksman will obviously see tighter groups than mine. 

I absolutely love this rifle, the only reason I am selling is because I bought a .308 bolt gun... 

I am located in the Minnetonka area and can meet a buyer within a reasonable distance. 

I am asking $250 for everything, OBO."

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $100 or can be negotiated in the price. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. The barrel and gas ports have been re-worked to cycle lighter birdshot loads for which saigas typically do not cycle reliably. Please contact me by email to make a cash offer or a trade offer.

Three things to point out, aside from some internal parts being missing.
- Handle grips were painted black by previous owner, original color white. 
- Trigger guard is held in by a screw that is obviously not original, seems the prior owner actually tapped the diameter of the hole bigger to make it fit.
- Cylinder looks rather worn to me, so may or may not be safe to re-use it."

Really had my hopes up on getting this gun serviceable again, but the gunsmith I took it to discovered 
that the frame is ever so slightly torqued. And I do mean ever so slightly, was told he couldn't figure out what the issue was with fitting a new 
cylinder until he took a micrometer to it.

Here's the bad stuff.:
- Frame torqued (unusable)
- Cylinder, badly worn, unsafe to use.
- Ejector, missing. (Was already missing when I bought it.)

Here are the good things about this pistol.:

-  All of the springs are intact!
-  Mechanical aspects are functional!
-  3"" Snub Nose barrel
-  good handle grips

I'd like to point out that this particular S&W .38 is over one hundred years old. Did some research on its serial and narrowed the manufacture date to 
somewhere in the 1906 - 1909 date range. For anyone curious, the serial number on this gun is only five digits ""97xxx"". Great pistol for display or just raiding parts from."

H&R .22lr- I haven't shot this personally but bought it off the boards here on a whim and just looking to get back what I bought it for. $100 firm


I've been trying to fund a compact/micro 1911 for awhile now (will add cash if needed and would prefer this weapon). I also have interest in an M&P 9c. They fit my small hands well and I'd like to try one out for carrying since that's coming soon as well. I check PM's throughout the day.

FTF, willing to meet around the metro area. IF I'm off on prices let me know. I just went from info I could find on the internet.

I am not really wanting to get rid of this rifle, but I am needing to sell it for money to help pay for school. This rifle is my baby, and it has been cared for immaculately. It has had only 200 rounds tops out of it and has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range. This carbine has many extras added to it, over $300 worth, most of them coming from Magpul Industries, one of the leaders when it comes to aftermarket parts for tactical weapons. The extras include seven 30 round Magpul PMAG magazines, a Magpul ACS Stock, Magpul RSA (Rail Sling Attachment), Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore Grip), several XTM rail panels, a Magpul MS2 one or two point sling, a Magpul BAD (Battery Assist Device) Lever, a Magpul MOE trigger guard, six Magpul Ranger Plates for the mags, and an Ergo Grip. I would have to say that this rifle is in excellent shape, I'd probably set the condition at 99%-95%. I'm willing to bargain with anyone, but only serious and fair inquiries please!

I’m selling a new revision Sig 556 Swat Classic with the folding collapsible stock. The barrel is a 16"" cold hammer forged 1/7 twist and has been nitrite instead of chrome lined. This allows for an extremely accurate barrel with a lightweight profile, I have shot 1 1/2"" groups with heavy 77gr and average 2""-3"" with American eagle cheap stuff or newer WPA steel. The newer revision has the one piece monolithic top rail/quad rail and the newer smooth machined lower receiver. It will accept AR15, M16 type magazines and has a full length adjustable gas piston firing system like an AK47. This will allow you to adjust gas pressure for silencers/suppressors and for cheap steel cased ammo that is under powered and short stroking. It also has the Swiss two stage trigger group in it with a fully adjustable trigger weight setting. It has the typical wear around the charging handle dust cover from brass hitting it on extraction. Overall gun is perfect and will come with a factory Sig magazine and a couple of my used M16 magazines.This will come with the factory hooded front and rear diopter drum sight setup with backup up popsicle stick sight under diopter."

594,http://www.armslist.com/posts/280594,For Sale/Trade:  98 Camaro v6 with T-Tops.  Trade for gun/car+cash,"Milton, Indianapolis, Indiana","$ 3,300","Listed On: Thursday, January 19, 2012",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,".I listed my Camaro about a week ago due to the fact that it's hard for me to get in and out of because of medical reasons. I've dropped the price due to the fact that she needs a new head gasket. It went out on me while I was driving to Indy today. Had her towed to B&R in Dublin. I had them replace the water pump, but she does need a new head gasket. That is the ONLY thing wrong with this car mechanically. No damage was done to the engine. I just don't have the time or extra money to have them replace it at the moment. My loss is definently your gain. She has the sharp factory chrome wheels too.....not the salad shooters. Any trade offer will be considered. The car is in great shape for having 151,000 miles on her. Shifts and runs (with new gasket) GREAT! The drivers side window needs some work done to the track. It rolls up and down, you just have to guide it when you roll it up. Passenger side works perfect. That's about it that I can think of. If something else hits me, I'll make sure to add it. This really is a great car, and if it wasn't for my health problems I wouldn't even be thinking of selling it. You could have a great car at a very nice price.....especially if you're a mechanic or have a friend that's one. Like I said, hit me with a trade offer if you would like. I'm looking for a large caliber wheel gun, like a Governor or Alaskan, I'll give top dollar and knock the price off the car.   I'm a little flexible with the cash price. Throw in a gun and you could have a VERY nice Camaro pretty cheap.  Head gaskets suck, but at the price that I'm asking you could have it fixed and still have the car cheaper then hell.  You can text me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking!"

I HATE to list this for sale but I am consolidating to 9mm. I love this gun as does anyone who has shot her. But now she just sits in the safe.

So enough of the sappy sentimental stuff....

Sig Sauer P229 .40 S&W, 1995 (AE Serial#) and here is what has been done to her (basically $500 of work & parts if done by SigArms service):

Brand new trijicon night sights (installed 1 year ago)
polished feed ramp
Bedair Solid stainless steel guide rod
Action Enhancement Package(internals polished for clean trigger pull)
ALL new frame springs including upgraded new style hammer strut and spring
Short Reset Trigger (SRT) installed
Short reach trigger
All brand new nickel controls, trigger and hammer (will include originals)
Hogue grip w/ 3 sets of grip screws

Extras:
Some new parts still in bags (firing pin, springs, roll pins, etc)
All of the original parts (grips, springs, etc)

Blackhawck CQC Serpa (never worn)
300 rounds (6 boxes of 50) Tula practice ammo (FTF only, won't ship ammo)

This Sig was not a safe queen and as you can tell from the pics it has a few minor imperfections. However, she is like new on the inside, looks great on the outside and is the most solid performer in my safe. Dead accurate, tight, smooth and crisp.

Asking $750 FTF (or $750 shipped to FFL less ammo)

Not really looking to sell but if the price is right, I will and then just purchase another XD or similar in 9mm.  Let me know what you have!  Thanks!"

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

I have plenty of places I shop that sell it for about $130 per 1,080 rounds. It is more accurate over longer distances, lesser recoil and ammo is cheaper than 7.62x39. It is also becoming more available than 7.62x39 since it has been replacing it in military service since 1974. Most AK accessories fit exactly the same ,too.
I added an ATI pistol grip and picatinny rail (that mounts via standard AK style mounting pad that is riveted to the left side of the receiver). This allows you to mount a red dot or scope, etc. The rifle has the cleaning rod, bayo lug, screw-on AK74 style compensator/flash hider. I am including THREE proper Bulgarian magazines. The stock is also black polymer and is a tad longer than the typical AK47 wooden stock according to my judgment. It fits better, IMHO, unless you are wearing plates.
I am in central Ohio. Price is cash only to an 18 year old Ohio resident. I prefer CCW Licensee. If you have more questions please feel free to ask. I have a few extra mags I can sell as well.
Plate carrier, plates, AR mags, IFAK, camelbak, pouches and EOTech are not included.

This is not a numbers matching rifle but it is preety uncommon to find one that is. This rife was built after the mauser design but many will say it is a much better design and quality mainly because the reciever action uses a much stronger metal working process and is much sturdier and longer lasting. 

most will keep in the current configuration but this rifle is the platform for probably one of the best .308 sniper conversions.
