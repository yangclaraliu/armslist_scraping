The 2007 GP WASR-10/63 has an updated front trunnion with added contact support for the bolt carrier.
A WASR-10/63 with an under-folding stock was introduced into the product line in 2007.
As of 2008, there are GP WASR-10/63 rifles which are being made from demilled military rifles. Look for a triangle with arrow (some only have a triangle) on the front trunnion.

The Ruger 77/22 and the CZ 452 are along the lines of what I am looking for.  My preference would be as listed below:

1.  Barrel length of 20"" to about 24"".
2.  Walnut stock versus composite (for appearance only).
3.  Heavy barrel if possible.
4.  If clip fed, prefer a flush fit magazine.  Tubular magazine is fine.
5.  Chambered in .22 S, L, LR, not .17 HMR or .22 WMR.
6.  No indications of rust.
7.  A decent lever action such as the Marlin 39 is always a consideration

The above is the wish list, but I am very flexible depending on condition, price and configuration.

I do not want to spend in excess of $500 since I can pick up the Ruger or CZ models on-line for less than this even with the shipping and FFL costs.

Thanks for taking the time to read my run-on missive.  I figure the details would help get us on the same page without wasting a bunch of time.

Let me know what you have and let's see if we can work a deal."

A Dillon ""XL-950"" Progressive Shotshell loading press. It is equipped with the oversize shot hopper, standard powder hopper, instruction/owners manual, a bag of parts, and empty case feeder.  It is currently configured to run 12Ga. Shells.

Summary-
        I got the machine gently used, from an estate that I purchased, with the intention of setting it up to run 20Ga. shells. I currently have 2 other progressive shotshell presses that I'm using and they are running well.  So, I've never even set the Dillon up, nor have I ran it.  It's been in my shop (covered) for about a year, I'm tired of it being in the way.  

Description-
        Like I said, I've never ran the machine, I am familiar with Dillon loaders, I use a Square deal ""B"" for my handgun loads, the press appears to be complete, functional, and ready to load.  I'm sure if there is a part missing, or broken, Dillon will be HAPPY to replace it, as their customer service is stellar.  I've worked the handle, and indexed the machine, and appears to be running and in-time.  That's about the extent of my knowledge on this machine.

The Mosin–Nagant (Russian: ???????? ??????, ISO 9: Vintovka Mosina) is
a bolt-action, internal magazine fed, military rifle used by the armed
forces of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and various other
nations.

It gets its name from the Russian Artillery Colonel Sergei Ivanovich
Mosin who designed the bolt and receiver, and the Belgian Emile
Nagant, who designed the magazine system[1] Also known as the
Three-Line Rifle (???????????? ????????, Trëhlinejnaâ vintovka), in
reference to the 7.62 mm calibre, it was the first to use the
7.62x54mmR cartridge.

As a front-line rifle, the Mosin–Nagant served in various forms from
1891 until the 1960s in many Eastern European nations, when the sniper
rifle variant was replaced by the Dragunov sniper rifle (???????????
???????? ?????????, Snajperskaâ vintovka Dragunova), and because of
its ruggedness and the vast number produced is still in use in many
conflicts.

Initial design and trials
During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, Russian troops armed with
mostly Berdan single-shot rifles engaged Turks with Winchester
repeating rifles resulting in heavy casualties. This emphasized to
commanders a need to modernize the Imperial army. The Russian Main
Artillery Administration undertook the task of producing a
magazine-fed, multi-round weapon in 1882. After failing to adequately
modify the Berdan system to meet the requirements, a ""Special
Commission for the testing of Magazine fed Rifles"" was formed to test
new designs.

Sergei Ivanovich Mosin, a captain in the Imperial army, submitted his
""3-line"" calibre (.30 cal, 7.62 mm) rifle in 1889 alongside a 3.5-line
design by Léon Nagant (a Belgian) and a 3-line design by captain
Zinoviev. When trials concluded in 1891, the units which tested the
rifles were split in their decision. The main disadvantages of
Nagant's rifle were the following: more complicated mechanism, long
and tiresome procedure of disassembling (which required special
instruments - it was necessary to unscrew two screws). Mosin's rifle
was mainly criticised for lower quality of manufacture and of
materials used which resulted in a slightly larger number of
stoppages. The Commission voted 14 to 10 to approve Nagant's rifle.
However, the head of the commission, General Chagin, insisted on
subsequent trials held under the Commission's supervision during which
Mosin's rifle showed its advantages, leading to its selection over the
Nagant."

Its a full size 1911 clone chambered in, as far as I can tell, rare 40 S&W. (I can't find another 1911 in 40 S&W for less than $1000.) Its got rubber grips, blued with very little scratching or fading, and two Mec-Gar magazines. 

The pistol works perfectly. Hammer safety and back grip safety work flawlessly. Very strong rifling in the barrel. When I first got it, it was dirty and unloved. I gave it a good field strip cleaning, some light feedramp polishing, and its been a perfect shooter ever since. 200 rounds from me downrange, and no problems. Cleaned religiously after each range visit.

I also have a large amount of Federal 40 S&W ammo and Speer ammo that can be negotiated with the gun. It all depends on the offer.

I have no need for shotguns, hipoints, or anything non firearm related. No lowball offers either. This gun is worth at minimum $375. 

Will only do FTF and bill of sale even on trades. Its just the smart thing to do these days.
Thanks for viewing."

Comes with one Magpul 30 round magazine as seen in picture

Great gun that I put together and has had 20 rounds ran through it two weekends ago.

The following is info about the upper from the CMMG website

M4-LEP II Upper

Gas Piston systems operate cleaner then the direct gas impingement operating systems. With the piston system, the propellant gases that are being diverted at the gas block are now vented at the gas block, instead in the operating system of the upper receiver. Since the fouling from the gas system is not being vented in to the action of your firearm, it stays cooler and cleaner. Our system is designed around the short stroke piston operation. The piston pushes the anti tilt one piece carrier, which unlocks the bolt and allows the piston to return home while the bolt carrier continues to cycle independently.

The upper is built off of our standard forged A3 receiver with M4 feed ramps. The chrome plated gas piston is mounted in a solid one piece steel gas block attached to the barrel by pins. The Gas Block's 1913 Piccatinny rail is receiver height and requires a front sight designed to be mounted on the same plane as the rear sight. The dedicated, piston specific, anti-tilt bolt carrier is one piece, machined with the piston impingement key(not a bolt on). The carrier uses our standard Mil-Spec bolt. The barrel is our 4140 steel, M4 profile, 5.56mm chamber and bore, 1/9 twist ratio and 1/2x28 threaded barrel and our proprietary WASP surface treatment. The upper is finished with M4 handguard caps, M4 handguards and an A2 flash hider installed with a crush washer.

The piston gas block has a gas shut off setting for use with a suppressor to allow for maximum noise reduction. You must replace the crush washer with a peel washer if you plan to mount your suppressor on the original flash hider. Fits on any standard Mil-Spec lower receiver. All uppers have been factory head spaced and test fired. There are no upgrade options available with this model. Nickel Teflon bolt carriers are discontinued and now come with a phosphated carrier"

Weight: 3.72 kg empty
Magazine capacity: Accepts all M16/AR15 magazines, standard capacity 30 rounds
The M17s is a self-loading rifle, and thus cannot be classified as a true ""assault rifle"". Nevertheless it could make a very good paramilitary of home defense weapon; it is also good plinker and all-around compact rifle in .223 caliber, combining rifle-length barrel with carbine-style short overall length. 
The M17s rifle is gas operated weapon that uses short-stroke gas piston, located above the barrel. Locking is achieved by rotary bolt with seven lugs; bolt is hosted in massive Ar-18-style bolt carrier, which rides on dual guide rods."

Comes with warranty card, spent shell from factory, case, and 1 mag.
I have had it for less than a year. cleaned after every range trip. a pleasure to shoot. this will sell quicky"

Also known as a Romak-III, FPK, FPK Dragunov, and SSG-97.  This rifle is chambered for the very affordable yet very powerful 7.62x54R cartridge.  I bought this rifle through Century Arms International.  It is in the same condition as I received it.  I have fired exactly 190 rounds (19 full magazines) of Bulgarian light ball 147 grain corrosive surplus ammunition through this rifle.  I clean it immediately after firing every time I go to the range and I re-lubricate the entire rifle at least once a month regardless of use.

Rifle was capable of a 2 inch group at 100 yards out of the box.  I removed some wood from the inside of the front handguard to ""free float"" the barrel which improved the accuracy and consistency of the rifle.  This modification is NOT VISIBlLE from the exterior.  It is now capable of a 1.75 inch group in my hands though I'm not the best shooter.

I have been told that these rifles are no longer being imported.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  I just need the money.  If I didn't fall into financial restraints I would keep this rifle.  I've got plenty of ammo left over for it.
