With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

Great shooting gun.

Cosmetically:
Wood=90-95%
Receiver=75%
Barrel=Bore is very good...BLUEING IS VERY POOR

The wood on this gun is very good in my opinion.  The receiver has some wear in the blueing and a few very minor scratches.  

THE BARREL BLUEING IS VERY POOR.  Probably 50% gone.  Not sure how it got like that as it was like that when I got it but it almost looks like someone tried to clean it with the wrong stuff and it was removing the blueing.

""STRUCTURALLY"" and ""MECHANICALLY"" the barrel is 100%.

I HAVE MORE PICS FOR ANYONE INTERESTED.

Also have a Plano hard plastic case that will be included if you want it.

Asking $275 but will consider SERIOUS cash offers or possible trade: WOULD REALLY LIKE a .38 or .357 short barrelled revolver or will consider any handgun in trade with me adding cash as necessary...my gun plus $300 would probably be my limit.

It probably just sits there and nobody ever thinks much about anymore, what with all these new & exciting guns coming out every week.
 It's just so old fashioned and past tense, that you may as well just sell it.
 You know; the kind that ejects out i=of the bottom & spits hot brass down your sleeve as fast as you can pull the trigger.  (Ouch)!
 The kind that, if you don't like it, your options are severely limited as to add-ons (unlike many modern 'modular' designs). 
The gun that, when firing it, is actually pretty boring; as it just keep shootin' in the same ol' place. Time after time.
 The kind that has a nice shiny wooden stock, and if it got scratched you'd just hate yourself in the morning.
 You know, the ones with the scrolly little foo foo decorations on the receiver, that look like they belong on Great Grandma's locket or something?
 The rifle that's so small & light, that when you take it apart to clean it, you could easily misplace half of yer gun. 
Or worse yet; a few of those teensy little parts.
 Because...
 ... If you DO need parts for it in this day & age, ya may just as well try to buy another old Browning .22 takedown.
 Heck- If I ain't talked you out of the little troublemaker yet, get ahold of me fast, and at least give a guy a second chance! I might  have something you'd like even better; even if it's just cash. 
  What have you got to lose? The worst that could possibly happen is that you'd get to keep the darned thing.
 So hurry up before I change my mind....but I'm pretty stubborn- 
So you got that working for ya.

If you have a project that you will ""get to one day"" and haven't - I want to buy it. I'll use the parts to make another Winchester almost new again! In the medical field you could say that I do ""transplants"" to patients needing a new heart, lung or such. Your old Winchester will live again but in another body. Go now, to the fartherest corner of your shop and dig out that old, tired soldier and send it to me. I'll prepare it for surgery.
You'll be surprised how much I'll pay for it!!

It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian ﬁrearm. A total of over 6.5 million M1 carbines of various models were manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II. Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies : the largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but many others were made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and the Rock-Ola jukebox company. The Chiappa Firearms’ M1-22 is a rimﬁre replica of the M1 carbine, featuring a blowback system and an adjustable rear sight, which can be removed to leave guides free for optics mount. The barrel and bolt are made of solid steel, the trigger guard, stock and magazine of polymer. The 10 round magazine has a straight proﬁle like the original. The stock is interchangeable with the original; a wooden stock version and a black synthetic stock version are available."

What ive got here is an original WWII japanese officer saber, brought home during the occupation of Korea. This sword is unique due to its transition period between mid war to late war. The sword wears matching koshiare (fittings) of mid war style and all the numbers match. It's also rare to find a sword of this late war period to have a groved blade, and a very long sword tip (O kissaki). The picture does not show but the sword is currently wearing a set of original WWII leather saya cover also. The sword is unsigned but still unique and this is NOT a purely machine made blade like the ones you see on NCO sabers.

The bring back papers that came with the sword should considered icings on the cake! This sword comes with two sets of paper, one from the Sergeant's commanding officer and another from concerning the legality of the swords status as a war trophy, definately a unique piece of history and make you wonder what this sword went through during the war.

Again, i hate to sell this unique piece of histoyr but it is what it is, money is tight this holiday.

This rifle is accurate right out of the box, I have taped the ""dope"" for the scope (for accurate adjustments of windage and elevation) on the butt of the rifle for a quick reference guide when shooting distance in situations where speed counts. This rifle is also compatible (SAGE EBR IS NOT INCLUDED WITH THIS RIFLE) with the Sage International EBR or Enhanced Battle Rifle Stock for 750$ when you purchase it directly from Sage International.

TWO 1895 Russian Nagant Revolvers  in 7.62X38R.

The Nagant M1895 Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver).

They have been arsenal rebuilt to excellent condition and are still in the arsenal cosmoline.  An additional $20 was paid for each revolver at time of purchase for “hand select”.  These have ""shiny"" bores and are not the dark bore ""specials"" everyone has.

One is stamped 1945 and the other is stamped 1937.  Each revolver includes a holster and cleaning rod.

These revolvers belonged to my brother & me.  Due to my brother passed away I am selling both.

I am selling these revolvers for $225/each ($450/pair).  I prefer to sell as a pair and the price is not negotiable.

This gun has been gently used, primarily on pheasant for the last 4 years. It works, it's light, it holds 7 shells without the plug (1 + 6) when using 2 3/4"" shells. It has been carried and there is one scratch on the butttstock.

I bought a 20 ga Over/Under this year and the Tristar just sat in the safe. Time to pass it on.

Tristar is owned by Gus Bader and I bought the gun directly from him. He told me it is based on an expired Beretta patent semi-auto design and built in Turkey. It is basically an old Beretta semi-auto.

Recently came across this extremely unique, three barrel cap and ball pistol at a local collector's Estate Sale.  

As photos illustrate, this piece exhibits cosmetic signs of age & wear (barrels all have surface rusting).  Structurally, this hefty piece is still intact;  aside from minor damage to the small, upper corner of the wood grip, the overall condition of this vintage ""high-tech"" assault pistol is good.

While I have no means of testing this curiosity piece, a dry fire or two showed that the trigger travels smooth & snaps clean.  Action of Hammer functions cleanly too. Sorry, no maker's mark is evident, nor any indication of date. I have no additional information on it's history.

Clearly, I am offering this item on an ""AS IS"" basis and make no guarantees as to any operational safety issues that may arise from the unsafe or improper use of this item.

However, as a display-case Pirate, this is surely something that would stand out from the rest...

This is a steal at $800.00 for everything! Scope alone is $300.00 and all the ammo, dies, brass etc...I can't beleive it has not sold yet!

I am the second owner, first owner bagged three Elk with this rifle. He stated he scratched the original stock on one of the hunts. After that, he did not want to expose the stock anymore so he put the synthetic. I have only fired 5rds.

We are seller eagle-estates on that big auction site.  You can verify our feedback from buyers there.

You are perusing a very hard to get, still factory sealed, Oregon bourbon. This bottle is labeled Batch 0002, Bottle 0963. 

The back of the bottle reads in part:, ""On behalf of 4 Spirits Distillery, a portion of the proceeds from this bottle are invested in local reintegration and veterans programs to help, heal and educate our veterans and their families...

4 Spirits is a dedication to all the fallen soldiers in our armed services. What personally has become a mission....to never forget our fallen, particularly the four soldiers from Delta Co., 2-162 Infantry; has become a symbol for honoring our veterans and active duty service members across the country..."" 

Batch two is no longer available and in fact, the 4 Spirits Distillery is now bringing batch 6 to the Oregon market. 

This would make a fine and full addition to your rare and unique bourbon cabinet.  And if you aren't in the state of Oregon, you can't get this...unless you buy this one..grin...

Thank you for looking and from this veteran to all of you, thank you for your support.

excerpS from review By Dan Smith - genitron.com
September, 2005     

The CZ P-01 is the latest variation of the CZ 75 pistol made by this Czechoslovakian manufacturer. CZ has been producing this famous line of pistols since 1977, and in 2003 they introduced this newest model to the US. At first glance the P-01 could be mistaken for the CZ-75 Compact model, but there are a few significant differences.

First, they made metallurgical improvements to the hammer, barrel and slide in order to meet stringent requirements for use by the Czech National Police. Additionally, the frame is made from aluminum alloy rather than the steel frame used in traditional CZ 75 models. Finally, an accessory rail was added to the bottom of the frame to support a tactical light or laser sight. Also standard on this model are black checkered rubber grips, a black polycoat finish and a frame mounted decocking lever.

My initial interest in this gun was as a candidate for concealed carry. I had read articles that compared P-01's size to the Bersa 380, stating that is was a high capacity 9mm pistol hardly bigger than the Bersa. And while point measurements for height, width and length between the two may be similar, when I finally placed the two side-by-side, the CZ-P01 was noticeably bulkier than the Bersa. That being said, the P-01 is still a compact hi-cap design whose size and safety features make it more than adequate as a concealed carry weapon.
m alloy frame.


...The improvements to the P-01 therefore were more in engineering than in design; improved metallurgy, tighter manufacturing tolerances and weight reduction (alloy frame versus steel). Perhaps this is because the traditional CZ 75 design is so well done that it simply can't be improved upon. The P-01 is an elegant double-action pistol with great grip ergonomics, smooth trigger pull and well placed decocking lever.

The CZ 75 slide design is unique such that the slide rails ride internally to the frame rather than rapped externally over the frame. Because of this, the slide itself is slimmer and has less mass than conventional slide designs. This helps give the P-01 its compact profile.

The caliber -
The 9 mm Parabellum cartridge was created in 1902 by Georg Luger, who also sired the Parabellum pistol. This is a world standard, used and manufactured nearly everywhere.

The following data set is based on standard factory loaded cartridges fired from a 4"" barrel, listed by weight, brand, type and muzzle velocity. This is only a very small sample of what is available.

115 grain Fiocchi FMJ : 1250 Feet Per Second
123 grain Lapua JHP : 1165 Feet Per Second
124 grain Federal FMJ : 1110 Feet Per Second
125 grain Ultramax FMJ : 1100 Feet Per Second

Handgun Observations -
The matte black polycoat finish gives the gun the look of quality. The rubber grips are very comfortable and insure non-slip contact with the gun. The slide is tight and trim with virtually no rattle when shaken, although I got a slight rattle from the magazine housing after inserting loaded magazine.

There is no separate takedown lever on the gun. Instead, the slide lock lever provides this function. To take down the gun, the slide lock lever must be pushed completely out of the frame, which can't be done without using some kind of hard point tool to press against the lever's pivot pin. In the field you can use the the bottom front edge of an empty magazine to perform this task. ---

A +1 round can easily be placed in the chamber through the open breech. The slide is then released before inserting a loaded magazine. The decock lever does not have a safety position. When pressed, it simply drops the hammer to its half-cock position, and resets the trigger to double-action mode.

The low-profile design of the slide reduces the serrated grip area. Some complain that this makes racking the slide difficult. It is further aggravated by the gun's stiffer recoil spring which compensates for the slide's lighter mass. It does indeed require a strong grip in order to rack the slide, but nothing a little practice can't overcome.

Shooting -
The gun is very comfortable in the hand. Recoil is easy to manage. Double-action trigger pull is reasonable, and single-action pull is light, with only about a quarter inch of take-up before a smooth break

For those of you who don't know, the surefire 310r is a weaponlight that mounts to your 1911 without a rail.
I bought this from asia for the h10r housing to replace my old 310r body. They are identical in shape and quality. The bulb is not as bright as a regular light but you can change the lamp for another 3v one and it will work. All the parts are interchangeable with the real 310r as well.
The slide stop included cannot be used though but you can buy a new extended slide stop from urban advantage from their s.p.r.s system that WILL work.
I am only selling this because by the time the light got here from Hong Kong I already had a change of plans with my 1911. Shipping was expensive and it took a while to get here.
So, the housing is made of thick aluminum like the original and the bezel is the same size and threading. Just get a 3v lamp and slide stop pin then you have a real functioning 310r clone.
There is a hole on the body for those who want to add a remote switch and also two adjustable screws on the light to adjust it to fit your 1911.

Got this gun for my wife last year now she wants an upgrade. Selling to pay off her new lc9. Gun shoots great, did some trigger work to make shorter/smoother pull. Sights were hard to see so added white finger nail polish dots. We shot about 100 rounds through it this past summer. Great first gun, light recoil, easy to shoot and accurate at 25 yards. Parts for this gun are cheap on ebay if ever needed. Comes with 5 round mag, zipper case and holster all for $125.
