CZ-USA                       CZ 75 BD    

This model is a decocker version of the basic CZ 75 B model. The decocking
lever mounted on the left side allows the hammer to be easily lowered on a
loaded chamber for a safe ""hammer down"" carry. CZ 75 B is used by more
Governments, Militaries, Police and Security agencies than any other pistol
in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol. All steel
construction (except alloy framed compacts). High capacity double column
magazines. Hammer forged barrels. Ergonomic grip and controls. Unparallel
accuracy, slide-in-frame design for better recoil control, 3 dot sighting
system (Tritium night sights available). Smooth double action and crisp
single action.

I have decided to part ways with the shotgun as I have never shot it. I know Grandpa used it but I have not. It seems to be in good working order. It comes with two barrels. A 30"" full choke and a 26"" imp cyl with a vent rib. Both are original remington barrels in great condition. I can send more pics if you want them. Let me know if you have any questions."

This weapon has performed flawlessly since the day I got it. I have had about 500 rounds through it without a single malfunction, FTEject, FTFeed or FTFire. I have gone through the break-in period of using high brass but have yet to use any low-brass through it. Because of the modifications I'm almost certain with a tightening up of the adjustable gas plug (during use of low-brass) you can be able to go through a full 20-round drum of WallyWorld bulk pack or even worse WWB without a single problem. This is a serious killing machine with the reliability of the AK47 platform and the devastation and destruction of a 12 gauge shotgun. I have had to use it only in ONE instance against another persons (late-night robbery attempt) and the very sound of the bolt-carrier slamming home with a fresh round was enough to send the group scattering screaming ""he has a gun!"" This gun has been at the top of my current collection but it's time to sell it and move onto a different platform.

I am negotiable on the price but by very little. Finding a converted gun with so much extras is very difficult for such a solid price. Heck, just finding a Saiga-12 for sale in a gun shop is hard enough.

(Here is a description stolen from the website)

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

The only blemishes I can find on the metal would be in normal areas you'd see wear on any PSL/AK platform rifle. (Safety lever.) I was told that $1450 is more than reasonable since these are significantly raising in value. I also did some research myself and found that the rifle alone is a pretty penny. I looked up some of the magazines and on places like eBay, they ranged from $50.99 to about $90.00 a piece. The rifle also has the ""last round, bolt hold open"" feature. I was told it's common for this rifle, but in case it wasn't, I figured I'd mention it.

The gun was rebuilt in 2007 using Israeli parts and specs and was also turned into a Semi-Auto. the gun has had 500 rounds through it and runs flawlessly. The gun comes with (1) 100 round belt cloth and 50 rounds of ammo (40 tracer) and 10 ball. I will take 1500 cash and the rest in trade for other guns.

Glock has decided to release a limited number of Flat Dark Earth framed pistols of its more popular service models. This is a G23 gen 4 pistol chambered in .40 S&W. This model is by far the most used in Glock's lineup, and is very common with civilian shooters due to its light weight, accuracy, high capacity, and legendary reliability. These limited edition Glocks won't last long, so if you've been considering a reliable pistol for competition shooting or self defense, it wouldn't be a bad idea to snatch up one of these limited edition pistols. 

Fired only 50 rounds and functions flawlessly. I am selling it because I do not like the compact grip of the frame, I prefer the full size duty pistol (Glock 22). Gun has been detailed stripped, cleaned, and lubed. Still looks brand new!

Comes with original case, 3 - 13 round magazines, interchangeable back straps, speed loader, gun lock, cleaning brush, and papers.

I paid $569.99 + tax for it, after taxes is $622. I am willing to sale for 
$575 - firm. 

I will consider trading for a brand new Glock 22 Gen 4, must come with 3 - 15 round magazines and recent production model (2012). Manufactured date can be found on the spent test cartridge envelope."

I'm pretty open minded as far as trades for handguns go.

I bought the gun new from Thunderbird a year or two ago when they first came out. This Rhino 200DS is #29 out of the factory.

I had an issue with the spent shells coming out and sent it back to the factory and haven't had any issues since. I was going to send it back in for a lighter trigger job, but never got around to it. ($100 for lighter trigger)

The gun shoots great and handles .357 magnum extremely well. It's very accurate and fun as hell to shoot.

The gun would come with everything as if new. Holster, box, manual, etc. etc. The leather holster does show wear on it but is still in good shape. If I had to put a price on it, I would ask $700, but would much rather trade. Also have several boxes of RAM .357 ammo that would go with it, and a box of .38 special. I also may have some defense ammo in the closet.

The gun functions flawlessly, and has a nice solid action. Its broken in, but not worn out at all. Has a new extractor also. 

It is a 5+1 capacity magazine, and I have a wooden dowel that you slide in to make it 2+1 for hunting anything with feathers.

2. 25 inch ""Slugster"" barrel with adjustable rifle sights on it.

944,http://www.armslist.com/posts/383944,For Sale:  BladeTech Duty Holster for Glock 19or23 w/TRL2 attachment,"Gilbert, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 70,"Listed On: Saturday, April 28, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a brand new BladeTech holster for the Glock 19 or 23 with TRL2/TRL2s light/laser attachment (will not fit any other light models). The gun will fit in the holster WITH OR WITHOUT the light attached to the weapon. It is made with upgraded carbon fiber and has the Tek-Lok for easy taking on or off without removing your belt. It can adjust to most common belt widths. It has the ""Weapon Retention System"" which is a latch that will lock your gun in the holster and can be removed easily for a fast draw with a quick press of the thumb latch. I paid $129.99 + $10 shipping for this awesome holster. It is a really good holster and the only reason why I'm selling it is because I bought it for my wife (who is really tiny and petite) and this holster is just to big for her and I have no use for it because I have a Glock 30 which will not fit. It is brand new and not even been taken outside or even used. If you live out of state I will ship it for FREE! Here is the website where you can see the video on how the holster weapon retention system works-

Buyer must have a valid wisconsin concealed carry license and a valid photo state of Wisconsin photo ID and sign a bill of sale for my records. 

Price is 250 firm cash, face to face sale in Green Bay only, I will not travel anywhere outside Green Bay for any reason. If you think you can get it cheaper online or somewhere else, then dont waste my time. I will not be low balled and I am firm on the 250! I dont need to sell, but would like the cash to pay for the other half of the glock I have my eyes on. And I feel the price is fair considering I paid 250 all together for the gun itself at a near by gun shop, will provide the original reciept for the gun. And the 100 I paid for both holsters combined both of which only used a 2 times each. Will not sperate the gun from the holsters as they where bought just for the 45 and is to big for my other pistols.
