I have here a Sig Sauer P250 Compact semi-automatic handgun in .40 S&W.
I've enjoyed the piece, but I need to sell it in order to fund my AR15 build.

I've put less than 1,000 rounds through this piece, and it is in great shape. It has some typical barrel wear but no major exterior blemishes. All internals were cleaned after every range session.

If you're not familiar, the P250 series was developed by Sig Sauer to have an Interchangeable Polymer Shell and Interchangeable Barrel/Caliber. It's an interesting concept, and I'd recommend you look it up if you're interested but not already familiar.

This P250 (pictured in the image) will come with One (1) 13 Round Magazine, a Sig Sauer black box, and the original Instruction Manual.

I also have for sale Two (2) additional 13 Round Magazines, a Sig Sauer Roto- Paddle Holster and a Sig Sauer Dual-Mag Holster.

If interested, I will sell the entire package (everything listed above: gun, 3 mags, holster, mag holster, etc) for $475. And with that, I'll even throw in 20 rounds of Federal 135 Grain Hydra-Shok Self Defense ammo.

This rifle set was only made available to members of the Midway USA Scholastic Shooting Trust for fundraising. Only 100 sets were produced. Proceeds from this sale will go directly to the Bishop Dwenger Rifle Team, a new team with aspirations of building an indoor shooting sports facility capable of hosting international level events. Midway has asked that proceeds from these rifles net $10,000. Midway will in turn donate another $30,000 to the Bishop Dwenger Rifle Team.
No other rifle holds the power and the mystique of the legendary Winchester Model 70 Super Grade – the ultimate expression of the Rifleman’s Rifle. For the first time ever, The Midway Foundation is proud to offer a matching set of four truly unique limited production Winchester Model 70 Super Grade rifles, each of which is chambered in a cartridge that’s ideal for the game animals they commemorate, and is so marked on the magazine floorplate. The Varmint rifle is chambered in the blistering 22-250 Remington, the Deer/Antelope in the flat shooting 270 Winchester, the Elk/Moose in the potent 300 Winchester Magnum and the Dangerous Game rifle in the bore crushing 375 H&H Magnum. All of the classic Model 70 Super Grade features are present – the fancy grade checkered walnut stock with shadowline cheeckpiece and ebony fore-end tip, the engraved crossbolt head and the traditional Super Grade pistol grip cap. Each of these beautiful rifles is built with the Pre-’64 style action that offers a forged steel receiver, massive external claw extractor, controlled round feeding and reliable blade ejection."

Product Information

4th Generation
30-Round Capacity
High visibility indicator in MagLevel window shows rounds remaining in mag
Anti-Tilt Follower and Stainless Steel Spring Impact cover stores on bottom of magazine (with standard floorplates)
Slim body ribs for snag free use in double and triple mag pouches
Accepts PMag Ranger Plates and PMag Maritime Floor Plates
Available in Black, Flat Dark Earth, Foliage Green and Olive Drab

The MagPul Gen 4 MagLevel PMag is constructed from advanced polymers with superior impact resistance and light weight. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for improved feeding. An anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding. The textured magazine body and flared floorplate improved handling over standard magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt with a full 30 rounds, unlike standard magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The snap-on impact cover protects the feed lips from impacts and debris while in storage. The impact cover also allows loaded magazines to be stored long-term (over 1 year) without compromising the integrity of the feed lips. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using the impact cover or simple punch for cleaning and maintenance. The magazine will accept PMag accessories, such as Maritime floor Plates and PMag Ranger Plates. Available in four molded-in colors, Black, Flat Dark Earth, Foliage Green and Olive Drab.

The MagLevel features two clear windows molded into the magazine body, and a specific coil of the mag spring painted orange to indicate the round count. When the mag is fully loaded the brass cartridges are visible, when there are 25-rounds remaining the Round Indicator will become visible, tracking the rounds down to zero. The mag body has 25, 15, and 5 molded in to correspond with the MagLevel Indicator. The indicator allows you to see the round count while the mag is locked in the weapon, something that is not possible with transparent mags on the market."

 This gun is used but in truly excellent condition, and there are NO issues. Just light wear that you'd expect on a 50 yr. old adult owned fine shotgun.
 This shotgun is chambered for the 3"" 20 ga. shells, and has the original plastic butt plate. The receiver is fully engraved and it is very similar in style, quality & looks to the old Belgian Browning Superposed I had as a kid.
 It's a nice light gun, & points wonderfully.
 If you are interested in the gun I will send detailed specs & photos. If you are still reading this; then you know what this shotgun is & will not be at all disappointed.
 I am also willing to trade for silver, or other interesting guns."

The gun has all of the features and then some that you could want in a custom 1911 especially if your planning on carrying it. The whole gun has Kimbers Carry Melt treatment done to it which is where someone in there custom shop sits there and pain stakingly rounds and smooths over every single edge, corner or part that could snag on your clothes. The slide is stainless in the raw and the lower is aluminium with Kimbers charcoal Gray KimPro finish on it. Its got Meprolight night sights that are still very very bright. The gun is completely stock and as it came out of the Kimber Custom Shop to my FFL. It's had less than 75 rounds through it, probably more like 40-50 but I can't be sure. There are no real scratches, just a few slight buffs from the holster plus there aren't any dings. If you have further questions about the features of the gun you can find all the answers at http://www.kimberamerica.com/1911/cdp-ii/ultra-cdp-ii. You can also feel free to either contact me on here (Armslist) or email me directly at bascom.matt @ yahoo. If anyone would rather talk in person or text me my cell phone number is 5four0 -2one9 -0three8three. If i dont answer please leave me a message or text and ill get right back to you. Gun will come with one 7 round Kimber magazine, leather OWB holster and the original case minus the manual and other papers. To tie it all up this is one great gun in great shape and a low price to help it find a new home a little easier. I love the gun but my needs have changed to where I would rather have a full size something. Im willing to listen to any offer thats not insane and im always open to trading, wheeling and dealing to make everyone happy."

For sale is a Spanish ruby contract pistol manufactured for the French for trench warfare. There are no import marks, so it appears to be a bring back. Manufactured by Gabilandos, which was the prime contractor of the Ruby. Shows all the signs of heavy trench use. Pistol is pitted, with a light patina. There is a decent amount of bluing left. It has been completely disassembled and dipped to prevent further pitting. At this point, it's more of a display piece and very occasional shooter. These were infamous for being just as dangerous to the person behind the gun as it was to those who it was pointed at. Add 100 years of aging to that. It had feed issues the one time I fired it, but I found out it had the wrong magazine. I have since sourced the correct one."

This is an older model, made better in my opinion than the other Winchester I have from the same period in time. I would give it 85-90 percent condition with only 1 small scratch on the wood stock. Gun has double checkered wood stock in good condition, bluing is great! 

It will come with a hard black case, sling, some black bear hollow point ammo x 6, both raised and lowered scope mount [to be able to use iron sights then pop up to scope], also comes with the mounting hardware for just about any scope. May include an extra mount or set of rings and a Barska hi-powered scope for $400 total....But the $325 is pretty firm on the low side. If you have a Walther P22, or GSG5 I would like to trade asap, any others I'm sure we can work something out. I also have a Desktop computer to throw in with a 17"" flat-panel monitor to sweeten a deal if your trade comes in a bit on the high-side of my asking price."
757,http://www.armslist.com/posts/659757,For Sale:  Full Size and Compact Green Gas/Propane Blowback Training Glocks For Sale,"North, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 85,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 13, 2012",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have two KWA metal slide blowback airsoft pistols for sale. 
First up is a G17(Fullsize).  It is all black and has a very nice stippled frame but has a few chips in the paint on the slide.  Repainting wouldn't take a second with a decent black spray paint.
Second is a G23(Compact) with a painted OD green frame.
These are great training aids because they fit in basically every accessory designed for each specific model and have a similar(unloaded) weight.  It should also go without saying that since they are airsoft, the side affects of being shot are much less severe and long lasting as the real thing, such as death.
I would prefer a face to face sale in Knoxville but I will ship for actual shipping costs and will only accept PayPal as payment.  I think I can get them both in the $5.35 small flat rate box.
My lowest price is $85 for either one or $160 for them both and I can not take any trades at this time.  I only have one magazine that fits so only the first to sale will come with the magazine.

COMPLETE UPPER
This DPMS LR-308 SST Upper Receiver Assembly comes completely assembled and ready for installation on any compatible lower receiver. This upper configuration has the distinction of being the first model DPMS produced to introduce their new LR-308 to the world. It is the Original LR-308 and the launch pad from which an entire genre of rifles have been spawned, quickly growing in popularity to the point that the LR-308 family is considered the current industry standard for large caliber, AR-pattern firearms.

The assembly's foundation is a thick walled, slick-side Flat-Top Upper Receiver constructed from extruded 7029-T6 Aluminum. The slick sided upper's sleek profile eliminates the conventional forward assist, case deflector and dust cover, while its Flat-Top Picatinny Rail is raised high above the bore line to allow clearance for the large objective lenses in use on modern high magnification rifle scopes. The 24"" Stainless Steel Bull Barrel wrings maximum velocity out of the 308 Winchester cartridge, while a Free Floating Aluminum Handguard isolates the barrel from outside influences that could have a negative impact on accuracy. The upper comes complete and ready to fire with a recessed target crown at the muzzle, single rail gas block, bolt carrier group and charging handle.

Minor driver's door wrinkles from getting body checked by a three point buck. The buck walked away with minor bruises. There is also a dent under the passenger side of the front bumper that is visible in the picture.

The factory says this is burgundy, but in the sunlight it looks more like root beer metal flake. The car looks darker in the picture as it was raining just before I took the shots. I guess it will look darker about ten months out of the year around here, huh? The interior is tan and only really shows wear in the driver's seat; I never had many passengers. Four door. Automatic transmission. It has power windows and door locks, power steering, tilt wheel, power adjust driver's seat, air conditioning, cruise control, defrosters on the rear window and mirrors, alarm system and a factory stereo with a six disc CD changer in the trunk. Alloy wheels and Les Schwab tires. The tags were renewed last month and will be good till September of 2014. I bought the CarFax report and will be able to show you the service history that way.

I bought this recently but cant seem to find a good holster i like and my hands are too small to fit comfortably. I recommend this for a person with medium to large hands because the grip is failry big as most Beretta handguns are. I really like it, i wish my hands were bigger its in excellent shape and for anyone who does their research will see these are accurate and very reliable.
It also has the metal recoil rod i believe its an upgrade the original from what i have read were plastic.

The 7.65 or .32 Auto Round is a more effective penetrator than its larger .380 sibling. The .32 and .380 both go about 850 fps out of a short barrel, and the .380 only outweighs the smaller round 85 grains to 71 grains. .32 ACP will always come nearer penetrating resistant surfaces, take windshields for example."
