A rifle from the Nepal cache of arms sold by IMA and Atlanta Cutlery. Chambered for the 577-450 martini henry black powder cartridge. Most of the original blueing is intact, though rust has been at work on the rifle. Some deep pitting below the wood line, but nothing significant from a safety standpoint. Light pitting elsewhere on the metal. and browning of the blueing in other places. Wodd shows age and a good deal of use with some repairs on the butt stock. There was some dry rot that was removed from the buttstock and as a result the wood does not head up flush with the reciever. Significant pitting on the stock fore end hook, and a replacement screw. Slight bend in the cleaning rod. The gun is complete and has been restored to working order. Functions fine and shoots, though not incredibly accurate and hits to the right for me. Bore is in accpetable condition with plenty of rifling and even a little shine. Internals are clean. Lots of British proof marks and Nepalese unit markings on the trigger guard. Ammunition is available for this rifle but VERY expensive. Equipment and components for reloading are readily available and cases can be formed from 24 ga. shotshell brass at a significant reduction in cost but not function. Best reloaded with black powder, but many people have had success with reduced smokeless loads and trail boss loads. A very cool British historical arm in great working condition at 124 years old.

Comes also with three Grips.Wood, Hogue Rubber and orginal straight strap factory grip. Bought this from a collector a while ago and have put around 300 rounds thru it. 
I hope to be respectful to my potential buyers and be treated the same. If you look these up on gunbroker they simply dont exist. There were only a little over 5000 of these made and I hear they are more rare then the 1076 FBI model. Anyways since I am guessing collectors only will be interested you will know how rare this pistol is. With the rarity and value going up every year I am fairly firm on price but I will negotiate and will take best reasonable offer. I have a job offer coming up so I will not take 600 dollars for it. Also on the smith and wesson forum a guy is making custom barrels for these so 357 sig and 40 cal barrels will be available again like they were years ago from barsto so this to me makes this gun even more worthy and a praised item.

Both are in wonderful condition and have been kept very clean/ oiled by me. Both are great shooters.

The Makarov is in great condition, showing only minor wear to the side of the safety and little to no holster wear. It was likely never carried. It has red commie grips with lanyard loop and comes with 2 magazines, original Cold War duty holster, 2 IWB holsters, 5 snap caps (when they finally come in the mail), 25 rounds of Hornady hollow point, 50 rounds of American Eagle FMJ, and 50 rounds of Privi Partisan FMJ. Ridiculously accurate.

The Mosin Nagant has all major matching numbers, 99% bluing, near perfect bore, cleaning rod and comes with repro cleaning kit, padded canvas case, 2 ammo pouches, 20 stripper clips, cartridge buttstock holder, recoil buttpad, 40 rounds of Winchester softpoint and 20 rounds of Winchester FMJ. Would make an incredibly stout hunting rifle.

I would be willing to trade all of this for a good condition Glock 17, 19 (preferred), 22, 23, or 1911 or sell for $400 obo and would like to keep as a pair to simplify the process. Other trade suggestions will be considered. All of this is worth well over $500; I'm simply looking for a more popular caliber for shooting competitions and general practice.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

I have them coming in from S&W, so I will mail them to the buyer when I receive them. I've put about 100 rounds through it. Very accurate, and very ergonomic.

There are a couple of small issues with it that I've included in the pics. First there are some scuffs inside the trigger guard. Doesn't affect the frame, or trigger operation.

Second, I have had the takedown lever develop rust after carrying it for about 4 days straight in the heat. All the other parts were covered in sweat, but absolutely no corrosion. Only on the takedown lever, and it wiped off with a paper towel & CLP. There is no pitting on it at all. A new takedown lever is $5 from Brownells, or you can just wipe it down.

Included is a horsehide/kydexholster for the M&P. The holster is incredible, and is extremely comfortable.

Problem is that they guy e-mailing me is selling something far different than what I'm asking for, and seems oblivious to it. He's also saying he's from California, which considering the law of that state, makes this all the more unusual. Here is a copy of what he's e-mailed me.

The 1st picture is his first response to me. Notice though, he sent it twice. I think it's kind of weird.

2nd picture is my response. I thought maybe he missed the part about me not wanting the whole rifle.

3rd picture is where I get suspicious. The guy says it has the ""original holster"" (for a bullpup?), he lives in CALIFORNIA (gun is not legal and he cannot ship that out of state even if it was), and he's willing to ship (no mention of an FFL!).

Okay, so now for what I always say in my WTB ads...

I am very up on the prices of guns and what they go for new and used... So that being said, when you contact me about a firearm don't expect me to pay new price for your used gun... Also, just because you didn't do your research and overpaid for the gun, or got ripped off at a local shop like H&H or Gun World, don't expect me to pay for your mistake... I am not trying to sound rude, but anytime I post wanting to buy a gun I get toms of people asking outrageous prices...

Carbon build up and powder residue are prevented from fouling the Upper Receiver - a superior operating system.

693,http://www.armslist.com/posts/129693,For Sale:  Custom Spyder Imagine Setup,"Fountain/Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 250,"Listed On: Monday, May 2, 2011",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a Spyder Imagine I built 4 years ago. I do not play any paintball these days, so this setup is now for sale. It started as a stock Spyder Imagine, and then I added a lot to it. I'll try to include everything, but I may miss something along the way. All the accessories (with some descriptions) are listed along with prices that I paid: 

-Spyder Imagine 200 
-Apex BT47 Barrel 80: This will fit any Spyder or Kingman threaded guns. This is the BT Designs barrel to mock the AK-47 barrel for paintball use. It also has the Apex barrel so it can be adjusted to shoot ""around"" corners, dive, or climb with the turn of the barrel or sliding the switch on top. You can find all the info if you put ""BT47 Apex Spyder"" on an internet search engine. I only put about 200 rounds through, then the gun went into storage. Barrel comes with Apex barrel sleeve. 
-Smoked Halo Hopper w/ Rip Drive 120: Halo B hopper with Rip Drive, smoked plastic housing, and rechargeable battery pack. Hopper works flawlessly. There is some small cracks toward the neck of the hopper, but doesn't affect the performance of the feeding system. Comes with a rechargeable battery pack (includes charging cord with led charge indicator) that was one of the best investments with this hopper because no need to fill up the battery tray with AA batteries, which saved a lot of money. I will include the original battery tray and original box, too. I will throw in the extra Halo black derin drive cone. 
-RAP4 3 Position Stock 80: This was a great stock for the time I had it. The only small thing that I found out is it is a little shakey, but this didn't affect the use of the stock at all. Screw to hold onto marker is lock-tite on to prevent falling out. 
-Fenix Trigger 100: It performed great with the Kingman Delrin Anti-Chop bolt (which is included in the sale). Has all the shot burst and full auto features like the usual, but I was a lot faster on manual trigger. The dual sensors make this trigger very fast. Definitely was one of the best features of my paintball gun when I played. Also I am throwing in a free set of Dye Stick Grips that are already installed on the trigger frame. These were much comfortable than the stock grips. Also comes with 2 cords for charging, just in case one gets lost or breaks. 
-Kingman ACS Bolt 25 
-Expansions Chamber 40 
-Drop Forward 25 
-Low Rise Feed Neck 20 
-Lapco Dual Rail System 35 
-Red Dot Laser w/ Rail Mounts 15 
-9 LED Flash Light w/ Rail Mounts 15 
-Air Tank Gauge 20 
-Halo Rechargeable Battery Pack 45 
-Compressed Air Tank with Neoprene Cover 65 (Needs new pressure test on it) 
-Rare 8 Inch Barrel 40: It is 8"" in length, which was great for close quarter paintball fields. It performed great when I was using it. Haven't been able to find this barrel for awhile. 
-Spring Kits 25: One is a 32 Degrees kit and the others are from Kingman. Go through them all and see which one you like most. 
Blitz Practice Barrel 35: Blitz practice barrel for Spyder/Kingman paintball markers. It is insulated with foam and is capped off at the end so you can dry-fire in a house without all the noise. Do not use with paintballs!!! It was great for tuning or seeing what springs or bolts to go with. Was a must have for small rooms or apartments. 
- 6+1 Belt & Hose Remote Relocate Kit 70: 6+1 Paintball pack that holds 6 tubes (which I'll throw in for free) and room for a tank. Also, comes with a coil remote hose kit that I used on my Spyder when I played. Hose was checked a couple of days ago and no leaks were found. Pack is a little dirty but that the only thing ""bad"" but everything works just fine. 
-Volumizer 20 
-Other random parts: There is a Shocktech trigger, an Evil Valve Kit, 3 bolts (1 delrin), and low rise feedneck clamp style (so no more loose hoppers and lowered the hopper about an inch). 

May have missed some accessories, but that's all I can think of now. I did test fire this paintball gun a couple weeks ago with the practice barrel (so didn’t put any paint through it), but it ran flawless and didn’t leak any air. I also have a bag to hold most of the accessories that I’ll throw in for free along with some other spare parts. I spent over $1200 on this setup, and I am very firm on the price. I have most of the original Imagine parts minus the stock Spyder Imagine E-Trigger. Please e-mail if you have any questions. I'll try to get back ASAP. I can send pictures of requested parts of the gun, too. I tried parting this out, but no takers so this sale is for the complete package. But you could buy the whole package and sell what you don't need. Thanks again!

Trades considered is a Gen 2/3 Glock 23/27 or Taurus 94 22lr 5"" Stainless Steel. Or let me know what you have and I'll consider it, worst I can do is politely decline. Thanks!"

Chambered for 40 s&w.  This gun is basically brand new.  Bought it at 5280 Armory and have only put 200 rounds through it.  I still have the boxes of ammo since my intention was to keep accurate count .  Pretty much I'm selling this for less then what I paid for it, and you get to save on taxes and I'll throw in 200 rounds of ammo since I won't be needing it anymore, so basically I'm saving you around  100 bucks. On a brand new gun.    

There is not a scratch on this thing; it comes with the standard package that the new XDms come with.  Two mags, speed loader, holster, mag holder, 3 different size grips, lock , bore brush, and a great case.  Of course I have all the paperwork that accompanies this as it is still brand new.   I have the original box that this thing came with as well as the original documentation.  Make me a reasonable offer please.  

I have never used ARMSLIST before, but serious inquiries only, and obviously only if you can legally own/purchase a firearm.  Found out that roughly the FFL fees for shipping are around $30.00, so if you are not in Colorado, think about that.    

Please let me know if you have any questions, email first, then we can talk or meet if you would like to look at the XDm

I have a buddy who has this model and carries it every day.  He has an inexpensive in-the-waistband Desanti leather holster he got off of Midway for $15 that he explains is very comfortable.  He also simply pocket carries when the occasion presents itself.  He had a single stack, slim 9mm (Ruger LC9, Kahr PM9, Keltec PF9) and actually prefers the snub-nosed 38 over those slim 9mm's.  You know when you pull the trigger on a loaded Smith and Wesson revolver, it goes boom.  Very simple to use, point and pull, which makes it an ideal handgun for inexperienced shooters.

UPDATE:  This same buddy of mine has given me a Blackhawk CQC Holster to sell along with this 442.  He thought out-of-the-waistband was going to be even more comfortable than the Desanti but decided to stick with in-the-waistband.  So, a new, unfired Smith and Wesson 442 with Blackhawk holster for $400"

There have beenn 300 rounds exactly fired through this rifle.  20 more rounds will be fired today.  Here is my issue and possibly why I want to sell/trade this.  I am a left handed shooter.  The brass goes down my shirt or hits my face.  I just installed a brass deflector I purchased from brownells.  That the reason for the firing of the rifle today.

Anything you want to offer may be considered.  No Hi Points or Shotguns or Taurus (except the Judge)
If trading for another AR or .223 I may keep accessories and/or ammo.  We would have to work out details. The Ruger rifles should be the models with the places for scope rings.  Im not interested in the older models that need to be drilled and tapped. Also, Im not all that interested in XD.  Not a bad gun by anymeans, just I would rather have Glock.  Send it my way if you want to, you just never know.  Especially if it is a XD357. 

This rifle willbe cleaned on arrival at home later today and has been after every outing. I will delete this post by dark if I decide to keep it. This will be a FTF transaction.

867,http://www.armslist.com/posts/129867,For Sale:  6.5 Grendel AR-15,"Minocqua, Northern WI, Wisconsin","$ 1,400","Listed On: Thursday, April 28, 2011",Rifles,no type,no type,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is my AR-15 in 6.5 Grendel caliber. I purchased the upper already built from a seller on gunbroker.com. The upper is a Sun Devil with a smooth black finish as opposed to the andonized finish typical on Sun Devil uppers. The seller told me the barrel is a Lothar-Walther, as is the bolt. I was told round count was under 200; I added another 75 rounds. The barrel was originally threaded for a muzzle break, but he had the threads cut off and the barrel re-crowned by a gunsmith. Hence, the barrel has a slight swell at the muzzle. The handguard is carbon-fiber and beautifully done. I purchased a Y/M National Match chrome bolt carrier group and a DPMS charging handle to complete the upper. I built the lower using a new black andonized Sun Devil lower with their tensioning screw. The buttstock and buffer are DPMS. The trigger is a Timney 3 lb single stage solid held in place by KNS 2nd generation non-rotating stainless trigger pins. The bolt latch, magazine latch and detent pins are DPMS. The grip is a Stark with integral trigger guard (built for bigger hands). Included in the package are: three C-Products 6.5 Grendel clips (one 10 shot stainless and two 20 shot black); 200 pieces of Alexander Arms/Lapua brass (approx. 75 once-fired; remainder new); Forester Ultra two-die set (full-length sizing die and ultra-micrometer seating die); and bullets (140g Hornady A-Max, 129g Hornady SST, 108g Lapua Scenar and 123g Lapua Scenar – each box has at least 75 bullets). 

The rifle shoots very well. My first test loads were 129g SSTs and 123g Scenars over Varget. Groups were 1-1.25”. When I was planning this rifle, I called a gentleman who had some Grendel things for sale. In talking, he told me he was involved in development of the 6.5 Grendel – foolishly, I did not write his name down, nor do I remember it. Anyway, he said the load which performed best in this caliber was 108g Scenars over Vihtavuori N133. I finished the build a few months ago and finally found some Vihtavuori N133 two weeks ago. The results of the first three shots from a cold barrel at 100 yards was a ""cloverleaf."" Follow-up groups were equally impressive (I have photos).

My total investment in this rifle is right around $1900.00. I’d like to get $1600.00 shipped to your FFL. The scope in the picture is a 30mm Pentax Lightseeker 8-32X50 mounted in Burris Signature high rings. For $2,000.00 you can have everything.

If you have any questions, please PM me and I will give you my cell number to call – I prefer talking to typing, although you might not guess it from this post. I have numerous close-ups of this rifle and its various components I’d be happy to email to you."
