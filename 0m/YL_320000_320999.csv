Not gonna hold for anyone. If you have the money, you get it right there...You don't come across these types of ammo every day. Some people don't understand that these are Military rounds...NOT store bought brand you can get ""on-line""..The military takes time to weigh, count and weigh again and agian so these rounds are made perfect so that each and every shot counts. factories don't do that..they have machines do that for them. Weigh the grams of powder and SLAM the bullet right on top of the casings. I should know this because.......my brother was the one who put these very rounds together. Any other questions or ideas??? Once again..these rounds were made for military use...NOT for sevillians on the streets. These rounds are perfect, will shoot perfect and will be a waist if you were to shoot some dumb ass pumpkins, watermellons or pieces of shit paper!! SO, Military?? Store bought?? Military??? Store bought???...Hmmm...I wonder which one will be better to use if i were to take a one and one-quarter mile shot at cha?? Lets see who can hit who first with a 30-06 round...My brother?? or you???

I have shot it out to 1000 and it shot sub MOA with factory crap ammo.  So, down to the specs.  It is a Fisher action they use for their benchrest guns; which is a single shot.  It has the Jewell trigger and set to where I like it (about 2lbs, maybe a little less).  It has the McMillan BR muzzle brake which is awesome for recoil without blowing all the sand and dirt all over you.  It has the 20 MOA base on it as well.  Being that I had no intention of shooting it off the bench, I had them install the ""Tac-50"" stock on it so it breaks down and fits in a Pelican a little easier and also allows the use of their steel bipod.  Also, if you want to mess with your buddies, tell them they can shoot a 50BMG pistol.  HA!!  Kidding.  Don't do that... if you do, video it.

This is the loading and unloading of it (sorry about the broken finger and one handed camera work): http://youtu.be/tpR3aRZ6gwA

So, essentially the rifle is:
http://mcmillanusa.com/mcmillan-rifles-competition-50lbr.php

The Stock and bipod are shown here on the Tac-50:
http://mcmillanusa.com/mcmillan-rifles-tactical-tac-50.php

Scope:
http://www.opticsplanet.net/custom-leupold-mark-4-6-5-20x50mm-lr-t-m1-illuminated-reticle-rifle-scope.html

I was going to sell it without the scope for $4k.  That is the no-haggle, no BS price.  The bench gun goes for $7500 new, the Tac-50 for $8k, so $4k is a steal.  I do have a Leupold Mark 4 6.5-20x50 LRT M1 illuminated TMR for it in Mark 4 rings that I would let go with it for half of retail (retail is $1479.99) and throw in the rings for free and the lens covers (shown in the pics) as well as the ballistic tape on there (with no markings on it).  

As you can see, I have the ballistic data on the side out to 1300 yards.  That can easily be removed and put onto the ballistic tape (on the scope) or a custom dial made by Leupold's custom shop.  Easily enough.

So $4k for the rifle alone, or $4740 with the scope, rings, etc."

It does have a replacement stock that came from the same weapons cache and this stock is dated to around 1900.  The firearm itself made the trip from England to Africa and may have seen action in the Zulu and Boer Wars.  These rifles were then transported to India and kept at the Ft William Arsenal until Britain gifted them to Nepal.   They were used by Nepal until being stockpiled and stored for nearly 80 years.  

 This rifle is has all British proof marks as well as Nepalese marks.  The bore is super shiny and smooth.  This is the nicest example of a Nepal Cache rifle as I have ever seen.  It shoots well too!  I have taken two deer with this rifle and hate to part with it but I have to fund another firearm venture.   I meticulously cleaned and preserved this rifle and it really is a beauty.  

I am included around 20 rounds of ammunition, bayonet, a British leather bandolier and a Victorian pith helmet for a proper display of this piece of history.   
Cash transaction, trades considered.   Thanks!

180,http://www.armslist.com/posts/320180,For Sale:  Russian Side Mount PK-AS Red Dot Collimator Sight,"Hastings, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 200,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 28, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a like new Russian PK-AS Red Dot Sight.  if you have an AK style rifle with the side mount, you need this sight.   It retails for $350 from Kalinka Optics.   The cool thing about this sight is that the site works without turing on the red dot.  There is a black donut ring and dot in the sight.  The dot turns red when the turned on.  It takes common watch batteries (two D-357 batteries) and has 50 hours of continuous life.  

Here are some more specifications: 
The PK-AS, an advanced version of the PKS-01, is the newest in tactical optics designed specifically for the combat operations of the Russian Special Forces. You will find it on the elite units of the Russian MVD; police, Spetznaz, OMON and others. State-of-the-art technology makes it the premier collimator optic in the Russian arsenal. It not only fills the role of the traditional red dot as a CQB short range/fast acquisition sight, but also has unique features designed specifically for longer range combat shooting. It boasts a unique ability to facilitate single shot kills out to 400 meters when used with the AK-74. It is rare that such advanced technology is available to civilians, especially to foreigners. Using the newest machining techniques, the quality of this amazing sight is equal to US military optics which cost many times more. Its fully coated prismatic lens system provides a remarkable, high contrast, wide angle field of view allowing for fast acquisition of moving and spaced targets. Its most unique feature is its state-of-the-art black dot-red dot operation. Under normal daylight conditions, a precise 1 MOA black dot enclosed in a simple elliptical range-finding circle (170 MOA) is always visible without the use of the battery. When needed, a flip of the switch activates a 1.5 MOA red dot. This flexibility allows the PK-AS round the clock effectiveness in all environments. This dual functioning is available in no other collimator sight. Another great feature is the exceeding ease of making alignment adjustments using its indexed ballistic cam. This thumbwheel style range turret is calibrated in equal 2 MOA increments which makes it easy to use the sight with any caliber rifle. The non-magnification design allows for both-eyes-open shooting eliminating eyestrain. You have an unlimited field of view and maximum ability to register incoming targets. The precision dot system combined with the striking field of view produced by the high quality lens system provides far superior accuracy at distances equal to and exceeding those capable with iron sights. The advanced elliptical range finder accurately quotes distance. The PK-AS Weaver version will fit virtually and rail from regular dovetail and Picatinny to Weaver-style. It is very light weight while being battle-field tough. Please note they no longer come with the lens cap. This sight is also available with an AK or SKS/SVD sidemount.

It has a ""Hammer Block"" safety system which prevents discharge unless the trigger is in the full aft position.

Charter Arms was founded in 1964 by a gun designer who previously worked for Colt, High Standard and Sturm Ruger. Their first offering was the Undercover model.

To make the revolver stronger and able to shoot hot loads the ""side plate"" design of other manufacturers was replaced with a one-piece frame with fewer moving parts. 

This resulted in the smallest, lightest steel frame revolver with the fewest moving parts built anywhere to that date. The Undercover's high quality, light weight, and reasonable price made it popular with gun enthusiasts and law officers.

The original company went out of business in the 1990s. Since then these revolvers have been built by various companies with variable quality.

This gun is SN 4400xx which identifies it as a 1977 model and built to exacting standards by the original company.

This Undercover is unmarred except for a small nick on the front of one cylinder flute and a small nick on the right side of the barrel at the bore. The bore is mirror bright.

I bought the Undercover in the mid 80s and loaned it to my Daughter who kept it in her night stand. It has only been to the range twice since I bought it, less than 50 rounds.

I had it appraised at $800 it's a 1897 brush gun takedown model. Excellent condition. The 1879 is one of the best shotgun actions developed by John Moses Browning for the winchester company. The brush gun model is a 26 inch pump with a full choke. The takedown addition allows the user to break the gun down by pushing a pin and unscrewing the magazine tube allowing the shotgun to be separated for carrying in a case. The gun was produced ~1923 judging by the serial number lookup. It's one of the best example I've and the dealer currently holding it has ever seen. Smooth action and tight lockup with 90% original blueing no rust and minor pitting on the outside of the muzzle barely noticeable to the naked eye in fact. It's in perfect working condition and quite a collectable. Only serious inquires please. The picture is not of the gun but it's a damn near perfect representation.

It works really well, as I had it mounted on my Glock(which I have recently sold). 
It actually came in handy when I had an unwanted intruder in my house back in November. Woke up to the dog barking at two in the morning. Grabbed my Glock and went to the top of my stairs and switched the light on, at which time I saw the guy at the bottom of my stairs. Long story short, with how bright and blinding my light was- I was able to quickly access the situation and caught the guy off guard. When he heard me rack the slide on my Glock he tensed up real quick and I was able to get the cops there with no incident. 
Selling the light as I no longer own my Glock and I dont have a way to mount it to my shotgun. I have a handheld for that now. 
I've had it for a year and only have had to change out te battery once. And I used it often. Takes Surefire style batteries.

The 8 lbs. 2 oz weight makes the gun easier to carry than most 12 Ga shot guns.  The 28"" barrels allow you to easily line up your game in the site and swing through it accurately and effortlessly.  This is a very nice gun that will allow you to drop a lot of game while making it look easy."

This gun has been shot very little and it shows very nicely. I Rate at 90%-95% for fit and finish. The cylinder is very tight and the trigger is very smooth. The gun has wood grips. For those who don't know, the Colt's are no-longer made (1990's for the last 4th generation)and are quite collectible amongst the Colt revolver crowd. These guns have an internal safety bar which prohibits the firing pin from hitting the primer, unless the trigger is fully depressed to the rear. I do not know the round count, I do not have the box. I have had it looked at by a local firearms expert in Lakewood who assessed it as not perfect, but a very tight, nice little Colt. 

The only reason I am selling it is to fund the purchase of a Hammerless J Frame.

If you are in the market for a very nice Colt revolver, something that will hold its value then take a look at this pistol. Look online... you'll see what I mean."

I have put around 1200 rounds through it. Mostly Brown Bear and Tula. Never had a FTF or FTE. 

Comes with:
- Original handguard
- 4x 30 round pro-mag magazines (it might as well not come with these as they're awful magazines if you don't have a bullet guide installed. I had 6 originally, two failed, the magazine's built in bullet guide is far too weak). If you live in Denver, you won't have to worry as you're not getting these.
- 2x SGM 20 round magazines (awesome mags)
- 1x factory 10 round magazine (not pictured. there are enough US parts that the rifle remains 922r compliant with the original hand guard and magazine installed)

Upgrades:
- Tapco G2 trigger, hammer, disconnector, customized by Carolina Shooters Supply
- Hogue AK grip
- SGM Quad Rail (have it as a tri rail in the pictures, the top is in one of the pictures though)
- Magpul Com. CTR stock on this generic tube http://store.carolinashooterssupply....4-Stock/Detail - Has a little wobble but not bad and as you can see, doesn't require the rear tang to be cut
- TWS Gen II dog leg rail. Rail has been refinished using flat black aluma-hyde II. It's not an exact match but the finish from TWS was very poor, looks much better this way
- TWS rear peep sight


I'm getting rid of this because I just don't use it between my 74 and my AR. Asking $600, cost me muuuuuuuch more than that. No trades please. Won't ship, FTF only, will request a peak at a valid CO ID or CCW permit

Also want to note, the bottom of the rifle hasn't been refinished from the conversion. I simply used a touch up pen on the bottom.

I have a Russian Mosin Nagant M91/30 in 7.62x54R. Bolt action rifle.

This particular gun was made in Izhevsk (Soviet Union) in 1942. 

Nice walnut finish and the action is very very smooth. Gun is very clean and the rifling is nice. This gun is a pleasure to shoot, but I have several bolt action guns and I need to make room. Price is negotiable, but I am not a dealer and and not hurting for cash so please no lowballers. 

I have been informed that a popular firearms website has Mosin's for sale for less than half of my asking price, I am certain that the one I am selling is nicer and their price does not include shipping or the FFL fee that your FFL will charge you. Not only that, but with mine, you can see it with your own two eyes, not just trust the people who run the website.   

Gun is all numbers matching, and finish on the stock is in refinished condition. 

Proof markings on the reciever show 1942. 

check out this web site for a lot of details on Mosin Nagant Rifles.
http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinM9130S.htm

Gun sale will include, period correct sling, cleaning rod, cleaning tools, bayonette and ammo pouch. (gun with cleaning rod and sling pictured, I have the rest too and I will try to post new pictures with it soon)

Will also concider trade, interested in AR, Glock, HK or Beretta trades. 
I may be willing to add some cash for an offbalance trade. 

SERIOUS INQUIRES ONLY, IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING RUDE TO SAY AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE GUN, KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. 

I am in Illinois so a FOID is a must and if you are from out of state, we will need to transfer at an FFL. 

I will not break the law for you. 

Buyer must also be willing to sign a bill of sale and show me the FOID.

Accessories include Russian Mosin-Nagant Model 1891 socket bayonet - Second Pattern - designed for the Mosin-Nagant Infantry Rifle.

+ Mounting Hardware and Installation Instructions Included
+ Restore Rifle to Original Configuration by Removing Mount and Reinstalling the Rear Sight

** This new scope mount has been designed to provide lower ""visual alignment"" mounting for scout scopes. Alloy steel cross bolt mounting to the rear sight base with a locking nut provides a secure installation and insures that this mount will not shoot loose.

The easily installed, ""no gunsmithing"" mount replaces the rear sight leaf. (Detailed installation instructions are included with the mount). Simply remove the rear sight leaf and leaf spring, then insert and bolt in the scout mount. Attach the included Weaver style rings to the Picatinny mount and install the extended eye relief (EER) scout scope. You can restore the rifle to its original configuration by unbolting the scope and mount and reinstalling the rear sight.

Some Mosin Nagant scope mounts were designed with two short bolts that attach through the side “ears” of the rear sight base and thread into the scope mount. With extended shooting these bolts strip out the threads in the aluminum scope mount and the mount comes loose. Our mount has been threaded completely through and is fitted with a full length threaded alloy steel cross bolt and retaining nut that securely attaches the scope mount to the rear sight base.

Ring Specifications:
+ Strong Lightweight Aluminum
+ Non-Slip Mounting
+ Matte Black Finish
+ Low Profile
+ One Inch Diameter
+ Fits Weaver Style Bases or Picatinny Rail

** This new scope mount has been designed to provide lower ""visual alignment"" mounting for scout scopes. Alloy steel cross bolt mounting to the rear sight base with a locking nut provides a secure installation and insures that this mount will not shoot loose.

The easily installed, ""no gunsmithing"" mount replaces the rear sight leaf. (Detailed installation instructions are included with the mount). Simply remove the rear sight leaf and leaf spring, then insert and bolt in the scout mount. Attach the included Weaver style rings to the Picatinny mount and install the extended eye relief (EER) scout scope. You can restore the rifle to its original configuration by unbolting the scope and mount and reinstalling the rear sight.

Some Mosin Nagant scope mounts were designed with two short bolts that attach through the side “ears” of the rear sight base and thread into the scope mount. With extended shooting these bolts strip out the threads in the aluminum scope mount and the mount comes loose. Our mount has been threaded completely through and is fitted with a full length threaded alloy steel cross bolt and retaining nut that securely attaches the scope mount to the rear sight base.

Ring Specifications:
+ Strong Lightweight Aluminum
+ Non-Slip Mounting
+ Matte Black Finish
+ Low Profile
+ One Inch Diameter

Here is the information EoTech has on their website about this individual sight.

XPS3-0

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount.  Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

This barrel has rifle sights, and is suprisingly accurate.  It has one small ding in the left side of the receiver (shown).  This would make a great HD shotgun, or a truck gun.  4+1 capacity, shoots 2 3/4 or 3"" shells.

The Ruger SR40c pistol has a 3.5"" barrel and an overall length of 6.85"". The pistol weighs 23.40 oz. and features a height of 4.61"", with the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR40. It has a fully adjustable 3-dot sight system and an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. The SR40c offers modern safety features such as a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator, striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect and an ambidextrous, frame-mounted manual safety. 

The SR40c ships with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 9 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate included. The second magazine features a grip extension and holds 15 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized grip. An anti-friction coating is applied to the magazine body to reduce the force required to load the magazines to full capacity.

This FEG Hi-Power clone is the 9HP model - meaning that it is built true to the original design and all parts interchange with a 'real' Browning. Slide-to-frame fit on this gun is nice and tight. This gun is a great shooter, and is a beautiful gun to boot. The bluing is nicer than anything I or anyone else I know has owned - very deep and glossy. Almost iridescent. The only thing detracting from the gun is very slight freckling on the front and back of the grip area. It's very faint and I didn't even notice it until I'd been holding the gun for a few minutes. Everything else on the gun could pass for new.

I picked this up recently because I wanted a chance to try a Hi-Power at the range, and no one I knew had one for me to try. Currently it is my only high cap 9mm and I'm looking to sell or 'trade down' to a used S&W 915 or 5904 for car carry purposes. It's too nice to just toss in my console or under the seat. If you have a more 'beat up' Hi-Power I'd consider taking it in trade as well.

Cash price is $400. Includes one magazine. North Carolina CCW permit required; bill of sale will need to be signed.

All I have right now is a crappy cell phone pic. I hope to have better photos by this weekend."

This one was made by Auto Ordinance (no Kahr junk) in West Hurley New York in September of 1975. The pictures you see below is the gun I have for sale, note the forward hand grip: it is NOT an AOW as it has a total factory length of 27” and there is no way to affix a stock to this. It has perfect wood and nice bluing, although there are a few very minor safe rubs. This one came with a 13” barrel, it also comes with (6) 32rd stick mags. I am looking for $1800 cash but will consider reasonable offers, prefer trades.

I prefer face to face in the greater Tampa Bay area with valid FL ID however I will ship this to the lower 48 states (from my FFL to yours) for $40.00.

5.  Dual-ported extended match grade barrel to reduce recoil and increase accuracy (shot less than 50 rounds)
6.  Original barrel

Shoots very nicely, and I could tell a significant improvement when I installed the extended dual-ported barrel.  Very easy to change, takes seconds.  Use the dual-ported/extended for target shooting, switch back to the original for carry.  I apologize for the poorer picture quality, but no surprises.  Shows very minor carry wear, no nicks or scratches, and functions as a quality Glock should.
