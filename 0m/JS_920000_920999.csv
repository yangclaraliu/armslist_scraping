I've read that Magpul has currently suspended production of the ""Maglevel"" (window) version of their PMAGs in order to focus on getting out as many of the regular (non-window/easier to produce) mags as possible, in anticipation of the High Capacity mag ban. These may not be available again any time soon (if at all)!

Bushmaster has reworked their magazines to offer significant improvements in function, durability and value. The aluminum box is stamped with a full ""progressive"" die to produce tightest tolerances. The welding process along the box seams has been automated to insure optimum weld ingot, strength and compliance with MIL-STD. The surface finish has been improved to meet or exceed MIL-PRF-46010 (required for U.S.G.I. magazines). Magazine boxes are treated with Molybdenum Disulphide (""Moly"") for its exceptional adherence properties which ensure long lasting protection and lubricity - far superior to the PTFE (Teflon) used on other magazines. Finally, these magazines now have a new ""anti-tilt"" follower that ensures the round is fed into the chamber properly - preventing failure to feed problems. Drop tests have proven the advantages of the anti-tilt follower over the traditional green follower. As an additional aid, the followers are caliber marked - 5.56 in this case. Highest quality tempered steel springs, and Bushmaster logo stamped baseplates (removable for cleaning) round out the improvements on these superior magazines - which have been endorsed by the National Tactical Officers Association.

IT'S MARKED A NORINCO SKS 1,818,5** AND JUST ABOUT EVERY PART IMAGINABLE HAS DEEP HACKSAW MARKS.  BARREL HAS BEEN BENT, WITH A NUMBER OF SAW MARKS, AND COMPLETELY UNUSABLE. THE FELLOW I GOT IT FROM DID HIS BEST TO DESTROY THIS, AND HE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB. ""EVERY"" PART HAS HACKSAW DAMAGE EVEN THE SIDE OF THE TRIGGER HOUSING WHICH DON'T GO CLICK, SAFETY WORKS, THE BARREL ATTACHMENTS (BAYONET LUG, GAS ESCAPE PIECE WITH SLING HOLDER AND THE PIECE WHICH HOLDS THE BOTTOM STOCK ON ARE OK). THE REAR RECEIVER COVER IS GOOD ALSO.  THE BOLT EVEN HAS SAW MARKS BUT FUNCTIONS.   I ONLY WANT THE FRONT SIGHT AND THE REST, TO ME, IS GARBAGE.
NOW, I'VE NOT OWNED AN SKS, STILL DON'T, BUT I DON'T NEED ANY OF THIS THING OTHER THAN THAT FRONT SIGHT.  THE LAST ABOUT 8"" OF THE BARREL'S END IS STILL PRETTY STRAIGHT, FROM THE GAS RELEASE TO THE TIP.  
I BELIEVE THE RECEIVER IS USABLE, BUT I COULD BE INCORRECT.  IT HAS HACKSAW MARKS ON IT, BUT BELIEVE THE RECEIVER IS FUNCTIONAL AND UGLY AS SIN.
REMEMBER, I'M STATING THAT IMO THIS IS GARBAGE WITH FEW USABLE PARTS AND EXPECT THE WORST SO YOU'RE NOT DISAPPOINTED
I'LL TAKE, IF ANYONE WANTS THIS AS-IS (DON'T EXPECT MUCH) THE BEST OFFER I GET WITHIN 2 WEEKS. 
 IF ANYONE IS CRAZY ENOUGH MAKE AN OFFER WORTH MY TIME AND GAS, ONCE IT'S MADE, I'LL SINK HOLE IT, WHERE IT BELONGS, BEFORE DROPPING A CENT-MALE PRINCIPLE.  
I WAS GOING TO DROP IT IN A SINK HOLE, BUT SOME NUT MIGHT WANT THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE FOR SOMETHING.  WOULD MAKE A GOOD CLUB.
EMAIL ME, NOT ONLINE OFTEN.  I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GIVE OUT MY NUMBER FOR JUNK.
I'VE JUST EDITED THIS AND HAVE A LOT OF UNOPENED RELIES, I SAID 2 WEEKS AND 2 WEEKS IT IS.  I'M IN NO RUSH, THIS IS A TOTAL BACK BURNER, ATTEMPTED TO BE DESTROYED, SKS - IN NAME ONLY.  THE HACKSAW MARKS WILL NEVER GO AWAY.

I got this in trade, I dont have anything that will shoot it. I am told it is good shooting ammo(google egyptian 8mm) but I WILL NOT guarantee it as I know very little about it.

An unusual feature is the rectangular ""push-button"" cylinder release built into the hammer below the hammer spur. Overall condition is very good. The hammer is factory ""jeweled"". The grips are in very good shape. H&R used letter prfixes which changed every year. The letter ""U"" indicated 1958 production. The serial number of this revolver is ""U10341"". The rear of the cylinder and ejector star are marked ""4"". The mechanics appear to be in good working order and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. This is a very reliable and accurate revolver. Your C&R License is acceptable for transfer if permitted in your area."

Destined to become the standard that all 1911 pistols are compared against, the Taurus 1911 offers you the most accurate and feature-laden model on the market today. Starting with hammer-forged -not cast - ordnance grade steel frames, slides and barrels, each and every part is machined to tolerance levels that surpass even today's industry standards. Skilled pistol smiths hand-fit and tune each gun with 19 standard features, using quality parts that are built 100% in a state-of-the-art factory. Then they mark the slide, barrel and frame with matching serial numbers. Available in the powerful .45 ACP, this aggressive, rock-solid firearm is ready to go right out of the box. The Taurus 1911 is an unbeatable gun that is also an unbeatable value.

Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged.

Has scratches on gun but has very tiny dings on the backstrap. Black plastic grips has a few very light and tiny scratches, but no cracks or chips. 

Very nice looking pistol that just feels good in the hand. Condition Excellent. 

THIS IS A VERY HARD TO FIND MODEL OF THE 950 ESPECIALLY IN THIS CONDITION. IT ALSO MAKES THE PERFECT POCKET PISTOL OR PURSE GUN FOR THE LADIES.

This gun has been a safe queen for most of its life and I'm the second owner. Less than 100 rounds through it. Pictures dont do it justice.

THIS GUN IS MAINLY A COLLECTOR GUN.

**This stuff is AWESOME!!!**
The industries leading varmint bullet with premium polymer tip and streamlined design results in ultra flat trajectories. The match grade jacket design provides maximum accuracy at all ranges as well as explosive expansion, even at low velocities.
Rapid, explosive expansion. 
FEATURES:
Polymer Tip
The polymer tip increases the ballistic coefficient and also initiates dramatic expansion upon impact – even at velocities as low as 1600 fps.
Higher Ballistic Coefficient
Hornady® combines the sharp, pointed polymer tip with the most aerodynamic profile for a high ballistic coefficient. The V-MAX™ profile also provides the maximum bearing surface for added in-flight stability.
Swaged Lead Core
The swaging process allows for precise formation of the core up and around the tip, with a cavity under the tip's stem. This allows the tip to build up energy before smashing into the core, causing dramatic fragmentation of the core and jacket.
Precise Boattail & Flatbase Designs
Utilizing the proper base design provides incredible in-flight stability for long-range shooting
