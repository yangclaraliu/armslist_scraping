The caliber is .308 NATO. These are much more reasonable to shoot than the .303's being all that ammo dried up a few years back. The bore is beautiful on this being it probably never shot  corrosive ammo. I had originally bought this with the intention of turning it into a British Enfield 308 sniper clone but never got around to it and probably won't with all my other projects. It shoots very well and is quite fun. Most people on the range are usually surprised to see one of these in .308. Face to face with ID.

Wonderful collectors gun, and works great also even if you want to just have it as your gun to use. Is a design similar to the 1911.
Must have a Nevada Drivers License and ""Mature"" purchasers ONLY. No immature youth, gang bangers, etc.

Sorry the pictures are not clear, but the silver finish and pearl handles are clean and nice looking. I took the pics with my digital camera, and tried twice and they both came out the same, so I don't know if it's some weird reflection of the silver plating that's blurring the pic or what. Even made sure the camera was still. Anyway, trust me, and you can look at it yourself if you want to come and see, it looks very nice.

BTW.... Yes, I know Star BM's can go from anywhere between $250-350 private party or retail. But this is not a regular Star BM. Silver plating is an over $100 job, as well as the addition of the Pearl Handles. You simply aren't going to find this anywhere else. You want the nice gun, you need to pay a little more for it. I'm still not asking any more than a retail .22 or Highpoint 9 would cost, so people stop trying to take advantage."

This is a part of Glock's short run of RTF pistols before adopting the Gen 4 as we know it today. The pistol shoots reliably and accurately, but I'm not a big fan of the grip's size. Glock's are great, but not the best suited for me.

 most AR rifles come with 1 in 7 twist which works better for heavy bullets 70 gr and larger --tend to be more expensive ammo.

this is a fine rifle and I have a lot invested. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY WHEN YOU GO TO THE RANGE.

I will sell it for $700.00 cash or I will trade for a Glock with some extras. I can buy a BRAND NEW Glock in my area for $500.00 plus tax.

I'm also really interested in a AK47 or a 74. Once again I'm not against a wasr but its not worth 600.00 so be prepared to add ammo or mags or something....a 2nd gen g19 ? 

I would also be willing to trade for 1 glock and a pocket 9mm like a keltec or something similar.
I'm not trying to be rude but I keep getting offers to trade my HK for a for a 9mm or .40 cal glock even. That's not going to happen. 
You will need to show Ohio dl and ccw is prefered.

I have slightly recontoured the original buttstock to make it more comfortable for your shooting hand. All of the wood was smooth sanded and sprayed with multiple coats of matte black paint. This includes the original handguards. Very nice work done by a woodworking professional. I have refinished several of these stock sets like this for customers and all are very happy with the workmanship. NO drips, sags, runs, errors, or any other imperfections with the paint or woodwork. This rifle fits like a glove. If you have ever held or fired one of these guns with the thumbhole stock, then you know how uncomfortable the original stock is. Not this one. I have polished the bolt and bolt carrier. This rifle has had no other modifications other than those stated. This is a unique rifle in excellent condition. NO trades. Cash only.

I bought it on a whim to clear three dead trees on my property.  After clearing them, I realized it probably would not get much use here on out.  I bought a bunch of extras for it too.  The saw alone was $379.95 plus tax.  

It has the 20"" bar and 56.5 cc engine.  It has anti-vibration technology and has what they call a ""smart carb"".   Easy to start in hot or cold weather.  This saw runs EXCELLENT.  (Like a Beaver on crack!!  LOL)

The extras:

It already came with the bar cover with built in storage for your chain adjustment tool and stick file.
New Stihl hard carrying case.
5 new bottles of Stihl HP Ultra Synthetic mixing oil
A Stihl 20"" ""spare"" chain new in the box.
And I'll throw in a brand new 1 gallon can that still has 1/2 gallon of fresh mix in it. (That is all that has been ran through it.)
Also contains the original owners manual and carb adjustment tool.

AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE PICS, THE BAR ISN'T EVEN SCUFFED UP AND IT'S STILL NICE AND SHINY.  AND YOUR MORE THAN WELCOME TO TRY IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.  With everything listed, I have nearly $550 in this after taxes.

I literally ran it less than 4 hours.  Only ran 1/2 gallon of mixed gas through it.  As you can see from the pics, the bar doesn't even have a scuff on it!
It's an awesome chainsaw and runs like a Beaver on crack!  It has a 20"" bar with the 56.5 cc motor.  It has anti-vibration built in and has what they call a ""smart carb"" that makes it easy to start in hot or cold weather with no adjustments necessary.   The chainsaw alone retailed for $379.95 plus tax at Tri-green equipment plus I bought several extras to go along with it.  It already came with the chain bar cover with built in compartments for your chain adjustment tool and stick file.  Included original owners manual and small tool for carb adjustments if ever required.   But I also bought:

New Stihl hard carrying case
Two new files with a comfort handle
Five new bottles of Stihl HP Ultra Synthetic mixing oil
And a new 1 gallon gas can with pour spout with sealable trigger mechanism.

With everything listed here I have well over $500 invested in it after tax.

Will sacrifice on my cash price and take $450 still it's almost new.
Or I will trade for a gun of equivalent value ($450-$500 should be the value of your gun.)

and if it was not a specific gun that I had listed here, then I would like to keep the caliber limited to .308; 5.56; 9mm;  and .45 acp.
I could also use a Five-Seven pistol with fixed sights. Could also use a trunk AK, stripped lowers, or something as partial trade. Could take off the Aimpoint and mount to drop the price down. Open to multiple trade offers as well.
If I am working with you, I expect trades to be beneficial to me. Unless it is on this list, it is unlikely I will keep it for long after it is traded to me, so odds are I am doing this for your benefit and to get at least one of the guns I am interested in.

Retail is about $400 and I'm asking only $250.

Leatherwood CMR Series Hi-Lux 1-4x24 Riflescope is the rifle scope you need when the shooting situation becomes up close and personal. The CMR Hi-Lux 14x24 Riflescope was designed and built by Leatherwood specifically for tactical or recreational shooting. The Leatherwood 1x-4x Hi-Lux Close Medium Range Rifle Scope uses a relatively short 30mm riflescope tube that won't add a lot of weight to your rifle. The multi-coated optics and large diameter scope tube increases light transmission by allowing more light in to give you a brighter image and sharper target. This Leatherwood riflescope also features a Zero Locking System which allows the shooter to lock in place their target alignment but still offers minimal adjustments and tweaks. Leatherwood has made these rifle scopes available with either an amber or a red circle dot reticle, both illuminated. If you're in a tactical situation or hunting dangerous game, you wouldn't want to compromise with anything but the Leather Wood CMR 1-4x24mm Scope."

I've mostly used utility rounds (Remington) and had pretty good luck with cycling. It does tend to be a little picky with other brands though.

Included with the firearm is the original plastic box, manual, key, extra front sight for adjusting point of aim and test target. I also have 2 extra magazines (sell for $40 each) that will go with it.

New these are selling for $325 with only one magazine.

Buyer must be a MN resident, have a PTP/PTC and sign a bill of sale. FTF cash sale only."

As long as I still have my box of .40 S&W ammo, I'm willing to meet up for a test shooting if you like.  I highly recommend trying to test shoot guns before buying, ESPECIALLY handguns.  Everyone is going to have a different favorite.  I only ask that you be a serious buyer and we agree on the trade or price beforehand. Also, if we meet at an indoor range, then you pay for the range fees.  Otherwise, I won't expect that you buy unless you like it.  I will also meet at Delaware wildlife area public shooting range for free on weekends if it fits my schedule.  

Like new, about 2-250 rounds through it, super clean. For those unfamiliar with the Glock 27 GEN 4, it's Glock's newest compact .40 S&W caliber, improved action, spring, grips. Comes with original case, instructions, sealed fired first brass, glock reloader, four 9 round magazines (1 has the extra pinky extension), and two 15 round glock magazines. Truly is like new, no scuffs or scratches, literally cleaned after every trip to the range.

Will also include nice leather inside the waist band concealed carry Tagua holster, like the one pictured here: http://i.ebayimg.com/t/ITP-IWB-PREMIUM-LEATHER-GUN-HOLSTER-4-Glock-27-33-9-40-/00/$%28KGrHqIOKpEE25br81Y0BNz,HPRZT!~~0_3.JPG
If you get to me early enough, I will throw in a box of federal ammo, but I may shoot it if too much time passes.  

This is a perfect pistol for everyday carry/concealed carry. Small enough for a quality inside the waist band or tucked behind on the belt holster without printing, but with the .40 S&W, there is no doubt there is plenty of stopping power. Fun to shoot, amazingly accurate, I hit the clothes pins that hold up paper targets off of the target range at Delaware Wild Life Area. Great grips, comfortable, really a great gun.

I'm in no hurry to sell, but entertaining trades right now or full price $500 asking price. Buy this lightly used gun with a bunch of extra magazines (believe me they can add up), and extras, all without paying the taxes or fees.   

Ccw holders preferred, however must at least have Ohio drivers license and must not be prohibited from owning firearms, don't even try.

I am especially looking for a 1911 pistol in 45 acp. If you have any other interesting trades, firearms, enclosed trailers, tear drop camper, or anything of worth, let me know.
Let me know what you've got and what your terms are, you won't know unless you ask."

I have kept it very well, cleaned after every use, and wiped down with a silicon imbedded cloth before storing. It is an awesome little gun, I have carried concealed on a few occasions. 

Firearm is a PPK clone made by Bersa and has a steel slide. Since it is a Walther PPK clone, it will fit in a large majority of the holsters that are made for the PPK. It has a single lever safety, which also serves as the decocker. It is somewhat more rare in the US than Bersa's other .22 handguns.

Included with the firearm are a hard shell Fobus Holster, an Uncle Mike's Sidekick hip holster, and 100 rds of .22LR. Also included is all the original paperwork and the integrated locking mechanism key.

Price is pretty firm at this point, but I will entertain any offer, especially a square trade for an SKS or AK in decent condition (beat up stocks are OK). Just depends on how things go. 

I travel the I-75 and I-64 corridors on a regular basis, with I-75 from the TN border to Lexington on a weekly basis. I can meet someone off the interstate along those stretches of highway.

History:  This gun was purchased in 2008 and has been stored in a safe the entire time I've owned it.  I have fired approximately 100-150 rounds since purchase.

Condition:  This gun is free of rust, pitting, and major cosmetic blemishes.  Bore and feedramp are smooth and show no signs of abuse. The gun only has superficial handling marks associated with normal use.

Function:  Accuracy is respectable and the gun has never jammed or malfunctioned at the range.  I'm selling this otherwise perfectly functionable gun because I rarely shoot it and need funds for a new acquisition.  I know Taurus's reputation on quality varies from owner to owner, but I believe this to be a good gun.

This is the only kit available that is made with an all steel slide. Kimber and the likes, are made of aluminum and will most likely require modification to fit anything other than a Kimber. This is also the only model that locks the slide back on the last shot.  Anyway, you get what you pay for. 

Purchased this from Midway a couple months ago with the intention of using it for practice and saving cash on ammo. Reviews claim this to be the best conversion kit, as the slide is milled stainless versus aluminium. Threaded muzzle, adjustable sights, and picatinny rail. I never got around to using it, and am funding another project. Midway's current price is $489.00, mags are $59.00 each - I have 3 total. Have the original purchase receipts for $609.00. I would be open to possible trades (Glock, CZ75, etc.), but like I stated - cash would be better preferred. Thanks."

I have spent many years putting this collection together. I have collected autographs since I was a kid and I have enjoyed the hobby for many years. Now, my time with this great collection has passed. Over time, I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on this collection. The majority of my collection consists of vintage baseball autographs such as Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Joe Dimaggio, Ty Cobb, Roger Maris, and many more vintage baseball stars. All of my autographs have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. Below is a list of every item in my collection. You will also see a value for what each item typically sales for. These are not my asking prices. The total value of the collection is approximately $24,265. This is not my asking price. I am only asking $3,500 for the entire collection. I know I am taking a huge loss but I am in a must sell situation. My wife and I have found a piece of property that we are interested in purchasing but we need a larger down payment. So we do not miss the opportunity to buy our dream home. As I said, this is a must sell situation so I will listen to all reasonable offers. I was asking $5,500 for the entire collection. I have dropped my price by $2,000 because we really need to sell the entire collection as soon as possible. This is really going to be an amazing deal for someone. You will not find a nicer collection at a better price. I have thousands more invested in this collection than my asking price. I am taking a huge loss on this collection. I really hate to see this great collection go but I honestly have no other choice. We really need the money right now. My loss is your gain. This would be a great investment opportunity for someone. This would even be great for someone that sells on ebay. You could list these items for sale individually and you could make a large profit if you just have the time. We do not have the time to do this. We need this collection gone as soon as possible. With Christmas right around the corner, this would also make an amazing Christmas gift for the baseball fan in your family. This collection will not last long at this price. If you have any questions or would like to make an offer, please feel free to contact me by email. Thanks for looking.

This is NOT a firearms so anyone can purchase it. Thus I'll not need to see any ID or CCW or anything like that. Still, not bad guys and I reserve the right to withhold sale from anyone. My piece, my prerogative. 

Meet in the Northern Colorado area in Greeley or the I-25 corridor in the Loveland area. I'd love to drive further to meet but my schedule is impossible and won't allow it right now.

Selling my used GSG 1911 .22 LR with 3 magazines.  The barrel is threaded.  I only have about 600 rounds MAX through this thing.  

It does have a few dings in it because my son was shooting it next to me while I was shooting my 10/22 and a shell went down the back of his shirt, burned him, and he dropped the gun.  Which also bent the tip of the dove tale for the grip safety so I ground it down. Which, in my opinion, made it more comfortable and easier to de-cock.  You can see in the pictures.

The gun works GREAT.  I found it worked best with Federal bulk.  It did not work well with the American Eagle ammo.
