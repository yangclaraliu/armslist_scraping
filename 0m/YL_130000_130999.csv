I am looking for an adult sized .22 bolt, pump, or lever rifle with a wood stock. I'm not interested in semi-auto, tactical, or youth sized rifles. Scope is not important. Factory sling swivels are a plus. Military training rifles (in .22) are also a plus. I just want a good solid hunting rifle.

The first rifle has a round receiver (lower rifle in picture), was made in 1942 at the Izhevsk arsenal. It has been re-arsenaled which means the finish has been completely re-done by Russia and it has been counter bored. Import mark is on the receiver. The stock was also refinished (well) buy another owner. They also added some accent paint around the numbers as seen in the photo. This rifle looks fantastic and has a great bore. It will be a great shooter but doesn't have significant historical value (like capture marks). That said, I'd value it around $110 if you wish to buy it outright. I know you can buy re-arsenaled Mosins for $80 online, but that's before shipping and transfer fees and you don't get to see it first. 

The other Mosin (higher rifle in picture) has a hex receiver, was made in 1934 at the Tula arsenal, and was captured by Finland. It has the Finnish ""SA"" stamps on the side of the receiver. Import mark is just below the muzzle. This rifle is in original condition, which means Russia was never able to capture it back and re-arsenal it. The numbers don't match, which is realitevly common for captured rifles. The stock has a crack in the hand guard. The bore is a little dark but the rifling is very strong and it is a great shooter. This is great collector item. If you want to buy instead of trading, I value it somewhere around $150 but feel free to make an offer.

Finally, I have a sealed tin of 440 rounds surplus ammunition. It's silver tipped 147 grain light ball. Not sure of the year. It was purchased from a retail store last year. I value this at $75, which I believe is very fair.

Both rifles are being sold as ""shooters"". I've had them both at the range on several occasions. However, as with any sale/trade I make, I assume no liability for the rifle or the shooter. The guns are WWII era. Have a gun smith check them out first or fire them at your own risk.

I value this lot somewhere in the $300-$335 range. I will split it up for a trade and I know the market fairly well. I am willing to meet in a public place in the Cleveland area to make a trade. If the trade is really good, I'll drive a little further but I won't add any cash to the deal. I have plenty to work with here. Please be of age and have a valid Ohio driver's license, CCW, or state ID to show. I will respond to people who are polite, realistic, and provide pictures of their items first."

Well, let Blake's Refinishing Service LLC be your first choice in providing you with high quality firearm finishes at a great price. By keeping our prices fair and our service fast, we stand out from our competition. Most firearm coaters usually sell firearms and hard goods in a retail based environment while providing finishing services. At Blake's, we only refinish firearms and a properly finished firearm takes time and focus. We do not have the distractions from a retail environment, which can cause longer turnaround times and in some cases, a lower quality end-product. Be sure to ask about our RMGO MEMBER 10% DISCOUNT!

I cleaned the metal and did several coats of Krylon Ultra Flat Camo paint. This is only a spray paint finish, so it won't last forever, but it has proved to be fairly durable through many range trips. It functions perfectly and has been well maintained. Also included is a 6 round side saddle. It is attached with velcro so you can remove it easliy, this is the setup used by many 3 Gun competitors. Great autoloader for the money!"

You will pay more for this gun, tax, and the background check than I am selling it for with the extras. I am willing to sell the 1911 by itself, but you'll have to ask about the price.

7.62x54R.............but we all know it better as a PSL.

1p21 scope, 1 mag. This is a military demilled kit that was put on a TG receiver. Has a bayo lug and a fixed supressor. all matching #'s.

The scope is an illuminated self calculating scope calibrated for the 150 grain 7n1 sniper 762x54 ammo (or any 150 grain ammo really). I use bulgarian 149 and it works out.

the scope automatically compensates from 300 meters to 1300 meters with the change in magnification.

You just find your range and set your magnification to that range and fire..

300 meters = 3 on the scale
400 meters = 4............
500 m= 5
.
.
.
900 meters= 9 on the scale
and for furthur distance 1000, 1100, 1200 1300 you set at max magnification and drop to the correct chevron.

neat huh? It works and is VERY accurate for what it is made for. It is not designed for punching 1/8th moa on paper, it is designed for knocking out a man sized target @ 300-1200 meters.





Lesson: We here in the US call them PSL's,,,If you hear it called an FPK, then it is not wrong. In Romania they are called FPK's, that is the designation by their military. People call them Dragunovs because,,,,,well lets face it, Dragunovs are the very cool older brother of the PSL.

While not any more accurate or reliable,,,they are definatly the gun with the higher cool factor,,,,,now the NDM .308's will destroy all of the varients of the Drags/psl's/tigers, and 54 NDms.

anyway I am getting off track here......



Anyway I have several of these, and this one has a small crack in the forgrip and sloppy looking rivets (not that it affects the gun in any way, but I just do not like it,,,,so the ugly duckling must go to make room for a new toy.


For trade,,,,What do you have???

Will sell for 1300, but will take trade offer of less value

I am a dealer so this WILL/MUST transfer.

Not interested in your basic run of the mill guns you can buy at every other pawnshop, bassproshop, or gander mountain...............!

This is a two tone Bersa Thunder in the original box and papers with both keys for the built in lock,a new cable lock and a Fobus Holster.I actually like this gun much more than my ruger LCP but I decided to keep the LCP and sell this one only because the LCP is smaller and easier to hide on a motorcycle.
I'm looking to purchase a Taurus Judge or something for home protection..maybe a pistol grip style tacticle shotgun..also interested in possably a LC9 not as a pocket gun but more a nightstand gun. So if you have any of the above and are looking for a nice concealed carry gun let me know and lets see if we can work out a deal that makes us both happy.

The list price is $549 and the extra magazine ($43), ammo ($27), and holster ($25) I'm throwing in adds another $95 of value ($644 total value) so I feel $425 cash is a very competitive price.

I'll also consider guns which came in the newer 'blue' box with the word ""Pistol"" printed repeatedly at an angle across the lid. The model and serial # on the gun should match the model and serial # on the box label. I will consider a gun without the box if it's pristine.
