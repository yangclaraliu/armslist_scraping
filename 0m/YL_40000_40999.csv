It is a great gun, I just want to trade to the same gun, just something smaller.

As the title said it's a 2nd gen 19 and has the Scherer Plug installed and has standard sights. It comes with 2 15rd factory magazines that drop free.
The recoil spring is very strong and it is very clean with very minor holster wear.
I have field stripped it and cleaned it after every shooting session (about 50-100rds a session) and oiled it lightly to spec with CLP. I have put through about 500rds through this since I bought it and it has never had a problem.

I am looking for a comparable Glock 26 for trade. If you have any holsters you want to trade with it as well, I have a Neoprene IWB holster that will go with it.
It would be preferable, but not required if one of the magazines did not have the extended floor plate/finger extension.

If you want to buy and not trade. I will sale it for $450 if you want to buy it as I can pick up a used 26 for that price locally.
I will also consider other pistols as well, I'm really just looking for a small 9mm, but make me an offer and we'll see what we can work out.

FTF only in Oregon with ID/CHL. I can meet after 4pm Sunday-Thursday, and anytime Fridays and Saturdays.

It has been doing 3"" groups at 100 yards but I think it could probably be better (Brown Bear 203 grain SP). Best group was around 2.5"" with Mil-Surp 147 grain FMJ stuff. It would certainly be acceptable accuracy for deer hunting, not to mention any other big game species. Barrel may need to be free-floated and possibly the action bedded. I don't have the time to do it and I have other guns, so I'm going to sell this one. $250 is very firm. Just calculate the cost yourself if you like (stock Mosin, ATI composite stock kit, scope, and other labor). No ammo is included since I need it for my other Mosin. The bore is in very good condition. It has strong lands and grooves. Groove diameter I measured at around .3125-.313"". Scope is a Simmons 8-point 3-9x50. Bill of Sale will be issued for transaction.

First off... this is NOT your Walmart ranch model. It's the 180 series, this
one manufactured in 1976 according to the Ruger history web site. I've
seen 180 series at gun shows going for almost $1,000.00 that were no
where near as nice as mine. I also have six 30-round mags and the
standard 5 round mag along with around 200 rounds of .223's. You have
to just see the pictures, they say it all. The price of $600.00 is firm.

610,http://www.armslist.com/posts/40610,"For Sale:  LASERMAX Rail Mount Laser, Picatinny / Weaver-Style Rails (LMS-UNI)","Arlington, Dallas, Texas",$ 175,"Listed On: Thursday, July 1, 2010",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Smaller than a match box and as lightweight as a single .45 ACP round, the LASERMAX Rail Mount Laser, Picatinny / Weaver-Style Rails (LMS-UNI) features a patent pending integral rail that allows the user to add other rail mounted accessories, such as a tactical light or infra-red laser. This special feature is unique to the Uni-Max system.

Uni-Max will emit the 635 nm (red/orange) laser that is characteristic of LaserMax's guide rod laser sights.

LaserMax's rail mounted laser sight quickly and securely attaches to any Picatinny or Weaver style rail, allowing for multi-use between pistol and long gun platforms. It is truly evolutionary because it incorporates its own integral Picatinny rail mount, allowing for additional accessories to be stacked onto the unit.

Mounting multiple LaserMax systems will enable both visible and infrared targeting while still maintaining a smaller footprint than competing laser sighting systems. Adding a rail-mounted tactical light is just as easy, demonstrating the real versatility of the system. The new LaserMax sight will address the ever-present need for fast and accurate shot placement in low-light, when seconds count.

Constructed from durable FRN (Fiberglass Reinforced Nylon), the new laser system features a rapid and secure mounting mechanism that is consistent with firearms safety guidelines. The user can safely install the system without ever passing their hands in front of the muzzle. No special tools are required.

The system is adaptable for two methods of activation which address various operating conditions. The first method is an ambidextrous switch that can safely and easily turn the unit on by pressing in with the index finger. The second method of activation (recommended for long gun use) is an optional remote switch for momentary on/off.

This Lasermax Rail Mount Laser also features an adjustable windage and elevation settings for precise alignment, and it maintains zero after every battery change. To avoid unintentional battery drain, Lasermax Uni-Max Laser Sight is set to turn off after 30 minutes of constant use. While in the time out mode, simply cycle the activation switch off to refresh the laser, and turn it back on.

Military Ballistics Industries (MBI) specializes in custom ammunition and ordinance products for use by the military, law enforcement agencies, and training facilities in the United States.

This remanufactured (reloaded in a factory) product is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, reloadable, and packaged in 100 round, sealed plasti-packs. It is both economical and precision manufactured by an established American cartridge producer. 


The brass for this ammunition will have various headstamps and may be brass or nickel-plated brass.

Remanufactured ammunition has been around for decades. Some of the world's best shooters use only remanufactured or custom manufactured ammunition to achieve a level of consistency and optimal ballistics performance that cannot be achieved with mass-manufactured ammunition. Remanufactured ammunition is produced by assembling carefully selected components to include specialty bullets, propellants, primers, and previously spent brass cartridge casings. The bullets, propellant, and primers are always newly manufactured while the brass cartridge casings are typically reprocessed to reduce costs or improve consistency. 

This MBI product is manufactured using only the highest quality products available to ensure consistent ballistics and firing performance. The propellant is manufactured by Hodgdon, the bullets are manufactured at either the Lake City military manufacturing facilities or by Hornady, and the primers are manufactured by either CCI or Winchester. In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition is assembled using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition. 

Each brass cartridge casing used to produce MBI ammunition is processed by first undergoing a lengthy mechanical cleansing process. Once cleaned, each casing is then re-calibrated by an electronic press to ensure that the final dimensions of each round are within micrometer tolerances. Each casing is then re-primed and re-charged using high-quality primer and propellants. Once the new bullet is seated using a precision-tuned electronic press, each round is hand-inspected to ensure perfection. 

This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is ""precision"" remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit.

However, that is where the ""standard"" part ends. This rifle was purchased in 1995 before Springfield ran out of the good stuff and is loaded with USGI parts including chrome lined barrel manufactured by TRW, which is one of the most sought after, bolt, operating rod and trigger group. USGI M14 barrels were designed for a minimum service life of 15,000 rounds. Also included is an almost complete set of USGI spare parts including, but not limited to, hammer, gas piston, firing pin, recoil springs, most all of the pin & spring groupings and cleaning kit.
Next are 14 spare USGI mags with 7 being new in the wrap and 4 additional Thermold mags ( 18 total ). These are NOT cheap Chinese fakes but have all the correct GI markings, welds and springs. All come in original GI carriers.
Included is a Burris Signature 3x9x40 Posi-Lok scope with duplex reticle in matte black finish and 1500 rds. of quality 7.62 x 51 surplus ball ammo.
Please do a GOOGLE search for ""differents M1A site"" for an excellent GI parts identification guide if you are unfamiliar with this rifle.
VERY difficult to come by this item today. Walk into any gun shop, tell them you want an M1A with GI parts and see how long it takes before they're rolling on the floor with laughter! Or, bubba says ""what's thaaat?""
This rifle has been test fired 10 rds. only and has been a safe queen for the past 15 years. Sold as a package only. Will not separate.

Combining the alloy and titanium construction of the AirLites with an L-frame featuring the enclosed ""Centennial"" hammer (the only non-J-frame Centennials Smith has ever made), the new revolvers were offered in both 7-shot .38 Special (Model 242) and 5-shot .44 Special (Model 296) flavors. Weighing only 18.9 ounces, the 2"" round-butt .44 Special Model 296 offered big-bore punch, medium frame size, snag-free carryability, and was lighter than a steel J-frame. It seemed to be a recipe for success in a time when liberalized CCW laws were sweeping the country. The new revolvers were still fairly complex to make; the complexity of the two-piece barrel and the machining of the titanium cylinder translated to an MSRP of $754.00

Smith discontinue the revolver after the 2001 model year. The few who purchased one found out, that pretty is as pretty does and if you're looking for an easy-to-carry big-bore wheelgun, they don't come much prettier than the 296 Ti.

Given their unique configuration and short production run it seems safe to say that these will probably achieve at least minor collectible status in the future. 


I have had this .44 Hand Gun loaded sitting in my night table for about ten years, I guess I will never be firing it so I have decided to sell it. I hope you get to enjoy it because I never did, thank you for looking...God Bless us all. $975.00 OBO

The Kimber is a 45 ACP has the Kim Pro finish on the slide, match grade trigger and barrel, all aluminum frame, and Crimson Trace brand laser grips. I have only shot about 100 rounds through it. I shot it when I got it and once when I went home. It shoots amazing and I love it! Accurate right out of the box. The Laser grip is set from the factory at 50 feet and is a TON of fun to shoot. If you know anything about Kimbers you know that they are hand built very fine weapons, there is over an 8 month wait on this gun from Kimber right now. There are a few places online to find them, but they are 1200-1300 dollars. (I just payed 1200 for mine) I also have the Kimber endorsed Fobus brand holster that will go with the gun as well as the Kimber slide lock, Kimber hardshell case, and ALL of the paperwork, tags, instruction manuals and brochures that come with a new Kimber Pistol. I even still have the oil that comes with it and the applicators and cleaners that I never used because I wanted to keep them lol. Again, I hate to do this but I have a baby on the way and money is tight. (It's time to start growing up) If anyone purchases it, they are more than welcome to come and pick the gun up, if it is too far I can ship it, but it must go through an FFL. (there is a place nearby that will do it for like 20 bucks, so whatever fees due to shipping will be covered by new owner, but it will be minimal) Asking for $1000. Thanks for your time and interest!

Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero.
