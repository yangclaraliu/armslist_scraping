Don't ask me - it's a girl thing.)  

I originally posted this stating 600 rounds, but I miscounted the boxes (they are in a military surplus ammo can, and I didn't unpack them, I though I knew how deep the stacks were).  

Here is a breakdown on the ammo:

750 of the 900 rounds are Remington UMC (15 50-Round boxes)

1 50-Round Box Remington Golden Saber Bonded Brass-Jacketed Hollow Point (for when you REALLY want to put them down!)

1 50-Round Box Union Metallic Cartridge Company

1/2 50-Round Box Speer Lawman Gold Dot HP

1 50-Round Box Speer Lawman (Regular)

Yeah, I know.  It adds up to more than 900 rounds, but I didn't want to do a complete count and I know that there is at least 900 rounds, so I figured anything more than 900 would be a bonus for whoever gets it.

I can buy a Cx4 Storm in 9mm for 735.00, so I would let it all go for that much, or just trade me your 9mm Storm.  I did the math on the ammo and it is worth about $270 alone.  

I have had other people say, ""Cx4 Storms are going for (whatever) dollars, so you should sell yours to me for that price."" to which I reply, ""Great!  Go buy one and let's trade!""  I am not really counting the ammo in the value of the rifle, I am just using it to get someone to either trade me rifles or buy mine for what I would have to pay for a 9mm one.  

If you want to trade, contact me and we can set up a time and place to meet.  Thanks, and I hope to hear from you soon!

I also put a slide release extender on the weapon. Great feeling gun but want a similar glock in a smaller caliber. If interested call REDACTED"

This gun began life as a Nodak spud NDS-2 5.45x39mm AK rifle.  With the help of a gentleman on the east coast, I've converted it into a bullpup rifle that cuts it close at 27.5"" overall (legal minimum is 26"").  The rifle now has quad rails, extremely sturdy as they are supported by the receiver where the lower handguard would be, the gas tube where the upper handguard would be, and the rear sight base.  Also has a vertical foregrip mounted on the lower rail, giving it a very comfortable AUG-like feel with the dual pistol grips.  The rifle feels very comfortable and points naturally, and is well-balanced.  I can easily aim and shoot this with one hand, and I am not a very strong guy.  Also, the safety lever has been machined out to allow for a bolt hold-open.  This is the only change that is irreversible, and it can be undone by simply replacing the lever for ten bucks.

Rifle will come with black Magpul BUIS (real ones, not the shitty PTS version), seven surplus polymer mags with steel lugs and lips, and 520 rounds of 7n6 surplus ball ammo.  Rifle will not include the Surefire G2X pictured, unless you specifically ask for it.

This is my personal favorite ballistic shell, because it has the most material to work with and provides a fantastic base platform for custom work while still providing excellent ballistic protection against handgun, shotgun, and SMG rounds.  I refurbish these and do custom work, so I've setup a pricing chart for the usual stuff.  If you have anything special you'd like, just send me a message and I will get righ back to you - I can do anything you want to the helmet.

As for painting, I can do any solid color or basic camouflage.  I am very good with the ""snakeskin"" pattern camo, and can do dozens of color variations - whatever you want, just tell me and I will do it.

I can recut the shell to your specifications, also.  Just tell me exactly what you want done to it, or what you want it to look like - I can remove the brow, trim up the back for use with a vest, trim the ears to half-height, remove the brow and ears entirely for a TC-2001 spec shell, you name it.

The first photo shows three popular helmet styles that I can recut the shell to match - from left to right TC-2000, TC-2002, and TC-2001.  The second photo shows some of my snakeskin camouflage paintjobs on previous customers' (non-ballistic) helmets, to give an idea of what I can do.

These prices are just guidelines, if you want different features or combinations than are listed, just ask me and we'll get it squared away.

Just snap it on & you're shooting in a matter of minutes.  Very fun & extremely accurate.  Will keep a better pattern than a Cx4 (probably due to the lighter trigger).

Those would be partial trades & you would need to add cash.  I prefer cash, though.  This can only be sold to a Missouri resident over 21 with the ability to prove it.

This is a great shooter, locks up great and is dead on accurate.  If you want a Colt snakegun that you can take to the range and enjoy, this one is for you.  It looks good enough to be proud of, but not so good you will keep it in the safe.

I'd prefer the WASR GP 10/63 variant but I'd take a WASR 10 provided it doesn't have the canted sight. I want an AK that is wood-stocked, but I'd consider a black synthetic stock. (no folding stocks or after-market stocks unless you're including the original with the deal) I want it completely stock, not loaded with mods. I want at least a couple of 30 rd mags with it.

I will trade the AR for your AK and $600 cash. If you have a lot of AK ammo to trade, I have 1000 rds of .223/5.56 ammo I can trade for your AK ammo.

I won't sell the AR by itself and I also won't sell the ammo, so please don't ask. The only deal I'll make is the one outlined above. I'm firm on the amount of cash I'd need to go along with your AK.

I can send pics of my rifle and would like to see pics of yours before a deal.

It has an Insight built in laser with continuous and pulse mode. Will come with box with paperwork and nylon case that S&W includes to carry the gun and an extra mag. These only come with 1 mag however I have another factory mag that runs 20 bucks. Included with sale is almost 200 rds of ammo with half being hollow points and hydra-shocks and the other FMJ. Have ran 75 rounds out of this with no ftf or fte (25 were hp's to ensure reliability to carry them for defense). Reliable and actually really accurate for a .380. Serial number puts manufature date in march this year. Have called around local shops in Springfield to see how much they are going for now and the cheapest I could find was Loftis for 369.00 and they would have to see if could order it in just like any other place in Springfield area. They are sold out. So cheapest just for the gun is around 400.00 after tax. This gun is light weight and weighs less than a can of soda. Would prefer cash but open to trades. Not sure of what I want as I have or have had just about everything I wanted to try. If you are a gun nut like me you know the feeling and is why you are reading this :). Those of you who dont know much about the .380 round it is just a shortened 9mm. 9mm is 9x19 and .380 is 9x17. usually 15-20 grain difference in bullet so is still as affective as a 9mm in my opinion. This has a polymer frame with a stainless slide and barrel so really resistant to corrosive material that cause most guns to rust.  Reason for sale/trade, well I am a 1911 fan by heart. Figured would try this pocket gun but feel naked carrying it so back to the 3 lb 1911. Anyway questions just send me an email. 400.00 is the cash price which includes all factory stuff, 200 rds of ammo and an extra mag. Ammo is worth about 75 bucks alone and again 20 plus tax for the mag if you can get them right now. Kinda scarce with the pocket pistol craze this summer. Thanks and please include phone number and pics of your trade."

The tri-action essentially allows for the hammer to be laid down for carry, but with a near-instant return to single-action upon trigger pressure. For an example, see this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P89vfQUJVCQ

Very accurate little gun (I'm much more accurate with this than I am my M&P or Kahr), with an absolutely amazing trigger pull in single-action.

Remington 597 Semi auto .22 with original mossy oak plastic stock and one 10 round magazine- $195.00

So as you see there is $449.59 invested, not to mention the installation of parts. So the selling price of $275 is pretty firm. I have shot about 1000 rounds through the rifle. After each time fired the action was cleaned and barrel had a dry cloth ran though it. The .22 works great with the 10 round mags, but I could not get the 30 round mags to cycle right. All I ever used was cheap bulk ammo, so maybe a better ammo would work in the 30rd mags. Adult owned and very well taken care of.

Must be face to face sale, I will not ship rifle. I am located in Bay City, but am willing to meet up somewhere closer to buyers location.

The P89 was introduced by Ruger in 1991 to overcome design flaws and accuracy issues with its predecessor, the P85, and remained in production till just a few years ago.

Internally, the P89 is a recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol. It uses SIG-Sauer P220 type locking, when one massive barrel lug locks into large ejection port on the slide; The P89 utilizes a Browning-style tilting barrel: It also uses a battle-proven and reliable M1911 style link system.

This P89 features a Double action with decocker (the firing pin is locked by means of the internal safety that is actuated unless the trigger is pulled all the way back). It can also be fired using single action.

The P89 frame is made from aluminum alloy. The slide is made from stainless steel on this model. Grip panels are made from polymer, and an aftermarket Hogue grip is included in the sale.

Sights are dovetailed and have white dots for increased visibility.

All P-series pistols are extremely sturdy, capable of continuous firing of high-pressure +P loads without any damage to the firearm. They are often referred to as ""built like tanks"" for their reliability over many years.

The gun has been fired fewer than 200 rounds in its lifetime, and is in like-new condition. Included in the sale are two (2) factory high-capacity magazines.

Price: $350 or best offer.

Buyer to pay additional fees and/or costs, if any.

Self Locking System (SLS) Tactical Holster 

The Safariland Model 6004 Tactical holster is built for comfort as well as functionality. This Tactical holster features the Self Locking System (SLS™) rotating hood system which is so well suited for the tactical situations encountered today. The hood on the Model 6004 holster can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. The STX Tactical finish of the holster is rugged, protecting the gun in scrape, scratch and dent incidents. Molded sight track and soft SafariSuede™ protect the gun's sights and finish. A special feature of the Model 6004 is the double leg strap and the leg shroud. These two features combined equal comfort and stability in the holster position on the leg.

Description: 
Back in Stock - Jet Guns offers Springfield XDM 9mm 3.8"" Black Package - $527 + free shipping. Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally
