Has a chromed barrel and once fixed, should give you years of service.

I thought the feeding problem was originally the magazine so I bought the Tapco Stock and magazine so I will include that.  Being overconfident that was the solution, I also bought a muzzle break too.  As of the posting I can't find the magazine or the top piece, but I can give it to you when I find it if you are not too far away.  Everything I'm including is in the picture.

Very nice Norinco SKS properly fitted in a Tapco Stock, color kaki tan, with pictini rail mounted on the under side of forearm. Stock has adjustable length of pull and adj. cheek rest and it is a folding stock. This is the better tapco stock with the good recoil pad and the padded pistol grip. Also comes with sling and bipod. I have left the original 10 rd mag in place as after market mags seem to be iffy at best with exception of a company that makes some excellent mags in Detroit Michigan that have a lifetime gaurantee, they are rather pricey at $85.00 each but they do work very well. I will include 10 stripper clips with the rifle as well and I do have the original stock, bayonet, and ramrod that will go with the rifle with all matching numbers. The rifle also has a Tasco Red Dot Scope mounted and it works well. 
Will meet FTF only in the Hilliard / Dublin area and you must have a picture ID to prove your age and there will be a bill of sale for my records only.
 Cash only, I am not interested in trades at this time as I am reducing inventory.
If you are interested in any of my listings do not be afraid to make an offer the worst I can do is say no.

I'll have to dig a little to be sure, but I think I only have one magazine and the blue factory case. Nothing else is included. I have no idea what the ""round count"" might be, other than the usual 'not much' description. The only sign of it being a used gun is some extremely minor finish wear on a couple of sharp edges, insignificant enough to not be able to document with any picture. I do not have a camera other than on my cell, so keep that in mind if you're insistent that you see pictures ahead of a FTF transaction. There's no gross misrepresentation with this one. Will sell for $450 FTF with the necessary credentials, or trade for lord knows what again.

This is a good shooter as far a accuracy in concerned = to MOA or less.

The problem is, I have discovered that primers are partially exiting the case after firing.  As soon as I noticed this, I stopped using it to get a fellow to check the headspace and he agrees w/me that it is excessive for some reason.

I like the feel and accuracy of the rifle, but since I do not hunt I don't feel like spending money to have a gunsmith fix the problem..

So...I know many Mauser lovers are out there and many are equipped w/tools needed to address this problem so I would like to hear from someone who can safely deal w/the problem to offer me a price to buy this ""project rifle"" from me.

Scope is mounted on a see through type mount so that you can use the iron sights also. this rifle is accurate and fun to shoot. This rifle has the original 10 round magazine in place as I have just had reliability problems with all the aftermarket mags that I have tried for the SKS rifle, with the exception of a company in Detroit Michigan that makes an excellent mag but they are pricey at about $85.00 each but if you like the SKS they are well worth the money. I will also include 10 stripper clips with the rifle. I also will include the original stock, bayonet and ramrod all numbers match.

12 gauge suitable for any skeet, trap, sporting clays, or hunting.

Some folks prefer a dedicated trap gun but I like the basic field stock dimentions for all my varied wing shooting.  My choice only.  I only say this because the gun was intended to be what most others prefer for SKEET.

This gun has the adjustible comb feature and ported barrels.

The condition is used so it does have handlng marks typical of a used gun.
The wood is high quality and has a very nice appearence.

I only say handling marks because if you want a perfect one you will need
to pay about $3000 I guess, but it will be new.  Make me an offer.

All the metal and mechanical parts on mine are tight and correct.

Long story short, was in the USMC, in the middle of my first term, I ended up getting injured, and started doing  a lot of weapons maintenance. I will take a look at what you have, discuss with you the specifics and exactly what you would like to do, and make a print out of what the parts/supplies will cost( if needed ), as well as the labor involved; Instead of charging you $85.00/hr for a job that possibly could be completed in 20 minutes, you will get a price that reflects the actual job and work performed.

 I am a certified Glock and Sig Armorer. I specialize in Full-out Tactical Builds, I have the ability to accurize rifles, do bluing/rebluing jobs, refinishing, cleaning, older weapon restorations, weapon add-ons, etc. If you have a project that you are stumped on, need parts put in, need it cleaned up, or you need a full-out build.

It is all matching serial numbers and has a chrome lined barrel. These are rare and very hard to find. Again this is a milled Ak, much nicer and valuable than the stamnped AKs.

It is in need of some TLC, I won't lie.  It needs green plastic safety indicator pin in the stock and doesn't fire all the time, but does fire.  I think it needs spring work in the bolt, or the trigger needs work, won't fire all the time, trigger hangs up like something is out of sync, mainly when tilting it up while moving bolt to put in shell.  Don't have time to fool with it.  Great looking gun, just needs some care.  Call or text Robert at REDACTED. Price is negotiable cause you might need to get a part from the gun show or ebay.

From Winchester:
""Lower your times and raise your scores with a ready-for-competition Super X2 Practical MK I. The gas-operated action is proven fast in recent tests, firing five shots in .49 of a second, while reducing felt recoil to put those shots on target. The MK I features a compact 22"" barrel, eight-round extended magazine and rugged composite stock and forearm. A TRUGLO® fiber-optic front sight helps pick up targets fast. The Standard Invector™ choke system improves pattern performance with shot and still works accurately with rifled slugs. An Improved Cylinder choke tube and sling swivel studs are included."""

Brand new, never fired. In original special issue red plastic cases with oil-paper, manual, test cartridge, lock, etc.

This is a Limited Edition Set with matching serial numbers. The set includes the 50th Anniversary .357 Mag. New Model Blackhawk revolver with a 4 5/8” barrel & the 50th Anniversary .44 Mag. New Model Blackhawk revolver with a 6 ½” barrel.

These are a re-manufacture of the original flattop SA revolvers to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Ruger’s introduction of their SA revolver for the magnum cartridges. The tops of the barrels are roll-engraved for the 50th anniversary and gold filled.

Both feature the “Flat Top” frame w/original “micro”-style click adjustable rear sight, smaller pre-1962 “XR-3” grip frame w/checkered “hard rubber” grips bearing original style black Ruger medallions.  They also have the unique reverse indexing pawl, new-style hammer spring & patented transfer bar ignition system.  

Included is a locking fitted walnut presentation case that features a glass top with a “Ruger® Red” silk-screened logo, dark green padded liner and keys.

This offer also includes a tooled Buscadero rig with .44/.45 cartridge loops and a matching spare tooled belt with 38/.357 cartridge loops.  Both rigs have oversized belts so they can be cut to fit as needed.  

Wait, there's more.  Also included are two new Hogue Pau Ferro grip sets for the XR-3 frame, one checkered and one plain and a pair of easily installed 39 oz trigger springs to reduce the rigger pull weight.

The revolver in the display case is for demonstration purposes only.  It is the same 50th Anniversary in .44 magnum but is not one of the matched pistols.  It has the smooth  “Bonded Ivory” grips.  It readily puts 18 rounds into a 4” circle at 25 yards using a generic load and I would expect the one in the matched set to do as well.

The SPR A1 is also available in a more compact model designated the A1a, chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO/308 Winchester with a 20” fluted cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel and a hard-chromed bore. The shorter barrel makes the A1a perfect for mid-range target shooting and tactical competition. The A1a has a one-piece steel MIL-STD 1913 optical rail with an additional 20 MOA of elevation built in. It’s matte black McMillan™ fiberglass stock has a close-radius upright grip, textured gripping surfaces and three sling mounting points.

Leupold's Mark 4 long-range/tactical riflescopes are arguably the most dependable, highest-performing riflescopes you'll find anywhere. Offering proven accuracy in the field, the scopes are everything a long-range competitive shooter, target shooter, or hunter could want.


The Mark 4 riflescope is ideal for long-range hunting or tactical use.



The scope includes a Mil Dot reticle.
Every component of the Mark 4 6.5-20x50 riflescope works together to help make every shot count. The scope starts with Leupold's Index Matched Lens System, which delivers unsurpassed sharpness, brightness, and contrast across the visual field for excellent target definition, even in low light. A Leupold exclusive, the system has nearly perfected the company's already impressive light management. The scope also offers side-focus parallax adjustments for fast, easy parallax focusing from 75 yards to infinity, no matter your shooting position. And all Mark 4 scopes provide absolute construction integrity, with a tough 30mm main tube and a fully waterproof exterior.

The Mark 4 6.5-20x50 riflescope is suitable for dual-use applications, with a design that works in both hunting and tactical environments. The scope performs admirably in long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise, long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association--men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more--rely on the accuracy and durability of Mark 4 scopes.

Other features include a Mil Dot reticle; finger-adjustable 1/4-MOA windage and elevation adjustments with audible, tactile clicks; and standard issue flip-open lens covers.

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement patrol officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor. The AR6720 represents a new generation of Colt rifle, which comes standard with an optics ready rail and a flip-up rear iron sight.

Colt’s use of the MaTech flip-up sight is unique among flip-up rear sights in that it has adjustment for both windage and elevation and its slender design allows for maximum peripheral vision when in use giving the shooter the most unobscured view of the target. These are also the reasons that the MaTech flip up rear sight has been the US Military standard for almost a decade.

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twists gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability.

The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones.

The AR6720 is a hybrid of Colt’s Government Carbine model AR6520 and Colt’s Flagship M4 Carbine model LE6920. This Lightweight Law Enforcement Carbine has a new roll mark of AR-15A4 recognizing Colt’s newest designation of an optics ready carbine.

Good Luck and Happy Shooting!

HS pro series stock, just like the ones used on M24's that the US Army snipers use. Is the standard stock for the X-40 rem rifles. Very solid stock made with Kevlar cloth, woven fiberglass, and uni directional carbon fiber. Features a full length aluminum bedding block and made for fully floated barrels. 

Badger Ordnance M5 DBM, detachable box magazine. These are the best of the dbm's without question. They use AI magazines, this will inclue 1-5round magazine and are easily purchasable online in either 5 or 10 round magazines. 

Save yourself the pain to have a stock inlet just to use the dbm. Just add your Rem 700 SA and you have a very accurate and functional system that can take tremendous punishment and remain precision accurate. If still using factory stocks this will likely half your group size at 100yd.

This would run $750 to get this new, save some money on this one in like new condition. Inletting for the DBM is ~$100
