Just to mention I really don't like to respond to emails without a phone number. I don't have to call you, but it is a curteousy to me and shows the level of interest. I figure if you don't want to talk to me about the gun, then you are not that interested in the gun and it's ok with me, 

RARE in .30-30 this gun is almost ALWAYS in .357, .44, or .45 colt, this one is NOT it is .30-30 and a wonderful pack gun. Here is the history of the gun, my son wanted to be like Dad, and so I bought him this because my Dad bought me my first .30-30. and when it came time to ""kill Bambi"" well... he just couldn't so I did, and he cried like hell. It broke my heart, but he grew up, moved on and here I still have the rifle, photos are included. It is NOT FACTORY NEW, hell I am not factory new, but this is darn near it! I looked up the value of these. no no no, not the internet lookups, I have 3 dealers in town that I use exclusively to buy and trade, and the books they use, the ONLY ones that dealers will approve of. This gun in this condition goes for $775+, the average is about $650.00 so I am not out of line here, mine is in wonderful shape! better than average WAY WAY better. Someone is going to get a great deal. I am willing to ship, but you pay shipping and only after funds have cleared. But it is better to keep it local, as this is a Colorado gun bought right here, and has stayed here it;s whole life. I wish you all the very best, may God bless you! I am looking to sell this not have you just look at it.

Here is what one guy is selling his Piece of Sh$^&t for! Look at the pittting and rust on the reciever, what a looser, but I know these go for that, and he'll get it. His is not ever going to be 85% condition overall NEVER, mine is 97+% and I am asking way less... and check out the NIB over $1000.00 after shipping and FFL transfer... (2nd link)

The metal finish is original, and the wood has a few minor dings and dents, but typical for it's age.  It shoots fine - very accurate - and the bore is very clean.  The second is a wall hanger out of Belgium, maybe?  Don't really know, but it's an old one.  The stock is broken in half, and the front piece missing.  The action still functions, but it isn't something that I'd want to fire modern ammunition in, and suggest you don't either.  Face to face in Monument if you want to take a look.  A bill of sale will be exchanged with cash, so bring ID.  Thanks for looking, and if you want more pictures of either rifle, just ask, and I'll send more."

I have 10 of these available and will split up if need be for $100 each. The cheapest you can purchase these for are on eBay for $160 and $200+ everywhere else on the internet. I purchased the wrong radios and the seller did not offer a return policy. My loss is your gain.

The Vertex Standard VX-231 provides wide band coverage, more signaling features and improved ergonomics* that adds up to a better return on your investment.


Improved Portability
A radio that won’t get in the way, the VX-231 is more compact and lightweight than the VX-160 series. A radio that is easier to carry with you on the job.

Wide Band Coverage for Added Value
One radio designed to cover the full band in the VHF and upper range of the UHF bands, which provides expanded options in frequencies to use.


More Scanning Options
While many radios provide 1 or 2 scanning options, the VX-231 radio gives you 4 additional scanning options for greater convenience and flexibility for the way you need your radios to perform. Options include: Priority, Dual Watch, Follow Me and Talk Around scan.


Exclusive Auto-Range Transponding System – ARTS
Only Vertex Standard radios are designed to inform you when you and another ARTS-equipped station are within communication range. If out of range for more than 2 minutes, your radio senses no signal has been received and beeps to alert you. The base station can then alert the field unit to move back in range. A great solution to keep your workers coordinated.

Additional Features
• 16 channel capacity
• Two programmable keys
• Flexible channel spacing: 12.5 kHz to 25 kHz
• Battery power save option
• Emergency
• Lone Worker

If your looking at this then you know that the rifle is a chanbered for .22LR. Its in excellent shape and is the older ALL metal version unlike the new polymer trigger 1's. This rifle was not made here Prescott, AZ., but in Southport, Conn. 
 The factory wood stock has been sanded down and re-cleared with a glossy coat. 
All I've done to it is put a scope base on it with a Barska 4x32 scope with weaver mounts, and a different buffer bolt.
 It currently is in a Butler Creek stainless folding stock which hasnt been shot in yet. 
I also have a Keystone Sporting Arms Revolution Yukon thumbhole stock for a .920 bull barrel in Cayenne color that I never got around to buying a bull barrel. This stock cost $180 + tax at Cabela's.
This rifle has had less than 500 rounds through it.

200 rds of .223 to get you started. Wont last long with the slide fire, but will get you hooked.
Black Tactical rifle case (not pictured).

There is well over 1600 dollars worth of stuff here, and thats well below what you would pay for it if you bought it yourself.

1300.00 firm cash price. Not hurting to sell it.

If you can buy it for the same price or less somewhere else, you'd better jump all over that.

Rifle is in excellent condition. accessories are like new or new. Slide Fire is like new with box. P-Mags are like new. .22 Conversion Kit and mags are like new, 2 of the mags havent even been trimmed to fit yet, so they are new.

I will not respond to ridiculous low-ball offers. I know what all of this stuff is worth and what it cost to buy it. And so far it seems most folks dont.

This is an excellent comprehensive setup and lots of fun, but I am a 1911 man and would much rather have more 1911's to add to my collection.

I am looking to trade this for a 1911 pistol + cash on your end, or just cash.

308,http://www.armslist.com/posts/392308,"For Sale:  CMMG MOD4SA complete lower with extras, minus stock body","Kingsport, Tri-cities, Tennessee",$ 230,"Listed On: Sunday, May 6, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have for sale a LIGHTLY USED, factory assembled CMMG MOD4SA lower, minus stock body. 

I am asking $230, firm.

This receiver comes with all of the lower parts, front take-down pin, fire control group, selector, plus a Magpul Enhanced Trigger Guard (the aluminum one - not the cheap plastic MOE version), Daniel Defense right-hand sling end plate adapter (which is cleanly staked to castle nut), pistol grip, magazine catch/release and 6 position mil-spec buffer tube. ***STOCK BODY NOT INCLUDED***

The lower is a takeaway from a factory CMMG rifle. It has a low round count with no issues.

There is a little finish wear where the charging handle moves back and forth, but that's typical wear and not detrimental to function. I tried to get a good picture of it, just so you know what you're getting.

Sorry, I am not interested in trades at this time. My price is firm. 

I can either ship the lower to your FFL ($15 ship fee, plus make sure your dealer will accept a firearm from a non-licensed person), or we can do a FTF in a public setting in the Kingsport area (legal residents of Tennessee only). 

Out of state buyers must go through an FFL, per ATF interstate sales rules. For FTF I will ask to see your TN driver's license or state ID. If identification cannot be provided I cannot sell you the lower.

Obviously no sales to minors, felons, or anyone who cannot legally own this firearm.

For FTF I do not accept checks or money orders. CASH ONLY.

Serious buyers only. All sales are final.

Attached are some pictures of the actual lower. If you have questions or would like more photos, feel free to email me via the ""contact seller"" button. Thanks for looking."

Hi, I’m selling an excellent condition Smith and Wesson M&P 40 Compact with FACTORY NIGHT SIGHTS. This is a no internal lock, no thumb safety, no magazine safety model (Model # 109303). This gun has less than 250 rounds through it and has had no failures. I’m selling because it sits in the safe and it needs to be loved and shot more often.

This package will include:
M&P 40 Compact
Factory Night Sights
(Model 109303 - the most desirable due to no extra “safety” features)
1 10 round flat bottom (factory) magazine
1 10 round finger extension (factory) magazine
All Factory Paperwork
Factory Hard Case

I’m asking $475 FIRM, no taxes, no FFL transfer fees and no hassle. CASH ONLY. I will require a copy of your MO Drivers License and we will complete a bill of sale. This gun without night sights will cost you $550 at a local shop and the night sights are a $100 upgrade!

Glock 26 Gen 4 with NS

The previous (and original) owner said he had put perhaps 500 rounds through it in it's lifetime, the majority of them in the 10mm cylinder.

These were limited production guns, only 5,000 were made if I recall correctly. This one is in pretty fine condition, as it's been shot very little. However the previous owner did replace the button that allows the removal of the cylinder after losing the original during a shooting excursion. If you look closely you can see a slight difference in the coloring between the replacement and the guns finish.

I'm trying to slowly sell off guns that I just don't shoot. I figure it's better to get them into the hands of someone who will enjoy them and pay down my student loans with the cash.

Of course, I'm always open to trade for things that might collect less dust in the safe. I'm open to a trade for SIGs, a decent AR or AK, or quality wheel guns. It never hurts to ask about other trades, but I'm not really in the market for any hunting riles or mil surps.

Pricing for these seems to be all over the place, since they are ""rare"" and ""collectible"" (but arguably not super desirable due to the unusual rounds it accepts). I'm asking $700, which is smack in the middle of the prices I've seen in various corners of the internet.

Comes in original box (although it appears the previous owners children doodled a bit on it) with manual, a field holster and a handful of 10mm rounds."

Selling my stainless Para P13 commander length pistol in 45acp.  I got this pistol in trade, and only shot 2 flawless magazines through it.  It shoots great, but it just sits in the safe, so it has to go.  Previous owner said that he got it in trade from a cop who shot it little, and previous owner didn't shoot it much either.  It shows little wear, but has a triangular mark on the right side of the slide, toward the rear.  I bought an extra Para Ordnance magazine, and built a kydex holster for it.  Sorry no trades; I have a specific purchase in mind.

BERETTA USA CORP             Storm Sub Compact    

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol is the most advanced sub-compact
sidearm of its kind. Built around Beretta's latest Px4 modular technology,
the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large
frame firepower. Available in two calibers (9mm and .40 S&W), the Px4 Storm
Sub-Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system,
providing a more compact and lighter weight system. A stainless steel
barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant. The pistol
adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable back straps
(included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides
of the slide for easy access by all shooters. A reversible magazine release
button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a
smaller and larger size button (optional). An interchangeable slide catch
can also be replaced with an optional extended profile configuration. A
standard Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) allows for an array of after market
accessories.

I cherry picked the best crates of these over the past 2 months, kept some that fit holes in my collection and selling the rest. I am pretty much just recouping my gas/cost so prices are firm and pretty darn good considering these are the BEST you could possibly get.
These were chosen for their overall excellent matching Serial numbers condition and will all make great shooters or collectors pieces. These fire 7.62x54r(compare to .308) which costs around $80 per 440 rounds.

Hey guys, I have a Savage Model 10ML-I (not II).  I don't know much about it other than it has very little use.  

I do know that this Rifle is not in production anymore but, it is still very desirable if you are a muzzle load fan.  The actual rifle shows very little to no ware on it (small amount on the top of the but of the stock and some dings on the scope).  No known issues or marks on the actual barrel or anywhere else on the thing.

Please see all pics and feel free to PM me on this.

Rifle comes with original box, all paper work, originally fired bullets, Bushnell Sportview scope as well as all everything else that is pictured."

Inherited from my father whom inherited it from his father.  Don't ask me how/why he had it other than he was originally from Boston.

Had it inspected and appraised by three different FFL Dealers yesterday and they ranged from $800-$1000 although bluebook showed high being $495.

The reason for their appraisal was that it is in EXCELLENT condition.  To my knowledge and their inspection, it has only had 10 rds through it and isn't even broken in.

Includes two 32 round magazines.

It is semi-auto and perfectly legal as-is in Oregon as a pistol.  I would prefer FTF.  If it goes out of state, you are responsible for making sure it is legal in your state. I haven't sold out of state and I'll charge extra for headaches.

The gun is going because it doesn't fit in my collection.  Will consider trades,  especially AMT AUTOMAG .30 Carbine, Ruger Mini 30, Bolt Action 7.62 x39mm or several revolvers/lever action guns.  Will consider non-firearm related items but make it worth my time.  Thanks!"

This is an early production gun of the model 625-2, which isn't a revision, it actually started at 625-2 strangely enough! Another strange thing with the early production of this model is that the right side of the barrel is rolled/stamped with ""45 CAL MODEL OF 1988"", which later that same year changed to ""MODEL OF 1989"", since that was the actual year this model was released. Later productions within the same year were laser etched not rolled, which is the usually the more desirable of the two with collectors. There is controversy as to how many of the early guns were produced, but several sources say that only 1,500 were made with these markings. This one is in excellent shape, and comes with the original Pachy grips with the window in the bottom to allow viewing of the s/n. The safety & instruction manual is included.

I am not a ""wannabe gun dealer"".  I have posted WTB threads here and on craigslist in the past, but have not posted on either in quite some time, and it was only one thread every so often when I thought about it.  I stopped because I wasn't getting any contact in response to my ads, so I quit wasting my time.  The ONLY thing I’ve ever posted a WTB about was shotshell reloaders or reloading equipment.

I'm certainly not ""buying and reselling to incapable buyers who cannot pass a background check and cannot legally buy a firearm"", and resent that implication (esp for the fact that I’ve never posted a WTB for a firearm).  I've only ever purchased one firearm off of Armslist (and none off of craigslist), and it was for my personal use, and when I sold it, it was parted out and sold on gunbroker, with the receiver being shipped to an FFL on the buyers end.  I'm EXTREMELY conscientious of all the laws required when dealing with firearms (probably more so than most people), and am the holder of an 03 FFL (C&R).

I am positive I’ve never had any sort of interaction with this individual, as I’ve never had anyone come to me when they were trying to sell an item.  I’ve ALWAYS gone to the seller when I’ve purchased on Armslist and craiglist, arrived at the agreed upon time (or slightly early), always paid cash, and always paid asking price or pretty close (after we reached an amiable compromise on the price).

Followup- It appears that the original poster either deactivated his listing after redacting my email address (thankfully).  Just thought I'd add this so my response makes sense, and it didn't seem like I was talking to myself LOL.

It was made in 12/1978 and rearsenaled 9/1991.  Stamped matching parts (locking block renumbered by the arsenal).  Bore is excellent and shiny.  This is the lastest version with extended slide serations, heavier slide, and frame reinforcing pin.  Finish is near perfect with no holster wear.  Comes with 3 origional Walther P1 marked mags and leather holster.  It is import marked on the right side of the slide.  This was still factory wax paper wrapped when I got it and I've fired 3 mags through it, it performed flawlessly.  I have another in rougher condition that I shoot a lot.

I have smoothed the inside of the reciever for easier cycling and added a slight chamfer to the barrel where the bullet feeds from the magazine.  Both are common mods to make them more reliable.

I have or have owned examples of all the AR-7 manufacturers, and fit and finish of the Armalites are usually better.  This one is in very good condition with at least 80 of the finish on the barrel and reciever, with some wear marks and a few small chips.
