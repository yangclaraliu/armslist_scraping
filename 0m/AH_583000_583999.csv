The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided.

If you dont know anything about PWS here is a little bit about it... 

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available. Top tier quality, and a much better design/build than any other 5.56 pistol on the market."

$2000 for the PWS (out the door)
$150 Noveski Flaming Pig Flash Suppressor 
$350 ALG Combat Trigger tuned by Geissele and fine tuned by a smith.
$400 Viridian Green laser with flashlight that strobes

If you dont know anything about PWS here is a little bit about it... 

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available. Top tier quality, and a much better design/build than any other 5.56 pistol on the market."

Want the suppressor look and feel without all the paperwork hassle and transfer tax expenses? Now with our WALTHER P22 THREAD ADAPTER WITH THREAD PROTECTOR AND FAKE SUPPRESSOR COMBO, you get ALL THREE PIECES FOR ONE LOW PRICE! 

Our .22 LR FAKE SUPPRESSOR is as close to a real suppressor as you can get without paying the tax stamp and it will work on any .22LR firearm that has the barrel threaded 1/2x28 TPI.  Its CNC precision machined from solid aircraft grade aluminim with a durable hard black anodized finish and its professionally laser engraved identically to our real NFA registered suppressors. Since its a fake suppressor, the sound is not reduced and bullet impact is not changed. Although, many customers do prefer the weight and balance improvement that the suppressor provides.

The FAKE SUPPRESSOR easily screws on to your Walther P22 with our WALTHER THREAD ADAPTER ASSEMBLY (thread adapter and thread protector) which is included in this money saving combo.

It does not have the Lazy& but is an example of the nice high polished blue that came on these older barrels.  Super accurate so why would I sell it?  Just acquired a Browning Nomad that is harder to scope and with open sights I shoot it a little better than my 41 and I still have 3 other barrels for the 41!  The Nomad is a little lighter and will become my open sight carry piece.  Will ship insured delivery for $300 CONUS.  Satisfaction guaranteed with a 3 day return for refund minus shipping.

The objective outside dimension is 44mm. I used it at 30' on the lower powers in the basement on an air pistol with great success. This is one of the few handgun scopes that have the adjustable objective to remove parallax that was ever made. Tightens up your groups and provides a crisp in focus view from short to long range.  It also has the posi-lock feature that adds a little to its value.  Took it to Burris since they are local and had them look it over. Refilled with nitrogen and leak tested with no problems found ready for action. Lifetime warranty to whoever has it in possession by Burris (great company).  Does not come with the rings pictured but they are available with scope purchase for an extra $30 (Burris Signature Zee w/inserts).  I just removed the rings by request and discovered some very minor ring marks that I took some macro pictures of, lenses are perfect.  Only $240 so email your phone number to purchase or ask questions and I will call you with mine.

I've added a Mesa Tactical Urbino stock with adjustable cheek riser and recoil pad. This pad is amazing. Can shoot 100+ rounds at a time and your shoulder won't even notice it.

It also has the Mesa 6 shell side saddle, and their top rail. I still have the original screws to blank out the rail if it's not your thing, and of course have the factory trigger group pins if you don't like the saddle.

I've added a Nordic Components charging handle, because I didn't like the factory one. Also there is a Nordic Components mag clamp on the front, with spaces for rail sections on either side if you want to mount something there.

The bolt release was polished and cleaned up by Rob the gunsmith at Bowers Tactical in Centennial, to make it easier to release the bolt quickly. He also installed an oversized safety for quicker release.

I will include a ""tactical"" shotgun scabbard with as much MOLLE as you could want. Attached is a zippered pouch where I keep the cleaning supplies like a boresnake, brush and other cleaning utensils. Those will be included as well.

I'm asking $900 for the package. I'll include 10 rounds of 00 Buck as well, so this is a shooter's package, ready to take to the range. I still have the manual and an unfilled warranty card.

This shotgun is no exception.  It was purchased by my father several years back but was rarely used as he was more of a collector than shooter.

This was imported in late 1994 and I bought it new in early 1995. It has never been fired and has been stored taken down, with the slide removed and the 2 magazines empty. Well oiled and protected, the gun is truly in new in box condition......VERY hard to find one as such. If you travel to many gun shows, you will find well  USED ones selling for near my price.  This pistol is both single and double action......... It comes with an original cardboard factory box, the 2 8 round magazines and a takedown tool.  These were banned from import many years ago, so the supply of ones in this condition is near impossible to find. There are  NO defects on the finish, the bubbly area on the slide  is just oil build up."

Almost every family has great grandpa's old shotgun. It may have been in the family for generations! It is a keepsake but needs to be put into better shape. Parts may be missing. It may be rusty and the wooden parts deteriorated. You may simply want the old thing professionally cleaned -OR- you may want it put into LIKE NEW shape! Perhaps you wish to present this family treasure, fully restored for Christmas? Don't wait. It may take us DAYS to complete your project - once we get yours in line. 
We have a huge inventory or antique and hard-to-find parts along with hundreds of stocks and forearms. If we don’t have the antique part we may have to order it or – even MAKE it. As an example, most of the guns we restore are over 100 years old! As of right now, firearms pre 1899 are considered antique and are EXEMPT from federal law & ATF rules.
We can offer Professional Results. Your family heirloom will look, ""Good as great Grandpa bought it!""
We are not a dealer and do not sell guns. However, we can restore your family treasure to its original out-of-the box appearance. Each project is priced based upon the customer's request and the current condition of the piece. Most of our projects are old shotguns and rifles. We accept antique gun projects from all states.

One-Piece Tube - rugged, aluminum alloy chassis maximizes strength and waterproofing. Extra-high Ring Height puts scope's bore center 37mm (1.46 inches) above the base height. Commonly used for mounting with a Flat Top AR15, providing absolute co-witness w/ iron sights Mounting ring fits Weaver or Picatinny style base. Waterproof - optics are sealed with O-rings to prevent moisture, dust, and debris from getting inside the scope. Fogproof - nitrogen purged to inhibit internal fogging, for reliable work in harsh weather Shockproof - high recoil rating. Tested with .375 H&H Magnum for 1000 rounds. Rugged one-piece 30 mm aluminum alloy tube Parallax Free - allows for rapid shooting with both eyes open, without concern for parallax shooting error. Parallax free beyond 50 yards; less than one-inch error closer than 50 yards. Operating Temperature - rated from -40 degrees to +140 degrees Fahrenheit. Unlimited Eye Relief - non-critical eye relief for rapid target acquisition. Adjustable Dot Intensity allows adjusting of the dot intensity according to viewing conditions. Night Vision Mode Sets the brightness to the lowest possible level-an illumination level that generally is not seen without use of a night vision device. 2x Optic Doubler Screw-in - doubler provides extra magnification for longer distance shooting. Battery Life - 6-hour auto-shutdown feature maximizes battery life. Typical battery life in normal mode of operation: Maximum brightness of 130 hours (Red) | 420 hours (Green); Minimum brightness of 4400 hours (Red) | 4700 hours (Green). Typical battery life in night vision mode: Maximum brightness of 7200 hours (Red) | 7200 hours (Green); Minimum brightness of 7600 hours (Red) | 8000 hours (Green)

This gun is in fine working order, all original, and with an added RedHead scope.  My father owned this gun before I was even born.  He is now 94 and in a nursing home.  For the past 12 years it was used to shoot squirrels in his backyard.  He added the scope because he couldn't see anymore....lol.

I learned how to shoot with this rifle at about age 6 or 7.

It shoots any 22 round from bird shot to LR.  I am not a gun expert or collector.  It just doesn't need to be in his or my house and its time to sell it.

Looking at pricing guides I have chosen $425.  I would not put it at excellent condition but I would add value for the scope.

New ones are crazy expensive to buy now.


I have posted 3 pics here.  I have more I can send you that shows the internals and condition."

PRICE REDUCED FROM $425. LAST CALL!!!

H&R Pardner Pump Protector 12 gauge pump action shotgun with 3"" chamber (can fire up to 3"" shells). 18.5"" smooth bore barrel. 6-shell magazine capacity (6+1 total capacity). 

Only 20 slugs have been shot through this gun! 

For those unfamiliar with the Pardner Pump, it is basically a Remington 870 clone. The only real difference is where the barrel lug lies. But almost any Remington 870 accessory/part will work on this shotgun. And the H&R is built every bit as tough and tougher in some areas as the Remington. Just google it, read the reviews and see for yourself. 

Here are the goodies/extras: 

- Blackhawk Knoxx pistol grip adjustable length buttstock
- Blackhawk Knoxx fore grip 
- Wilson Combat +1 magazine extension (original magazine tube capacity was 5 shells, but is now 6 shells with this extension)
- Tacstar 4-shell side saddle
- 25 shell bandolier (shown in ammo picture) 
- A total of 175 shells:
   - 100 Nobel Sport, 12 pellet 00 buckshot @ 1290 fps
   - 15 Federal Premium, 8 pellet 00 buckshot @ 1325 fps (not shown, loose)
   - 25 Olin, 8 pellet buckshot @ 1325 fps
   - 15 Winchester Super X, 9 pellet 00 buckshot @ 1325 fps

I have about $575 into this package, including the ammo. I am asking $350. This thing shoots great and the action is smooth. This gun is nearly brand new.
