Included are an extra magazine (two total), original box and papers, and a Passport brand belt holster.

The gun is nickel with Rosewood grips.  Both magazines are OEM Taurus.  The holster is a nylon Passport which can work for right or left hand carry.  I have carried this gun several times myself and really like the Passport holster.

A female customer bought this gun, against my advice, for concealed carry.  After a week she brought it back and bought a revolver (my original advice).  
This gun has had less than 50 rounds fired through it ( Iknow this because she brought the original box of ammo back with the gun, with maybe 20 rounds used).  It is very clean and like new.  

The barrel tips up for easy loading of the first round, which makes it an ideal choice for ladies who don't like to pull the slide back to chamber the first round.  

The PT-22 is single action only with an internal hammer.  Very safe to carry fully loaded.  

I am a dealer, so can ship to any other dealer after I get a copy of their FFL.  If you live in Ohio and want to meet me I can do that, but will still have to complet the 4473 and call in the background check.

Here is the partial list of everything, there is more but just this list is worth more than I am asking, so consider the “other stuff” a bonus
Everything came off of either a, 1995 M/T or 1991 4runner A/T With 3VZE, 3.0L

1995 (I installed a 3.4L so I don’t need them, I just need some room)
Cylinder Heads,  Excellent Condition with oversize valves and Hi-Pro camshaft. These were just pressure checked and deck checked for flatness (warping) by CHS in Oregon, 10,000 miles on them before sending them out to be checked (they were checked because I blew a head gasket)
Clyinder Block, 10,000 miles on it since install, Rebuilt by CHS Portland OR. Includes High Compression Pistons (.50 over) with hand fitted aluminum connecting rods, Oil pan, Hi-pro oil pump, Crankshaft etc
Distributor, Toyota/Denso, Not aftermarket
Coil/Ignitor
Throttle Body
Cruise Control with Cruise ECU (2 ECU’s)
ECU for M/T (2 of these, both work)
LUK Clutch Disk and Pressure Plate, New Never Used (installed then removed before I started the engine, I decided I needed a heavier clutch since I went to 3.4)
Timing Belt with tensioner and gears (put on 10,000 miles ago)
Knock sensor (replaced when motor was done)
Valve Covers
Various Sheet Metal/Plastic parts (ie front cover)

1991 (pulled at 162,000 with spun rod bearing)
Block, Disassembled, only problem I can see is the spun rod bearing, crank, cylinders, pistons/piston rods all look good
Cylinder Heads and cam, All look good and unwarped, good set to rebuild or use as exchange
I’m sure I am forgetting some parts but you get the idea
I would prefer that it be picked up at my house due to the number of items and weight (sort of heavy to load from 1 vehicle to another) but if need be I can load it up and meet. If that’s what needs to happen to sell it I would only ask for $ to cover my gas
Asking $700.00 obo
I will take a partial trade of some exhaust work or firearms or firearm related but need at least $400 cash from the deal

Thank you
I have listed and taken calls, went to meet people, waited for people who said they were interested and wanted the parts but …. I guess they got lost, forgot how to dial their phone and/or had an emergency situation …. Whatever the reason they never made it. (it goes without saying I am only guessing why they never showed, they just never did)
So back to the subject at hand. I am selling as a complete lot with Everything for one price. I might separate but I really don’t have the time or energy to sell it piece by piece considering I wasted my whole weekend with deadbeats."

Included  are two Bersa OEM Magazines, one is a 10 round, the other is a 17 round.  

I purchased this gun when it was first introduced and was only available with a 10 round magazine because of the stupid high capacity magazine ban.  Thankfully that idiotic piece of legislation died and I bought a 17 round mag for it.  

This gun has less than 100 rounds fired through it.  It functions and shoots great.  Ambidextrious safety and decocker, abmidextrious magazine release (move the release from one side to the other as needed) makes this a very versitile full size pistol.

It comes with what you see in the pic.  The factory strap, 2-thirty round factory mags, and a 3-12x44mm Leapers Accushot Scope.

It has the factory made MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Tri-Rail with a Knights Armament Vertical grip.  I still have the original factory grip which I'll include in the sale.

I also have the Neu-Trigger installed, which dramatically cleaned up the trigger pull.  

You'll be the most popular person at the range when you show up with the FS2000.  I always have shooters & staff asking me questions about it and telling me how much they wish they had one.

It functions 100% and works perfectly.

My asking price is $1450, and this ISN'T up for negotiation, so dont' send me low ball offers via email.  Please don't think that if you show up to my door with some amount less than $1450 that I'll take it just because it's in front of me, because I won't.   I stand firm on my price because you're getting a great firearm with all the accessories.

If you search on Gunbroker or GunsAmerica you'll see that my package deal is better than what anyone is selling on there.

Please don't ask me if I'm including ammo.  That drives me nuts.

I'm not too familiar with these rifles so feel free to ask questions or get me to take more pictures of certain areas.

Rifle has a Lyman 57WJS rear sight on it and a dovetailed blade front sight with a small brass or copper insert. On the top of the receiver are the markings C.L.S. I am not sure what they stand for. The bolt may or may not have been bent back a bit, I just don't know what bolts came with what models. All the metal parts I can see match the receiver though.

The stock is in less than great shape just because of how many modifications were attempted. A pistol grip was added and screwed and glued on. Looks like doing so cracked the wrist area and there is a brass rod going though. It was either to reinforce it, or was the original problem. The rifle has a decelerator pad added and is missing the sling swivels.

Overall it has a few problems but should be a good source of hard to find parts or at least a sporter if you wanted to rebarrel it. I think it is currently in the original caliber of 8x58r.

I'm selling a mildly sporterized 7.65mm Argentine M91 Mauser rifle. It was made in Berlin, Germany by DWM, under contract for the Argentine military. If you're not familiar with old Mausers, this is a bolt-action rifle with a top loading, 5-round, non-removable magazine, and adjustable iron sights.

Years ago when these Argentines were first imported in large numbers, it was common for folks to ""sporterize"" them by curving down the bolt handle and reshaping the clunky military stock to a more sporting profile. That's exactly what was done to this one. The barrel, receiver and action have not been modified.

The rifle shoots well and the bolt draw is super smooth. Overall it's in uncommonly nice condition for an ex-military gun that's 100+ years old. Yes, there are an assortment of small marks and surface scratches in the finish, but nothing out of the ordinary for a gun that's been taken good care of for most of its long life. The bore has nice strong rifling with some dark patches -- much better than average for its age but certainly not minty fresh either. The stock is a beautiful tiger-stripe maple, one of the prettiest I've seen on any Mauser. I just haven't been using this gun and would rather turn it into cash or something I would use more often.

In the pictures below it's the rifle on the right (the ugly one the left is already gone).

The receiver stamp says MAUSER MODELO ARGENTINO 1891 DEUTSCHE WAFFEN UND MUNITIONSFABRIKEN BERLIN.

Asking price: $175 ?

Possible trades: .22 rifle, pump shotgun, handguns of all kinds, inexpensive single-shot rifle (NEF, H&R, Rossi, Rem Spartan, etc.), or some boxes of ammo in common handgun calibers (.357mag, .38spl, .380acp, .44mag, .45acp, or 9mm). Other trades possible if it's something of value to me. If you're not sure, just throw it out there. Worst I can say is 'no thanks.'

I also have 100+ rounds of surplus FMJ 7.65 ammo that can go with the rifle for a few extra $ or the right trade.

As you know only 180 or so of  these ""evil looking"" shotguns were imported in the 1980s before being banned.  Enough said !

     However,  I would also like to sell you this amazing ""TRIDENT"" SAIGA 12 muzzle brake.  It was made by 78 years old man.   He made 3 of them and I bought one for $150 bucks.  His name is Bill and this TRIDENT took him 8 hours to make.   There are 3 more TRIDENT's available and I told Bill I would post them for him.    He made this TRIDENT muzzle brake on a Sears mini lathe and drill press out of his garage.  Ridiculous Quality!!   I think $150 bucks is a joke for 8 hours of machining time,  but that is what Bill told me to sell them for.   I am going to help an old man earn a few measly bucks.  I am going to post these TRIDENT's on EBAY and SAIGA forum as well.  There are only 3 TRIDENT's available at this time, but Bill will make more as long as they sell???   You will not be disappointed in the quality.   If you want one let me know.  I can meet you in Indy North side or I can ship you one.  The money will go directly to Bill.

1. The name is of the muzzle brake is ""TRIDENT""
2. The price is $150.  $5 bucks more if you want it shipped in the 
    USA.  
3.  Email me to Place an Order.  Paypal, cash, Postal order, etc...
4. The muzzle brake is made from 3 Stainless Steel prongs and
    the body is Aluminum.  It is light weight.
5.  The ""TRIDENT"" threads easily on to the end of your Saiga 12 
     barrel.
6.  The Stainless prongs slide forward and lock into place.  The prongs also
     slide backwards and lock into place.  There is a simple, SPRING loaded, 
     locking mechanism which locks the prongs in a slide forward position 
     and a slide backward position. 
7. Get a TRIDENT now for $150 bucks, because i do not think this price 
    will last.  I will make sure the $150 go's directly to Bill."

I can throw in a Black & Decker industrial heavy duty sander/angle grinder for the right deal.  Its a great tool and extremely strong, I just have no use for it. I mean it is heavy duty with a 7"" disc.  I'd say it's worth about $150 or so. That's what I see it sell for in dirtier condition than mine.

If I value the pistol at $350 (kind of an average value), and the value of the angle grinder, that's $500 to $550 worth.  Any takers?  I will also throw in any other discs I have to fit it. Email me for pics.

Recently I had it checked by the Bushnell factory after I took it off my rifle and they gave it a clean bill of health.

All I can say is this....If you have never fired a P220 you will love it. Dead on accurate even for a newb. I will also say my P220 has been far more accurate than any of my 1911's ever where. Yes, I said it

Included:

P220R w/brite night sights
Blade-tech holster rig
6 x mags

Bonus= Butt load of ammo for the right deal. That includes: Speer Gold Dot, Golden Sabers and ball-range loads WWB etc. If I remember correctly there is at least 700 rnds. Probably more and will double check.

HAND MADE Saiga 12 Muzzle Break, Toad Sticker, Bayonet, etc....  If you own a SAIGA 12, you need one of these.   IT simply threads onto the end of your barrel.   This ""TRIDENT"" SAIGA 12 muzzle brake is made by a 78 year old man.   It takes him forever to make one of these.  Ridiculous Quality and it is $99 bucks.   I am trying to help a 78 year old man get his life back.   There are only a couple of TRIDENT's left???     If you want one now is the time.   I am not sure if more will be made?   I assure you that for $99 bucks, you will not be disappointed. 

1. The name is of the muzzle brake is ""TRIDENT""
2. The price is $99 and $8 bucks to ship it in the USA only.
3. The muzzle brake is made from 3 Stainless Steel prongs and
    the body is Aluminum.  It is 11 ounces.
4.  The ""TRIDENT"" threads easily on to the end of your Saiga 12 barrel.
5.  The Stainless prongs slide forward and lock into place.  The prongs also slide backwards
    and lock into place.  There is a simple, SPRING loaded, locking mechanism which 
    locks the prongs in a slide forward position and a slide backward position. 
7. I will make sure the $99 go's directly to the old guy who made it.
8. The following statements in red letters are to protect me from crazy people.   

CHECK YOUR LOCAL and STATE LAWS BEFORE ORDERING

1. By purchasing this TRIDENT and having me ship it, you are stating it is 100% legal for you to OWN & RECEIVE this item!

2. By purchasing from this TRIDENT from me you certify that you are purchasing the product for lawful purposes and will not supply them to others in violation of their local laws if any.

3. By purchasing, you are are assuming all civil and criminal liabilities for purchasing the product. 

4. I will not be held responsible for the use of this item.  Although it is functional and 100% metal, it is not intended to stab trees and doors.     I am sure FLESH is OK, but generally speaking I do not want to be responsible for your foolishness."

I did upgrade a little and add Meprolight night sights and buy an extra magazine, for a total of three.

Prefer a FTF in my area, but if needed I'm sure we could work something out.

My main interest is handguns, but feel free to make me an offer on what you have. Worst I can do is say, ""No thanks.""

Ok guys....Here's the deal, If you are local, and you want to purchase this weapon,  I require a background check at the local gun shop. Due to threatening legislation. I will not be added to the list of arrogant fools who choose sell firearms to people who should not have one. If you are legit you shouldn't have a problem with it. If you have a problem with it you'r probably not legit. If you don't agree with it, Don't buy it..."

$2000 non negotiable (with the new gasblock) or 1800 without. I know this is expensive, and it is not for everyone. But if you want a semi auto sniper rifle that is capable of what this is then it is a fair price.

Keep in mind this has a 2 stage match trigger, best hand new picked and slugged/aligned  barrel I could find with matching #kit, 10 degree crown, best of 20 1p21 scopes 




This is a prototype weapon I built,,,it is still not serial #ed but will serial # it before I send it off with you. 

I can give this a custom serial # and/or a custom model # of your choice.
Yes.....I can do that, I am a firearm manufacturer. I will electro etch everything in and can do a custom design/insignia around the serial area if you like.


This reciever started out as a full piece of 4ft x 8 ft flat steel that was, cut out bent, pressed, indented, machined down, welded, and hardended.

This reciever was completely made by me,,,not a 80% that was finished, or a store bought piece, I can show you my dies and custom tooling for making these receivers.

The rest of the gun is like new military demil parts kit, with matching numbers, threaded barrel, and the infamus safety detent sear kit that you never see with these guns when they come in with the third axis pin. Which is not illeagal to posess but once installed this becomes a NFA ""class three"" weapon by ATF standard.

The scope is a 1p21 sniper scope, it was designed for use on a machine gun, but the snipers found it to be a great scope and adopted it so. It is an auto auto ranging scope to automatically compensate for bullet drop from 300 meters to 1300 meters (about .8 miles.) This scope lets you shoot 200-300 meters, and if aquire a target @ 600 meters, you just turn the zoom to 6, and you are zeroed in automatically. then if you see another target @ 1300 meters you turn your scope to 9 (for 900 meters) and use your lowest chevron and you are automaticaly zeroed @ 1300 and ready to fire. You can zoom it back out to 300 and you are automatically zeroed back it.

With this scope you can only use 1 type of bullet,,,a 149-152 grain bullet with the same ballistic coefficient as the 7n1 sniper ammo. 


(keep in mind that 7n1 and 7n14(AP) ammo just surplus ammo with better quality control and care and a bit of inner changes (added air pocket) ,,,,nothing extremely special about it. I had some ammo custom handloaded special for this gun,,,,I have spent alot of time and money finding and having my reloader make these custom rounds for me.


These make the 7n1 look like basic surplus junk! This ammo is very accurate after months and months of playing with bullets and powders we found a combo that is a perfect match for this barrel and scope, @ 300, 600, 900  and 1300 meters. @ 1300 metes I can hold 3 shot groups in a 24"" pattern, on a cool calm day from a viced lead sled. That is very good for a semi auto thin barrel rifle, and a 150+/- grain bullet!

comes with 4 magazines, and 100 rounds of ammo,  and a muzzle brake that cuts the recoil down in half of what it is with the muzzle brake in the pic. Works really well, just looks big and ugly.
REDACTED


Also I am just about finished with my own adjustable gas block, turning this into a bolt action, and with the flip of a switch, back to a semi auto. That should help the accuracy even more.

when it is finished I will want $200 more with the new gasblock,,,well because this gas block looks cool, and it is either on or off,,,not using a set screw like the cheap $100 ones found on the net that look like a big gaudy Klondike bar sitting on your barrel.

I have a second version of this in the works now that will shoot a .308 bullet and have (about) the same bullet drop as the .311 762x54r bullet now used. This next rifle will have the fast switch adjustable gas block installed and have a 26"" 1"" fluted bull barrel. Taking up alot of time and money, so the funds from this gun will go to making that one. 

that should cover it,,,any questions please call. Also serious buys can view a shoot with this gun,,,,,I have 300, 900 and 1300 meter targets set up on my property in Morganton on the top of the mountain. We can go, set up the targets, I will shoot and you can see what this rifle can do. SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY!

I'd put the bluing at 97% and the wood at 90%. It is a standard, and NOT a sweet 16. All numbers match.

Stock & forend are in great shape with handling marks and slight lacquer wear. The stock still retains its original integrity, with NO splits or cracks. 

Overall, it's in great condition for an older gun. The barrel is 28” in length, is chambered for 2.75” shells, has a solid rib and a fixed FULL choke. The underside of the barrel has a rub spot, as most of these models do. 

The gun is in excellent mechanical condition and shoots great. I'm not interested in trades at the moment, unless you have a similar Browning automatic in a 12 gauge or a Beretta 390 synthetic."

All Kimber pistols in centerfire calibers have a Loaded Chamber Indicator Port.™ When a round is chambered and light is available, the shell casing should be visible through the slot at the rear of the barrel hood. 

All slides and frames are paired in the early stages of production and travel through the factory together, ensuring optimum fitting of every part. This is one reason Kimber pistols have unequaled performance and dependability. 

Custom features like high ride beavertail grip safety, extended thumb safety and Commander-style hammer are part of every Kimber pistol. All parts are made inside the Kimber factory, ensuring quality control. 

The Kimber Custom sets the performance standard for production 1911 pistols. 
Models are offered with a choice of fixed, adjustable or night sights, and in 
matte or polished finishes. Both carbon steel and stainless steel versions are available. Common features include the Kimber Firing Pin Safety™, designated by “II” in the model name, along with rounded and blended edges for comfortable carry. Barrels, barrel bushings, chambers and triggers are all machined to exacting match grade dimensions. Ejection ports are lowered and flared, and sights are mounted in dovetails machined into the slide. Chamberings include .45 ACP, 9mm, 10mm and 38 Super.

New for 2010, the Tx4 presents yet another solution in Beretta’s line of home defense options. The shotgun incorporates decades of Beretta’s experience perfecting the gas operated semi-automatic design.
The reduced felt recoil is complemented by the infallible reliability Beretta shotguns are known for. Weighing under 6 ½ pounds, the compact Tx4 with its 18” barrel is very maneuverable, while maintaining a 5+1 round capacity.
Like the Cx4, the shotgun’s length of pull may be adjusted with ½” spacers (one included), while the soft rubber grip inlays on the stock and fore-end ensure a firm grip in all situations.
A metal Picatinny rail is mounted to the receiver to accept your optics or the included rugged and fully adjustable ghost ring sight. Adopting Beretta’s new Optimabore HP choke tube system, the included choke may be replaced with several optional accessories.

Like the rest of the Storm family, the Tx4 may be accessorized to meet the demanding needs of today’s shooter.

When:
October 29-30, 2011.  Event starts at 08:30 AM.

Where:
Hillside Plinkers Range
2676 Browns Creek Rd.
Williamsburg, KY 40769
N36.78239 W84.09265

This event is open to everyone.  Project Appleseed is an activity of The Revolutionary War Veterans Association, a 501(c)(3) all volunteer, non-political, non-profit organization, dedicated to teaching every American our shared heritage and history as well as traditional rifle marksmanship skills.  You may shoot anything from a .22 rimfire (the Ruger 10/22 and Marlin 795 are popular) to a centerfire such as an AR, AK, SKS, M1A or M1.  You will shoot approximately 250 rounds per day as you try to qualify as a Rifleman (210 Points) on a modified version of the AQT (Army Qualification Test) course of fire.

There are only 20 slots open for this clinic, so pre-registration is highly encouraged to make sure a spot on the line is reserved for you.  Politics are not discussed at Appleseed shoots, except for the politics of 1775.  NOTE: Participation in an Appleseed shoot meets the marksmanship requirement of the Civilian Marksmanship Program to purchase a vintage ""US Rifle, Cal. .30, M1"" (aka ""Garand rifle"") at a DEEP discount.  The Revolutionary War Veterans Association (RWVA) is a CMP affiliated organization.

Some of the things you will learn-
Safe Rifle Handling
The Six Steps to Firing the Shot
Building Solid Shooting Positions; Standing, Sitting and Prone.
Steady Hold Factors
Use of the GI Web Sling
Natural Point of Aim
Inches, Minutes and Clicks
The Story of Our Nation’s Birth
The Lessons of April 19, 1775
The Debt We Owe to Our Forefathers
The Duty We Owe to Our Posterity

Pre-registration Fees (per person):
Active Military, Reserve, and Guard (w/ ID), Peace Officers (w/ ID), Disabled (w/ ID), Re-enactors in period dress, Elected officials (w/proof) shoot for free!
Youth (Under 21): $2.50 for one day or $5 for both days.
