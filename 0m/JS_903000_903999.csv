Weapon is flawless and had only 50 rounds through it. Includes 4 - 10 round mags, and 3 grips, hard case and  all factory equipment.  

Comes with Smith and Wesson weapon mounted tactical light!

Must have clean criminal record.

Shop around and you will see the weapon without 4 mags or light is going for $650 so my price is firm at $600 and no need to ask what I'll take for it because I just told you $600 not a penny less !

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

No scratches or rust on the exterior. I bought this rifle for the H-Bar and it does weigh more than your standard AR-15/ M-4. Also the Bushmaster quality is always a plus in my book! Comes with a Magpul B.A.D. lever and vertical foward grip. I also installed an Accu-wedge to tighten up the very unnoticeable play(unless you really force it or are looking for it) between the upper and lower reciever, and a buffer and bolt protector to protect from metal to metal contact damage. Rifle also comes with a Sure-fire flashlight and adjustable mount (lights up the night even for its small size). I didn't notice the very slight play at all between the upper and lower reciever and shooting less then 40 rounds down the barrel would not have caused it, so it is really is not a deal breaker. I installed an Accu -wedge and it totally solved the problem and makes it a non-issue! Upper and lower are tight as hell now! Go to youtube or google accu-wedge and let the truth be told! It happens to alot of AR-15s and its not just a (Bushmaster thing). I understand that uppers alone are going for about $800.........Interested? Then send me an e-mail and we will take it from there!

The next-generation PMAG GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. The next-generation PMAG Window GEN M3 features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Choke is ideal for Home Defense … spreads out that pattern!

Modeled after the Browning A-5 design it has been one of my favorites over the years.  This is not a museum piece, so if you are looking for a 100% gun that was purchased new, locked away somewhere and ignored this is not the gun for you.  If, however, you are looking for a gun that has been appreciated and enjoyed for its intended purpose (Shooting) then you might want to consider this one.  I bought this gun in 1988 or 1989 from a friend who had used it his whole life (it had been his father’s gun).  I did a little shooting with it early on and it always worked flawlessly for me but I have not used it much of late.  This is a shotgun that shows both its use and appreciation.  It has been well maintained but it does show wear, especially on the forearm which also has a hairline crack on each side.  The buttstock has a few scratches but is in remarkable condition.  The bluing looks nice but under bright light you can see specks missing at the rear of the barrel and some wear at other spots on the receiver and rest of the barrel.

Overall it is a very nice looking gun that has aged wonderfully and is a joy to shoot.

(I will be riding it weekend if I still have it and we have snow so miles will go up...). Its a 500cc 4 stroke that gets over 20mpg on the trails! It has a nice canvas cover, electric start and reverse along with hand and thumb warmers. The battery was brand new about a month ago. It also has a nice clutch kit that engages at between 4-4200 rpm and aftermarket hauck performance GHT-R-Done exhaust and fuel injection programer on it. The kit in itself cost $1200 and adds 12 HP. The exhaust is loud and it is a very fun sled to ride. I have links at the bottom so you can see the exhaust. If you look at the reviews when it came out everyone rated the sled 5 out of 5 stars. I was not a fan of the idea of a 4 stroke sled until I got this one. I am highly impressed and the weight is not as heavy as what people try to say they are. The suspension on it is second to none as far as factory goes and it is just all around a great sled. The front has adjustable bypass shocks with nice shock covers and the rear shock is adjustable too. Blue book says $3725 without the exhaust kit. I am asking 4,200 I would also be willing to trade for a Arctic Cat or Polaris mountain sled. Needs to be atleast 700cc too because I want to take it out west and hit up the deep powder in the mountains so I need the power. I am really looking for a crossfire 800 or m8. Just let me know what you have and we will see what we can do. Call or text (906)221-one8zero7

I would be happy to text you any pics you want. And yes the sled is just as nice as it looks in the pictures.

Quick! Accurate! Rugged! Easy to Use! 
After a simple calibration procedure, the D-Terminator scale is ready to weigh. No fiddling with three  different poise weights; just pour the powder in and in a few seconds, the D-terminator gives you the weight of your charge in large (if you're over 40,  large is important), easy to read digits. Dillon is particularly proud of its display.  It is not only the largest available, but is angled forward so you can read it  without leaning over the scale. This is important because the scale is sensitive to even the slightest breathing or air movement nearby.
Of course, you can also  check bullet weight or weigh other small items with amazing accuracy. The scale  weighs in grains or grams."

I have a late 1960's Polaris Mustang snowmobile in great condition that I would like to trade (I'll find out the exact year and post it here). I bought it from a private party a couple of years ago that said it spent a few decades in a barn. It was running when I bought it and though I never used it...and it still ran great, I wanted to make sure all is okay with it before I sold it so I put it in the shop last month. Cherry Creek in Jacksonville, VT did a carb kit, fuel filter, fuel lines, plugs and greased it. ""This thing purrs like a kitten"" said Rusty, owner of Cherry Creek when I picked it up."

The RCBS press (a Junior 3) is from 1978- my x-mas present.  Lost and found all these years later but not needed as I have another I am using.  I never used it-- it's literally been in a box since 1978.  There is rust on the handle, but the ram is clean and moved smoothly when I first took it out of the box-- it's in great mechanical shape (no play in the handle) and would clean up nice.  it's got a neat primer auto loader built in that I don't see offered on them today.  The primer is set-up for large/mag rifle primers but can be changed for small rifle or pistol priming with a few ($5) dollars for the kit from RCBS.

Terms: Cash at meeting half way within a few hours of Hartford, KS OR $10 off if you come to me (all paved road).  Trades for 25-06 or 7mm/mag Rem rifle: bullets, brass, a tumbler, a powder thrower (better one), or lube pad (lost mine) are also considered.  A little ""rust"" or wear is fine, but if it's worn out, not interested.  Thanks."

As described by another user:
""Among the most unique magazine designs, the 30/45 magazines were designed with an extendable bottom section that would allow the magazine to be fully loaded to 30 rounds and stored (with the base extended) with the spring under minimal pressure. This allowed long-term storage of fully-loaded mags with no wear to the spring or the feed lips. They can also be loaded with 45 rounds when the base extended, though they shouldn't be stored in this configuration.""

It's a great rifle and I don't want to get rid of it but I bought it for my wife and she doesn't want it.

Most don't know but ATI lowers are multi cal and meet military specs. Meaning, it can be married with a 556/223 upper when you're ready (Smith and Wesson M&P 15-22 can't do this). This gun is a great starter platform for an AR15 and can be tricked out with military spec parts, such as MagPul.

You can shoot, train and have fun with the 22lr upper, and then get a 556 upper and have a serious rifle.

I will only sell to Oklahoma residents who are at least 21 years old and who are legal to own this rifle.
