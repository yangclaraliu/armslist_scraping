These are for a 400sbc (standard bore size) to be used with bushed floating connecting rods.
There is 8 pistons and Sealed Power rings all brand new/never used. Hypereutectic Pistons 0.100 dome with coated skirts.
I bought these pistons about 5+ years ago from Jegs but decided to build a 388 stroker instead and have been sitting in the closet ever since. The pistons cost approximately $53 a piece not including the rings. The only bad is the set is missing one of the lock clips that holds the pin in the piston. I used one pin to replace one i had lost in a different motor...Very cheap to replace! I believe $3 through jegs for the lock.
Jegs description >> (((Speed-Pro's new Hypereutectic pistons with anti-friction skirt coating are ideal for street, bracket racers and oval track. They work perfectly with normal ring end gaps and is highly resistant to scuffing and wear. These pistons operate with tight bore clearances.
Please Note: All compression ratios are figured with a gasket thickness representative of those commonly used and are approximate.

This is a great tactical sniper/varmint setup for someone who doesn't want to spend 800 on a .308 sniper rifle especially since it shoots almost exactly the same round. To add to the benefits, shooting this gun is very inexpensive! The 7.62x54R is cheap and found EVERYWHERE. 

I've only had 20 rounds down the tube since I had it customized, just enough to sight it in. And let me tell you, this thing is accurate! Also, no rust or pitting in the barrel (which is common with these guns) The barrel and clean as could be!

P-3AT (Custom Billfold Brown Color)
The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Calibers: .380 AUTO
Weight unloaded: 8.3 oz. 235g
Loaded magazine: 2.8 oz. 81g
Length: 5.2"" 132mm
Height: 3.5"" 89mm
Width: .77"" 20mm

Muzzle Energy Max: 250ft-lbs 340J
Capacity: 6 + 1 rounds

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

These bullets have no cartridge case as well as no primer to cause rust and corrosion. They have a velocity of 1150 FPS. They are intended to be shot with a Daisy VL rifle. 


The V-L bullet consists merely of a cylindrical plug of solid propellant attached to the rear of a slug or missile. When the trigger of a V-L rifle is pulled, a powerful spring drives a cocked plunger into a cylinder, compressing and heating the trapped air to about 2,000° F. Escaping into the firing chamber through a valve, a jet of heated air strikes and ignites the propellant, which pushes the missile through the barrel"

this is not a 50 dollar daisy from walmart its a top of the line pellet rifle was purchased at basspro for 299.99 +tax 5 weeks ago 
this air rifle will fire 22 cal pellets at 950 feet per second its not a toy and its not a good idea to get this for a kid 
now i paid 322 dollars cash for this and ive had it on here a couple times and alot of people are geting mad and cussing me out because i wont take their 
25 to 100 dollar offers so before we start any of that try and understand i gave over 300 cash for this a little over 1 month ago so im not gonna be low balled 
im not selling it because im desperate for money im selling it because i bought it for some pest control and the job is done 
now you could go to walmart and spend 50 to 100 and get something that will do some pest control pretty good 
but its not gonna be this powerful and your not gonna get one at walmart that will hit quarters everytime at 50+ yards just like with everything else you get what you pay for there are high end products and there are low end products 

i will take 175 dollars cash firm and i say firm so you dont have to wonder if i would have taken less if you buy it 
and to save us both time there will be no negotiation 175.00 is bottom dollar 
and that way you know you got the best deal on it you could have gotten from me 
its about 150 dollars less than i paid 5 weeks ago

i also have a benjamin sheridan 397 p 177 800 feet per second

It is in excellent condition. It has been fired somewhere between 100-200 times. I've had it now for a few years and it has just sat in my safe. I'm ready to sell it to buy something else. I'm asking $650 which I think is reasonable. This gun sells in the $800s now. Here is a link to S&W's website for the gun. The SKU # is 164198 if that link doesn't work for you. I have around 50 rounds of FMJ that I will throw in with it, and also a few HydroShoks. Included also is the case, lock, manual, fired case, and the key to lock and unlock the gun itself. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I will be writing up a bill of sale with DL info for our protection in the sale. Thanks, Matt,..

Up for ( Sale or Trade ), Is a like new limited edition Ruger M77 Mark II H-Varmint bolt action rifle in 22-250 Remington, It has all of the bells and whistles that a true ""Sportsman / Hunter"" would want, Here is the specs and features that it has...

( 1st ) It has a highly polished blued 22"" inch heavy chamber area tapered match grade Varmint barrel, That is heavier than a standard barrel is around the chamber for slightly stronger hunting loads, Without having to go to the extreme extra weight a Target style bull barrel...

( 2nd ) It also has a forged milled steel receiver, That is factory milled to accept Ruger style scope rings, For a precision mounting of optics...

( 3rd ) It also has a factory hand ( Lapped, Fitted, & Polished ) chrome hardened bolt assembly, That is precisely fitted for a smooth action...

( 4th ) Next it has the modern 3 postition side lever safety on it, It has a firing position, A trigger safe postion, And a firing pin block locking position, So that the firearm can be safely transported while it is loaded...

( 5th ) Then it has a beautiful solid hardwood Walnut stock, That is finished in a very nice semi gloss finish, For a beautiful lustrious look that is not to shiny glossy that it would scare off any game...

( 6th ) The stock is also fully checkered on the front and rear grip areas of the rifle stock, To get a good solid firm grip on the rifles stock, So that way the shooter can make a good solid controlled shot on his target...

( 7th ) It also has front and rear factory installed sling swivel studs, That are percisely ( Centered, Drilled, and Factory installed ) to add a harris bi-pod or any type of stud mounted carrying sling...

( 8th ) It also has a factory installed 3/4"" inch neopreme rubber recoil reducing butt plate with the Ruger logo embedded in it, This is not the standard cheap plastic or the thin hard rubber one that is found on the standard models...

( 9th ) It also has a hinged lower floor plate to quickly and safely unload the internal box magazine, Instead of having to jack them out of the action one at a time using the bolt...

( 10th ) It also has a pistol grip lower bottom end cap plate, With the Ruger medalion logo on the bottom of the pistol grip area, Which also helps to protect this area from chips and small cracks if it is light bumped around....

This is the top of the line limited edition M-77 varmint hunting rifle that Ruger made a couple years back, This is not a standard cheaper M-77 model, That a lot of you guys out there are looking up, And then trying to lowball me on, So please don't waste your time trying to haggle...

The rifle has a very low round count of seven rounds put threw it since it was bought, Besides what the factory puts threw them before sending out the door, And that was just to sight in and aline a scope that was on it, So it is basically still in like new condition, And will still need to be fully broken in, But let me tell you now it is very accurate and really sweet to shoot...

I would really like to trade it for a nice compact concealed carry piece or a 1911 style pistol in ( 9mm, 40 S&W, or 45acp ), Like a ( Springfield, Kimber, Colt, STI, or Sig ) preferably a stainless one...

It is a genuine Trijicon ACOG, a TA26SR-10.  This model is one of their mini-ACOG's, 1.5 power with 16mm objective (1.5x16), with a RED circle-dot reticle with post (see pic).  It has TONS more eye-relief than the 4X ACOG's (you see in the pics it is mounted at the far end of the receiver).  It sits in an ADM quick-detach mount, which returns to zero nicely after being taken off and reattached multiple times without need to zero, these generally run the better part of $100 by theirself, but they are definitely worth it (I have detached/reattached multiple times switching between this and my TA33, it always held zero fine).  Optic is in excellent condition as seen in pics, and lots of life left in the tritium.

General ACOG information:  Very robust combat-grade optic, and uses battery-free illumination.  They are illuminated by a light gathering fiber optic which automatically adjusts for ambient brightness, as well as using radioactive tritium for illumination in even perfect darkness.  Trijicon is excellent glass on par with any other top-tier optics maker.

I have had this on here a few times and 3x someone has wanted it and not came through. I was busy today and dropped everything I was doin for a guy who wanted it and drove 45 min to go meet him and of course the AHOLE doesn't show up and dont answer calls or texts. If ya want to be that way then dont bother contacting me. You want it you come to me and get it because I have had it for awhile and it sits there and doesn't bother me just thought someone else could use it. I dont like shotguns and I don't hunt so I have no use for it and I don't need the money. Oh and if your gonna text me and say you want it and have something to trade, if you change your mind its not that hard to say never mind, your not gonna hurt my feelings if you dont want it so just SAY SO. Dam people act like a bunch of babies and scared to tell the truth. I dont mind getting a million texts cuz they free but act like an adult. If I want something I get it if I don't I say I DONT WANT IT. I will  try to put pics this time. The past few times they havent downloaded and if it dont work I will text them to ya.

Getting to old to hunt.  This rifle will make someone a perfect gun.

The BAR rifle was initially produced totally in Belgium and then assembly was transferred to Portugal in the early 1970s. This was history making for Browning, as the BAR was the first Browning firearm made in Belgium with assembly at an all new Browning plant in Viana, Portugal. Today, the Portugal factory has grown to be a major component of the Browning manufacturing system and is where the BAR continues to be assembled today, as well as the 12 and 20 gauge Gold and Silver autoloading shotguns and limited runs of the Hi-Power pistol. Contrary to what some have said, the BAR has always been made in Belgium and assembled in Portugal from the beginning.

The following info is from the Palmetto State Armory:

The open-tipped rounds until now have been available only to Special Operations Command troops. The first 200,000 5.56mm Special Operations Science and Technology rounds are already downrange with Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan, said Brig. Gen. Michael Brogan, commander of Marine Corps Systems Command. Commonly known as “SOST” rounds, they were legally cleared for Marine use by the Pentagon in late January, according to Navy Department documents obtained by Marine Corps Times.

SOCom developed the new rounds for use with the Special Operations Force Combat Assault Rifle, or SCAR, which needed a more accurate bullet because its short barrel, at 13.8 inches, is less than an inch shorter than the M4 carbine’s. Using an open-tip match round design common with some sniper ammunition, SOST rounds are designed to be “barrier blind,” meaning they stay on target better than existing M855 rounds after penetrating windshields, car doors and other objects.

The full name and designation of the round is the MK 318 MOD 0 ""Cartridge, Caliber 5.56mm Ball, Carbine, Barrier"". The 62 grain bullet was designed by Federal / ATK. It features an open tip with lead at the front and a thick copper base. The lead is designed to defeat barriers and the copper to penetrate the barrier."
