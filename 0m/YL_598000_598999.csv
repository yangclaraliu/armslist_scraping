Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.








Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.








Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

I have original box and manual.

MSRP is $500

Stoeger's description is as follows:
Stoeger’s Double Defense side-by-side shotgun is a straightforward, rugged and reliable home defense shotgun. Ideal for use in tight quarters and tense situations, the Stoeger Double Defense with its traditional break-action and short, efficient design is easy to load and quick to deploy in an emergency.
     A double-barrel shotgun has been the defensive firearm of choice for generations, but Stoeger has added practical, up-to-date features to the “tried-and-true” double gun. The Double Defense is chambered for 2-3/4- and 3-inch shells, in either 12- or 20-gauge. The tactical-length 20-inch ported barrels feature fixed, improved cylinder chokes. The fast, single-trigger design and convenient, tang-mounted automatic safety makes the Stoeger Double Defense ideal for home security use.

     The Double Defense gun is outfitted with a green, fiber-optic front sight and comes standard with two Picatinny Rail accessory mounts: one on the receiver for red-dot sights and a second factory-installed rail under the barrels for attaching targeting lasers or tactical lights. All metal surfaces are finished in matte blue and come complete with non-reflective matte black hardwood stock and forearm."

Fixed sights, and original plastic grips. 
It shoots very well, and has 95 + bluing and the only mar to the finish is on the bottom of the grip heel, where it got rubbed on something once long ago. No rust there, just a VERY SMALL portion of the blue is rubbed off. It could be touched up and only you would know it had been done.
I put in a Volquarsten extractor  and replaced the recoil spring, not because it ""needed"" it, but just to do it.
This is a tough, sturdy plinker, and is a fun ,inexpensive gun to shoot with the family.
It comes with one (maybe two if I can find the other one) 9 round original mag, and 4 10 round Mark 2 magazines which work fine in the standards.
I prefer to sell to a ccw holder and would like a basic bill of sale."

Double triggers and extractors.  Works perfectly and locks up tight--I just shot four rounds of skeet with it (that's 100 shells, for those of you who don't know) with no problems whatsoever.  Has some cosmetic flaws, but fewer than you'd expect for its age: some marks on the wood, a couple of dings near the end of the barrels, and some corrosion patches in the bore, but nothing that affects safety or function.  The receiver internals are clean and corrosion-free.  The lever return spring is brand new.  

It would make a great hunting gun: robust, reliable, well-balanced, and not so fancy that you'd be worrying about messing it up.

It would also be a great gun to coach for cowboy action:  none of the barrel dings are within the first 18 inches, so they'd go away, and the chambers don't need to be reamed--they are already open enough to shake the empties out."

I purchased this gun new about 3 months ago and love it. However, finances are forcing me to sell it.  My loss is your gain. There are only about 250 - 300 rounds through this gun total and it includes everything it came with (including the two micro-small allen wrenches for adjusting the laser!). I am also throwing in an Uncle Mike's IWB (right-hand draw) holster. It shoots great and the laser is already adjusted. You are basically getting a new gun and a holster for less than a new gun!

I am not looking to ""get rid of it"" so I will entertain offers but they need to be of similar value; the worse I can say is ""No, thank you"". My build costs over $800. 


I had it sent off to ADCO to be cut and threaded to use with my silencerco Sparrow but at this point I am interested in trading.



I have, and it comes with:
-Ruger 10/22 Takedown model
-Bag they come in
-Bushnell TRS-25
-Leapers 4x32 Mini CQB Combat Scope (red/green illumination) 
-4 Ruger BX25 Magazines
-1 Factory Rotary Magazine
-A factory (backup/extra) Takedown buttstock.  The glue holding the Ruger emblem on the grip part fell off.  I contacted Ruger, they sent me a new stock.  So if anyone wants to get crafty and make a storage section out of the spare stock, you can.  I also have the emblem that fell off of the stock so you could just glue it back on and have a backup stock.
-Backup sights (another Ruger model that are slighlty higher since I wanted to use it with a suppressor.  These sights are NOT installed.)
-The Ruger has a quick release bolt release that I installed
-It comes with the weaver rail that they come with
-It has been cut to 16"" of barrel length by ADCO
-It has been threaded 1/2x28 by ADCO (standard thread pitch for .22)
-It has a thread protector (made from the barrel, ADCO offers this for an additional $15 so I paid for it)


The firearm has seen on erange trip of 100 rounds of CCI Mini-mag.  It ran flawlessly, I just can't convince the GF that .22lr is fun to shoot.....


I value my trade at roughly $700-$750 (primarily considering the 4 magazines, the cut/threading by ADCO, the Bushnell TRS-25, extra butt-stock, and slightly considering the other stuff)....As mentioned above, this set up ran me over $800 and is as new as LNIB gets.


I am willing to sell for (but would prefer trade):
$750 SHIPPED to you or $700 without the Bushnell TRS-25.


I AM WILLING TO TRADE FOR:
-LNIB Glock 19 plus cash on your end
-LNIB Sig P226 of similar value (threaded barrel is a plus) ***COULD DO STRAIGHT TRADE FOR THE RIGHT SIG***
-Various other handguns, just IM me an offer and the worse I can say is no thank you.


I prefer FTF out of simplicity but I am willing to work out different options (I am willing to negotiate for most aspects of the trade, PM me for any questions).


Everything is flawless and there is not a single scuff on the entire rifle (the pictures in the link in comment below will show this).


I will also not shoot this firearm until my suppressor is in my hands (at least 30 days away).


PERFECT SHTF SETUP!


Thanks for looking.

Molded polymer stock provides maximum comfort, speed, and freedom of movement for operators wearing body armor in CQC situations. Same topside contours as a standard M4 carbine stock allow the shooter to maintain a solid cheekweld when firing, but overall length is slightly shortened to maintain correct length of pull. The deeper, curved underside is angled so the lower tip rides comfortably on the upper chest or collarbone in a forward, high carry position near the dominant eye; keeps the sights and barrel close to the line of sight, ready to be engaged with minimal head movement.

Forward carry also provides better armor protection than the traditional angled stance that leaves the vulnerable arm holes exposed to threats. Made of lightweight, glass reinforced composite polycarbonate specially formulated for maximum impact and heat resistance. Reinforced at stress points for added strength. Aggressive checkering on contact surfaces minimize slippage.

Matte black finish accepts most paints, so you can customize the color of your Duostock to fit your tactical requirements. Universal fits all M4-type buffer tubes. Sand interior to fit oversized tubes. Colt model provides a snug fit without “play” on the narrower-diameter buffer tube of Mil-Spec M4 carbines."

This is 9MM Luger, Swedish Gallery ammo designed for the M45 and M45/B subguns. 36 rounds of brass cased, berdan primed, non-corrosive ammo per box on one big stripper clip. Plastic projectile with a 5mm steel BB in the tip. Muzzle velocity 1050 fps, effective range 100 ft . 

Will not cycle most semiautomatic actions. Some guys find that with a weaker spring this ammo will cycle. 

Laquered bullets and primers, no rust or tarnish.   It has been said that the bullets in this ammo can be pulled and the clean, primed case reloaded.  I do not know that to be a fact.

Having said all that, this Kammarpatron m/39 ammunition is sold for display only. It is meant to be fired only from a Swedish SMG m/45 or m/45B equiped with a special barrel. 36 rounds on a special stripper clip (which can be used to load the Swedish ""K"" magazine). Made in Sweden (1986).  It may or may not work successfully in other weapons and is not guaranteed to work in them safely.

Cash is preferred, but interesting trades will be considered.  Leupold, EoTech, or Colt or Smith & Wesson or Sig or…..  Perhaps a Short barrel .357 magnum.  Please no leather, whips, chains, or teenage children.  Already have enough of those."

I really like the ruger 10/22 and would love to essentially build one. So I'm looking for one in poor condition, basically all i'd care about is the receiver and the bolt, though if all you have is a receiver that'd be fine too i guess. So if you've got a 10/22 sitting around that's in rough shape over all send me an email and maybe we can work something out :)

Also looking for a mosin nagant in rough shape. I'd like it to be functional or close to it, but I don't care if the stock is cracked, most of the bluing is gone , if its a bit rusty or if it has a nice bore."

This is compatible with Gen 1, 2 or 3. It is not compatible with Glock Gen 4 - sorry! This kit is in great condition and comes w/ all factory accessories. I'm including an extra 10 rd magazine. Price is $325.

Item Description:

These kits are had to find because the manufacturer Advantage Arms are working a large commercial contract and kits sold to individuals are extremely hard to find right now. This is a valuable training aid to maintain proficiency, train new shooters, or just to casually plink with. It is very reliable & easy to install.

For anyone who shoots very much ( or would like to shoot more) it can easily pay for itself in just one year. Training sessions are more enjoyable/ affordable when each shot is only $ .03-.04 per shot instead of $ .25 - .35.

FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:


1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits. 3. FINISH All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

4. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto theframe, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

5. INEXPENSIVE .22LR AMMO Never worry about leaving the range early because you don't want to use any more expensive ammo.

6. IMPROVED ACCURACY Because of less recoil, shooting the .22LR rounds in your Glock will improve your accuracy and get you used to the same look, feel and gun weight you are used to. The only difference is the ammo and cost of each round.

These are extremely hard to find kits in this size!

I'm an individual and not a dealer. I will mark this ad as ""Sold"" once it's no longer available. I'm not interested in trades at this time.

Note: I also have a Advantage Arms .22 conversion kit for Glock 19/23/25/32 for sale as well (it's Gen 1,2 or 3)."
