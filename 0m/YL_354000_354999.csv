52,http://www.armslist.com/posts/354052,For Sale:  FS ReadyShot System for GLOCK,"Greeley | Northern Colorado, Colorado, United States",$ 250,"Listed On: Saturday, March 31, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've got a ReadyShot System for sale that I bought for review purposes for Haus of Guns. This setup is approximately $574 new with the carrying case. The magazine insert will fit any Glock pistol, but the laser insert is specifically for 9mm pistols, though it worked fine in my Glock 23 .40 S&W too, albeit a little loose. The ReadyShot system is a great solution for folks who maybe can't get to the range all that often because of where they live or time. It's also a great way to train with your gun and save on mucho ammo cost while training on a target that gives an audio response and tracks your hits. 

Full disclosure, since I bought it for review ReadyShot gave me a substantial discount at $400 to my door, meaning I didn't pay the entire $574 it's worth out of pocket. Everything it came with is still there, barely used with a whole bag of trigger magnet adhesives too. It's a great system I just need some cash for bills. Crappy student loans. 

Anyway I'm asking $250 for EVERYTHING! That's something like 60% off retail cost from the ReadyShot website listed below and still a heavy hit on my end from what I paid for the system back in November.

Here's the link to the exact product page: http://www.readyshot.com/ReadyShot_T...s-glk02-bk.htm

This pistol has been lightly used, with less than 200 rounds fired through it. In like new condition. I purchased it new. The $225 price is for the pistol with ONE magazine and a hard case. I have a total of SIX magazines. You can purchase additional magazines at $25 / each, or take it all for $325. If you don't want all the mags, I will sell those separately as they are in demand. This is a great pistol, fun to shoot, fairly accurate, and has been reliable with the limited ammo selection I have used (Remington, CCI). The one disadvantage to these is that magazines can be difficult to find. But I have solved that problem for you. :-) Only selling this because I just don't shoot it enough to justify keeping money tied up it. NO SHIPPING - FTF only in Reno/Sparks/Carson City areas.

Though I would love to keep this rifle, I simply can't due to financial circumstances and buying a new home and the cost of renovations.

I have read and been advised by many folks that the conversion alone will cost around $2,000. This is not with the addition of a SL8 which will set you back a pretty penny itself. The gun looks great. I have not fired it since purchasing it and the round count is said to be low. There are very few blemishes on this gun. There is one slight blemish along the handguards that looks as if it was moved around in a gun safe. It also has a slight mark on the mag release. I will post a link to photobucket so everyone can view photos. If you would like to see more photos, please pm me. I am asking $3,300 cash for this rifle. This is a steal compared to what I have researched. I will consider partial trades for this rifle but the deal must include $2500 in cash due to our financial needs at the moment. This rifle will come with one Lancer Clear magazine. Here is the link to see the photos

If you have any questions, feel free to pm me. Thanks for looking. 

This sale will take place face to face in Rowan County, NC. I will consider shipping the rifle at the cost of the buyer though I would prefer a face to face deal."

charles daly rabbit ear 12 gauge shotgun. the only markings i can find on this whole shotgun is ""charles daly"" on each side of the action, ""NO. 997"" on the trigger gaurd which i beleive is the serial number, ""997"" on the foregrip, and ""997"" on the bottom of the barrel.  i think their is a proof mark down in the action where the barrel locks in that is a figure ""8"".  all the ""997""s mean its all original. im not sure the age, but i have researched what i could online and it appears to be a late 1800's shotgun. 

the  barrel has surface rust on the outside and looks rough.

the foregrip looks to be in good condition. it has a dark finish on the wood and shows age with discolor and wear on the wood and the metal. 

the action looks to be in good condition for the age. the right side firing pin appears to be broken. their is play between the barrel and the action. the front trigger is broken off about half way down.  it would not be safe to shoot this shotgun in its current condition, but fixing it might hurt the value.

the stock looks decent toward the rear but at the action its cracked. someone has wrapped it with some kind of tape a long time ago. you can tell the tape has been on a long time. i dont know how bad the crack is but holding the stock and barrel i cant feel any play where its cracked, so it may not be too bad.

this would make a great display gun on  a mantel or wall. it doesnt look like its ever been messed with. all finishes look original. it has a good old look to it.

I am changing collecting direction and am offering this really nice British Enfield No.4 MK 1* Long Branch 1942.
On the left side of the receiver it is stamped "" No.4 MK 1* Long Branch 1942 ""
The rifle is all matching serial number on the Rifle, Bolt and Magazine
There is a small import mark on the very end of the barrel on the right side, can be easily missed if you didn't
know where to look for it.

Bore is really nice, Bright, Shiny and Good rifling. It is a great shooter and a pleasure to shoot.
I have fired 100 rounds down the tube without any problems. 

1. The rifle pass's the Field Gauge test
2. Also pass's the Bore Erosion Gauge test
(using British Military Throat Erosion gauge 4139 SA & MG)
3. Rifle also pass's the Muzzle Bullet test

The Bolt - shows the LB symbol
The Bolt Head - is a size ""O"" and has the LB symbol & the C-broad arrow The Cocking Piece of the bolt - has the LB symbol 


Stock is really nice with normal wear marks that would commonly be found
on rifles of this age. Rifle has the Early Grooved Rear Hand Guard (see pictures)

Sling is correct to the rifle and is marked M.E.Co. 1942 with the British Broad Arrow mark.

Bayonet is a correct Long Branch arsenal marked spike bayonet with scabbard (see pictures)

The only exception I see on this rifle is that on the top of the receiver the charger guide is slightly
bent. Whether this happen in combat or ?? is anyone's guess. (if only these rifles could speak)
Even though, it has NO EFFECT when loading rifle with the correct Enfield stripper clips.
Matter of fact it loads so easy and smooth....

I will also enclose a free surprise gift to the new owner

Price on this rifle is $400 Free Shipping or FTF
Must ship to FFL-03 or FFL-01 holder or FTF Transaction


I would consider TRADES on some of the following interests

Trades

Russian, Polish, Finish M44 Carbines
Mosin Nagant 91/30 sniper types

Hello gentlemen, First off a big shout out to those serving our country and those who have. You are appreciated!! For consideration is my fully dressed Draco AK47. Front official OD angled Magpul(newer slim, smaller version) is not attached nor for sale with this. These Dracos are getting a little harder to come by with the approaching election. The AK is in great condition and only has a few boxes of ammo through it. It has a top and bottom OD green Tapco hand-guard on the front with quad rails(small ones on the sides). Also has a saw style Tapco OD green one on the rear. I added a OD Hogue slip on over this and it feels great with a nice fit. An aftermarket heavy duty sling plate has been added legally without any of the no no holes drilled in the rear trunnion. Tactical single point OD bungee sling attached for the ""Israeli Sling Method"". Mag well is dimpled on both sides, so no frankengun here..lol. The magazine is matching OD Tapco also and is very tough(I believe they are made of Zytel or glass filled nylon). An aftermarket railed dustcover has been added for the optic. Unlike some it feels solid. It is the see through style so you can still use your iron sights. The best of both worlds. The optic is a Leapers UTG, 38mm CQB Red/Green tactical dot sight with attached flip up lens covers. Has multiple intensities and works well with this gun. 745 or best offer. Just send message. Original dust cover also included. I can ship to your ffl if needed. Take care and God bless."

Hello gentlemen, First off a big shout out to those serving our country and those who have. You are appreciated!! For consideration is my fully dressed Draco AK47. Front official OD angled Magpul(newer slim, smaller version) is not attached nor for sale with this. These Dracos are getting a little harder to come by with the approaching election. The AK is in great condition and only has a few boxes of ammo through it. It has a top and bottom OD green Tapco hand-guard on the front with quad rails(small ones on the sides). Also has a saw style Tapco OD green one on the rear. I added a OD Hogue slip on over this and it feels great with a nice fit. An aftermarket heavy duty sling plate has been added legally without any of the no no holes drilled in the rear trunnion. Tactical single point OD bungee sling attached for the ""Israeli Sling Method"". Mag well is dimpled on both sides, so no frankengun here..lol. The magazine is matching OD Tapco also and is very tough(I believe they are made of Zytel or glass filled nylon). An aftermarket railed dustcover has been added for the optic. Unlike some it feels solid. It is the see through style so you can still use your iron sights. The best of both worlds. The optic is a Leapers UTG, 38mm CQB Red/Green tactical dot sight with attached flip up lens covers. Has multiple intensities and works well with this gun. 745 or best offer. Just send message. Original dust cover also included. My FFl can ship to yours if needed. Take care and God bless."

Anyway the gun is in very good condition with no signs of damage to the stock/forearm or metal parts of the gun. It looks to be all original. I put 100 rounds through the gun last october and it functions just fine. It is actually quite a great gun for trap as the first round I hit 17 of 25."

According to Flayderman’s, the Model 1862 is considered by many collectors as the ultimate in streamlined design by Colt’s factory during the percussion period. Serial number 2632 this gun was manufactured in 1861. 36 Cal.5 shot. This one has a 4 ½” round barrel with the COL. SAML COLT NEW YORK USA AMERICA barrel address. COLTS/PATENT is stamped on the left side of the frame and PAT SEPT 10TH 1850 is stamped within one of the cylinder flutes. Serial number matches the cylinder, frame, trigger guard, arbor, back strap and wedge. Nipples are in good condition. There is evidence of 4 remaining safety pins. The gun retains a great deal of color. The trigger and wedge have a high percentage of blue while the bottom four screws and loading lever screws retain their fire blue finish. The frame has a high percentage of case coloring remaining. The back strap has a generous amount of tarnished silver at the butt and frame. The cylinder is plum brown with bluing in the cylinder stops. The barrel has about 50% of its blue. The bore has fine lands and grooves and is still shiny. The one piece varnished walnut grips are in excellent condition and retain at least 95% of the original varnish. Action is crisp and tight. It would be hard to find one better.

It utilizes the M67 bullet for greater wounding effect, and is loaded hotter than most other standard ammunition in addition to being considerably more accurate. Easier on your extractor than most steel cased ammo.  It comes in a wooden case, and hermetically sealed in a zinc tin.  The ammunition is packed in boxes on SKS chargers, so you get 112 of those along with the ammo. This stuff was manufactured by the SAME factory that is currently producing PRVI Partizan ammunition, so trust me, it's quality.Oh, and it's a lot of fun to open these guys up and smell the history.



The ammo in this configuration has been sold out for some time. I've run through a case before and it's GOOD stuff.  I'm just selling it because of a financial issue. Would prefer cash or bank money order.



Caveat:  Though I've NEVER had an issue with crates of these, I cannot guarantee the ammo as it is hermetically sealed for storage purposes and I have not inspected it. It's just like it was when it rolled off the assembly line.

Number match. Includes holster, 2 magazines and cleaning tool. The blue finish show some light holster wear. The bore is nice and clean. The 9mm makarov ammo is inexpensive.

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force. Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun. A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot. a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

The small size and single stack mag makes this a very nice gun for concealed carry. Fits easily in a pocket and there are various holsters available.

This is a very nice gun and I'm not in a hurry to sell it. The price is pretty firm. Please don't send me your ridiculous low ball offers. Also, I don't need anyone telling me what they think this gun is worth."

This is very thin, about like a KAHR K-9, in fact the Kahr CW9 and K-9 holsters fit this slim 45. It is heavy though which helps compensate for the jump of the 45/3.5"" barrel. Very accurate.
Nothing wrong with it, I just don't feel comfortable with the single action.

It feeds and fires, but someone used a piece of flat spring steel to replace the extractor spring and I never ordered a new one.  The ejector also needs a little tweaking.  The hole for the bolt actually does extend into the bore, but I was planning on trimming and cutting a new dovetail to mount the mag tube.

I have 6 15 round mags and 1 10 round mags as well as a soft case (blackhawk not HK) and safariland FDE thigh rig. This is a great suppressor host but I think I prefer the M9. If you have one with a threaded barrel that would be preferred. Price for the pistol mags and case is $925 or $1025 with the thigh rig. I'd prefer to trade though. I also have a GGG rail adapter that lets you use standard weapon lights on the stupid HK proprietary rail. Date code is AD. Low round count. I'm open to offers on other 9mm suppressor hosts as well or whatever just make me an offer. Pics will be coming. 812 26 7 7478.

Made by the Italian firm of F.LLI Pietta, this revolver was bought new and has only been fired a couple of times. Featuring the flat-sided frame of the original Dance Brother’s revolvers made for the Confederacy during the Civil War [or the War of Northern Aggression, depending on your point of view] this revolver also features as does the original, an 8” Dragoon style barrel with blade front sight, and an un-engraved 6 shot, .44 caliber cylinder. Made in 2005, this entire finish of this gun has been antiqued and its overall condition is excellent; as can be seen on the right side picture there is not a mark on the wedge pin or barrel – the usual places butchered by weekend black powder hobbyists. New, these guns go for almost $300.00, and while the internet is full of used, brass framed Navy-type percussion guns for sale, there are not many of these to be found. This gun is well worth my asking price so please don’t email me and ask if I’ll take seventy five dollars for it. For sale only - no trades considered. Shipping will be $18.00 nationwide. Please note that all state and local statutes if any must be adhered to for this sale."

I am thinking about selling my AK-47 made by Inter-Ordnance. The model is: I.O. Inc. 10K-47C. This rifle is NOT a WASR, not by a million miles. This thing was quality built, I compared it to a WASR that I bought new (and got rid of because it wasn't up to par with this one). This rifle was 100% American built, not some cheap thrown together rifle. The rifle was made in 2008, I confirmed it by calling the manufacturer and looking up my serial number. The gun was recently DuraCoated in the color of Parker. Because this is a quality AK-47 variant, and I know the pricing this thing was originally priced at, I will not let this go for under $700. So if you are going to try and offer $699 or below, don't bother wasting our time.

The rifle will come with the following:

- 1 Brand-New, never used TapCo magazine (in plastic still)
- TapCo infusion hand guard with a tri-rail system and heat shield (top one screws on but I took it off for a better iron sight picture.)
- TapCo AK-47 style buttstock with metal buttplate.
- Un-installed scope mount bracket.
- Two 30 round magazines (steel)

***MAGPUL FORWARD ANGLE GRIP WILL NOT BE INCLUDED.

Asking for $700 for all of this. If you look up the price of the rifle as well as all of the stuff included, you'll see it's valued a few hundred less.

I can send pictures of the rest of the stuff, but if you look it up, it's going to be the same as in those pictures. I WILL NOT TRAVEL MORE THAN 20 minutes from Fayetteville and I will NOT accept a bullshit offer. Thanks for your interest."

The gun has a 30""  full choke barrel, the walnut stock is not in the best of shape it has a few chips out of the forearm as well as larger chip out of the stock near the butt plate.  It appears as if some one at some point prior to me owning it tried to refinish it as well.  it's not the best job but it could be fixed if you wanted to spend the time.  Overall bluing is 80%+ on the gun, not bad for the age that it is.  I have shot a handful of rounds thought it with no issues at all no issues cycling or ejecting the rounds. The bore is nice and bright, no pitting at all.    I took it in on a trade a while ago and has been sitting in my safe ever since.

I'm very interesting in a Hi Point Model Carbine in 9MM,  a revolver or semi-auto pistol.    I would be willing to add a couple of dollars to something if the deal is right.   Also willing to trade for a Mossberg 500 with a smooth bore barrel, or Remington 870 with a smooth bore barrel.   I'm not really interested in .22 rifles unless your trading me at least 2 of them, or unless you have a very nice one, I have plenty of them in the safe as it is."

Description:
Rare find. This is the legendary FBI contract 1911. Exact same specs as the ones used by the FBI's swat team. Shoots like a dream. Tight pistol with plenty of hand fitted parts. If you order a new one expect a 18-month wait. $3300 is not uncommon for a new one as there is high demand and very low supply. No gun store online or in California has this in stock. Has a very low serial #CRG5xx. Built year 2000. Current serial #s of ones recently sold are #CRG3900. Great write up on this pistol here: http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/articlearchive/details.aspx?ID=656

Looking to break even. In preparation to selling this I wanted it to be just like brand new for the next owner. It just came back from Springfield Armory Custom Shop (SACS). I spent $420 to do the following with direct factory SA Professional spec replacement parts:
