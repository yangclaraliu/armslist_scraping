The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower. We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

Thermold Magazines started in the 1960's as a molded plastics injection manufacturer that served the automotive industry. It's founder, William Howard, was well known in his hometown of Wilson, N.C. as an innovative thinker who held many patents. Mr. Howard was also a big game hunter for whom making firearms more reliable was both a passion and a necessity. Using a nylon resin called Zytel, developed by DuPont after World War II to replace metal in large-scale manufacturing, Thermold began producing weapons magazines that resisted heat and corrosion, and functioned with extreme reliability. Thermold magazines rapidly became the product of choice among military personnel, law enforcement officers and sport shooters around the world. All of our products are proudly made in the United States in North carolina. Today, many of the firearm industry's largest and most prestigious distributors are once again able to sell the trusted line of Thermold magazines and weapons products. ""Time-tested quality and reliability. That's Thermold.""

No deals less than 1,000.  In other words for example 1,500 7.62.x.39 to 1,000 silver bear .223.  Will it work in your AR?  I dont know.  I dont own one.  .223 is quickly becoming scarce and is currently being outlawed for use in certain states.  For all you guys with .223 rifles, I would be grabbing up as much .223 as possible.  Also the BATF recently bought as a commodity on the stock market millions of pounds of brass in a roundabout way to enact gun control.  If they cant take away the guns, they take away the materials need to make ammo.  food for thought."

With the assistance of the bipod and the monopod attached to the Magpul PRS Stock, I have managed to have the Scope Crosshairs on target without any support from me.  Just lay behind the rifle correctly and don’t jerk the trigger and it will hit with Sub-MOA reliability.  Best part is that the Muzzle Break is so good that there is not enough kick to lose your target from the barrel rise!  I have always been able to shoot this rifle and watch the splash of the bullet and can see the vapor trail in some conditions!  

If you buy this rifle, you can expect: One Solid Rifle designed for maximum accuracy.  When you go to the range to shoot it, do not be surprised if an audience is behind you watching.  It happens all the time when I would use this rifle.

I have put about 500 rounds through this rifle, which I purchased new.  I hate to sell it, but I do need money.  So, my loss is your gain.  At least, someone will be able to put it to use.

The rifle is sold, “as is.”  Buyer must have, and present at sale, GA Driver’s License & Georgia Carry Permit.  Plus, must be willing to sign a Bill of Sale.

There are trades that can be considered, which are, but not limited to: AR-15 Lower Receivers, AR-15 Bolt Carrier Groups, some handguns and rifles will also be considered.  Leave a message at REDACTED, and your message will be answered quickly!  The price is $6,000, or best offer."

New - ATI's Omni lower reciever is as strong as aluminum and will accept any .223 caliber upper and magazine. The Omni is a multi-caliber AR15 lower made of reinforced polymer. It is designed after a mil-spec lower and is compatible with most current AR15 lower parts kits, grips and stocks. Made with a high-grade durable polymer material, the Omni can withstand harsh environments as well as everyday wear and tear. 

This is the same material used for Glock pistols. Those pistols are famous for being run over by trucks, thrown off of buildings, submerged under water, and then being picked up and fired with out issue. I am amazed at how light this lower is. It would be perfect to make a light carry gun.

You are welcome to check it out in person.

Waited a year for this to become available and finally just received it last month, it is a brand new Spikes Tactical ST-15 (AR15), never been fired, M4 style flat top with 6 position collapsable stock. Mid-length gas system and 16"" chrome lined barrel. Spikes are known for being super reliable and accurate rifles out of the box with great fit and finish, and there is a long waiting list to get your hands on one. They are highly desirable and thats why it takes forever to get a new one and they are selling for over $2000 right now on gunbroker. This is not some walmart s&w, bushmaster, or dpms, each and every Spikes rifle is built by craftsmen with tight quality control and attention to detail. You will find absolutely zero negative comments about them anywhere and they are the choice of many law enforcement officers that are in the know. Dont take my word for it, research it yourself and read some reviews. Kills me to sell it now after it finally came in only a month ago but I need the cash for another vehicle and that is the only reason why I am even considering it. I would also consider trades up or down with cash on your part or mine for a decent reliable and fuel efficient vehicle. Prefer something like a toyota truck but open to any offers, just depends on what you have. Looking to work with someone to come up with an arrangement that satisfies us both, or just sell the rifle outright. If you have an extra vehicle you dont need that doesnt have any serious problems and want to get yourself a higher end AR without spending a dime, maybe we can make a deal that helps us both out.

*I do not have the BCG for this rifle. I gave it to my brother as a Xmas gift and there is nothing I can do about that. The rifle is new in the factory hardshell case, never been fired, but I DO NOT have the bcg. If anyone wants to supply their own bcg and get my new Spikes rifle, $2000 is what it will take.

It's not enough to just have any old wood-stocked .22 Long Rifle semi-auto in their hands. These 22s are near carbon copies of full-size combat rifles. However, they have been modified to be less expensive to buy and to shoot. To flesh out this growing field of tactical can tappers, ISSC Austria has stepped forward with its contribution—the MK22.
For fans of the FN-SCAR battle rifle, the MK22 should look very familiar. Along with the FN-style stock and receiver outline, the MK22 has many of the same features as the rifle that inspired it. The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights. The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.

Action: Semi-Auto
Caliber: .22 Long Rifle
Finish: Tan Ti-Clad finish
Sights: Adjustable Rifle/ 3-Dot
Barrel Length: 16”
Overall Length: 36” (Stock Extended)
Width: 2.81”
Weight: 6.5 lbs.
Capacity: 10 + 1, or 22+1 Rounds
Twist: 1:16” RH
Rifle Grooves: 6 

The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. 
22-round magazine. The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. The three-dots are not terribly useful on this gun, but an interesting idea nonetheless. The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. Tan finish. Take advantage of the accessory rail system to dress up the gun a bit. The lower rail provides an ideal location for the Streamlight TLR-1. The rail has plenty of room to move this compact, powerful flashlight back and forth to find the ideal location operation. The guns feel like they should be filled with water from a garden hose rather than loaded with ammunition. But shouldering and shooting the MK22 feels like you are running a ""real"" gun. The recoil of the MK22 is feather light, as is to be expected. The trigger is smooth, gauging out at 4-pounds, 12-ounces, with some creep after the firing pin is released. 
The greatest strength of this rifle is the flexibility of its possible applications. For an understudy to the full-throttle FN-SCAR, a customizable small game hunter or over-the-top plinker, the MK22 can do it all with panache. I've even heard folks suggest that the combat features of this rifle make it a candidate for a low-recoil self-defense option for the injured or elderly. With quality ammunition, and enough rounds fired with proper shot placement, it could do the trick. For those folks who take their .22s seriously, the MK22 is seriously fun to work with.

Those who are familiar with M4 rifles know that Daniel Defense builds one of the premier rifles produced today. Daniel Defense supplies M4's to the U.S. Military and they are a favorite among U.S. Special Forces. While everyone advertises that they build to MIL-SPEC, Daniel builds their weapons to what they term MIL-SPEC Plus.

The truth about Mil-Specs -

Mil-Specs are a convenience for the federal government when sending out bid solicitations. The do not denote a higher quality, merely the minimum acceptable level of quality and/or performance. There are Mil-Specs on nearly everything the government buys - from powdered eggs, ice cream, and chocolate to aircraft parts.

Mil-Specs are just a convenient way for the federal government to purchase things that are guaranteed to meet the minimum acceptable quality or performance level - they're a way to specify something without the need to write a complete specification every time because the Mil-Spec is the specification. 

So, when buying a weapon you intend to use for defense, I hope you'll remember that Mil-Spec is just another way for the government to spend less of your tax dollars for the minimally acceptable product - not necessarily the best product.

Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The boat tail creates in-flight stability for long-range shooting. Hornady's swaging process creates precise formation of the core around the tip of the bullet, creating a build-up of energy which contributes to its phenomenal performance. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles. This ammunition is non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

****0301ST, a top-quality knife equipped with the patented SpeedSafe assisted opening system and equipped with a partially serrated blade. SpeedSafe enables users to deploy the blade one-handed—using their choice of an ambidextrous thumbstud or an equally ambidextrous blade protrusion.

In addition to SpeedSafe, the 0301ST features a tough S30V stainless steel blade with ZT’s tiger stripe Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating. The S30V blade steel is designed to provide the perfect combination of durability, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The Tungsten DLC tiger striping not only provides a non-reflective camouflaged surface, but also enhances blade hardness and reduces friction drag. The 0301’s Ranger Green scales are 3-D machined G-10 in the front and titanium on the back for incredible mechanical strength, a super-secure grip, and a solid blade lock-up.

The 0301ST also features a 3/8-inch hex head pivot shaft nut that makes field adjustments fast and easy with minimal tools. In addition, this dynamic folding knife comes with Zero Tolerance’s quad-mount system so you can configure the knife for tip-up or tip-down carry, left- or right-handed. This knife is also available in a plain edge version as the 0301.


****0300ST is easy for users to deploy one-handed—using the ambidextrous thumbstud or flipper blade protrusion. The flipper blade protrusion is easy to access and with a blade this massive, SpeedSafe supplies an assist you’ll appreciate. In addition to SpeedSafe, the 0300ST features a tough S30V stainless steel blade with matte black Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating. The S30V blade steel is designed to provide the perfect combination of durability, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The Tungsten DLC not only provides a non-reflective camouflaged surface, but also enhances blade hardness and reduces friction drag.

0300’s handle is 3D machined G-10 in the front with a matching 3D machined titanium back. The titanium frame lock provides a secure blade lock up during use. With or without gloves, this enables a very firm grip. The solid grip enables a quick transition from forward to reverse grip time and again. Heavy jimping on the thumb ramp further enhances the grip. A 3/8-inch hex head pivot shaft nut makes field adjustments possible with minimal tools. ZT's quad-mount pocketclip enables for tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed carry. The 0300ST is also available in a plain edge version as the 0300."

In the last 7 days, I have sold 10 ar rifles at pricing comparable to what you would have received last November. I asked each of you what your purpose was for purchasing, and my only wish was that they not be sold at inflated prices either on Armslist or at another forum . I wanted regular folks to be able to enjoy a reasonably priced AR.

Every single one of you relisted the guns within 8 hours for a highly inflated price. 

I had promised to relist the rifles as they came in to help you guys out, but that's a promise I will now break. 

So, the 11 rifles I received today , will not be sold on Armslist. I dont need to expose my self to this type of greed. You guys and gals are on your own...you can continue to screw one another and when the manufacturers catch up, and they will, your 2K ar will again be worth 900.00. 

What a pity!

I will not respond to emails...you guys are on your own...you all had your chance...



This response is what I'm talking about...don't you want to buy from this guy?

I didn't buy any from you but I made some good money flipping  AR's and I also got what I wanted so yes I sold for higher prices but also bought for higher prices, with the way the government is right now it's worth the risk waiting on prices to drop  so stop being such a crybaby and complaining

In other words, I can’t drive around “showing” it to potential buys who just want to see it (that happened a lot when I sold something here a year ago, so sorry).  It is exactly as described and factory new.  Please do research on the web before asking questions that are better answered by people who know more about these than I do.

More reliable then an AR, MUCH more accurate then ANY AK. Look em' up, I dare you. Just taking offers on it. It's in excellent condition. Has two mags. Does not take AK mags. Only VZ.58 mags. They can still be had for $16 for the 30 rounders. This gun is light, compact, accurate, and way cheaper to shoot then an AR right now. Make offer only."

Please do not reply asking for pics, if I had any, I would have posted them. It looks the same as every other bone stock brand new Spikes Tactical ST-15 with mid-length gas system. You are welcome to check it out in person.

Waited a year for this to become available and finally just received it last month, it is a brand new Spikes Tactical ST-15 (AR15), never been fired, M4 style flat top with 6 position collapsable stock. Mid-length gas system and 16"" chrome lined barrel. Spikes are known for being super reliable and accurate rifles out of the box with great fit and finish, and there is a long waiting list to get your hands on one. They are highly desirable and thats why it takes forever to get a new one and they are selling for over $2000 right now on gunbroker. This is not some walmart s&w, bushmaster, or dpms, each and every Spikes rifle is built by craftsmen with tight quality control and attention to detail. You will find absolutely zero negative comments about them anywhere and they are the choice of many law enforcement officers that are in the know. Dont take my word for it, research it yourself and read some reviews. Kills me to sell it now after it finally came in only a month ago but I need the cash for another vehicle and that is the only reason why I am even considering it. I would also consider trades up or down with cash on your part or mine for a decent reliable and fuel efficient vehicle. Prefer something like a toyota truck but open to any offers, just depends on what you have. Looking to work with someone to come up with an arrangement that satisfies us both, or just sell the rifle outright. If you have an extra vehicle you dont need that doesnt have any serious problems and want to get yourself a higher end AR without spending a dime, maybe we can make a deal that helps us both out.

*I do not have the BCG for this rifle. I gave it to my brother as a Xmas gift and there is nothing I can do about that. The rifle is new in the factory hardshell case, never been fired, but I DO NOT have the bcg. If anyone wants to supply their own bcg and get my new Spikes rifle, $2000 is what it will take. The price is firm. As you can probably tell, I really do not want to sell this rifle."

The SW9VEs and SW40VEs barrels and slides are all professionally duracoated in matte black to match the frame (giving it an all black finish, much like the special edition VE's that were hard to find). I had the Barrels done as well, whereas some ive seen previously just did the slide. This adds to the durability of the barrel as well as the look. Also added adapters and red lasers to each as well. Each pair comes with 10 mags (5 mags per gun), with the 9VE mags being 16 rounds and the 40VE mags being 14 rounds. The reason the VE series also was the one where you could still make the trigger mods to them to lighten the trigger pull (2 of mine have the trigger job done already), while also being improved over the first series of sigmas. From what i hear, the SD series isnt able to do trigger mods. Looking to get $950 per pair

The mags alone are going for about $40 each on gunbroker, so between the 10 mags per pair, the duracoat, and the lasers, these are well worth the asking price

If it doesn't sell that's ok too.  The following is everything I know about this gun...

I am the 2nd owner.  I bought if from a guy in Kentucky who wanted to sell it to make room in his safe for other stuff.  He liked the gun but not as well as others.  I got the impression from him that he hadn't used it much but I don't know the ""round count.""  I can tell you I've shot less than 200 rounds through it.

My research into this particular SKS leads me to believe that this rifle was made after the Clinton assault rifle ban and made by Norinco for export to the civilian market. It has no bayonet or bayonet lug and has a ""hunting"" look to the stock.  This gun packs all the punch of the black ""scary"" ""assault rifles"" that are out of vogue in Washington (and New York, and other places) without looking scary.

For those of you who like a shorter, more maneuverable SKS, this paratrooper fits the bill. Compared to it's longer SKS cousins, this 16"" barrel SKS is much more manageable. I think this would serve you well if you were to use this weapon for home defense; the standard SKSs would be too long and cumbersome for ""inside"" fighting. 

This SKS (like most) has a milled receiver for incredible durability. Because it was built by Norinco to use AK mags (and is not a conversion)  I call it ""THE POOR MAN'S AK"". For those of you who have an AK you can use the same mags (and ammo) that you're already using.  Some people have told me that SKSs tend to be more accurate that AKs, I'm not sure but I can tell you that this rifle is quite accurate. 

Like most AKs and SKSs this rifle has the adjustable front sight that allows you to (theoretically) use your iron sights for targets out to 1,000 meters. Practically speaking, my sights are spot on for up to 30 yards or so, after that distance I need the scope anyway ;-) . The front sight is nicely protected in a round shroud. For those of you who have an AK front sight adjustment tool, it will work on this SKS. 

The blonde wood stock is what came with the gun and shows some light wear but not too bad. No visible rust on the gun and the barrel's inside is very clean. I don't know if all the numbers match because when I have taken it apart to clean it I forget to check. If it is make or break for a serious buyer I'll look into it. I can tell you it functions flawlessly and I've kept it clean and lightly lubricated. This SKS also comes with it's original sling and a Tasco scope which is about the same age as the rifle. The scope mount on the rifle was engineered in such a way that you could look under it and utilize the iron sights if you so desired (see pic below). 

I'm not interested in most trades and any trades must be FTF. The only thing I might trade for would be an AK (with some $$ coming from me, for the right gun), but partial payment can be made in ammo as well (7.62 x 39, 9 mm, 40 S&W, 22 Long Rifle).  I'm only interested in up to $100 worth of ammo in partial payment.  If you are offering your gun in trade you must send me a few pictures with your offer.  

Note: The plastic mag in the pictures is for demonstration purposes only. No magazines are being offered with this gun.  If you want to purchase that magazine that would be extra and you must make sure it is legal in your locale.  

I prefer face to face near Indianapolis, any part of town except downtown or the west side (I'm hardly ever over on the west side anymore). I need to see an Indiana DL and LTCH. No paperwork, I just need to know you're not a felon or from out of state.  The buyer asserts that they are buying for themselves and this is not a ""straw purchase"".

If I receive an out of town bid, the bidder asserts that the gun is legal in your state/county/city.  The bidder/buyer  asserts that they are buying for themselves and this is not a ""straw purchase"".  Out of town buyers pay shipping and handling ($50) plus your FFL fee.  I will pay for my FFL."

Please do not reply asking for pics, if I had any, I would have posted them. It looks the same as every other bone stock brand new Spikes Tactical ST-15 with mid-length gas system. You are welcome to check it out in person.

Waited a year for this to become available and finally just received it last month, it is a brand new Spikes Tactical ST-15 (AR15), never been fired, M4 style flat top with 6 position collapsable stock. Mid-length gas system and 16"" chrome lined barrel. Spikes are known for being super reliable and accurate rifles out of the box with great fit and finish, and there is a long waiting list to get your hands on one. They are highly desirable and thats why it takes forever to get a new one and they are selling for over $2000 right now on gunbroker. This is not some walmart s&w, bushmaster, or dpms, each and every Spikes rifle is built by craftsmen with tight quality control and attention to detail. You will find absolutely zero negative comments about them anywhere and they are the choice of many law enforcement officers that are in the know. Dont take my word for it, research it yourself and read some reviews. Kills me to sell it now after it finally came in only a month ago but I need the cash for another vehicle and that is the only reason why I am even considering it. I would also consider trades up or down with cash on your part or mine for a decent reliable and fuel efficient vehicle. Prefer something like a toyota truck but open to any offers, just depends on what you have. Looking to work with someone to come up with an arrangement that satisfies us both, or just sell the rifle outright. If you have an extra vehicle you dont need that doesnt have any serious problems and want to get yourself a higher end AR without spending a dime, maybe we can make a deal that helps us both out.

*I do not have the BCG for this rifle. I gave it to my brother as a Xmas gift and there is nothing I can do about that. The rifle is new in the factory hardshell case, never been fired, but I DO NOT have the bcg. If anyone wants to supply their own bcg and get my new Spikes rifle, $2000 is what it will take. The price is firm. As you can probably tell, I really do not want to sell this rifle."

The SW9VEs and SW40VEs barrels and slides are all professionally duracoated in matte black to match the frame (giving it an all black finish, much like the special edition VE's that were hard to find). I had the Barrels done as well, whereas some ive seen previously just did the slide. This adds to the durability of the barrel as well as the look. Also added adapters and red lasers to each as well. Each pair comes with 10 mags (5 mags per gun), with the 9VE mags being 16 rounds and the 40VE mags being 14 rounds. The reason the VE series also was the one where you could still make the trigger mods to them to lighten the trigger pull (2 of mine have the trigger job done already), while also being improved over the first series of sigmas. From what i hear, the SD series isnt able to do trigger mods. Looking to get $950 per pair

The mags alone are going for about $40 each on gunbroker, so between the 10 mags per pair, the duracoat, and the lasers, these are well worth the asking price

I have determined the following prices based on GB (leading online auction site) auction prices.  My prices are below the average closing price.
