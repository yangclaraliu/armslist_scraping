Shotgun is in very good mechanical condition. I have fired light loads only, just to make sure it worked ok. It has had the stock taped a long time ago. Alot of older shotguns I have seen had tape because of cracks. I know that new wood is available for less than $60 on ebay. It is also missing the beed sight on the front but I know those are easy to get.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular rifles in the world. It has proven itself in the field and on target ranges as a durable, dependable, accurate rifle and is worthy of a quality scope and mounting system.

Many shooters prefer smaller scopes on this carbine because of their light weight and smaller profile. This 3X to 9X variable power mini-scope meets those qualifications and includes the added feature of a red illuminated reticle with range estimating mil-dots.

The unique Picatinny rail scope mount has multiple mounting slots which provide a wide range of mounting options. Mini-scopes can be mounted further back for precise eye relief adjustments, however, this mount is perfectly adaptable for use with red dot, hollogram and full size scopes).

This scope, mount and rings kit is compact, lightweight and very functional for shooters who normally hunt at closer ranges, yet need the extra magnification to reach out to targets at extreme rimfire ranges.

I love this gun, but I am moving to Philadelphia for a job on the 29th and need to thin down the collection.  I completely disassembled, cleaned, and oiled the gun from head to toe when I bought it and it works great!

I have put a total of 40 rounds through it with half being my personal reloads.  The gun will come with 20 rounds of loaded ammo that I reloaded with Hornady A-Max bullets, and a boresnake.  Additionally, I will throw in the Lee dies that I bought and the remaining 60 A-Max bullets for reloading.  

Now a little more about the gun.  It of course is sighted for 300 meters, so you have to aim low at 50 and 100 m to hit much.  I have a different front site that can be installed for shooting at 100 yards, but I never got around to it.  The reloads I am selling with it shoot great and give me <2 inch groups off a bag rest at 100 yards.  There are little bumps and scratches on the wood as with most old guns, and a little section of it has some deeper markings.  You can see those in the picture.  

Let me know if you want more pictures of her.  I will sell it in Philly if I don't like the offers I get here, so don't try to low ball me.  No trades!

I love this gun, but my girlfriend wants a new couch and she sold her XDm-9 and now I need to sell a gun to put towards it.  I completely disassembled, cleaned, and oiled the gun from head to toe when I bought it and it works great!

I have put a total of 40 rounds through it with half being my personal reloads.  The gun will come with 20 rounds of loaded ammo that I reloaded with Hornady A-Max bullets, and a boresnake.  Additionally, I will throw in the Lee dies that I bought and the remaining 60 A-Max bullets for reloading.  

Now a little more about the gun.  It of course is sighted for 300 meters, so you have to aim low at 50 and 100 m to hit much.  I have a different front site that can be installed for shooting at 100 yards, but I never got around to it.  The reloads I am selling with it shoot great and give me <2 inch groups off a bag rest at 100 yards.  There are little bumps and scratches on the wood as with most old guns, and a little section of it has some deeper markings.  You can see those in the picture.  

Let me know if you want more pictures of her.  I won't be able to sell her until after the 4th of July, since I will have family in town and will be too busy.  No trades!

I am mostly interested in a trade at this time for a James Bond type Walther PPK. I am not particular on a stainless steel or blued model PPK, just so long as the pistol is in good operational order. I would prefer the Smith & Wesson over the Interarms model as I have a large collection of Smiths. Yes I know the reputation Smith have, but it's what I prefer. :)

I also have a hankerin' for other guns such as a shot gun or .22 pistol for my daughter. As you would imagine, she loves pink, so I'd prefer a pink Walther P22 or pink Sig Sauer Mosquito...just let me know whatcha got. 

Anyway, this post includes the following:

• Ruger LCP .380 Auto Pistol (Blued)
• One magazine with extended finger grip 
o Spare non-finger grip magazine base 
• LaserLyte SML Ruger/Kel-Tec .380 - CK-AMF
 o Spare batteries
 o Sight tool
 o Owner’s manual
• Original box
• Original owner’s manual
• Original lock and keys
• Original fired casing and documents
• Original Ruger zipper pouch (not pictured)
• 50 rounds of ammo
 Additional information about the Ruger LCP 380: http://www.ruger.com/products/lcp/index.html 
Weighing just 9.4 oz (266.5 g) this is Ruger's first entry into the field of tiny, ultra-light defensive pistols.[4] LCP stands for ""Lightweight Compact Pistol"" and was designed in direct response to customer requests for a compact firearm for use by police as a back-up, and as a defensive handgun for civilian concealed carry needs.

The pistol has a glass-filled nylon frame, a two-finger grip, and a through-hardened blued steel slide. It is similar in appearance to the Kel-Tec P-3AT which weighs 8.3 oz. and uses a similar tension spring for the lightweight hammer, identical locked breech mechanism, and similar takedown method. The main differences are the Glock style extractor and the incorporation of an external slide stop. It is possible to tell if there is a round chambered by looking at the ""view hole"" next to the extractor

Additional information about the Laserlyte laser: http://www.laserlyte.com/products/ck-amf
 LaserLyte answers the growing demand for lasers specific to the increasingly popular conceal carry market with the new Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser (CK-AMF). At half the cost of a leading competitor, the CK-AMF fits on the side of the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec .380 and .32. Easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock pins with the new screws (included). Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The CK-AMF design works also as a finger guide that allows for safe trigger control without blocking the laser beam. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. The side mounted laser allows the pistol to fit in virtually any nylon pocket holster. The new LaserLyte Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser is compact and light, and foremost – deadly.

I've got a new Marlin .30-30 336. I've shot 2 boxes out of it. I bought it maybe a month ago, and I put one of those Wild West Trigger Happy triggers in it, because the stock trigger sucked. Its really nice. I also got a safety delete pin and replaced the safety. She's in good shape, and clean. I have the box, the lock, and the sling that came with it. 

I'm selling it because while I love the rifle, the .30-30 ballistics just aren't as awesome as I'd like. That being said, I have .308 dies already, so I'll consider trades for .308 rifles like Rem 700's, Win Model 70's, or XDm 9mms, things like that. 

The trigger cost $100, the rifle cost $400, the safety delete was $15, and I'll include 3 boxes of ammo. I'm asking $500, which I think is a very fair price, considering everyone is asking $500 for their super old used up .30-30s. Please don't ask me if I'll take $400, because no, I won't.

I can send pictures, but my phone is old and they won't look very good!

Up for sale is my Glock 27 Gen 4.  Great little carry gun that packs the .40 S&W punch.  Only reason it's going is I'm consolidating calibers within my household.  It has around 500 rounds through it (none of this ""I swear it only has one CLIP through it"" BS).  This pistol has not malfunctioned once, and has been maintained meticulously.  It shows very little wear, even having been carried every day.

Sub-Compact .40 S&W

Comes with 3 9-round magazines

Included are 3 Pearce Grip +0 pinky extensions, 1 Pearce Grip XL +1 round extension, and 3 standard Glock mag floorplates

Ameriglo I-Dot Pro night sights (only 1 year old)

Comes with Medium and Large changeable backstraps

Also included are all of the standard Glock package features such as: Glock case, lock, cleaning rod and brush, factory papers, and fired casings

Prefer FTF deal.  If you are interested, I could also deal in some high-end holsters for additional price, but it will be a fair deal.  I will only offer it to those who are serious enough to meet up to look at the gun.  

The only trade I am interested in is a Glock 19 Gen 4.

Buyer MUST HAVE a North Carolina CCW, and a photo ID that matches the permit OR a NC Pistol Purchase Permit.  This is not negotiable.

The beaver-tail frame is hard anodized light weight with integral Picatinny rail.The slide comes with Blackwater logo on top and the grips are also engraved with the Blackwater logo.Some of the Blackwaters features are a custom mag well, double action trigger is 10.0 lbs, single is 4.4 lbs, length is 7.7"",width1.5"", height 5.5"",Barrel 4.4"", sight radius 6.3"", weight with mag 34.0 oz., mag cap. 20 w/ 4 mags. I believe they started production of the Blackwater Tactical in 2009 and ended in 2010. This is a Blackwater TACTICAL, it is one of the very few that does not have front slide serrations, because it is one of the first ones produced, then they changed the design. This was manufactured in Jan. 2009. You can confirm this with a toll free call to Sig Sauer. This has had 75 rounds shot thru one magazine. The 3 other 20-round magazines are still sealed in factory packaging. Please do some research before making an offer. I am interested in quality Ars. I will sell outright if the price is right.

All you need is a receiver to build this back into a firearm. It is legally not a firearm now so no need for license and all that mess. I know a person that is selling a receiver for $75(you wont find one for under $175) that I will give buyer of kit his info and you can buy/deal with him for that.
