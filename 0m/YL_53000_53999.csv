I have a basically brand new Benelli Super Sport Carbon Fiber for sale. This gun is in pristine condition with no scratches, scuffs, blemishes or anything. IT'S BRAND NEW! This gun has only been shot about 500 times (mainly just trapshooting). The reason I'm selling this gun is because 1. I could use the extra cash  and 2. I have waaayyy to many Benellis. If you  noticed this gun was priced at 1625.00 US It's now priced at 1300.00 US THAT IS A STEAL!. This gun retails at a little over 2000.00 with all the extras. This gun comes with the following: 5 choke tubes, Benelli hard case, trigger lock, and I will throw in a fully stocked gun cleaning kit. 

If you want to know any other info about the gun you can look at my post a couple posts down from this one ( maybe like 6 down ). Please send emails to REDACTED or give me a call REDACTED. Thanks.  I DROPPED THE PRICE 325.00 US!! huge savings. Don't miss out on this gun!"

Deep foliage, nor canyons phase the rugged eTrex Vista HCx. Its high-sensitivity receiver holds a GPS signal in the toughest environments. Similar to the Vista Cx, this handheld navigator also has a bright color screen, barometric altimeter, electronic compass, microSD card slot and automatic routing for wherever adventure takes you. With its high-sensitivity, WAAS-enabled GPS receiver, eTrex Vista HCx locates your position quickly and precisely and maintains its GPS location even in heavy cover and deep canyons. The advantage is clear - whether you're in deep woods or just near tall buildings and trees, you can count on Vista HCx to help you find your  way when you need it the most. The Vista HCx has a built-in electronic compass that provides bearing information even while you're standing still, and its barometric altimeter tracks changes in pressure to pinpoint your precise altitude. You can even use the altimeter to plot barometric pressure over time, which can help you keep an eye on changing weather conditions. Adding maps is easier than ever with Vista HCx's microSD card slot. Conveniently plug in optional preloaded microSD cards with MapSource data for your land and sea excursions. Just insert a MapSource card with detailed street maps, and Vista HCx provides turn-by-turn directions to your destination. The card slot is located inside the waterproof battery compartment, so you don't have to worry about getting it wet. Like the rest of the eTrex series, Vista HCx is lightweight and compact - the perfect size for all your travels."

It comes with the rifle itself, shoulder strap, internal cleaning kit and rod, (2) 30 round magazines, (1) 10 round magazine, and a new case.  On a scale of 1-10, I would give this rifle an 8.6 in terms of cosmetics and a 10+ in terms of functionality.

399 rounds through it, you ask?? When new, I purchased 1000 rounds to go out shooting...I had 601 rounds left when the time came to trade it for .223 ammo (for my AR-15)  I have 50 rounds left that are going to be sent with the gun so you can start shooting right away.  Shipping should be $30 for the box and shipping (no handling charge); although, I would prefer to meet FTF.  This gun will only be sold to a qualified individual will only be sold to a AK-47 legal state.

This is for the 1 of 251, made in 2009, Marlin 308 SDT with a 16 1/2"" barrel in the powerful 308 Marlin Express. The action has the fluted bolt of the XLR series and has Ballard rifling. The rifle wears the OEM Williams Firesights and of course comes in the original box with all the papers, (no hammer spur & front sight hood were enclosed in the box, BOO hiss!). The condition of the rifle is NIB with no ding's, dents, gouges or any other wood damage. The stock wears the original equipment Marlin installed Pachmeyer Decelerator recoil pad on it. The metal work is excellent. The crown is perfect and there is no wear on the muzzle. The rifle balances very nice in hand and is very light in weight. And, just to note, this is a genuine 308 SDT as stamped in the barrel, not a cutdown imposter. 
The rifle is listed elsewhere at a fixed price.

 As I previously mentioned, I am an individual and not a dealer or business and because of this, the gun is sold with out warranties of any type on my part and all sales are final. That said, if you have been looking for an excellent example of these very handy and hard to find rifles at a very fair price, you will not be dissapointed with this one. Thanks for looking and good luck bidding.

It includes the original box as well as the instructions and warranty which has not been filled out. It also includes two sets of sights, a set of standard three dots and a set of Novak tritiums. 

http://www.taurususa.com/product-details.cfm?id=578&category=Pistol&toggle=tp&breadcrumbseries=OSS

This is a used gun but barely used as it was purchased 8/23/2010. It has only been fired just enough to ensure reliability as I planned on carrying it for self defense. All ammunition fired was factory ammo, no reloads. No +P ammunition has been fired either.

After purchasing the pistol I also purchased the Novak sights with Trijicon tritium inserts. The sights are brand new with a very bright glow to them. The Novak tritium front sight is installed and a standard two dot Novak rear installed. I will include the tritium rear as well as a single dot front that is not tritium so you can mix and match as you wish.

Here are prices for Novak sights:
[url]http://www.novaksights.com/products/sights/index.html[/url]

The pistol includes two 17 round magazines loaded with 16 rounds each of Hornady 115 grain Critical Defense FTX rounds. These cost around $20 per box of 25.

The pistol itself costs $466.44 shipped thru Bud's Gun Shop but did not include the Novak tritium sights. The Novaks cost an additional $155 shipped. Including the transfer fees this brings the total to over $645 for the pistol. 

This is an extremely nice shooting pistol and is very accurate. It is a SA/DA pistol with a decocker to allow DA carry or you can carry it cocked in SA and locked like a 1911. The trigger is very nice in both SA and DA.

I am not needing to sell the pistol but I am looking for something different. I like the pistol a lot but I have different wants at this time. If I don't sell or trade the pistol I will just keep it as it is a very nice pistol, just not what I am wanting now.

You will not find this pistol with these additional items for the price. I will not seperate any part of the deal.

Call only between 10am and 9pm please.

I am not in dire need of getting rid of this gun so please don't bother offering me something ridiculous like $300 or three broken motorcycles.  I want to trade for other guns +/- cash for the right deal."

I have 100 lbs of targets in 1 lb containers and have another 100 lbs in 1/2 containers coming (they are in route) and will have 2 lb containers and .22 sensitive targets within the next couple of weeks ! 

Save time and money buying locally! Buying from me you don't pay shipping and don't have to buy in bulk (10 plus lbs) and the best part is I will go to your house or meet you somewhere usually the day you call me.(I am working on getting my street vendors license)

You can make these targets yourself if you can find someone to sell you the chemicals. After the Oklahoma city bombing ammonia nitrate is usually only available to farmers or laboratories with a permit. If by chance you find someone that will let you buy the chemicals your probably going to get fertilizer. With these targets from sure shot they are made with lab grade chemicals witch gives you a Hell of a lot bigger bang. With these exploding targets every cubic inch of explosives will expand to 7 cubic yards of gas at over 15,000 feet per second. These are class 3 explosives according to the ATF and for good reason. 

.17 hmr and .223 and above will detonate all targets 
.22 lr will detonate .22 sensitive targets only 

Prices 

1/2 lb container = 5.00$
1 lb container = 7.00$
2 lb container = 12.00$

.22 sensitive 10 pack = 18.00$ < about the size of a silver dollar need to be a decent shot to hit them 
.22 sensitive 300 gram magnums = 10.00

The rifling and bore about an inch or two above the chamber are fouled bad.  Been soaking and scrubbing for about three weeks with minimal success. The rest of the bore looks good.  It is a Nazi stamped K 98 mauser.  The gun is chambered in 22 K-hornet.  The bolt band has been removed, so the bolt don't go all the way back for the short cartridge.  The bolt face has been modified for the smaller cartridge.  Action has some surface pitting, but not bad.  I believe this barrel could be used if re chambered to a larger cartridge.  Maybe could be cleaned with something else to remove the fouling.  All I have is brake cleaner and Hoppe's # 9.  I don't have a job right know, so I can't experiment with any thing.  The gun does shoot.  I shot it three times.  Ask for more questions or pictures.  Thanks.

Went and shot this after cleaning it up some and it shot a lot better.  Hornady factory ammo was with in an inch at 55 yards.  Pressure signs on the primers though.  The bolt head needs a little more work to be finished."

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 20"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an special muzzle break with the correct crush washer. This muzzle break is of special design that reduces felt recoil dramatically. Also included is a special steel collar between the gas block and muzzle break that can be used to attach a suppressor or other muzzle device. The barrel is machined from chrome moly steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. All external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. The barrel is right hand, 1 / 9 twist. The 1/9 twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.

The handguard is massively slotted for efficient cooling can be timed to any rotational position and then locked. This handguard completely free floats the barrel, contacting it only at the barrel nut. The four position gas block is machined from aircraft aluminum and hard coat anodized for long life and makes it quick and easy to attach sights and accessories. The buttstock is the current US Mil-Spec A2 buttstock. This is not intended to be an exact copy of an SPR, just a clone.

This rifle has been worked on extensively by Smith Enterprises.
This was the info given to me by the 2nd owner who was absolutely correct and this rifle is extremely accurate and I verified everything stated above..I have put 500 rounds of 168 grain Federal match and have excellent results. I was considering having it rebarreled but after shooting 1/2 to 3/4 inch moa I decided it doesn't need it. Previous owner took excellent care as well.. The bayonet lug was removed. approx round count is 2700.

Things included are ammo...3 boxes of federal gold match 168, 16 boxes of PPU match 168, 1 box of Black Hills 175.
A USGI stock in good condition have more pics if needed...Misc...M1A parts: front sight, rear sight marked (WCE) dewey cleaning rod...eagle industries discreet case... cheek pad can't remember maker..three 5 round check mate industries magazines, 2 cmi 10 round magazines, 2 unknown 10 magazines,,2 cmi 20 round rebuild magazines...quick cuff sling..

$400 or if you got a glock 26 we can make a deal

The guy I got it from said he hunted 2 turkey seasons with it and he carried it dove hunting with me once. I seen him shoot it but like I said I do not think I have shot it. It has 4 choke tubes (IMP, MOD, FULL and the extended XXFULL Turkey). There are a couple small spots from taking it in and out of the safe but nothing major that I seen. I stripped it down and cleaned it this morning and there is not hardly any wear inside. I have just over $340 in it, MSRP is $525 so you could probably find one for around $450 - I will take $325 OBO. THANKS!!

Here is what Mossberg says about them; from their website...
Each and every component of the 835® was designed and tested around the demanding requirements of high-power 3 1/2"" 12 gauge magnum ammo. Unlike other new-comers to this specialized market, who just modified their existing 2 3/4"" - 3"" shotguns, the 835® was designed to stay the course. The robust bolt, receiver, and other components are specifically sized for the longer shells and the downrange punishment they dish out. 

In addition, all 835® Ulti-Mag® smooth bore barrels are overbored to 10 gauge bore dimensions, reducing recoil and producing exceptionally uniform patterns from both light and heavy shot charges. Working in tandem with the performance-enhancing overbored barrels, strategic placement of eight ports on each side of the 835® barrel direct gasses upward and outward to not only reduce felt recoil, but to minimize muzzle jump for quick second shot recovery."
