It even comes with the original test casing from the factory. This is a very functional weapon and features double and sinlge actions. It has a working de-cocker as well as an external safety. I purchased this firearm from the original owner who was short on cash and hated to see it go and honestly I am sad to see it go as well. I did take it to the range and fired 50 rounds through it with 0 malfunctions. This is a very reliable weapon and is perfect for carry. These things go boom every time you pull the trigger. I did some poking around and actually found several videos on youtube of guys firing full clips through these guns completely underwater. Please feel free to text me or call me with any questions. I work a lot so texting is the best option but I will give you a call back if you want to leave me a voice mail. I may be interested in trading for a sub compact 9mm but please dont try to low ball me. I know what this pistol is worth and there is no point in waisting your time or mine.

Clean, basically new CMMG 5.56 AR 15.  Can shoot 5.56 and 223, has never had issues with any type of ammo from premium hunting rounds to cheap reloaded brass to steel case russian ammo (meaning you can save a ton).  Has only about 150 rounds through it.  It has a dust cover, forward assist, charging handle, etc, 16"" carbine length military parkerized barrel.  Selling because I got into handguns and shotguns more, and want to get into reloading.  (Will also trade for a FULL 9mm progressive press set up which is what I want most, will consider trades for quality handguns, or a nice side by side or over under shotgun).

Flat top model with picatinny rail, ready for optics, handrail, or any other accessory for that matter.  Currently in the pictures you will see that there are some clamp on flip up back up iron sights which work OK, but those are cheap and I would replace the rear sight or just use your optic of choice since it's a flat top.  Very accurate and precise with better sights like magpul or any other quality sight (that I no longer have).  Basic collapsible stock and basic hand guards.   All black, comes with an extra set of OD green hand guards, one 30 round P-Mag, one 20 round P-Mag, one 30 round older israeli defense magazine, OD green rifle case, and about 200 rounds of mixed new Federal 556 (brass case, about 130 ish) and Russian Tula 223 (steel case about 60-70 ish), all on stripper clips, a large pack of new stripper clips and stripper clip loader for quick loads, and M16/AR 15 cleaning kit."

More pictures upon request.

For sale is a lightly used Kel-Tec PF-9 with olive drab frame, chambered in 9mm. This pistol has less then 100 factory rounds through it and was carried very little. Bore is sharp and shiny and the pistol shows little evidence of any considerable use. This very compact pistol is in very good condition and includes the following:

2 Factory Magazines (One with finger grip extension and one with flat mag base, also comes with one addition flat mag base if you don't like the finger grip extension.)

1 Galco STO460 IWB leather holster

1 Fobus C-21B Paddle holster

Case, manual, original paperwork, and lock


The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Luger 9 x 19 mm
Weight unloaded: 12.7 oz.
Loaded magazine: 5.5 oz.
Length: 5.85""
Height: 4.3""
Width: 0.88""
Barrel Length: 3.1""
Capacity: 7 + 1
Trigger Pull: 5 lbs.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

I made a new mag follower that makes it possible to have 14 rounds in the magazines, instead of the factory 10 rounds, you cannot use the protruding metal pin that sticks out of it though, but who cares as the mags are easy to load conventional style.

I'm taking the piece i made to a local plant that does injection type plastic molding and seeing what it would take to make them in quantities, that is if anyone would be interested in such a thing.

The one i made, I have used it in my personal mags, and not a single foul up, or round mis-feed, it works just like the factory piece does.

I understand why they make them all 10 rounders, because of states that cannot have any mags over 10 rounds, but there are states that do allow for high cap mags.

I have posted pics of the rounds in the mag, but i will not post a pic of the piece i made, because i don't want to give it away, until i find out if others would be interested in such a thing, I think there will be a demand for these.

I made the CCW holster myself also, it is made out of Elk hide, and with raw hide for the inside skin for durability, and hand stitched it myself with artificial sinew."

A CHEAP SEMI-AUTO MAY NOT FUNCTION AS QUICKLY AS A SINGLE SHOT!!  Picture on Guns International looks like mine tagged ""ECLAIR LEIGE"". This 16GA. single shot with exposed hammer has a part round & part octagon barrel about 29"" long and an attractive stock. I think it's called a SIDE LOCK, as the latch is on the right side rather than the top. No brand name on the gun but lots of Belgian Proof Marks and a tasteful amount of engraving. I last used it to resolve a feral  varmint problem at my country house in the late 1980's. Since then it's been a display piece in my den. This shotgun is LIGHT enough to carry all day in the field, BEAUTIFUL enough to hang on the wall in your office or den, and packs a healthy wallop. It's not a virgin safe queen but you won't be ashamed to display OR carry it. Why buy a CLUNKY single shot when you can have BELGIAN QUALITY in a LIGHT WEIGHT BEAUTY?  CASH price is $250 FIRM. Sorry, I don't  have photo capability, no camera phone. NO SHIPPING, NO TRADES, NO B.S. OFFERS.

I have fired the gun about 200 times, and it performed flawlessly. The bottle-necked 5.7x28 shell cycles smooth and more reliably than a conventional semi-auto round, so I imagine this gun will never jam.

Have original factory case complete with manual, cleaning tools, and 3 factory, 20-round magazines. Yes, they are 20-round mags, and that is a lot of firepower from a handgun basically shooting a necked-down .223 round at about 2000fps.

This weapon system is only familiar to military, SWAT teams, and serious enthusiasts. It is a lot of fun at the range, shoots flat, and kicks about like a .22 Magnum.

Its light, easy to disassemble and clean, and extremely durable.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

This is a very cool gun with aircraft sights.  I think it is a 7.7 Cal.  - The barrel looks to me to have been cut a little shorter and the bolt has been turned down most likely for a scope or something.  Finally it does not have the flower on the barrel.  I looked it up and some do not have this flower so either it has been sanded off or never came with it.  I have seen these guns priced at $350-$450.  I am selling at roughly half the price to compensate for the differences from original.

I want to buy your Old, Rusty, Broken or Fire Damaged Winchester Rifle - Parts missing = OK. Broken, Does Not Work = OK Model, year not important. Older, the better! If you have a project that you will ""get to one day"" and haven't - I want to buy it. I'll use the parts to make another Winchester almost new again! In the medical field you could say that I do ""transplants"" to patients needing a new heart, lung or such. Your old Winchester will live again but in another body. Go now, to the fartherest corner of your shop and dig out that old, tired soldier and send it to me. I'll prepare it for surgery.
You'll be surprised how much I'll pay for it!!
I pay CA$H. -or- I have Shotgun Barrels to offer for trade. (choose from 300) I also have over 250 rifle barrels for trade! I might even find a real shootin' gun to trade for yours.
