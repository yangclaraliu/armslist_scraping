P-32

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.

The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

This gun has had the barrel polished and has a front night sight.
i was asking 500 but i'm starting to realize that i cannot sell it quick with that price on it. 
450 is about what you would spend on a new one locally and those who keep saying that you can buy one for 389.99 online. you still have tax and FFL fees. i think 450 is fair for the package you are getting.

the gun has a heat shield installed on it. nice gun for home defense .

WITNESS DESCRIPTION: 
The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. 

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you'll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.

This is a great looking and shooting gun made in 1942 that has been thru the post WWII Soviet arsenal refurbishing program.

The gun was made at the Tula Arsenal in 1942 – the receiver bridge has the Tula star arsenal mark and is clearly stamped with the year of manufacture. The irregular box that encompasses these marks indicates the rifle was arsenal rebuilt after WWII likely in the 1950’s or 1960’s. only about 7000 of these guns were imported to the United States before the import ban in 1998 this rifle has the small import markings along the reciver beltline and partialy hidden by the stock........

 A summary of the features on the gun are as followed:

 •Features early style 6 baffle muzzle break and type 1 sling swivels ( free moving ) not cast
 •Complete with proper cleaning rod
 •Plumb colored manganese arsenal refinished bolt and bolt carrier Numbers  match on receiver, stock, bolt, bolt carrier, and trigger guard. However, the numbers on the bolt, carrier and trigger guard are electro-pencil arsenal forced match, while the receiver and stock numbers are stamped
 •10 round detachable magazine
 •AVT 40 hardwood stock

 By far the best feature of this rifle is the AVT 40 stock. The AVT 40 was the select fire version of an SVT 40. Of course the merits of a select fire rifle in 7.62X54r with a 10 round magazine are debatable. But the stresses of war in the Soviet Union at the time brought some really dumb ideas and designs to fruition. As a result, we get the AVT 40 stock made of a true hardwood instead of the arctic birch normally used for standard SVT 40 stock. The AVT 40 stock is heavier, denser, and has a larger cross-sectional area in the wrist and along the receiver. I personally would not buy an SVT 40 without an AVT 40 stock just for the added strength, added heft, and beefier grip for larger hands. The AVT 40 stock can be positively identified by the dual selector cut-outs just behind the trigger, one on each side of the stock (see pics). If the stock has only one selector cut-out, it is a standard arctic birch SVT-40 stock.

The bore on the gun is brite and shiny and the the lands and grooves are crisp sharp and well defined. The adjustable gas system is clean and functioning – it can be adjusted using a small wrench. It is not frozen on one setting due to corrosion like many other SVT40's on the market . The rifle is a strong shooter I have had it since 1990 and it has been a safe queen most of the time Ihave fired about 50 rounds thru it in that time. 

The gun sports about 98% of the arsenal refinish, has nice bluing, a bit thin is some spots, but it is all there. The lacquered finish on the stock is strong about 98% complete, with very minor chipping and flaking near the stock cross bolt and the rear of the receiver above the wrist – hardly noticeable.

Changing times have caused me to reevaluate my gun collection and after much debate, I decided to put this gun up for sale. I feel this is a better than average gun, but the i feel the price is very reasonable concidering the condition the gun is in. I am looking for  cash but will accept partial trade if reasonable... Please be real and serious I have had several flakes and scammers contact me only to lowball me or back out at the last second....that being said, I can ship to your FFL dealer or face to face if your local please text REDACTED  ..."

From Trijicon's website:


TA01NSN-TRD: 4x32 Trijicon ACOG® with 8.0 MOA
The TA01NSN-TRD combines the technology of the battle-tested Trijicon ACOG (4x32) gun sight with the Trijicon RedDot™ 8.0 MOA red dot sight. This provides the shooter with the option of quick acquisition close range sighting with the RedDot™ sight and the precision for longer range shooting with the Trijicon ACOG 4x32. This ability to adjust to tactical situations gives the user the needed edge when the lives are on the line and success is the only acceptable outcome. The ranging reticle allows for bullet drop compensation out to 600 meters without any manual adjustments. The reticle will appear black during the daytime and will glow amber in the dark, thanks to Trijicon’s patented tritium illumination."

Supposed to be the next great thing!

Years of research and testing by Dynamic Research Technology (DRT) in conjunction with elite agencies world wide have created the deadliest ammunition available. This is the only ammunition used to safeguard officials and has earned the name ""Dead Right There"". The uniqueness of this copper-jacketed ammunition is in the compressed powder core which is as fine as talcum powder, as the bullet is fired it is spinning at such a high speed, when it reaches any part of the ""target"" and comes into contact with the organic tissue the hydrostatic shock of the soft material going into the hollow point actually makes the entire core projectile expand creating a fatal wound. The bullet will not pass through the ""target"" making it perfect for home defense or close quarter combat. Hit any part of the body to stop it dead in its tracks."

I am a hobbyist at best and will do all I can to answer questions. All specs listed below are from the manufacture site based on the pistol's model number.

FROM MANUFACTURER
========================
These rugged, durable revolvers also make a practical choice for backpacks and tackle boxes, especially where there are bears and other predators around. Extremely comfortable to fire and easy to control - the Tracker Series continues to grow in popularity thanks to its high level of accuracy, rock-solid performance and near-indestructible construction.

Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality

Rifle has been sold twice now and guys keep changing thier minds so NO more hold it for me calls please. Missed other sells doing so. I am not being rude just straight forward. This is an amazing deal! Close to $600 invested in this setup that is basically BRAND NEW!

This compensated CP88 Competition air pistol uses a 6"" barrel versus the 4"" found on the standard CP88 airgun. The longer sighting plane of the 6"" barrel and a smooth trigger pull in either single or double action insures exceptional accuracy from this CO2 powered gun.

Built at ERMA-Werke, one is marked with this manufacturer, and the other was made in W.Germany, but imported by Iver-Johnson, and marked accordingly.
These are excellent little carbines, weighing in at almost exactly the weight of the US Military M1 Carbine.

The magazines are built to resemble the M1 military ones, but chambered in .22LR.  These magazines hold 10, 15, and 15 rounds, as shown in the picture.  They were often lost or misplaced, and these are quite rare.  Also, the rear sights were often misplaced when the carbines were fitted with scopes.  But both of these rear sights are present, as shown.

The rifles are fitted with reproduction slings, and the Iver-Johnson has a repro oiler.  The ERMA carbine has a dowel in place of the oiler.

Rifles are $350 each.  Magazines are: 10-rnd $45; 15-rnd $60. I cannot sell magazines before the rifles.  Each rifle must have at least one magazine as option.

Total package (Buy the entire package) is $750, face to face, within 50 miles of Williston, SC.  Can meet in Columbia, Aiken, Orangeburg, Barnwell, etc.

Shipping will require the buyer to pay by postal money order, and secure the services of an FFL to receive these.  FTF buyer will be non-felon, not under indictment, and will have cash in hand.  If your state will not allow high capacity magazines, I cannot sell you the 15-round magazines.

Complete AR-15 for sale with lots of extras. Asking $1050 firm. 

Upper Specs: CMMG M4A1 SOCOM upper, Vltor CASV-EL, MI BUIS, Bobro VFG (large), NATO 5.56, 14.7 chrome-lined, 4150 steel, MP barrel w/ A2 perma hider (making it non-NFA), 1/7 twist, CMT/Stag BCG, properly staked gas key, F-marked FSB, and M4 feed ramps. 

Lower: SEMI-AUTO, Spike's Tactical, Daniel Defense ambi-sling end plate, KNS pins, Rainier Arms Enhanced Trigger Guard, cleanly staked castle nut, mil-spec diameter tube, standard carbine buffer. This lower has the spider logo and select fire H&K style bullet pictograms. Comes with standard M4 6 position collapsible stock (CMMG).

This weapon is used but still like new. It has a low round count (maybe 300-400 rounds of green tip X-tac 62gr) with no issues. I am the original owner. Everything was purchased brand new. The base upper assembly was a takeaway from a factory complete CMMG rifle. The lower was purchased complete, directly from Spike's Tactical. I upgraded it with a few accessories (sling plate, KNS pins). 

There is no canted FSB or other defects with this weapon. The rail is in excellent condition. These Vltor rail systems are rock solid and battle proven by U.S. Navy EOD. 

Weapon does not come with a case or any mags.

I can ship the rifle your FFL ($25 ship fee, plus make sure your dealer will accept a rifle from a non-licensed person), or we can do a FTF in a public setting in the Kingsport area (legal residents of Tennessee only). Out of state buyers must go through an FFL, per ATF interstate sales rules. For FTF I may ask to see your TN driver's license or state ID.

If you would like to simply purchase the upper assembly with all accessories, minus the lower, I will take $800 for it. I can ship the upper directly to you, since it's not considered a firearm.

Obviously no sales to minors, felons, or anyone who cannot legally own this weapon.

Payment methods: U.S. Postal Money Order (mailed) or cash (FTF). No checks, sorry.

Serious buyers only. All sales are final.

Attached are some pictures of the actual weapon. If you have questions or would like more photos, feel free to email me via the ""contact seller"" button. Thanks for looking."

This has been used at the Bad Karma Airsoft Field and is the gear you want to take with you. It includes:

2 Batteries
4 Magazines but note the one of the magazines DOES NOT WORK, and I can't remember which one. You may be able to repair it.
Smart charger (so it doesn't over charge the batteries)
Molle vest (I played black shirt team and thats why it's black) no pockets but even without makes for very good armor.

    Looking to trade for a real gun, I'll trade straight out for a LCP or  .380 Bersa in decent shape, or if you have something cool let me know and I'll tell you if I'm interested. 

    As a bonus I'll throw in a 30-30 & 12 gauge lazer bore sites (located upper left in the picture). They are shaped just like the ammo and you install them the same way. I got them to sight in my guns but they do not work very far at an outdoor range in the daytime. So if you have an indoor range, or somewhere to shoot at night then they may work for you, if not you can always use them to entertain your cats.

    Looking for FTF only and I am a TN resident and have my carry permit.

TL;DR: All the stuff in the picture for your LCP, 380 Bersa or ? & yes I'm legal to own a gun"

The wood furniture that it came with was not the greatest so I upgraded to a synthetic side folder stock and 4 rail hand guard. the Pistol grip is synthetic as well. I am not the greatest with iron sights so I put a red dot on it and wrapped the stock in paracord to raise the cheek weld and it helps with recoil as well. It's a 2 MOA rifle with the right ammo so it's a great specimen.
