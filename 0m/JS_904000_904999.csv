This is a Jukar .45 black powder pistol. I never shot it, so it remains unfired. It's in excellent shape, wood is free of knicks, dents or scratches, metal is clean and untarnished, no rust, and the lock is strong. Missing its ramrod but I ran a patch down the barrel and it came out with no powder residue. It still has the tag on it from when I got it and as you can see it was originally $129. I am asking $100 but will take the best offer I can get. Just need some cash to get me to the first of the month.

The next-generation PMAG GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

The next-generation PMAG 30 Window GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining."

DETAILED PRODUCT INFO: 

The Most Up-To-Date & Reliable Civilian Magazine Available

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. 

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber Yreinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. This mag has our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.”

This is a very rare variant of an extremely hard to come by pistol.

In 1979, Wayne Daniel manufactured a semi auto only version and somehow (miraculously, I still don't know how he pulled it off) was able to get the BATFE to approve it as a Title 1 firearm i.e. a 'Regular' gun. The open bolt semi auto M10 pistol manufactured by RPB were initially made using surplus SMG parts bought from Military Armaments Corporation when they went out of buisness in 1978.

The period of manufacture was short lived however as in 1982 - the BATFE reversed its decision on approving the open bolt semi auto guns when it was found that they were easily converted to full auto. Effective June 21st 1982, any new M10's made as open bolt pistols were to be considered Title 2 firearms (i.e. machine guns)....

These were produced for less than 3 years and can never be made again. 

In case you don't believe that there is any way this can be legal please read the text of the ATF decision rule 82-2 which banned any more of these from being made but allowed the ones already in circulation to be grandfathered.

This is sold as a unique collectible pistol, you are responsible for complying with all state and federal laws (i.e. don't do anything illegal with it, to it, around it. Don't think illegal thoughts, don't contemplate any hypothetical, don't ask any STUPID questions, and don't discuss anything nefarious even as a joke...)"

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is a .40 S&W caliber.

You must have a valid ID for me to view (verify you are 21), and have no prior known felonies (obviously).  Serious buyers only.  I will write up a receipt for you showing serial number and date of new ownership so you have it for your records.  

Okay, now for the reason I am selling.  Well..... siimply put I LOVE this XDM but it is just a bit too large in the grip area for my fiancee who has VERY small hands.  So, I have chosen to purchase a different handgun which will suit both of us better not just myself.  Absolutely nothing wrong with it and the gun still looks new because it only has about 300 rounds through it.  

You must come to me to buy it or see it unless otherwise agreed upon.  Thank you!

This is chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson. It comes in hard case with 2-magazines & the full MFG warranty.

MFG Description:
Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is a .40 S&W caliber.

Burris MTAC Scope #200429   $350

The Burris MTAC features even better glass quality than their Tac 30 series, with fully multicoated lenses and laboratory grade nitrogen purging. The power ring moves seperate from the ocular bell, meaning the shooter can easily zoom all the way from 1.5x to 6x with little effort. The 40mm objective and 30mm tube result in an excellent exit pupil measurement of 13mm at 1.5x. The CQ reticle features ten red illumination settings with ""off"" stops in between each one. The brightest setting is useable in daylight. The CQ reticle features built in holdover points from 100 to 600 yards and can be used with either 5.56 NATO or 7.62 NATO calibers, but is ""native"" to 5.56 NATO. 7.62 shooters will have to use the finger adjustable turrets to make a couple of audible, tactile clicks for the reticle's holdover points to work correctly. The MTAC is 2nd focal plane so the reticle does not change size as you zoom. It is covered by Burris's Forever Warranty.

From the Manufacturer:
The Izhmash Saiga autoloading shotgun incorporates the Kalashnikov design, providing reliability and simplicity of operation. Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4” sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands. Models are available with side optic mounting rails, bead front sight, V notch rear sight or leaf rear sight. Included is a detachable five round magazine (two round hunting magazines are also available)."
