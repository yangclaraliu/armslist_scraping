I upgraded the barrel to a shorter 24"" ported barrel. I bought the barrel brand new. It is factory Mossberg camo dipped, factory ported, and came with an extended turkery choke. Also added a Choate mag extension and Knoxx recoil reducing stock. I have put 20 rounds through it the way it is set up now and this thing shoots awesome with very lil recoil.

Also, I painted the reciever and mag extension to kinda match the barrel. And I bought a used forend off ebay for it. It is a factory finish camo forend but didnt realize until after I bought it that it is the woodland camo and doesnt match the same camo Mossberg used on the barrel. 

Lookign to trade for an 870 or 500 12 or 20ga or possible pistol or rifle. Open to really anything, whatcha got? Trade value is $350-400 but will take $300 cash for it.

This is the tactical one from Savage with the fluted barrel, McMillan style stock and tactical bolt knob. Has Accutrigger. One 5rnd magazine. Great shape, 95% gun. Previous owner said he fired 600 rounds, and I've fired about 100 through it. With good ammo (hell even without good ammo) its easily the most accurate rimfire in my safe. Cloverleafs at 50 if you do your part. Very fun rifle. Comes with Centerpoint 4-16x40 scope, it actually holds zero and has repeatable clicks (this must be a good one). Pretty clear glass up to 10x as well. Unknown brand of rings. Bipod not included. 





Brand new its $400 plus ffl/shipping from buds (cheapest I found) and $440 on Gunbroker. Scope was $70 new. I'm asking $400 for this one.


Remington 591 5mm Magnum rifle. Pretty rare little rifle. Bolt action, 4+1 magazine. Shoots the very flat shooting 5mm Magnum rimfire round. Nearly as flat as a 17HMR, but with 22WMR power. At 200 yrds with a 100yrd zero, its only a couple inches drop and still holds enough energy at that distance to knock a groundhog flat dead (ask me how I know). Rifle is in 90% shape, no bluing loss but a few dings in the wood. The pistol grip cap is in perfect shape compared to most of the ones you find are buggered up. 

Rifle does NOT include scope or rings. Rifle, clip and ammo ONLY. I have over 200rnds of ammo for this rifle, that is worth $80 itself. Ammo is readily available, and priced between $15.99 and $19.99 depending on the place. Bipod not included. 





I'm asking $550 for the whole package on the Remington. Thats rifle and ammo.

Sales need to be FTF in the Youngsville, Wake Forest, Raleigh, NC area. I sometimes travel to Wilmington or Asheville, and I can hold the rifle for you with a deposit. I will ship on your dime as well. No trades at this time."

THE 10mm pistol! A whacking chunk of American Stainless steel. Accurate, with power to boot. Barrel/barrel bushing are lapped. Trigger was fixed by S&W back in the early 90s. Six S&W magazines. One CrossBreed Supertuck holster, custom leather pancake holster. Hand fitted rubber Hogue grips (have the original ""derlin"" grips, too). Adjustable LPA rear sight. I also have the original Novaks. Box and papers. Reloading dies, brass, and loads of ammunition (which will cost extra). This is a complete set-up.

This was the pistol that was designed for the FBI following the findings of the Miami-Shootout disaster. The 10mm is the father of the 40 S&W and .357 SIG and more powerful than both. It uses widely available 40 caliber bullets. 10mm has more energy at 100 yards than a 45 ACP does at the muzzle.

This pistol has not been made for nearly two decades and it looks as if no more Full-Size 3rd Generation S&Ws will be made. This was their king. It has the SIG type frame-mounted de-cocker, regarded by many as superior to the difficult S&W type slide-safety. The double action trigger on this pistol is remarkably smooth, and single action is very good. 

If you have not experienced 10mm, I suggest you do. It is makes the 40 Short and Weak and 45 ACP feel like a joke. Unlike the Glock 20, the 1076 is truly up the the task of handling full-house 10mm, not simply the FBI-lite.

Unlike some FBI and Kentucky State police trade-ins, this has not been abused. It is in superior condition.

Ohio DL absolutely required. Ohio CCW holders and Miami Rifle and Pistol club members given preference."

They are battlefield pickups with rough finish and carvings on them, still covered in cosmoline. They include metal hardware such as sling swivels and buttplates, but don't have screws for the pistol grips. Should work on most ak's with some minor fitting.
Most of the carvings would come off with a little sanding- I've refinished one for my own rifle and it looks really nice, or would make for an interesting AK if you wanted to leave them. They are mostly small Cyrillic words, maybe the former owner's name, but one has a larger carving on the buttstock (third picture).

This is a great all original WW11 rifle and an excellent shooter. This is a very rare model of 1903A3's, that have some characteristics of the older 1903 model 1919 (flip-up ladder style rear sight and no finger groove on the stock) very very cool old design.

About the rifle (serial number and reference book used to get history of THIS SPECIFIC rifle!):
It was manufactured in November of 1942 at the Remington typewriter factory in New York, New York. It was shipped out to the Marine Corps that month for use in New guniea and the Solomons. From there it traveled from island to island, hopping with the Marines through Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, Saipan, and Peleliu, seeing action on every one. Before Iwo Jima, they were replaced entirely by the M1 Carbine, except for a few in commando missions (not this one though). This rifle was then shipped back to the states for use in boot camp as marksmanship training rifle from 1944 to the end of the war. Then used as a drill rifle by all services. (from the fleck of white paint left on the stock, and the overall condition, my guess is that it was used by military police in Korea, not as a drill rifle.) That is up until 1955-56, where all M1903 rifles were re-collected, refurbished if necessary, re-parkerized if necessary, and then sold to retired WWII and Korean war vets as hunting rifles for $25.50. Officers were allowed to hand-pick their rifles and that is were the majority of collector grade rifles came from. Some were converted to hunting rifles with new stocks and are now worth around $200. The untouched military versions can be worth thousands. The rest were sent out to VFW, ROTC, and other military units as ceremonial drill rifles where their barrels were filled with lead and receivers were rendered inoperable or were used in military burials. This one sat unfired in a cabinet for the last 55 years completely untouched. I've only put 40 rounds through it.

Finish still looks great, no major wear anywhere, only a few hundred rounds through.  The grips on it are the factory Taurus grips, but have been professionally stippled--they offer a more aggressive look to the gun and a much better grip.  

Pistol comes with original box, manual, and accessories (hex keys for lock, etc). and 2 8-round Taurus magazines.

If you want to shoot the gun double action, the decocker is really odd on this gun. To decock it, you set the safety on safe and pull the trigger. Yep, that's not a misprint...you pull the trigger to safely drop the hammer. The best route is to not bother with double action shooting with this gun. The single action shooting is easy and fun.The Walther P22 comes in two sizes: one with a 5"" barrel (mine shown) which also has a compensator that probably doesn't actually accomplish anything. It just makes the gun look cooler. It also comes in a model with a 3.4 "" barrel with no compensator.

The gun features interchangeable backstraps to better fit a shooters hand, ambidextrous controls, magazine disconnect, hammer safety and firing pin safety, fixed (read more accurate) barrel, and interchangeable barrel. The gun is only 18.7 oz, comes with two 10 round magazines, rear sight adjustable for windage, 3 interchangeable front sights for elevation, sights of the 3 dot configuration.The gun is plenty accurate with the fixed barrel contributing to that aspect of the gun. With it being super light, it is easy to maneuver and the sights come in line quickly on the 5"" model. People who shot it initially loved it and could hit anything they shot at with little time to get used to the gun.
When I purchased the Walther P22, I thought it to be a little pricey at around $360 plus tax new. But considering the weight and size, ability of people of all sizes to shoot it, accuracy, and exceptional dependability, I now consider it to be a good value. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an acceptable .22 pistol for the whole family.

The exact same chasis the the U.S. military use.
The Navy Seal Grey chasis is next to impossible to find at this time and is highly sought after.

Very accurate rifle that has one of the best muzzle brakes,is loud and fun to shoot. It is heavy,about 12 pounds empty.
Can shoot either NATO 7.62x51mm ammo or.308win ammo.One 20 round magazine and one 10 round magazine included.
Also included is 100 rounds milsurp ammo and 2 Korean 20 round mags and 2 chinese 20 round mags, gas cylinder wrench,unused buttstock cleaning kit.
*** DOES NOT INCLUDE ORIGINAL STOCK AND RAIL.***

You can change the buttstock with any that will fit a Remington 870 shotgun also.

Scope is a Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40mm on a Basset Machine mount.
Bipod is a Shooter's Ridge 9-13 inch.
Buttstock is adjustable with built in adjustable cheekrest.

It is over 4.5 feet tall, and 4 feet wide (4.5'x4'x3'). This thing is huge! Tired of digging in the grass to find your missed arrows? This is your answer.

Shoot at 80 yards without worrying about loosing arrows. If you live in town and want to shoot safely in your back yard, this thing is big enough that you don't have to worry about a miss. If you have a kid just learning to shoot, set this up for them. This thing will stop any arrow they shoot at it. It is so big that you cant miss it!

This is also one of the easiest targets I have ever used. I can pull 3 arrows out at the same time with just 2 fingers, and do it with ease even using my compound. I am serious when I say that you will not find a target easier to pull arrows from. If you don't believe me, come over and you can check it out for yourself.

Not only is it the biggest target you will ever find, and the easiest to pull arrows from, but it lasts forever. My dad has had one for almost 10 years and we still use it. You can shoot at 4 different sides, so there is no way you can wear it out. You can paint dots, cross-hairs, deer and turkey silhouettes, whatever... 

Use it in your back yard, drag it to your deer lease, take it out with your buddy's and use it for a back stop on the longest 3D target shot. It is light enough 1 person can handle it alone. You can't go wrong with this thing.

These guns are very rare and highly unique. This specific one was made in West Germany in June of 1987. It is in great condition with very minor holster wear on the slide near the muzzle and the rear sights.

These guns are no longer produced and have high value. The P7 is a semi-automatic, blowback-operated firearm. It features a unique gas-delayed blow-back locking system, which reduces felt recoil and makes for reliable operation. Even if the extractor would break, it would still eject casings.

It also uses a squeeze cocking lever in the frame. Making this on of the, if not the safest handgun, without that squeeze cocker being held, the striker is not cocked, and it will not fire. The squeeze cocker also is used as the slide release after changing mages, making it a quick single action to fire after loading a new magazine. This also encourages tight grip increasing reliability.

Another unique feature is its barrel which is fixed into the frame. This serves to greatly improve accuracy, the barrel does not move when a round is discharged or move if the slide is in movement. This also helps bring the center of mass move towards the hand, reducing felt recoil.

These truly are great guns. I am quite surprised no one has tried to make one similar to it recently. I absolutely hate to sell it but I am looking for a more CCW friendly handgun.


Comes with:
-Original Box
-Original Manual
-Original Cleaning Rod
-2 Magazines (8 round H&K mags)(Mags can go for $60 each)
-Leather Belt Holster (Hard to find)

It has been fired around 200 times. 

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

One mag, 60 rounds of ammo and 3-9x32 mil dot scope. $200 OBO .17HMR

(scope in picture is not the one on the rifle now) 

Yes that stock is painted, it was originally FDE from savage, the last guy painted it camo and I painted over it with FDE. If you want the 4-16x40 scope thats pictured the price is $250 and I have a case I can throw in for $25. Just the gun and mag, no scope, rings, or bases for $160 firm, If that painted stock is a problem I can swap it out for a plain black factory stock just like it for free. 

Next up is a FEG 7.65mm Md74, thats what its stamped. However it is actually a Romanian Md74. Not sure of the date on this one but I am leaning to 1981 ish. Left grip was modified and thumb rest removed to fit my hand better. I have two mags and hogue hand all installed for $220 OBO with 14 rounds of ammo included. ( for those that dont know 7.65mm is 32acp )


last up is a leupold M8 2x20 pistol scope. Was mounted on a ruger redhawk and holds zero just fine. Its got some spectacular glass and is beautiful but not my style. Its got the gloss finish and looks new. Asking $220 OBO

Comes in original S&W case with paperwork. This particular model is fairly hard to find.

I will also include a Crossbreed Supertuck that I got when I got the gun, though admittedly it is in somewhat rough shape from use but is certainly still usable - it was modified by the original owner who cut the higher portion off to make it easier to get a positive grip on draw. I also ran across a black OWB with a black trim panel that I can include; this holster was not made for this firearm, but it fits just fine (I THINK it was made for a Sig P250).

I also have 132 rounds of Federal FMJ, 40 rounds of Hornaday TAP, and 40 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense that I will include for an additional $50. This ammo is not for sale seperately.

I am not interested in trades at this time. I am located in Steubenville but don't mind a decent drive. I do ask that you be willing to meet half way.

One is left handed, the other right. These rifles are identical in all respects except for one being left handed, so all details listed below are the same for each.

-Built on Savage Long Action with Accu-Trigger
-Wood laminate thumb hole stock
-Chambered in 6.5 Creedmoor
-26"" Stainless Match barrel by Criterion, varmint contour
-Precision ground recoil lug
-Action is pillar and glass bedded
-Free floated barrel
-Barrels are broken in, with long range hunting load development complete
-Scope is Leupold VX-3 4.5-14x40 CDS (Coupon for free custom turret included)
-Burris Signature Zee rings

Both rifles have fired groups at 1/4MOA at 100 yards and have held less than 1/2MOA out to 500 yards. Leupold CDS scopes have exposed elevation turret for easy range adjustment. Scopes come with coupon for free custom turret built by Leupold for load and chosen environment. Loads developed using 140gr Berger VLD hunting bullet, scopes are zeroed and data will be included for range adjustment. 20 hand loaded cartridges included with each rifle. One set of reloading dies, brass, and left over bullets can be added with either rifle.

We have found these to be very light recoiling, pleasant shooters with fantastic long range accuracy in the right hands. Though these would make excellent target rifles, they were built with long range hunting in mind, and one rifle was used to take large buck two weeks ago at 480 yards with a cross wind. Single shot to vitals, took 10 slow steps then fell over dead.

Asking $1650 each, $3000 gets the pair. Willing to discuss selling without optic if you already have one.

I will add up to 4 window pmags for $15 each.

The stock is shown fully extended and with the cheekweld raised in the first photo to give you an idea of the adjustment. It is a collapsible stock, so you can shorten it for CQ, or extend the length for target or prone applications. The stock is also very nice for switching from optics to irons as you can slide the cheekweld piece forward to lower it immediately. I added some photos below that show some other setups. I have 2 20"" Hbar config ARs, so that is the only reason this is for sale.

The scope shown is also available. It is a Springfield Gen III 4-14x40 calibrated for the .223/5.56 round. It is mounted on a B-Square mount with QD Rings. $300 for that setup. I am located in the Akron/Canton area, but willing to drive for the right deal."

In 2001, DPMS expanded from its share of the .223/5.56mm market, and exploded onto the .308 rifle scene. The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.
With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist, free floating handguard and a high ride receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since. With numerous upgrades available, the LR-308 is the ultimate long range target and competition rifle.
This RFLR-308 comes with several factory installed upgrades including.
Replacing the normal smooth or ""Slick Side"" receiver with an A3 upper receiver
Upgrading the Bull barrel with a Bead Blast finish, full fluting and barrel threading.

ust for fun. Shooting a 1911 chambered in .22 LR is great practice and an ideal way to train new shooters. It is also affordable. A Kimber conversion kit for an existing 1911 pays for itself in the first few hundred rounds.
Kimber rimfire pistols have the same features and unequaled performance as Kimber centerfires. Adjustable sight, bumped beavertail grip safety and extended thumb safety are standard. Aluminum slides and frames make rimfire pistols exceptionally light—ideal for young shooters. Conversion kits work with all Kimber .45 ACP pistols that have either 4- or 5-inch barrels and single stack magazines. They also fit most brands of 1911 pistols, provided they are mil-spec, single stack, and do not have a ramped barrel. (For fit information, call Kimber at 800- 880-2418.) Conversion kits can be purchased directly from Kimber as they are not classified as a firearm.

I bought this a number of years ago and have never used it. It has not even had a round loaded in it. It has just sat in the safe. It comes with the pouch and lubricant and loader. Google this brand and you will see they sell anywhere from $219 to $299, sometimes plus shipping. There is a cheaper brand available, but this is the higher quality one. I am firm on this price. I will ship if needed for $15 more. Thanks.."
