Product Information
Shop more Surplus products For the ultimate in capacity for an AK-47, this 75-rnd drum can't be surpassed. Made on original tooling, these magazines are identical to ones issued with Chinese RPK light machine guns all over the globe. The crank design permits the magazine to be stored loaded with no spring tension (meaning no fatigue) and then cranked when ready to be used. The 2-piece clam shell body allows for ease of loading and maintenance.


Note: These are new production, never issued drum magazines for the AK-47."

Unlike the WASR-10 models , this has the dimpled magazine well designed to hold hi-cap magazines tightly.  The SAR-1s were assembled in the US from Romanian and US parts to be rule 922R compliant, they do not have a bayonet lug and the barrel isn't threaded (have a gunsmith thread it if you really want, it isn't difficult.)  Designed for hi-cap magazines (not dremeled out like the WASR-10s) these models aren't very picky about ammo and will feed pretty much any 7.62x39 from double stack magazines.  This gun has been a safe queen and my gunsmith put a brand new gas cylinder in it before Thanksgiving, because when he was going over it he thought it could cycle more smoothly.  I am pretty selective with my guns, even the non-high end ones and I always keep them clean and use Clenzoil.  I have shot 200 rounds or less through this gun since I purchased it approx. 15 years ago.  The sights are fine and the gun really isn't broken in yet.  If you want a reasonably priced AK-47 to shoot good groups (by AK standards) and you want one that will feed pretty much any ammo, this is the one to get.  The magazines aren't plastic, but all metal (better when you use the magazine as a fore grip during rapid fire shooting IMO) and two I have never used and are still coated with Cosmoline.  If you want ammo with the gun, I'll sell you surplus Wolf 7.62 x 39 123gr at $7 per 20rd box for up to 700 rounds or whatever amount I have left in 7.62x39.   800 obo"

Used Smith and Wesson 40S&W Shield. Bought the gun new at gander mountain and same day the takedown lever was unusually stiff/not moveable. Sent it in to S&W and had it worked. The best part about it was that I had the trigger lightened to 5.5-6lbs which is PERFECT compared to the heavy pull it had. Once I received it I put only 50 rounds through it. Too small for my larger hands. 

Price is $500 FIRM! So buyer will be paying $500 or no sale. The shields are extremely hard to get seeing they are considered the hottest carry firearm right now.

The TRP standard line is designed around the same specifications as the FBI
contract pistol, the TRP-PRO model. The Springfield TRP offers nearly the
same performance and features as the TRP-PRO model at a fraction of the
cost. From its fully checkered front strap and mainspring housing, to its
durable Armory Kote Teflon or stainless steel finish, this gun can only be
described as a knock out value.

New 40 round Stainless Steel, black teflon coated magazine for AR-15 and compatible Rifles. This is a 5.56x45 / .223 caliber magazine with an orange anti-tilt follower. SS (stainless steel, black teflon finish. 

The Stainless Steel magazine was developed at C Products LLC to solve the problem of unreliable magazines for military and law enforcement. The use of hardenable 400 series Stainless Steel allows for greater body strength without the added weight of conventional steel magazines.

The use of .020 thick material allows for greater room within the interior of the magazine body which enhances the proper stacking of the rounds. The use of a C Products anti-tilt follower as a standard greatly increases the reliability of the magazines functionality. In testing, the failure to feed problems experienced in other magazines was reduced to below 1%. C Products is the only magazine manufacturer to have developed the technology using fully automated robotic welding stations.

This allows us to control and monitor automatically each magazine weld, insuring that each weld is dimensionally correct. A computer printout is available from every shift to verify the quality. Any weld not meeting the load specifications is immediately rejected.

Magazine Body Material - 400 series Stainless Steel Heat Treat Finish, Salt-bath nitrating /oxidizing process that introduces corrosion resistance to the base material resulting in the formation at the surface of a nitride compound zone, enriched with oxygen/oxides which increases the corrosion protection, boosts wear resistance, increases fatigue strength and produces low coefficient of friction [lubricity]. Hardened to RC 32 in the above process.

Magazine Body Coating - E COAT Black Teflon Base Plate Material - 400 series Stainless Steel [annealed], Cleaned, pickled, and passivated [ref. QQ-P-35] Black Passivate Coating. Follower - Anti-Tilt, Plastic PA110G33A53380 per ASTM D4066, orange. Spring - Wire, Chrome Silicone, Heat treated, Tempered 600ºF / 1 hour, Protective finish 5.4.1 of MIL-STD-171

Polytech used high quality forged receivers like the US Government originals, not the softer cast type used by many companies. A Fulton Armory Hardened bolt was added very recently for added strength and durability. It has a removable receiver mounted  Return-to-Zero Gen 3 optics rail. It has fully adjustable combat sights(some of the best ever put on a combat rifle), a chrome lined barrel that protects it from wear and corrosion, and is very difficult to find on newer M1A's. It also has a removable full cage flash hider and 6 (all in great shape) steel box type 20 round magazines that you can probably kiss goodbye soon.  

The M14/M1A uses the 7.62X51 (308 winchester) which is devastating up close or long range. 800 meters is a reasonable shot for and M1A. The Polytech receiver will work great with a short scout barrel (even better then the Springfield model). Or keep the original barrel, it has tight groups at 200 to 300 meters (with iron sights) and passes on the head space. This rifle will take USGI parts and upgrades, and the M1A is more then likely not getting banned so the parts will be there. Its a hell of a lot more durable then an AR (of any brand) and almost as accurite. And puts AK's to shame, more power, hell of a lot more range, better parts, better duriblity. And if it does jam with dirt and mud just jam the charging handle against the nearest thing because your not going to break it, dent it, or bend it. 

The rifle was put back in to its original import stocks which are kind of rough. This is the 3rd M1A/M14 I've sold or traded so I'm getting I'm getting low on pretty stocks. There are all kinds of stocks out there right now if you act fast. Other then the stocks this is the best Polytech I'm selling or trading off."

RRA stand alone rear sight also included.
High quality bi-pod.
(2) factory 30rd steel mags, along with (2) other 30rd mags brand new in packaging (one is polymer, one is steel).
540 rounds of .223/5.56 ammo of a few different brands (was testing performance on different types of ammo).
Only about 1000 rounds put through this rifle and has had ZERO malfuctions of any kind.


I'm not entirely sure I'll end up selling this rifle, just wanted to see whats out there since it's currently a sellers market. Pretty open to all firearm related offers. But please no low quality craftsmanship offers, and low ball offers will be ignored.
I have over $1,600 into this rifle as is plus 540 rounds of ammo. If i wanted to be an A-hole i could estimate it (in the current sales market) to be valued close to $2,500.
Please don't make me be the A-hole.

Again, pretty low round count (around 1500) and have never have a problem with any type of ammo i've fired through it.


Again not really sure if I want to sell this rifle, but am interested to see what's out there.
And again, no low ball offers or low quality trade offers.

The reticle placement of the 6-18x65LU has been placed in the first imaging plane, which allows it to zoom in size along with the magnification-and quite importantly, does not allow the changes in magnification to affect the impact point.

This gun is super fun to shoot. Perfect for and addition to your plinker collection with its tactical rest and picatinny quad rail. I originally purchased it before everything in the Assault Rifle world went crazy. And only got it about a week and a half ago. But I have since upgraded to a much bigger caliber rifle. It looks like they are close to banning Assault rifles. So get it fast while you still can legally so that you are grandfathered in. 

Brand new it is about 345 but that was before everything went nuts and you can hardly find any assault rifles in stock anymore. After fees and taxes everything came up to well over 415 dollars. this is what you would expect to pay for this now if you were to go through the process of hunting one down and going through the painstaking motions. I am willing to part with it for 375.

Must be able to provide FFL for me to ship to.

Has a battery saver on off switch hidden in grip bottom with laser on off switch for instant use on grip. All very ergonomic. Like new. Fired about 1 box of .38 +P rounds and 158 grain .357 rounds and 125 grain .357 rounds and plain .38 Special rounds I reloaded.
Very versatile revolver that can be used as CCW weapon or plain home protection with subsonic light bullets. When carrying use .357 rounds for maximum effect. I like the fact that you can use cheap and plentiful .38 Special rounds or use the very effective .357 Magnum rounds for daily carry. Price is firm, no trades. FL DL and CCW a must, selling from collection, getting rid of the bulk of my weapons due to lack of outdoor ranges with meddlesome range attendants that act as if their rights are God given. There is a nice way to make sure safety is observed and a wrong way to correct unsafe behavior and lately it seems that the wrong way prevails. I've been shooting since I was 11 years old, through one war, and one robbery that excalated to a shoot out. The fact that I am here writing this answers the question on who prevailed. Most of what I am selling is what I paid for, I'm not a carpetbagger. Thanks"

It clamps directly to the Ruger factory ring mounts so you can add halographic sights and magnifiers. This one has the regular front sight without the muzzel brake so future compliance should not be an issue you can add the cool stuff later. It is unfired so there is no guessing how many rounds have really been down the barrel it or what kind of ammo was forced through it. Buy it now and get grandfathered in before an executive order comes along. I accept postal money orders or wire transfer and outside of Iowa this must go through your local FFL in legal areas.

Serial # 582-22XXX Included are the scope rings, paperwork, 5 round magazine, (not pictured) and an aluminum AIM 7"" picatinny scope mount. It clamps directly to the Ruger factory ring mounts so you can add halographic sights and magnifiers. This one has the regular front sight without the muzzel brake so future compliance should not be an issue you can add the cool stuff later. It is unfired so there is no guessing how many rounds have really been down the barrel it or what kind of ammo was forced through it. Buy it now and get grandfathered in before an executive order comes along. I accept postal money orders or wire transfer and outside if Iowa must go through your local FFL in legal areas.

The prices are sick sick sick, hope all who are selling like gouging dealers end up dis armed due to greed in the future. money will not put food on the table, protect you or your family or property.. Once men figured out how to turn paper into gold life was never the same, albeit OUR current fiat funds are worthless at the drop of a dime and subject to hidden inflationary costs, shit will drop like gas then it will skyrocket in a few months by summer.

Quit gouging each other, hold your arms and ammo, WE will need it!"

Restrictions apply for higher capacity magazines in the City of Denver.  Price is for one magazine. I have 6 currently. Willing to trade two of these for one 10 shot magazine.  

These are 11 shot Pre-Ban, factory S&W Magazines for the Smith & Wesson 4000 type metal frame pistols in .40 S&W caliber, including the standard 4003 4004 4006 4026 4043 4044 and 4046. Parent 4003 Pistols these came from were issued to Atlanta Police Department between 1989 and 1992. I bought them from a FFL dealer as described.  

Construction is stainless steel body, with high impact polymer followers and black floorplates. They will not fit the small single-stacked 4013 type pistols. Each of these has slash marks on the lower front of the magazine body that date them as solidly pre-ban. Variants are 1, 2, 3, or 4 vertical slashes or a + sign.  These magazines are in Very Good condition, probably even Excellent condition, and relabeled with Smith & Wesson bar codes. I have cycled them through my 4006 with no issues.  Most of these magazines have moderate carbon deposits on their polymer cartridge followers and moderate amounts of insertion and ejection scuffing on their stainless steel bodies.  Not for sale to City of Denver Residents.  Must be 21 or over and have a CO CCW or be active or former military. My rules, not the Feds.
