The rifle is the stainless model, as is the Prostaff scope (which matches the rifle beautifully). Only roughly 40 rounds have been fired through it, all at a controlled range (no hunting). Padded case, roughly 30 rounds of ammo, and a Bore snake is included as part of the package. Much more interested in a simple trader than a sale, but no offers will go unconsidered.

Instead of trying to work a bid on gun broker up to the 1300 this could bring in, i am simply letting it go before i get attached and keep it. I'm not a huge antique collector but a functioning .380 from 1921 would be a decent addition to the case. I did you the favor of stripping this gun and cleaning/lubing all the pieces and parts, but if you took a real good brush to it it would glisten beautifully.

This is the model that was issued to the FBI in the mid 90's. It has all the FBI model specifications. This gun is a beast--very powerful! It is a ""man's"" gun and I would not recommend it for a woman's hand. Great stopping power for home defense or hunting sidearm. Capable of taking down a black bear! Relatively new condition considering only 150 rounds were shot thru it. It was kept in the house as a home defense weapon (which is why it was hardly shot) and passed down to me by my father. He put 100 rounds thru it and I have put only 50 thru. No malfunctions at all between the two of us. This gun has been very well cared for...cleaned and lubricated after every use. Very solid weapon and best 10mm I have ever shot. Trigger reset is very minimal and gun is very accurate. I am only selling it because I want an XDM .45 Compact and my wife said i have to sell one of my guns First or i can't get it (lol) so I priced it to sell fast. This is a steal for one of the best 10mm ever made. This model is no longer produced and probably harder to come by than most. FBI issued models have been sold for $2000+ on auction sites (no lie look it up!). This may or may not be an FBI issued weapon but has all the same specifications as the FBI issue from what I have read. I haven't checked with S&W (didn't care enough to) but you could call them with the serial number if you wanted to find out. FBI issued 1076 are worth the premium price but regardless of what mine is I am selling it for $650!!

Now a little about the adapter.This adapter does not require a T&E mechanism but works off of adjustable spring tension.This allows the user to adjust to his or hers shooting style.You can take your hands off the gun and it will return back to level or you can adjust it so it returns upward or downwards.The more spring pressure added to this adapter will make the gun feel lighter and give you faster mobility.
Heres some of the other features that built in to this Adapter: 
• Fully enclosed Link chute (Keep links from falling onto the ground)
• Custom locking pins for your ammo cans (keeps them secure and tight) 
• Spring tension design (Eliminates the T&E mechanism) 
• Built in Brass chute (Comes w/hose- bucket & lid) 
• Comes with all hardware and is a bolt-on system.

Comes with all of the goodies (case, 17 rd mag, 10 rd mag, loader and original purchase receipt).  Estimate 50-100 rounds through it (not broken in yet).

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights.

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

Please email me and I will send you pictures SOG Knives Collectors' Review/Take:
The SOG Tomcat is one of the largest folding knives from SOG. It features a thick blade of 0.2"" and is backed up by a solid lock. This makes it a heavy-duty folding knife, and though it weighs more than the average folding knife it will stand up to hard use. It was also one of the first folding knives to incorporate a bowie knife design into a folding knife, along the lines of the S1 Bowie. The SOG Tomcat also won 'Overall Knife of the Year' award in 1988, one of the first awards won by the company, for its great and unique design. Many owners particularly like this version of the Tomcat for its clean look and heavy duty lock, like many of SOG's early folders.

The Tomcat was and still is a popular design and has not dropped off the SOG production list. It is one of the most collectible SOG folding knives and the earliest version of the SOG Tomcat is hard to find, with the right engravings. Other later versions include the Tomcat (Cocobolo) - limited run with Cocobolo wood handles, Tomcat II and the Tomcat 3.0."

We are selling one our spotting scopes as we currently have 3. This Scope is a Cableas HD 20-60X 80mm scope. It was purchased new just over a year ago for retail $900. It does have one scratch on the Objective lens, however it doesn't affect the image what so ever. This scope is very bright, and has very very good image quality due to HD/ED low dispersion glass lenses. It is multi coated and has very very little chrom abberation. I am an absolute Mule Deer Fanatic and have personally used this scope to observe bucks and accurately judge them as far as 2 miles when situations permitted easily.

FFP Brief Introduction: Most scopes have the reticle fitted in the second focal plane (near the eyepiece). While, presently it has always been the practice to fit the reticle in the first focal plane (the reticle increases its size when change the magnification from low to high). Each system has its advantages.

More information on how to use mil-dot scopes:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pebrDf9HURQ&feature=player_embedded

The advantage with telemetric reticles (like rangefinder & Mil-dot etc) is that the target image and distance between dots remains constant even when changing magnification. It is the system that is widely used by the TOP military suppliers now.

""Any reworking or refinishing has a negative effect on the value of a gun to the collector, and the

It has the Armalite SS Match Barrel with a 1-11.25"" twist. The barrel was originally 24"" in length. I found the length a bit unnecessary and had Jim Burke in Southern Arizona chop it to 20"" and thread it. It now sports a Vortex Flash suppressor. The original Armalite free-float tube has been replaced with an aluminum, smooth bottom unit that was created for the Army Marksmanship Unit by Superior Weapon Systems. The SWS tube has picatinny rails along the top and all four sides at the end of the tube. It's great for mounting bipods and slings forward. The lower has a Tango Down Battlegrip and still contains the 2-stage match trigger from Armalite. The long A2 stock has been replaced with a standard AR15 mil-spec carbine tube and a VLTOR EMOD stock. The EMOD stock has a nice cheek weld and ""J"" shape that aids in shooting off a bipod. In order to allow the use of standard AR15 carbine stocks, the buffer and spring has been replaced with a ""XH"" unit from Slash's Heavy Buffers which also aids in taming recoil. Everything in this rifle has been thought out to provide long range accuracy and the lightest weight / shortest length possible. 1 20 round magazine included. Bipod not included. I also have an Eberlestock Gunslinger in Flat Dark Earth is available for an additional $180.

This rifle has proven capable of .75-1MOA out to 600 yds with 168 gn HPBT SMKs. 600 is the longest range I've been able to fire it at. I am sure that it's capable of more. I no longer have that much range to shoot at, so I am content with my 16"" AR10. This rifle has approximately 400 rounds through it."

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armor explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORY has added another level of comfort. The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (3) magazines and a holster.

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armor explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORY has added another level of comfort. The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (4) magazines and a holster.

It is in good condition, cleaned lovingly, and only taken to the range twice for me. Purchased at a local gun show for 150, but found that I like a rifle with a little higher caliber though this is great for going to the range, target practice, or just a rifle that you can get a box of 50 rounds for 10$.

Can fire 22 Short, 22 Long, and 22 Long Rifle and can be set to either go single shot/bolt action or semi-automatic depending on how it is set. Roughly holds 10 Rounds in the barrel with ease to load. I've only used Long Rifle in it and fired wonderfully in single shot. The spring needs a little TLC for semi-automatic but looking online that's inexpensive and easy to look at. Just every once in awhile I had to pull the bolt back all the way myself despite having it in Semi-Auto.

Also have a nice leather soft case to carry it in.

$900 cash for ALL.  If you know BMG parts, then you know this is reasonable as a full kit runs $6K and it's even harder to locate individual parts because no one wants to break up full kits (they're getting scarce)

Sig Sauer P239 357 sig double action/single action with stainless stamped slide plus siglite night sights and hogue grips.  Comes with 2 mags, Sig case, lock, manual etc.  $650 no trades or offers please

As you can see these are all quality handguns, I will not waste anyone's time if they do not waste mine.  I am not in need of cash but wouldn't mind selling these guns to fund other projects so if you have an offer it will have to be fair for me to even respond.  

I have a very good idea of what each of these guns are worth so please do not tell me what you think they are worth because that means nothing to me.  Thanks for looking."
