Description

NEBO PROTEC ELITE HP190LS combines a brilliant white light with an adjustable bright red aiming laser. It uses a highly efficient CREE® Q5 LED to generate 190 lumens of intense white light with a 5-milliwatt, 650 nanometer laser sight, located below the light. Light of this magnitude is enough to dominate an aggressor’s night adapted vision, ideal for military, law enforcement, and self-defense. The reflector lens focuses the beam for long distance lighting while also producing enough light to support the user’s peripheral vision. The HP190LS’ batteries will produce 3 hours of continuous illumination. The compact body of the HP190LS is constructed of aircraft grade anodized aluminum making it a lightweight, yet powerful light source. The HP190LS is also O-ring and gasket sealed to be completely weatherproof. The HP190LS features an ambidextrous momentary/steady On-Off switch to provide one-finger operation. This switch allows you to select 100% white light or defensive strobe.  A separate switch on the bottom is used to control the laser. Laser travels over 450 yards.

This is a well built and very accurate rifle. 2 MOA with irons. Nice clean trigger too, no slap.

5.45 is a potent caliber, if you are unfamiliar. It's like a little buzzsaw, and yaws like hell when it hits a soft target. Definately a good defensive caliber.

This is a good price, and I've got well over a grand in all this, so price is firm. Package deal only, I will not break it up. I do not have to sell this, lowballs will be ignored.
Only trades I am interested in are for Springfield M1A pattern rifles. Prefer a Socom16. 
I might be interested in something else of equal value or with cash, long as its military pattern. Let me know.

Selling you 10 year old boots, left over brick, old furniture.....

Dealers selling overpriced items that can be had locally for much less, dealers spamming up the site and using it for their advertising?

Selling glocks for $600-$800, and other USED guns for OVER MSRP. 
The value does not increase because you owned it for a week. 
Some of these guns advertised even look stolen. And not to mention the ""out-of-state"" spammers looking to steal through mail.

You want to trade me your gun (at full MSRP) and value mine at $100 UNDER bluebook and have the balls to ask for a significant boot?

Smith & Wesson Model 916T Field Grade 12 ga Pump Shotgun LNIB


The only S&W shotgun that was ever MADE IN USA. Not all 916T's were created equal. This one is a rare version of the 916T that has:

- Wildlife Scene (Duck in flight with Catails) Engraved in the Receiver
- Checkering in the Forearm and Grip
- White Line Spacers at the Recoil Pad and Pistol Grip Cap 
- Two-Bead Wavy Top Ventilated Rib.
- Correct O stamp Barrel (NO Recall) with Chrome Bore

This is the barrel that shipped with the gun, not a S&W recall replacement barrel, so the gun must have been a very late one with the revisions already in place. The barrel is 28"" and Steel Shot Safe.


In all the years I have owned the gun I have never seen another one like it (I saw 'one' that was similar but did not have the correct barrel). Every other 916T I have seen was the plain jane version with no engraving, no checkering, no spacer's, if they had a VR at all it was a standard one, and all, but a handful, did not have the correct O stamped barrel which can be dangerous.


Barrel Markings on Left Side:

SMITH & WESSON - MODEL 916T
SPRINGFIELD, MA., - MADE IN U.S.A.

Right Side:

PROOF TESTED 12 GA.
- 3 INCH CHAMBER -
MODIFIED CHOKE


I bought the gun brand new many years ago. Fired 50~100 rounds. I have the original box, but cannot find the paperwork.


Please no message's quoting book value as this gun is simply not in the book with the feature's that it has. The book lists only the plain jane 916T with a potentially dangerous barrel. Even so, I am pricing this Deluxe 916T right in line with the book value of the plain jane 916T. Condition is an easy 98% or Excellent, depending on the book.


$250 firm or Trade up/down/even for Wood Field/Sporting/Hunting Long Guns, a .22 Auto Target Pistol, or a Large Caliber Revolver with 5"" plus barrel for deer hunting. Can add cash.

May also trade for 28 squares of shingles, a truck stake bed (bed/rails only), motorcycle, lawn tractor, Gibson, Epihone or EPS electric guitar, vintage minibike, ?

I would like to sell or trade this. My asking price is 1100 dollars, obo. Please don't email me unless you are interested in buying or trading for this. I will trade for multiple firearms of equivelant value, firearms and cash, or a single firearm of equivelant value. Offer whatever you like, but please remember that I am looking for a total value equal to my asking price. Any messages I receive that do not meet this criteria will not be answered. The only thing I know for sure that I don't want are emails telling me why I am asking too much, that you saw one of these for ""x number of dollars"" at such and such place, etc.... Just FYI, non-collector Marlin 1894's in 45lc go for 750 and up, and it is nearly impossible to find one with anything less than a 20 inch barrel. This particular rifle is stamped in two places to reflect the unique genuineness of this particular run. As stated earlier, there were only 250 of these made, if you belong to the Ohio Gun Collectors Association, this is a wonderful piece to add to your collection. Thank you for looking."

Here is the design. Was fired once for testing. Otherwise kept by the bed for safety. I just got my CCW and am looking for an easy carry gun. 

Benelli’s SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun sight. At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova Tactical isn’t just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums.
The SuperNova Tactical comes with newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights. The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation. Optional three-dot tritium inserts can be easily installed. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. Butt stock options include a tactical pistol grip stock, or the ComforTech stock. The top of the SuperNova’s receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics."

Here is the design. Was fired once for testing. Otherwise kept by the bed for safety. I just got my CCW and am looking for an easy carry gun. 

Benelli’s SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun sight. At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova Tactical isn’t just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums.
The SuperNova Tactical comes with newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights. The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation. Optional three-dot tritium inserts can be easily installed. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. Butt stock options include a tactical pistol grip stock, or the ComforTech stock. The top of the SuperNova’s receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics."

257,http://www.armslist.com/posts/102257,For Sale:  WTS/T Tikka T3 Lite .270wsm / Bushnell Elite 3-9x50 with RainGuard,"Orange County, North Carolina, United States",$ 625,"Listed On: Thursday, March 17, 2011",Rifles,Tikka                                                                                ,270 WSM                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I just cut the asking price!


This rifle is as close to new as they come. It was bought for my wife. I bore-sighted the scope & took a couple of shots to get on the paper — then she announced she wasn't hunting. I immediately stopped playing with it. (OK, I was more than a little ""aggravated"" as she could have said that before I bought the outfit. Previously she had said she didn't want to cary a heavy rifle, so I got the Tikka T3 Lite.) I can't say it's new & unfired, but I can say we've never hunted with it & it looks to be in perfect condition.

I've never seen a Tikka that didn't print a clover-leaf group or better & I have no reason to believe this would be any different. I had someone hand me a Tikka T3 that he said wouldn't group when we were shooting 2 weeks ago. I took 3 of his shells & put 3 shots into 100 yd target, producing a group that was less than 1/4"" between centers. I then told him he needed to practice more because that's how the Tikka T3s shoot.

The .270 WSM is a great cartridge. It shoots flatter than a .25-06 or .270 Win. yet doesn't require a muzzle brake to shoot comfortably.

The Bushnell Elite scope is the same as we have on our .243 & I can speak to how well it works. The RainGuard works wonderfully & eliminates almost all fogging so you don't miss a shot because you exhaled as you picked up your rifle. The 3-9x50 will let you shoot way past legal light. It picks up light VERY well!

I've got about $700 in the outfit it but would listen to reasonable offers (cash or trade). I may sell at a loss but I will not give it away. This will be sold as it's become a personal sore spot (the joys of marriage), & it's taking up space in the safe. If it doesn't sell as a unit I will split it up. Let me know if you are interested and make your offer. This will be posted on several boards so it may sell quickly.

We can ship to your FFL but prefer face-to-face.


Things I'm looking for: quality 20-60x80mm spotting scope, 15x56 binoculars, quality rifle scopes (Swarovski, Nightforce, Zeiss, etc.); & accurate stainless rifles in: .243 Win, .338 magnum, .340 magnum, a 410 shotgun, and anything else ""interesting"" that's not junk. 

Yes, we are focussed on HUNTING arms and, no, we are not looking for pistols or more archery gear. Although we prefer stainless with composite stocks, we will consider blued steel with wood stocks if it's something we would want to cary hunting.

If we ship we'll split the costs.

It's still available in Orange County. Let's deal!"

I purchased this a little while ago but decided it needs to go to fund another project.
It's a Browning A5 light twelve with a 30 inch full choke barrel chambered in 2 3/4"". It was manufactured in Japan in 1980.

The gun was a shooter for a number of years before retiring to a safe so there are some dings on the stock and forearm and some areas with the blueing worn.

The screws are pristine and overall the condition of the gun is pretty darn good.

Awesome condition. Very few rounds through this 1911. Frame is flawless, so is the barrel, guts of the gun and the slide. Bolt face shows light use as well. This baby is tough and accurate, same hole accuracy at 10+ yards even for marginal shooters. Trigger is very light and this gun eats absolutely every ammo fed: Handloads, Tula Ammo (steel cased cheapo), Winchester white box, Remington Green box, UMC AND handles Cor-Bon Pow'Rball self defense ammo very well. 

Comes with original Kimber plastic hard case, Kimber slide lock, and 2 Kimber Stainless factory mags. Magazines are same condition as the gun, 95% minimum. Check out pics for details. Happy to drive for public face to face meet up. $750 CASH ONLY. Will consider trades but it needs to be a doozy.

This quad rail has a very minor ding on one of the lugs that is barely noticeable, see in pictures below.  Last picture is a sample of what this style of rail looks like on a gun and is just an example.

This is the Specter Length version, 9.675 inches. It will cover the gas block on a carbine length barrel and makes a very nice looking gun in my opinion. These are sold out all over the internet including direct from YHM.

Manufacturer's Description:
These unique forearms feature diamond shaped heat vents, an extended top rail for gap-free installation, “T” marked rails to mark accessory locations, and our anti-rotation screws for secure installation. The forearms and barrel nuts are made of 6061-T6 aluminum and hardcoated to military specifications. The jam nut and anti-rotation screws are steel and plated a matte black finish to match. Assemblies include: one jam nut, one barrel nut, two anti-rotation screws, and one forearm tube."

- 1 unopened crate of 5.45x39 caliber ammuntion (2,160rds 53gr FMJ)

Everything you need to survive the end of the world or zombie apocalypse. Or both. Package price 950 obo.

This is a well built and very accurate rifle. 2 MOA with irons. Nice clean trigger too, no slap. Very fun to shoot, with almost no recoil whatsoever.
5.45 is a potent caliber, if you are unfamiliar with it. Known as the ""poison bullet"", it's like a little buzzsaw, and yaws like hell when it hits a soft target. Definately a good defensive caliber. 

This is a good price, and I've got well over a grand in all this, so price is firm. I do not have to sell this, so lowballs will be ignored.

I'd trade for a used Springfield M1A pattern rifle(plus cash on my end), or for a good quality RPK with cash.
I might be interested in something else of equal value or with cash, long as its military pattern. Let me know.

Thanks."
