 I have a 95 Pathfinder that is sutable for what the title says. The reason its a parts truck or a great farm truck is beacuse it was rear-ended when I was moving to charleston. Slight rear bumper and hatch damage otherwise The truck has great 4WD and runs smoothly, however the frame has a crack and the insurance company totalled it. Its been a trooper and honestly i wouldnt be afraid to hop in it and take it anywhere. 
 I have been waiting for them to send the info to oklahoma in order to get a salvage title but its been over 6 months and i need to get rid of the truck, I live in an apt complex.  Im looking for $1000 obo. its got alot of good parts. The RADIO AND SPEAKERS wont go. The wife says NO So I will have to take these out. I have an old Kenwoord CD player if needed to listend to the radio/cd (wont be installed). The truck was driven daily until the tags ran out. I have the title and its in my name however id rather not deal with the dmv anymore and thats why im selling it as an ""as is"" parts truck. Any questions feel free to ask.

When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a combat shotgun, they bought a Benelli. That’s because a combat shotgun has to function the first time, every time. The Benelli M4 does it for the U.S. military, and now can be the centerpiece of your own home defense plan. Benelli engineers developed and patented a unique auto-regulating gas-operated (ARGO) system. Dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber operate directly against the bolt assembly. It’s a simple and dependable system that eliminates the complex linkage, springs and heavy parts that other semi-automatic shotguns have to depend on. The result: Marine-tough reliability under the harshest environmental conditions. The M4 comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a ghost-ring fully adjustable rear sight and fixed blade front sight; a variety of modular stocks are available as accessories. The M4 is combat proven and U.S. Marine Corps approved — why would you depend on anything less? Specifications: Item #:11707 Barrel Length: 18.5 in. Stock: Pistol Grip Synthetic Capacity: 4+1 Chokes: MOD screw in Type of Sights: Ghost Ring Length: 40 in. Length of Pull: 14 3/8 in. Drop at Heel: 2 1/4 in. Box was lost in move, as were chokes.

All distances are cleary marked. Scope is precision and comes with different turret caps that accomodate different bullet grains (weight). 36, 38 or 40 grain bullets (a turret cap for each)...you exchange the cap for each weight bullet that you choose to use and it will calculate the bullets projected drop for set distance...for that grain weight. Scope and turrets are calculated for the .22 caiber long rifle bullet and is the most precise scope I have ever seen.

I would just like to say, THIS IS NOT CRAIGSLIST!!!  Did you bother to read the ad before you clicked on the link?  I AM A DEALER!  Why the **** would I sell you a brand new gun for $50 less than what I paid?  If you cant afford it, why are you shopping?  If you think you can get it at a better price from someone that has it IN STOCK, GO ****ING BUY IT! You want a gun at cost? YOU SPEND THE MONEY AND WAIT 6 MONTHS FOR AN FFL!   Does my price include IL state tax?  Let me ask you... Does my ****ing ad state that it does?  NO!  Why?  BECAUSE PEOPLE FROM OUT OF STATE BY GUNS TOO!  Does my price include shipping?  Again, does my ****ing ad state that it does?  Why would I include shipping for Illinois buyers?  You're smart!  Its FUCKING idiots like you that fuck up the right to own a gun for the rest of us!

No, I will not take trades, however, I will offer you a fair price for your used guns, NO, I will not pay you retail price for you used gun nor will I pay you full value of it being used.  I have to list it which takes time out of my day especially dealing with the morons that email/call me and for that, I expect to make a dollar on it for my time.  If you have an issue with that, this is what we can do.  I need my bathroom remodeled.  Since I am not allowed to profit on my sales, I will buy all the materials for my bathroom, you come install it for me and I will sell you the gun at my cost.  Deal?

It is full parkerized finish with a  16” chrome lined barrel, 1:9 twist in .223/5.56.
Came factory with a six position telescoping stock and flip up troy battle sites.
It has Warne high rise quick detach, back to zero scope mounts and a BSA Sweet 223 scope with original box & paperwork (scope has built in bullet compensation adjustments and multiple turrets for different grained bullets – I believe it is a 3-12 x 40) and Butler Creek flip up scope caps. Pictured also with a front post grip. The grip has a compartment in the handle accessible under the cap on the bottom of it to store extra batteries or whatever. The light is an O-Light M20 Warrior tactical light. I believe it is 275 lumens with the strobe feature and a button specifically for the strobe. The light has a pressure switch (on the right side of the post grip), rail mount and extra reflector and original case and paperwork/manual. 

In addition, I have four extra 20 round magazines, two additional 30 round magazines (all A.R. Stoner mag.s), two magazine couplers and 600+ rounds of factory new ammo; most is 55 grain FMJ copper, (540 rounds new in box, 40 rounds of factory new in box steel, 20 tracers and somewhere around 100 loose rounds between the loaded mag.s and blue box pictured). I also have a soft case I could throw in (not pictured) for bargaining if required.

Please be advised... this is also for sale in other areas and what is pictured may be sold off individually.

$2,850 for everything.

Serious inquiries only please.

X400
The SureFire X400 combines a brilliant white light with a bright red laser aiming device in one WeaponLight. A high-efficiency LED generates 170 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with good reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light--enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision--for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The 5-milliwatt, 635 nanometer laser sight, located below the primary light, is nearly twice as bright and much more visible than the nearest competitor. The laser's adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The white light/laser combination makes the X400 effective in close- to medium-range engagements, ideal for law enforcement, military, and self-defense use. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X400 comes with two adapter wedges permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation, and a mode switch allows you to select white light only, white light + laser, laser only, or system disable. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger. Other switches are available for operating the X400 when attached to a long gun"

The gun is accurate, drop dead reliable and a joy to shoot.

This gun is hard to find in Massachusetts - get it while you can.

The gun features a 5"" Melonite® barrel, fully supported ramp, satin finish slide and black polymer frame. Comes with 2 10 round MA compliant magazines. Or if you are legally able to have them, I can arrange for two 13 round high caps to be sent to you instead. I don't have the box or paperwork. I put maybe 1,000 rounds through this gun a few years ago to break it in, and then it sat in my range bag as a backup for training classes. It shows some typical minor wear from range use, but is in good condition, no damage, mechanically sound and functions flawlessly. It went in my safe when I got married, and has sat there ever since.

Please do not email and ask ""Is the gun still available?"" If this listing is still up, the gun is still available. 

Price is $750, OBO. Transfer to be done face to face on FA-10. This gun is privately owned in Massachusetts and available to transfer to any MA resident with a Class A LTC A.

I will comply with all Federal and State Laws. If the firearm is to be shipped, you must provide me with a signed copy of your dealer's FFL (or your 03FFL if this is a Curio and Relic).

For anyone who lives by or has gone down by the Renton Landing area you might have seen this man. He is a older weathered looking homeless man. Most times you see him he is wearing the same older sweat shirt with a string tied around his waist to keep it together, and some old dirtied pants. However every time you see him he will be walking around with several old plastic bags in which he keeps all his valuables so they don't become ruined by the elements. My wife and I have seen him in the Landing area walking around minding his own business not bothering anyone. As far as we have seen he normally spends most nights out in the semi wooded area behind Lowell's. There have been times where we have driven by and seen him hunkered down with bags all around him to ""try"" and keep himself dry in the rain. 

We also normally will see him in the Target down there shopping, the Target management is nice enough to supply him with a gift card so he is able to buy somethings for himself however they all seem to be of course the biggest bang for his meager buck. Each time I've either driven by him or the wife and I have seen him in Target looking around making small talk with whomever will give him more than a smile and move on. Each time we both think we need to do something for him, I should help him in someway. Tonight we both realized that we had to do something for this sad polite human being. The wife first stopped to look at some beauty products when we noticed him looking at a mirror and put it back. I thought nothing really I saw him and then looked back at my phone to see what was new on SGN. However my wife is much smarter than me. She realized that what he was doing was looking at himself in the mirror.. Looking at himself. Something so small we take it for granted.

We both turned to each other and reached into our pocket and pulled what small amount of cash we had out. When we was kinda by himself I approached him. I didn't want to embarrass him, or make him think he was just getting a hand out. I quietly went up and said ""Sir my wife and I would like you to have this."" Shook his hand and gave him the cash. Now we could just pat ourselves on our backs and move on until next time we see him. However I have to do more, if I don't my inner boyscout would be ashamed. I would like to have just done this myself but being unemployed with zero income besides my amazing wifes I can't.

NOW THE IMPORTANT STUFF...
Thank you for making it through the back story, sorry I'm not as talent of a writer as I would like to be. What I am asking for is any of your old SHTF items. I'm looking for bags, backpacks, cold weather gear, hygiene gear, waterproof gear, socks, knives,one man tents, sleeping bags, bevy sacks.
