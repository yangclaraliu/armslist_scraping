Made by Tanfoglio in Italy for the Israeli domestic market.  One 16 round mag, 3 dot sights (red front dot, white rear dots), grip area has factory grooves on front and rear for improved grip.  This gun is super comfortable in the hand to shoot and it aims like it is a part of your arm.  Great shooter, I've put maybe 5 mags worth of 9mm through this gun with 0 issues or problems.  Shot several brands of ammo with no problems.  Gun fired all of it great, even the cheap stuff.  Extra mags are easily available online or from most gun shops, the mags are identical for the EEA Witness 9mm full size and the Jericho/Baby Eagle 9mm full size and are interchangeable, thus fairly cheap.  Crisp, smooth trigger, pistol is double or single action and has a frame mounted safety.  These were made in the same valley in Italy as Beretta... the Valley of the Gun they call it.  Nice pattern to the wood grips but they show some wear.  Slide and frame both marked with serial number (not always the case on these).  Gun shows some wear and tear but nothing terrible.  Slide is marked ""MOSSAD"" and has two six point ""Stars of David"" on each side of ""MOSSAD"".  Frame reads as follows: 
Made by Fratelli Tanfoglio S.P.A. For ""Weapons house LTD"" - Israel
I'll go $350 cash on this one and a quick search online didn't turn up but a couple for sale, and most looked worse condition wise.  Fairly rare gun in the US market, get it while you can!

Introducing the XD-S. Superior innovation in the palm of your hand. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers all the performance of a.45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand. At only 1"" wide, the XD-Sfits as perfectly into your concealed-carry strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. And with it, you get the power of a .45 with superior control and comfort without sacrificing important safety features. The unique combination of an ultra-slim profile paired with enhanced performance point-and-shoot features allows you to shoot accurately without having to adjust your wrist giving you greater control. Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texturefor greater control and usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Wicked bad rifle!  Unfired, in as-new condition, no handling marks, no damage, no rounds chambered, nothing.

Gun is outstanding and literally could not be distinguished from a brand new gun in any way.  Has been handled since purchase 3 or 4 times ever, twice to take pictures, once to put it in the new case, and once when I moved just to make sure everything was in there before I moved.  My Dad checked it out once when he first got it and then put it away.  He died last year and I've got too many 308 rifles right now, so I'm letting go of his bad boy.  Not hard up for cash, price is $2,200.  You can't buy one on any of the web sites I've seen with all these accessories and gear for anywhere near that price, let alone a new one with all this.  Plus you'd have to ship that and maybe pay taxes depending on if it is a NC shop or not!  GREAT gun, I've just got several 308's and I'm letting go of one or two... will keep whichever doesn't sell, so I'm pretty set on my price.  We spent like $240 on the extra DPMS mags alone I think."

I know I'll regret selling this one...but I need to pay for a new topper I bought for my truck.

This is a Sabre Defence M4-style rifle.  It has:


*  14.5"" barrel with permanently attached flash hider
*  ""F"" front sight
*  1/7 chrome-moly vanadium barrel, chrome lined, chromed chamber
*  Mil-spec receiver extension
*  6-position stock
*  Removable carry handle
*  Original box, plastic wrap, manual, warranty card
*  2 GI aluminum mags (30 rounds)Otis (Sabre marked) cleaning kit -   never used (not pictured)

This is one of the best M4 rifles I've ever owned.  I've owned it for several years...original owner.  It feeds/fires anything.  I love the short barrel, too.

Sabre is known for making barrels for the USAF big guns.  The barrels on Sabre rifles are top-notch and pretty much equal to anything out there.  This one is no exception.

The rifle is in excellent condition with only minimal signs of use.  I've taken very good care of the gun.  However, it could use a routine cleaning.  I used it in a class recently and haven't had time to devote to a thorough cleaning.  I'll try to get that done but no promises.

I bought this gun from my shop and dealer cost 7 years ago was over $1100.  Sabre guns were manufactured with great attention to detail and it shows.

You won't be disappointed.

Don't really need any trades right now.  Sorry."

Both are Bench Bred. Harley is of European lines.

Jewel: Black/White Tri
Harley: Black/White Tri ROAN

Jewel is a great dog, good with kids and families. She is the timid one of our bunch. She is 5 months and her feathering is starting to come out great.

Harley is a great dog also. She is not timid, but loves to be around people. She is a little more ""hard"" headed than Jewel.  She has more of a hunter instinct bred in her than Jewel and I believe this is cause of the euro line. 

Both are crate trained, and started obedience. Both are NOT spayed. We paid 1200 a piece for each of them. To their new homes, they will come with kennel, collar(s), leash, and food bowls. Both are up to date on shots. Harley has had cherry eye surgery a few months back w/ no complications. 

Looking at even trades. Depending on the trade will depend on whether they come with papers or not. I am NOT giving my dogs away. They were going to be part of a breeding program but things have changed. Avg Puppy Price: 800 w/ limited AKC registration to 1200 Full AKC. I'm not after this, and am not looking for trade plus boot. This is going to be a clean trade, through and through.

The barrel is a dedicated 16"" 22 LR (WASP) barrel by CMMG with a 1:16 twist, the action and collar are all stainless steel (the nicest action sold by CMMG), charging hande is made by CMMG for dedicated 22 uppers.  It has the regular m4 sight base, a magpul moe carbine handguard, and an A2 flash hider (which can be unscrewed by hand to attach your suppressor should you have one.  The upper receiver is a Tactical Innovations AR-15 receiver.  And comes with 2 - 25 round magazines.

This is a cream-of-the-crop build, it is nothing like these cheesy, toy-like dedicated 22 AR's that S&W and Mossberg are putting out, this upper has the look and feel of a real 5.56 upper, it is sturdy, feels great, looks great, shoots fantastic (both accurate and reliable - still yet to jam in the first 300 rounds with the cheap Federal Value pack ammo), yet still in a lightweight package.

This upper is a fantastic training tool for your AR (you can practice at 3-4 cents a round, compared to 25-50 cents a round for 223/556, this adds up very quickly!  You could dump a mag of 22 for the cost of a couple rounds of 223!).  It is accurate enough to be a hunting rifle.  Install on your AR lower takes maybe 10 seconds.  Spare mags can be purchased for $20.

I have exactly $632.31 into this upper, not uncluding the rear sight (Rock River Arms Dominator [$150] and sightmark red dot [$60] which are not included in the $630 price.  I am not looking to make any money on this upper, I am just wanting to start another project.  If you want the rear sights (which are Co-Witness) I would do a package deal at $800.  

So, it is $630 for the upper with no rear sight, or $800 with the Iron & Red Dot.

If you are interested in trading, I am wanting to get either a 22 Magnum rifle (magazine fed, not a tube fed version) or a Ruger 22/45 with threaded barrel.  I would be willing to give you a retail trade value on one of these types of guns (not like gun shops that try to rob you).

I may be interested in other trades so if you have something, just ask.

Also, I would be willing to meet you at a range so you could test out the upper before you bought it so that you can see just how well this gun runs.

If you need a lower, or would like one, I would love to build one for you.  If you ordered the parts, or gave me the money I could order them and assemble the lower for you.  We could go as cheap or as nice as you want to.  they can range anywhere from around $250 to $500+ (these are multi-cal lowers, so they can be used with any uppers).  I would charge $20 to do everything, this is just a hobby for me, I love it!"

The gun does have a collapsible stock. Also, the Yugoslavia SKS's are able to shoot grenades out of the barrel just like the M1 Garand's. This gun does still have the flip up grenade sites.

No rust, or damage. 

Unlike most SKS rifles the Yugoslavian Sk, has a gas shut off valve. When you fire a gas system rifle the gas pressure will cause the rifle to load another round. However; with a gas shut off valve you can force the gun to fire the single round then be reloaded manually. Just like a Bolt Action Rifle. Simply grab the charging rod pull back and release forward to load your next round from the magazine. The gas release valve is on the Yugoslavia Sk's because, as mentioned before the gun has the ability to fire barrel ""mounted"" loaded grenades. A special cartridge would be loaded into the magazine and fired striking (I guess) a primer on the grenade. Hence the need for being able to make a semi-automatic rifle, a bolt action rifle when desired.

#1
Marlin 717hm2, caliber: RIMFIRE 17 mach 2 (or 17hm2), NOT 17hmr , it has the heavy barrel with recessed crown. 1x7rd mag (many marlin 22lr mags are compatible), semi-auto, if you are unfamiliar with the cal its like a necked down 22lr whereas the 17hmr is like a necked down 22mag. , the rifle has incredible accuracy. the 17 mach 2 boasts 1/2MOA at 50yds (though i have not tried). if you have never heard one fired it sounds about the noise level of a light whip crack
flaws: missing front sight , someone before me painted a couple inches of the fore-end with a permanent marker ? (think could be easy enough to remove) and there is a crack in the under-plate in front of the trigger(can see in pic).
the good : has a Simmons prohunter 3-7x32 scope and 100+ hornady v-max 17gr rounds (thats right 17grain ) , ammo is around but not ""common"" (my baitshop carries them even before i needed them)
this was going to be a project rifle, but just too many ""irons in the fire"" or cash price $220

About 3 months old. Quite possibly the best carry gun made. Super thin and light.

Done a few things to the gun to improve it. A Kel-Tec is meant to be ""finished"" by the owner for the most part. All modifications are easily reversible but I doubt you'd want to.

**This gun shoots MUCH nicer than a stock factory gun.**

- Fluff and Buffed. Gun has been broken down and deburred. Slide rails and feed ramp smoothed. Hammer surface smoothed

- Trigger straightened, softened and shortened. Biggest complaint with this gun is the trigger shape from the factory can ""pinch"" larger fingers. The shorter trigger is MUCH more controllable and softer to shoot. A stock replacement trigger is about 2 bucks from Kel-Tec.

- Hogue grip installed and trimmed. Helps suck up the recoil and improve grip on this little beast.

- +1 extended magazine bottom not only adds a round but vastly improves the gun grip.

- Extra +1 magazine. Any defensive gun needs an extra mag. It also has the +1 extension

- Stainless belt clip. Not installed in the pictures but included. Here is a pic of one installed (mine is stainless, not black) 
http://imgur.com/gTW0w (not my gun)
Installation is very simple 2 screws.

- Sights and hammer painted orange. For some reason the white sights and my eyes did not play nicely. Orange is MUCH easier to see and get on target with. Orange hammer means it is much easier to stage the trigger (along with the shortened trigger) for fast accurate shots. Both are ""painted"" with my 5 year olds orange nail polish. It's the type that doesn't need remover. Just ""peels"" off with a toothpick if you don't dig orange. You will though.

- Shimmed rear site. Gun was accurate but this shooter always trended a touch low with it. You may be different. Shim is just a plastic spacer that you can remove if you shoot differently than I do. I'm no marksman.

- Deburred the grip. Has some ridges on it from the factory that can hurt your hands after awhile. An hour with an emery board really smoothed things out.



Also included:

Flat magazine floor plate.

Pinky magazine floor plate (doesn't add a round)

Allen wrench for sight adjustment

Kel-Tec plastic case

Instruction booklets



Not included but possible for the right deal:

Desantis Soft Tuck holster

Uncle Mikes pocket holster



Looking for a compact 9MM such as a Glock 26 or Ruger SR9c. The Kel-Tec is too small for what I need it for now and I have another gun when I need something smaller. Will add cash as needed to the right deal.



A trade is preferred but will sell outright for $360. This is what everything would cost you if you can even find it all plus you'd have to pay tax and shipping.

FTF bill of sale. DL or CWL required.

Just so you know, this is one complete pistol and one frame/barrel/magazine. The FCM which is basically the trigger and firing assembly can be swapped from one to the other. That way you can have full size pistol, compact or sub compact when you need it. Only one can fire at a time though. You can get another FCM through JC Weaponry for $200 ( I think ) shipped to your FFL.

This is a collectable early model Desert Eagle. If you don't know the ""Deagle"" brand has changed hands a few times since its inception in the 80's. This Is the original Desert Eagle in .357 before the 50AE  version ever existed. Yes its not nearly as powerful as the 44 or 50, but have you priced a box of 50 compared to 357? what im trying to say is that this is much more pleasurable and cheaper to shoot.....and no it doesn't shoot 38 special if that's what you were thinking. This thing is in almost 100 percent condition, and functions flawlessly....its been a safe queen. I just put 20rds down the tube last weak to make sure its all good....it is. And i cleaned it, I'll show you how to take it down if your interested. 

Anyway it will come with two 9rd magazines, that's all.....I don't have the box. Shoulda held on to that...oh well. Hindsight is 20/20. I'm Mainly looking for high-end 1911's, and custom or collectable firearms. I have a weakness for S&W performance shop firearms. 45acp is king in my book. I'm also on the prowl for a nice UZI, preferably IMI. I may be able to scrounge up some cash for the right trade. Let me know what you have...Mutigun trades are welcome. I'm only interested in selling it if you want to pay the Blue book price.....even then i'm much more interested in a trade. I'll trade down in price ( for the right gun) if you make up the difference.

I am in the market for an M1A SOCOM or Scout Squad, and would be willing to sweeten the deal if you have one you want to trade. I will also buy it for cash. To a lesser extent I'm in the market for the pistols I mentioned above, especially .45 caliber full sized Glocks. Also looking for surplus quantities of 7.62 NATO, all brass and lead non corrosive. I would also like an original Magunum Research .50 Desert Eagle, preferably in a dark finish but I'm open to others as I understand they're not all that common. 

I also work on ARs in my spare time and could build you a custom AR at a really good price. I do not deal in firearms, so you would have to bring me at least a stripped lower, but I have dealer accounts for most things in terms of parts and accessories, including optics.
