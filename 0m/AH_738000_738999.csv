I'm actively looking to put together a 14.5"" lightweight carbine rig ASAP (for suppressor), so up for sale is my Mid-length AR15. This is an awesome set-up, that was built for accuracy, ease of cleaning, and function (which it serves extremely well - zero malfunctions in the 500 rnds it has been fired). Hate to see it go - but its a bit too heavy with a 2 LB can attached (never fired suppressed).
This is NOT a POF Piston system. I've had the piston systems - didn't like them - and sold them. Then built this to maintain the ""slick"" nickel upper for cleaning/operating purposes.

This is up for sale locally as well, I'll go by time stamp.

It outputs the brightness of a 20mw laser. It will fit any rifle with a picatinny rail and comes with the laser, mount, CR123 battery, pressure switch cord, mounting/adjustment hardware, and standard end cap.

**For those of you who may not know, the Talon grips are removable if you do not wish to have them on this Glock 21. In my opinion, they dramatically help with control, accuracy, and felt recoil of the gun. They run about $15 dollars.

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine.

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floorplate when not in use to prevent possible loss. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

Here are some more details from the Sig Sauer website:
The SIG556® HOLO features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by Swiss Arms and marries it to a CNC machined from 7075-T6 grade aluminum forged trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle’s weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines. The SIG556 HOLO features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The SIG556 HOLO has a proven two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system joined to a lightweight alloy trigger housing that accepts standard AR magazines. The vented non-slip polymer forearm has three Picatinny rails for accessory mounting. Sight options include front combat sight, flip-up rear sight, and a red dot style holographic sighting system that allows for quick target acquisition, with four illuminated reticle patterns with adjustable intensities. The SIG556 buttstock is collapsible and has a rubber butt pad and a number of sling attachment points. Select versions feature a folding stock with the ability to collapse, providing the best of both worlds."

I have a sig sauer p250 tac PAC 9mm, with a holster, two clips, holster for clips, speed loader and a crossbreed super tuck holster. Bought this past February @ Cabelas and paid  $85 for the crossbreed holster. Asking $500 obo will consider trades for a 1911 or carry semi auto carry gun.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style."

I am not looking for any extras just the weapon and 1-2 mags. I currently have a gen3 G26 and a gen4 G17 and want to complete the set of 9x19 Glocks. I am a chash buyer and do not mind if there is significant wear on the finish of the slide since i am likely going to refinish it or cerakote it. Additionally my fiancé recently got her concealed permit and she works late shifts at two hospitals in the ER and there have been several recent attacks and sexual assaults and a G19 would be a perfect carry weapon for her.  As for location there wasn't an option for the seacoast region so I had to put in Manchester but I am located in the Exeter, NH area and can meet pretty much any time on the weekends.  I am also perfectly ok with purchasing out of the area and having it shipped but obviously a face to face transaction is preferred.  Price is negotiable and I am looking for a weapon that may have some miles on it but is still in good shape.  An ex range gun or agency turn in would be awesome to keep cost down but any used G19 or 19c will fit the bill. I would like to stay in the $400 range but will go up to get a G19 in good shape. Thanks again and have a great Christmas."
