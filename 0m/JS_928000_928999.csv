Specifications: 
For 5.56 x 45mm cartridges, capacity is true 30 rounds. Fits AR-15/M16/M4/SCAR Light series weapons. 

Heavy duty feed lips provide smooth, positive round delivery. 

Unique Patent-pending follower is skeletonized for easy magazine cleaning without disassembly. 

Semi-floating follower is molded in low friction polymer, and utilizes proper anti-dive shape. 

Premium quality chromium-silicon spring is heat treated, stress relieved and moly coated. Spring life is 100,000+ cycles. 

Patented modular design and construction allows for maximum part integrity during the injection molding process. 

Dimensions are tightly controlled, allowing the magazine to drop free, even from non MIL-STD receivers. 

Modular design allows for material choice flexibility. Transparent lower sections can be bonded to the high-strength upper sections without sacrificing feed lip durability. Lower sections have no floor plate to fail if loaded magazine is dropped on hard surfaces. Rugged five-sided box construction provides superior impact  resistance. Color is molded in, with no coating to chip or wear off. 

Proprietary polymer has been successfully impact tested from -40 degrees F to +150 degrees F. It is unaffected by gun lubricants and solvents. 

Ultra high strength adhesive permanently bonds both sections together. Joint is stronger than the base material. 

Patented, durable EVA sand seal prevents entry of environmental contaminants into the weapon system (Military model only). 

Molded-in ridging, front & rear, assures positive grip on magazine during ‘push-pull’ insertions. 

Deep ribs on sides enable sure grip on magazine during mag pouch extractions.

Gun has a rifle length free float aluminum handguard and a heavy threaded barrel. This gun has only had two boxes fired through it and comes with the bipod, and the 6x18x44 scope pictured. Gun also has the soft case and all the paperwork it came with when I bought it as well as the factory magazine, I might even have a couple boxes of .308 left to throw in. This may be one of your last chances to get a .308 AR10 varient and especially in this condition! Most everyone is asking closer to $3000 for this rifle right now so I believe my asking price of $2500 OBO for trade on everything is decent. I will work with you on the price if you are wanting to buy it straight across with cash. I am looking to trade for a few things right now and they are as listed:
Full size  or possibly compact Springfield XDM or XD in .40 or .45 + cash
Full size M&P in 9mm, .40 or .45 + cash
Full size Glock in 9mm, .40 or .45 + cash
1911 varient + cash
AK47 varient + cash
Nice bolt action rifle in 30 caliber or larger + cash
OR I AM WILLING TO TRADE STRAIGHT ACROSS for a motorcycle or 4x4 truck/SUV or a couple older dirt bikes.

I am willing to do more then one gun on trade to even out the price, but I do need some cash on this deal unless you have a streetbike, 4x4 truck/SUV or a couple dirt bikes then as I said I would trade you straight across. This post will remain up until the deal has been made on the DPMS at which point I will take it down so there is no need to ask if it is still available. Send me pics of what you are offering to trade or I won't respond to you, and please only serious offers or inquiries.

Trade value is $2500 OBO and I don't want any low ballers, if you wanna buy it straight across I will work with you on the price. Thank you."

This gun has the engraved bear with trees and mountain sceen. This is the Alaskan Backpacker and not the new Backpacker that are manufactured with MIM parts and all over Laser Etching... It is the 629-4 verison that has the endurance package, and no hilary hole (pre-lock version) The 629-4 is the most sought after and with the limited run makes this highly colectable. It has the 2 1/2"" ported barrel. Overall condition is 98% as this beauty has been a safe queen. Fired very little and well maintained. Willing to sell or trade. Before replying do some research as there is little info or pics out there on this Smith as they are not available for sale. None on gunbroker or any other sites. The gun does not have the cardboard box it came in, wish it did. Upon several inquirys I am told current value to be $1200-$1400 and these prices will go up as very few where made.

These are the infamous Black Talon by Winchester. 20 Rounds of .40 Cal for sale. This is to some, the most powerful, deadly round made. Production stopped many years ago due to controversy and bans on this ammunition. 

This will most likely be your last opportunity to purchase or find ammunition like this. This ammo is already rare to come accross and with new legislation possibly coming into effect......it will soon be practically impossible.

Very rare and in mint condition. Very few produced. Comes with 2 mags bayonet, scope mount and 3.5x10x32 scope. Asking 2000. Will add pic soon. Here is description from manufactuer:

The AK-54R rifles are built upon Category 1 (nice, minty, un issued) Romanian PSL rifle parts kits, using a special receiver that allows for the use of regular AKM type butt stocks and pistol grips. They also feature a correct, and fully functional, scope mount, installed on the left side of the receiver . The barrel is shortened to 16.5 inches, and is re-profiled, allowing the gas block and handguard retainer to be moved rearward, so that standard AKM length gas pistons (we use a Tapco stainless unit, which provides an extra 922r compliance part) and standard AKM type handguards can be used! The idea is simply to give the end user an AKM sized package that delivers the powerful punch of the 7.62x54R cartridge. This initial batch of rifles will feature a non-pinned Romanian PSL muzzle device, on 14x1 LH threads, K-VAR synthetic furniture, in plum, beautiful gun kote finish ."

834,http://www.armslist.com/posts/928834,"For Sale:  Norinco SKS ""M"",  Paratrooper, Built to use AK mags!","In order of preference: South, East, North, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 700,"Listed On: Friday, January 25, 2013",Rifles,Norinco                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"My research into this particular SKS leads me to believe that this rifle was made after the Clinton assault rifle ban and made by Norinco for export to the civilian market.  It has no bayonet or bayonet lug and has a ""hunting"" look to the stock (so as not to scare those who fear ""assault weapons"").  

For those of you who like a shorter, more maneuverable SKS, this paratrooper fits the bill.  Compared to it's longer SKS cousins, this 16"" barrel SKS is much more manageable.  I think this would serve you well if you were to use this weapon for home defense; the longer SKSs would be too cumbersome for ""inside"" fighting.  This SKS (like most) has a milled receiver for incredible durability.  Because it was built by Norinco to use AK mags (and is not a conversion) I call it ""The Poor Man's AK"".  Some people have told me that SKSs tend to be more accurate that AKs, I'm not sure but I can tell you that this rifle is quite accurate.  

This SKS also comes with it's original sling and a Tasco scope which is about the same age as the rifle.  The scope mount on the rifle was engineered in such a way that you could look under it and utilize the iron sights if you so desired (see pic below).  

Like most AKs and SKSs this rifle has the adjustable front sight that allows you to (theoretically) use your iron sights for targets out to 1,000 meters.  Practically speaking, my sights are spot on for up to 30 yards or so, after that distance I need the scope anyway ;-) .  The front sight is nicely protected in a round shroud.  For those of you who have an AK front sight adjustment tool, it will work on this SKS.  

The blonde wood stock is what came with the gun and shows some light wear but not too bad.  No visible rust on the gun and the barrel's inside is very clean.  I don't know if all the numbers match because when I have taken it apart to clean it I forget to check.  If it is make or break for a serious buyer I'll look into it.  I can tell you it functions flawlessly and I've kept it clean and lightly lubricated.  

Because of the run on guns that is going on I've decided to put this one up for sale and see how it goes.  If it doesn't sell that's ok too.

I'm not interested in most trades.  The only thing I might trade for would be an AK (with some $$ coming from me, for the right gun), but partial payment can be made in ammo as well (7.62 x 39, 9 mm, 40 S&W, 22 Long Rifle).  If you are offering your gun in trade you must send me a few pictures with your offer.

Note: The plastic mag in the 3rd picture is for demonstration purposes only.  No magazines are being offered with this gun.

I prefer face to face near Indianapolis, any part of town except downtown or the west side (I'm hardly ever over on the west side anymore).   I need to see an Indiana DL and LTCH.  No paperwork, I just need to know you're not a felon or from out of state."

Accurate; fires great.
That being said, I’m not sure how this gun came into this world. I inherited and know little about it. The slider is stamped COLT M1991A1 and the other side says SERIES 80. However, the top of the barrel is stamped COLT .45 AUTO. N.M. and below that MK.IV/SERIES ‘70. 
This might even be correct but with my limited knowledge I can’t be sure.
What I DO know is that this is a mildly spectacular hand gun. I’ve fired a couple boxes through it and it never hiccuped once. Really low recoil so you can stay on target pretty easy. I’m not that great of a shot but I could hit tin cans at 70 yards consistently, leaving big dime sized holes. Good balance empty or full and it has a fatter grip to accommodate the ten round mag.
Hate to let it go but need the money. $700."
