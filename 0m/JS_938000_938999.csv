This is a Yugoslavian SKS M59/66.  Please do not confuse this with the Chinese SKS's.  This was made AFTER 1970 (very important), so the barrel is chrome lined.  That's one of the things to look for in an SKS, also Bayonet, and has the integrated grenade launcher with grenade launcher sights.  I don't have grenades, but you can still get dummy grenades, and a golf ball launcher for it!! The front sight is a luminescence night sight, and also has a distance peep sight.  Chambered in 7.62x39, comes with over a dozen clips, extra ammo available.  I hate to see this go, but I bought a few more toys than I was allowed, and I have to sell some.  If a few more of my other things sell, I'll be keeping this one.

No special machinery required the work could be done with a hand drill or drill press. Parts Kits are available for less than $400 if you shop around. So with a little work you can have an AK for 1/3 the current prices. One with out a paper trail so Obama will have a hard time finding it once he gets his BAN in place.

It comes with 2 magazines, and the holster that I got with it when purchased.
There is one unopened box of Silver Bear 94gr. FMJ, a partial box of 19 rounds of Silver Bear HP ammo, and 40 rounds of Hornady XTP  95 gr. HP ammo that was loaded into Starline brass by me a few years ago when I reloaded.
There is SLIGHT finish wear around the muzzle, as most of these pistols have. It's very slight, though.
No chipping of finish.... it's overall in great shape.
Where your fingers rest, when gripping the pistol, on the ""left"" side of the frame near/ behind the trigger, the finish is worn off of the frame. I really hadn't noticed that until I was taking pictures to post here. It's really not noticeable unless you look for it.
Must sign a bill of sale with both of our drivers license numbers, disclaimers, contact info, etc.  
Prefer to sell to CCW holder.
Local FTF sale, no trades.
**I also have a nice  IWB holster that was made by HBE Leatherworks back in 2003 for a Makarov that I once had. It has been worn 5 times!!, and is still like new! As per a conversation that I had with Eric on the phone, it fits the CZ 82 like it was made for it.
I would sell that for $50. The picture limit on armslist is small, so I can't post that picture, but could send one via email or text. I believe it was called a IWB Pro."

This is NOT legally a firearm as it has not yet been drilled. It has no makers stamp or serial number. All that is required is that you glue the included template to the appropriate place and drill the indicated size holes. Instructions are included on the template. No special machinery required the work could be done with a hand drill or drill press. Parts Kits are available for less than $400 if you shop around. So with a little work you can have an AK for 1/3 the current prices. One with out a paper trail so Obama will have a hard time finding it once he gets his BAN in place.

I will ship the receiver as pictured and two copies of the template via priority mail the next business day after receiving payment for the asking price. Payment can be via Money order or preferably Pay-Pal

This is NOT an order and wait. I have 1 of these left and once I receive payment for it this ad will come down.

Warning once you do drill it; it is a Firearm as defined by the BATF. Check you local, state & Federal laws before attempting any work on this piece."

The barrel is rifled and has a good bore. I just replaced the firing pin and the 550-1 would not fit. Natchez sent me a 550a and fit.

I have a brand new DPMS LR-308 precision AR chambered in .308 up for sale or trade. Gun has a rifle length free float aluminum handguard and a heavy threaded barrel. This gun has only had two boxes fired through it and comes with the bipod, and the 6x18x44 scope pictured. Gun also has the soft case and all the paperwork it came with when I bought it as well as the factory magazine, I might even have a couple boxes of .308 left to throw in. This may be one of your last chances to get a .308 AR10 varient and especially in this condition! Most everyone is asking closer to $3000 for this rifle right now so I believe my asking price of $2500 OBO for trade on everything is decent. I will work with you on the price if you are wanting to buy it straight across with cash. I am looking to trade for a few things right now and they are as listed:
Full size or possibly compact Springfield XDM or XD in .40 or .45 + cash
Full size M&P in 9mm, .40 or .45 + cash
Full size Glock in 9mm, .40 or .45 + cash
1911 varient + cash
AK47 varient + cash
Nice bolt action rifle in 30 caliber or larger + cash
OR I AM WILLING TO TRADE STRAIGHT ACROSS for a motorcycle or 4x4 truck/SUV or a couple older dirt bikes.

I am willing to do more then one gun on trade to even out the price, but I do need some cash on this deal unless you have a streetbike, 4x4 truck/SUV or a couple dirt bikes then as I said I would trade you straight across. This post will remain up until the deal has been made on the DPMS at which point I will take it down so there is no need to ask if it is still available. Send me pics of what you are offering to trade or I won't respond to you, and please only serious offers or inquiries.

Trade value is $2500 OBO and I don't want any low ballers, As I stated if you offer me a reasonable cash offer or cash/trade offer it is yours today,  if you wanna buy it straight across I will work with you on the price. Thank you."

A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase. The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver looks great. There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new. Bore is in fantastic shape. Shoots brass or steel case ammo.
This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47. The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section. This rifle has a chromed gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented. The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design. Chrome lined barrel. The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights. There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the night sights can be replaced by new mepro sights from Optics Planet for about $80.
The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic. There are (12) 35 round magazines. There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.
The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

Finish about 80%.  This is not an IMPORT marked gun....most likely vet bringback due to the fact that the sideplate was missing.  That was how the G.I.s de-milled these so the Germans couldn't shoot them.  

Parts matching receiver:
all internal, all external except takedown lever (unmarked armorer replacement part) and sideplate is a modern repro part.  It has matching grips panels, but large chip out of left panel where mag release button is.  Have repro VOLPO style grips on it for shooting.  Magazine is mismatched but correct for period.    

Bore is good, has some minor frosting out near the muzzle, but not bad.  Functions 100% has nice strong action spring....finger biter!

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. and TALO Distributors, Inc. have teamed up to create a limited edition USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ rifle. This special run is limited to just 5,000 rifles, with serial numbers GOLD-0001 through GOLD-5000. A $20.00 donation will be made to the USA Shooting Team for every rifle sold. This is a historic opportunity to own a collectible Ruger® firearm and support the USA Shooting Team at the 2012 Olympic games. The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is a stainless steel rifle with a distinct blue stock. Like all 10/22 Takedown™ rifles, the barrel and forend are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction-fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but rarely needs re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used. The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is also shipped in a special red ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features the USA Shooting Team logo. The bag features internal sleeves, which hold the two subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

Umarex H&K Heckler Koch MP5 A5 - 22lr
This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rim fire rifle. It's built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. They are proportionate in size to the center fire version's magazine to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine.

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. and TALO Distributors, Inc. have teamed up to create a limited edition USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ rifle. This special run is limited to just 5,000 rifles, with serial numbers GOLD-0001 through GOLD-5000. A $20.00 donation will be made to the USA Shooting Team for every rifle sold. This is a historic opportunity to own a collectible Ruger® firearm and support the USA Shooting Team at the 2012 Olympic games. The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is a stainless steel rifle with a distinct blue stock. Like all 10/22 Takedown™ rifles, the barrel and forend are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction-fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but rarely needs re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used. The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is also shipped in a special red ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features the USA Shooting Team logo. The bag features internal sleeves, which hold the two subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

Bought this new for my wife and her finger is too weak for the trigger for her to shoot it consistantly so selling it to buy another model. Gun shoots great. I've put exactly 70 rounds through it between 2 different range times. Cleaned thoroughly after shooting and a clean patch ran through every ten shots to help with the proper barrell break in. This gun is equiped with a built in laser from the factory and it also strobes. I have 75 rounds of Winchester fmj and 14 rounds of Corbon Pow'rBall . I have the original box and the case for the gun. Might be interested in a trade for a glock or similar value hand gun. $375 firm.
