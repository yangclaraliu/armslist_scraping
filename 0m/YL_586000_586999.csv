BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer Custom
Shop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and
nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When
combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine."

This rifle is in great condition. It is equipped with a Daniel Defense Rail System, CAA ergo pistol grip and CAA collapsible butt stock. I have some mags that I can throw in also. The optic that is mounted is zeroed to the rifle. It does not go with it but I did not want to remove it for pics in the event I want to shoot before the rifle sells. I am willing to sell the optic if the buyer is interested. 

Don't confuse this with a run of the mill off the shelf AR-15/M4. It is a name brand competition quality piece. It has had some trigger work done. It is much nicer than the government issued M4's I use at work. It was manufactured in Windham, Maine prior to Bushmaster being sold to a larger company. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this rifle. I am only selling it to fund my next project.

NOTES: Dynacomp muzzle device is a superb break that does not make any more noise than an A2 flash hider and it keeps the muzzle dead on without movement.  Makes nice fireballs sometimes!  Gun kept perfectly clean, never a rod through the bore, only a bore snake, Spike’s properly calibrates their gas port for optimal cycling which sets them apart from the majority of other builders.  This is no boutique gun like that Rock River, Bushmaster, DPMS, Delton, Oly Arms, S&W crap, this actually meets and even exceeds actual military specs.

I have an absolutely beautiful Kimber Ultra CDP ll available for sale or trade plus cash. This gun is the best looking gun I have ever seen hands down.

I bought this gun to carry but it's such a nice looking gun I can't get myself to carry it because I don't want to damage it from everyday carry. It does not have a scratch on it. The gun retails for $1,331 on the Kimber website seen here..

Up for sale is my 9mm DW Guardian commander sized bobtail. This gun is a factory blem and priced as such. The blem is some hazing around the serial number and address. (this was apparently a common issue with a batch of Guardians) The gun is in excellent condition and has no idiot mark. According to the previous owner it has around 200 rounds down the pipe. It is wearing black double diamond grips and has contrasting night sights. The fired shell casing date is 6/11. Comes in original box with paperwork and two factory mags.

I purchased this light on a whim and have not used it except to play around with it. It has never been mounted on a gun. The batteries were charged only one time. This is an amazing light, super bright and lightweight. The specifications are below. Or you can check it out at the Kalrus website.

Comes with the box for the light, with all paperwork and accessories, the box for the charger and the case for the filter. The remote pressure switch and gun mount did not come with packaging.

Asking $125 (If you purchased everything new it would be about $175). Cash, FTF in the Littleton Area preferred. Not looking for any trades.

Specifically designed for military and self-defense applications, the Klarus XT11 outshines the competition with its extremely durable build, brilliant 600-lumen output, and stainless steel strike bezel that can be used to ward off attackers. Like its smaller cousin, the XT10, the XT11 uses Klarus's dual button tail switch that allows for one-handed control and easy access to its blinding strobe function. The strike bezel can also be unscrewed to attach other accessories like colored filters. If you want to weapon mount the XT11, it is fully compatible with the ED10 Remote Pressure Switch.

It was first specified by the U.S. Military for use on SOCOM Special Sniper Weapons (SPR’s) in 2003. GUN-KOTE™ is superior to parkerized, blued, or air dry finishes in both durability and performance. GUN-KOTE™ satin matte black finish protects metal parts from rustcorrosion, & scratches and will not break down, peel or dissolve. In fact, once applied and heat-cured, the only way to remove it is through abrasive blasting. GUN-KOTE™ is resistant to all known gun solvents, oils, and thinners. GUN-KOTE™ is a highly specialized, hard, abrasion resistant coating that meets all military specifications for protective coatings. GUN-KOTE™ is formulated to provide excellent impact resistance, lubricity (meets military dry firing specs), heat dissipation, chemical resistance, corrosion protection, durability, and scratch resistance. It is specially formulated for salt corrosion protection and meets US Military requirements for ""Resistant to Chemicals"". GUN-KOTE™ has outstanding heat dissipating qualities, outstanding temperature variation durability  (+800 degrees F to -300 degrees F), and outstanding lubrication qualities. The M4 six-position collapsible stock is manufactured in the USA with military grade polymer and a super strong machined aluminum tube. We include a custom machined steel side-rail installed on the left side of the receiver to provide you the option to mount variable power scopes. The double hook USA mfg.

Bore is exc, comes complete with correct rear sight (these sell for $300-350 alone), all matching numbers (barrel, bolt, receiver, rear sight, etc...).  The rifle looks very nice for it's age and is easily in 90% condition for a modern rifle (under antique VG+?).  

Please as with any rifle of it's age (1930's? going through a war) expect some dings and dents in the stock, some very minor bluing loss and very small areas of where there was older minor surface rust.  The only real damage the rifle has had was a small piece had broke off the butt plate but this has been repaired (note very top left side of butt about 1/2 in by 1/4 in, the broken part did not extend to the screw hole).  These are very rare and good shooters, in checking around the net I think you'd be hard to find someone selling one for less then $800 and most cases more if they have a correct original rear sight (simpsons lists an incorrect sight version for $2800).  I can supply more pictures if needed.

I have an antique (102 year old) 1910 Meriden special 12 gauge double barrel Shot Gun for sale. This gun is in good condition (given it's age) and still operational.  The gun is stamped with the following:

Manufactured by the Meriden firearms company, Meriden CT pad July 9th 1907. 

This gun is all numbers matching which means its all 100% ORIGINAL! The numbers on the forearm stock, numbers on the receiver, numbers on the barrel and numbers on the locking hardware all match!

I have done a lengthy study on this gun and have found out the following information.

Brief history:

The Meriden Firearms Company of Meriden, Connecticut, USA manufactured small arms from 1905 to 1918. Meriden made side lock double-barrel hammer and hammerless shotguns; single barrel shotguns, small revolvers and small bore rifles. The Meriden Firearms Company was formed when Sears Roebuck purchased the Andrew Fyrberg & Sons firearms manufacturing plant and moved the plant and machinery to Meriden, Connecticut in 1905. The company started manufacturing firearms mid 1905. In 1918 Sears announced that the Meriden Firearms Company would discontinue the manufacture of sporting firearms.
Meriden Firearms represented a selection of good-quality, relatively low-cost firearms of which many survive in operational condition more than 100 years later.

The shotguns were well made and available in several grades. All had automatic safeties and cocking indicators. Barrels could be had in twist, Damascus of several grades, armory steel or Krupp steel. Hammerless or hammer shotguns with varying amounts of engraving were available.

In, 1908 when Richard Sears left the company followed by Fred Biffer and later Aubrey in 1909. After Aubrey left, the guns were marked Meriden without the Aubrey name.

I'm asking $200.00 or best offer (or trade).

I am sure this lying low life has other emails he uses but these are the 2 he used to try and run a scam on me.

He originally emailed me from the Forsaken email offering $500 on a gun I had for sale listed at $525 and I agreed on that price with him. He fed me a line of bullshit saying he was out of town doing ""security detail"" and would be back Monday and we would complete the deal. 

LATER that day I got an email from the Carryonkentucky email lowballing me at a price of $450 I replied back saying I wouldn't go that low and I had other offers. Then the Forsaken email replied back saying he would be out of town for 3 months and the carryonkentucky email said he had cash in hand at his $450 offer and could meet ASAP.

Funny thing that this lowlife didn't realize was BOTH email had his name attached to them! Austin Carswell, guess this brain surgeon didn't know that when you send an email from YOUR account it has YOUR name on it. 

Anyway he is a liar and in book a thief. Trying to take advantage of people by lying an cheat honest people enjoying their hobby.I am sure this guy also isn't a straight shooter on items he sells, if someone is willing to lie about something like that go as far as creating 2 email accounts what about the items he is selling? How crooked are those items? I'd be very cautious buying any gun from this guy. He is located in Louisville on Preston Highway."

Comes complete with Yugo cleaning kit, 30rd Yugo mag, Original Yugo short muzzle break (for SBR), sling, extra Yugo M92 original trigger pack, case and accessories carry pouch. These are very rare rifles. Krinkov Rifles are a factory designed short barreled AK47 with the short stroke AK piston system (10in barrel, 12.5in with short ""horn"" flash hider.). They were designed and used by the Yugoslavian version of the Speznaz for CQB. The extended ""hollow"" muzzle brake has been put on with a spot-weld to make it legal length (16.25in).
     They are typically bought to SBR them as the extended muzzle break can be removed (unscrewed) to install the short muzzle break after getting your SBR tax stamp. It was built on a proper Krinkov No-Dak Spuds underfolder lower receiver. 
     This is a brand new never fired Rifle still in the shipping hard case! This is not a used parts de-milled krink kit..it is a brand new from the Yugo factory virgin rifle. 
     I can send more pictures upon request. You must be legal to own! 
     Typically an SBR version of this weapon sells for $2000 - $2500 + you still have to buy the $200 tax stamp.....this is the faster route because you can get the Tax Stamp at your leisure while actually possessing and enjoying it! I have two of these great firearms and am looking for a trade only at this time*. You can respond by e-mail or call 850-Four Two Zero-4509. Thanks for looking.

*I would only consider selling it for cash if the price was right! These are the most unique AK47's and most collectable of the AK variants made! Just to give you a ball park figure these typically go for $1500 - $1700 if you can find them even available for sale as a completed rifle.

One described about the same (but more rust) just sold for almost $1700, I can supply the link to the closed auction.  That seller claimed because these were in the flooded storage room most of them have light surface rust.  With the price of gold, the coin alone is worth it.
