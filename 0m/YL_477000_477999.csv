up for sale is unfired HK45 limited edition HKPRO version pistol.  HKPRO is a HK enthusiast forum online and the only thing different about this pistol is that it has their logo engraved on it.  The reason for this limited edition was that it came with an extra magazine and night sights over the stock variant.  Also, I paid extra to have HK do the LEM conversion on mine with the 4lb trigger.  The downside is the loss of safety, but the trigger feels so much better over stock.

What is included in the sale:
- Unfired HK45 (with factory grease on it!) LEM kit installed (4lb trigger) with night sights
- 3 Magazines (which is 1 extra magazine... that goes for $50 a pop)
- Brand new M-pro 7 Tactical cleaning kit (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H6DHBS/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00)

This one's on the chopping block. Let me start by saying I DON'T NEED TO SELL THIS, I DON'T NEED THE MONEY....SO DON'T LOWBALL ME, OR I'LL MOCK YOU RUTHLESSLY. So on to business, the lower is a USA tactical with a palmetto state lower parts kit. The trigger has been worked with a polished trigger and hammer spring mod, it's SUPER crisp and set at about 5lbs compared to the stock 7, and has no grit like a stock mil-spec trigger. The gun has a mil spec buffer tube and a Magpul MOE stock and a stark industries pistol grip. The reason I went with the stark industries pistol grip was becuase when I was banging one of the roll pins out of the ears, I snapped the ear off (which I still have, and can be JB welded back on), the stark industries pistol grip has a bigger trigger guard built in, and completely covers the broken ear (you can't see it), and no worries about the grip or trigger guard ever coming off. The upper is a factory 1/9 twist 16"" chrome lined stag arms with a magpul MOE hand guard, magpul flip up rear sight and a FAIL ZERO bolt carrier group, the BCG cost me over $225 alone. I also have as you see an Aimpoint Comp M2 (not ML2), this is the real deal military night vision capable aimpoint that I can include with the rifle. Round count is less than 400. You will be required to sign a bill of sale to buy this, no questions asked. I will sell them sperately, but not before the rifle sells FIRST.

Rifle and aimpoint: $1200

Rifle: $850

I'm firm on these prices, so don't bother sending me low-ball offers. I'm not interested in any trades unless you have a spikes tactical stripped lower with the bullet pictogram. I'll also take .223/5.56 BRASS cased ammo as partial trades. You can call/text me   7    0    4    5    0    2    7    7    7    2

I am selling my GLOCK 30 SF 3rd gen (they do not make a 4th gen GLOCK 30 or 30 SF).  The pistol has approx 100 rounds through it.  I am getting rid of it because I don't carry it as much as I used to.  Bought for a carry gun and find I still carry my 1911 more, and my comp guns are Springfield.  Included is all paperwork from GLOCK, case, GLOCK mag loader, cleaning brush and rod, 2 10 round magazine with pierce grip extensions (original GLOCK mag bottoms included, same size just not moulded for your finger) 1 9 round flush fit magazine and one Desantis Mini Slide holster with adjustable retention.  The Firearms has also had a ""Factory Cleanup"" done at Springer Precision as soon as I bought it. (I do this to all my automatics when I buy them).  The factory cleanup basically consists of deburring and polishing by hand all the surfaces, polishing feed ramp, smoothes out the trigger and less friction on the slide/frame since the surfaces are consistent.

$590 for the entire package.

I’m selling it reluctantly, but she-who-must-be-obeyed says it has to go if I want to equip the eldest with a competition rifle. So here we go…

This is a single-shot, break action combo with a .22 rifle barrel and a .410 shotgun barrel. The rifle barrel has relatively nice partridge sights and obviously can take .22 short as well (a nice feature for noise levels). The shotgun barrel is smoothbore with the customary front bead sight. The trigger breaks cleanly at 5.5 lbs, which I have found to be good for kids learning safety. It’s not a target trigger, obviously, but these aren’t target sights either and it does teach control. 

I’m also including an extra-short buttstock I made. Some of these “youth” stocks apparently have rather large youths in mind. Young girls frequently need something shorter, and in this case it is included. It is easy to change with a ½” socket on an extension. Another benefit of this is that the shorter stock allows for a substantial recoil pad for learning shotgun. It is good to avoid teaching kids to flinch! (That part isn’t included, but any strap-on recoil pad should work.) 

This combo has very few rounds through it, mostly because we ended up spending so much more time with an air rifle. Consequently it is in very nice shape. It also comes with a well-thought-out padded nylon carry case. Maybe now would be a good time to think ahead toward the holidays? Or a first hunting season? 

The usual legal nonsense…Face to face only, bill of sale and WI driver’s license required.

""THE SL8-6
A revolutionary rifle design—the HK SL8-6 is constructed almost entirely of a reinforced carbon-fiber polymer. Based on the combat-proven G36 rifle used by the German Army, the SL8-6 uses a proven short stroke, piston-actuated gas operating system, well known for simplicity and reliability.

Designed and engineered to deliver exceptional shooting performance, the SL8 is a favorite among European target shooters, due in large part to its modular construction and free-floating bull barrel. A short Picatinny rail mount is standard and allows accessory optics to be easily added. Made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process, the SL8-6 barrel ensures accuracy and long life. The ergonomic and clean lines of the HK SL8-6 are functional and modern, giving the SL8-6 the look and feel of a 21st century firearm.

It has wood grips and a pachmyer forend. I have added some info on the 357 max.

The .357 Maximum, formally known as the .357 Remington Maximum or the .357 Max, is a super magnum handgun cartridge originally developed by Elgin Gates as the wildcat .357 SuperMag.[1] The .357 Maximum was introduced into commercial production as a joint-venture by Remington Arms Company and Ruger in 1983 as a new chambering for the Ruger Blackhawk.[2] Shortly thereafter, Dan Wesson Firearms and Thompson/Center Arms introduced firearms in this cartridge. United Sporting Arms chambered it in their Silhouette series single-action revolvers. It is a .357 Magnum case lengthened .300"".[3] Based on the .357 Magnum cartridge, a revolver or single-shot pistol designed for the .357 Max can fire .357 Magnum, and .38 Special rounds. Intended primarily as a silhouette cartridge, such high velocity and energy levels have hunting applications.[2] SAAMI pressure level for this cartridge is set at 48,000 CUP.[2]

Despite stellar performance, the high pressure and velocity of the cartridge caused flame cutting of revolver top straps (due to the use of light 110 and 125 grain bullets), and the cartridge has since been dropped by all manufacturers who so chambered their revolvers.[4] Single shot pistols and rifles (e.g., Thompson/Center Contender) are still available in this caliber, and remain popular among handloaders.[2] Unprimed brass is still produced every few years by Remington."

OK details about the Kimber and its story. I am the 3rd owner of this gun. I know the other 2 owners, they are coworkers. The first owner sold it before he filed for divorce from his wife. He was more of a collector when it came to 1911's. I actually tried to buy it then, but missed out. The second owner only had it for a few months. He bought it with thoughts of it being his daily carry. However he is a long time competition shooter and did not care for the shorter grip and barrel. He went back to a full size 1911 for his daily carry. That is when I bought it. I carried it a lot. Its a sweet looking gun. The all satin black gun with satin chrome controls and the rosewood crimson trace grips just make it look like something special. I have never seen this color configuration from Kimber, but the original owner says he bought it that way either from gander mountain or buds gun shop. He can't remember. To his best memory he bought it new about 3 years ago. I had the gun appraised at The Sportsmans stop in Elmore, Ohio. He did mention that it was most likely a special order because of the color configuration. The front checkering is an insert that goes under grips from side to side it is an add on.

OK the gun Kimber Ultra Carry II 45acp with Crimson Trace Rosewood grips 
3"" barrel 
7+1 magazines 
Original case 
I have had no feeding or ejecting issues with the gun at all. I have ran quite a few different FMJ ammo through it and 3 or 4 types of JHP. I may have put 150 rounds through it myself. The second owner loaded it with Hornady Critical Defence shot 1 or 2 mags reloaded the one mag and carried it. From what the original owner tells me he shot a few boxes of FMJ through it to brake it in and then a box of federal hydrashocks. So total round count on the gun? My guess is 450-650.

The firearm has been Dura-Coated with a Coyote Tan and Green Camouflage pattern.  Before Dura-Coating several of my tactical rifles I did this little handgun for practice.  It turned out quite nice.   

The handgun does have a lighter spring for lighter double action trigger pull, which makes it nice for an inexpensive carry gun or back-up.  

It has a cracked left panel on the grip but it has been repaired from the inside and it’s solid.  Grip panels and parts are very inexpensive if someone wishes to replace.   It makes a good inside the vehicle gun as a back-up piece for personal protection, with your Carry Permit of course.  It also makes a good inexpensive carry piece for those on a budget.   

The gun is dated with a 1976 production date and is a surplus firearm from Poland.    It’s a great little shooter highly accurate and fun.   Handgun comes with 2 mags, over 60 rounds of 9x18mm, and a nice soft case.

History of the P-64:  

The P-64 pistol (official designation 9 mm pistolet wz. 1964) has been developed in Poland during late 1950s and early 1960s, as a compact and lightweight replacement for Tokarev TT pistols, manufactured in Poland under soviet license. Following the Soviet road, Poland replaced the powerful 7.62x25mm ammunition with less powerful, but still effective 9x18 Makarov ammunition. P-64 has been used by both Polish military and police, and still could be found in holsters of some Polish police officers. In military service it has been superseded in mid-1980s by the P-83 pistol. The P-64 was small and light enough for a pocket or a concealed carry sidearm, but it has too small magazine, and too heavy trigger pull to be considered as a valuable service pistol.

P-64 is a blowback operated, semi-automatic weapon, made almost entirely of steel. P-64 is hammer fired, with double-action trigger and de-cocking safety, mounted at the left side of the slide. Safety features also include loaded chamber indicator in the form of a small pin, which protrudes from the back of the slide, above the hammer, when chamber is loaded with cartridge. Trigger guard is a separate unit, which is hinged to the frame and served as a disassembly lever when pulled down. Single stack magazine contains only 6 rounds, and magazine release catch is located at the bottom of the grip.

The GAP round features a shorter case than traditional 45 ACP resulting in the ability to use a smaller frame and grip to house the magazine. However, a smaller case does not equal less stopping power. The GAP operates at higher pressure than the ACP providing results on par with the traditional load.

This particular GEN 3 G37 has an extremely low round count and is basically new.  Unfortunately, the box and papers were lost so what you see in pictures is what is available.  It is outfitted with a Glock adjustable rear sight and Glock extended slide release. It comes with two 10 round magazines and enough Magtech 230gr JHP rounds to load them both.

OK details about the Kimber and its story. I am the 3rd owner of this gun. I know the other 2 owners, they are coworkers. The first owner sold it before he filed for divorce from his wife. He was more of a collector when it came to 1911's. I actually tried to buy it then, but missed out. The second owner only had it for a few months. He bought it with thoughts of it being his daily carry. However he is a long time competition shooter and did not care for the shorter grip and barrel. He went back to a full size 1911 for his daily carry. That is when I bought it. I carried it a lot. Its a sweet looking gun. The all satin black gun with satin chrome controls and the rosewood crimson trace grips just make it look like something special. I have never seen this color configuration from Kimber, but the original owner says he bought it that way either from gander mountain or buds gun shop. He can't remember. To his best memory he bought it new about 3 years ago. I had the gun appraised at The Sportsmans stop in Elmore, Ohio. He did mention that it was most likely a special order because of the color configuration. The front checkering is an insert that goes under grips from side to side it is an add on.

OK the gun Kimber Ultra Carry II 45acp with Crimson Trace Rosewood grips 
3"" barrel 
7+1 magazines 
Original case 
I have had no feeding or ejecting issues with the gun at all. I have ran quite a few different FMJ ammo through it and 3 or 4 types of JHP. I may have put 150 rounds through it myself. The second owner loaded it with Hornady Critical Defence shot 1 or 2 mags reloaded the one mag and carried it. From what the original owner tells me he shot a few boxes of FMJ through it to brake it in and then a box of federal hydrashocks. So total round count on the gun? My guess is 450-650.

824,http://www.armslist.com/posts/477824,For Sale:  22LR conversion for 1911 by Tactical Solutions,"Lexington, Lexington, Kentucky",$ 330,"Listed On: Monday, August 6, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Includes original box
Complete slide
1x 10 round magazine
(gun for reference, not included in price)
http://www.tacticalsol.com/tshome/2211-1911-22lr-conversion

Popular for practice on your 1911.  Learn your trigger with $.04 a round instead of $.40.  Milled from solid metal to keep the same weight as your original 1911 slide.  Good for holster draw practice and aim with the same gun weight.
Works great on RIA 45, slide lock >83% of the time.  Slide lock does not function as well on a frame with a tight slide fit like the Doublestar 1911.  However, it will punch the 10-ring all day long on both platforms.

Note: image with gun has threaded barrel, the one I am selling does not.  Image is just for reference only to see how it fits the 1911

I will not respond to low ball offers.  Local Lexington pickup only.
Thanks for looking."

 The .357 with CC grips is worth over $600 (the grips cost over $200 new) but I have it listed for a measly $550. 

The AK-47 has only had a few hundred rounds through it. 

You can see a video of me shooting it (unsupported but still mostly hitting) 100 + yrd 10-inch steel targets @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGRjjrxKbG8&feature=plcp  My son and I both were hitting a 12 inch steel plate at 200 yards. This is a great rifle but I have 7.62x39 weapons and am a big fan of that caliber but I want a RRA SOCOM upper to hunt with this year. It is listed for $395 firm. 

So the Ruger is $550 firm (comes in orig. box, with speed loader, owners manual and holster and lock); $395 for the AK47 with a spare magazine and $275 for the camera and accessories.

NOW BEFORE CONTACTING ME... PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...

===================================================

When I first came on Armslist I sold a gun or two and bought a couple with no problems. Beginners luck! At that time I would come across ads with fine print like I am about to write and think... ""Wow, what a grumpy attitude.""

Since then I have had my time wasted over and over by people who boldly make offers and as soon as they are accepted disappear or begin modifying them. 

You are free to make whatever offer you feel is fair and we can talk about it. But, as a matter of principle, once I agree to an offer, I will not budge an inch. Period. 

Please don't make an offer you don't have the money to cover. I just don't get it. What is the point?

If you offer a fair price and I accept it, don't just assume I would have taken less. I don't tend to dicker around a lot. 

Please do your research before making an offer. I am not offended when someone contacts me and says, ""Hey, I can buy this from www.acmeguns.com (or whatever) for $XXX."" Prices vary and recently I found I really was asking too much for a gun given what they currently sell for elsewhere new. I adjusted the price. However, please, please, please make sure the price you quote are for IN STOCK guns. Gun dealers can put any crazy price they want on OUT OF STOCK GUNS! Also make sure you add in transfer, shipping and handling fees if they apply. Anyone can put a cheap price on the tag if they are going to recoup the discount on the way out the door. Just saying... don't get in too big of a rush to say you can get it somewhere else cheaper when you really cannot. 

I prefer FTF deals. I will absorb no part of shipping including my gas. (Plan on adding about $35 to the price) I will not send until I have money in my hand. No exceptions. If you send a check, it has to clear before I ship. Sorry but that's the deal. 

If you want to offer a trade, send clear pictures of your item(s) to REDACTED Please understand that my goal in considering a trade will most likely be to obtain something I can get MORE money (MORE than $550) to apply to the purchase of the SOCOM upper. So don't be offended if I say no to an otherwise ""fair"" trade, okay? (Why else would I go to the trouble of doing a trade for something I have to re-list etc?

BOTTOM-LINE All I hope for is that folks will be fair and act responsibly. I can promise you this, once I say, text or email the word DEAL ... that's it. I was raised that your word is your bond and I have been offered better deals after accepting an offer and it doesn't turn my head. Once I sold a rifle and then discovered the sight on it was worth over half my asking price by itself. I should have done more research ... my bad... out the door it went. Somethings (like your name or character) are more important than money but hey, not all of us were raised the same and I have plenty of faults of my own. 

Thanks for looking and all the best to you."

I have decided to sell both, upgrade to something along the lines of a Mk4 or NF and use a Larue QD mount. 

Im in town for a week or so and can meet FTF while I'm in the area. I go back to Colorado soon but I will leave ad up, prices include priority/insured shipping if applicable

Weaver Tactical 3-15x50mm
FFP
Mil-dot reticle
1/4 MOA adjustments with locking turrets
Side focus
Comes with 30mm medium Mk4 rings
$650

FFP
Illuminated MOA reticle (EBR-1 MOA if you go to Midway or the Vortex site and look)

Both are slightly used. The Weaver has seen about 50 rounds on my Rem 700 and the Vortex is around 200 rounds on my LRB M25. Both will come with the rings listed. I can possibly switch rings if someone prefers the Mk4 over Burris or vice versa. I would prefer not to as the Weaver is still mounted.
