One of the many challenges facing Standard Products was where to obtain the personnel necessary to manufacture their M1 Carbines. Port Clinton, Ohio was a rural area with other wartime industries competing for a workforce. Early in WWII units were commonly made up of enlisted personnel from the same towns and counties. At the Battle of Bataan units made up of male residents of the Port Clinton area were wiped out by the Japanese. The few survivors who survived became POW's whose next challenge was the Bataan Death March and all that followed. 
When Standard Products announced they needed employees to manufacture M1 Carbines, the call was answered by the wives, parents, grandparents and siblings who had lost loved ones at Bataan. Many of these workers already had jobs elsewhere. When an evening shift was started to boost carbine production, many residents stepped forward and took on the second job."

If you think your intelligent enough to purchase a rifle then you should be smart enough to get on the internet and research the price of the rifle. Thats called personal responsbility, something thats lacking in this country for quite some time. Its my option to price my rifle at any price I think the market will bear. If someone wants it bad enough or is ignorant enough to overpay for it than thats on them not me. Its called Capitalism. I do not feel sorry for ignorant people. If Ipurchase a rifle for 500.00 and want to sell it on here for 2,000 dollars as long as I advertise it correctly thats my option. Thats why this country is in the shape its in, we have a abundance of ignorant people that the government coddles like children. I have no compassion for someone that has overpaid for a gun. Do your homework, or maybe you shouldn't own a firearm if your that ignorant."

It is pretty simple buy what you want and shop around. Too many people do not know about the firearms at Wally World and get ripped off by dealers and kitchen table dealers. Armslist isn't a message board, to those of you who want to bitch and complain take to another board unless of course you have something to loose by people knowing about these guns?"

I can buy a new one at local shops for $450 to $500. So I don't want to spend more than $400 on one used. I'm not a fan of the RTF, and I want a rail for any accessories. So that's why I want a 3rd generation. I do have a carry permit, and I can legally buy a firearm."

Picked this up a while back used and never hav put anything in it so decided I must not need it. Previous owner used it well. These are listed as gun ""safes"" when you search them online but I think it's more like a ""cabinet"" or ""locker"". The door is pretty sturdy but the sides and back are thin sheet metal like a school locker. It has a barrel key. More for keeping kids out and such than making guns impossible to be stolen."

Remington 1100 12 gauge semi automatic shotgun.
Built: 2008

I took in trade and added to it overall:

The entire shotgun has been black dura a coated by Don Dobb- he is registered on the dura coat web page

I have added:

1) Wilson fire site front red fiber optic post

2) Rear site is the standard graduated site-I have had it re blued and the small bolts replaced with new ones

The sites sit upon a Remington 20 inch open cyl barrel

I have added:

1)  Choate + 3 mag extension-it also has been black dura a coated

2)  GGS sling point on the front of the mag extension

3)  Over sized choate bolt handel 

4)  Choate orange shell follower ( nylon)

5)  Front and rear checkered Remington (actual) stock set with sling point on buttstock

6)  Tacstar 6 rnd side saddle

I have had the shotgun cleaned and inspected by a smith and then re assembled + bore sighted by the same smith-I have yet to fire it but was told it will be 'on paper' at 75 yards- this guys works on all my guns/trades that I take in and has been good so far.

In the buttstock are the following parts

1) 11 spare new rubber gaskets
2) Original Front brass site
3) Wrenches for the side saddle

The 11 gas rings should last a very long time-I never exhausted any on my previous 1100's so this is just cheap insurance-The spare front site is just good to have


There are a few scratches in the dura coat-one on the rear of the Front site-one on the tip of the barrel and a few around the base of the trigger Assembly-that's it.Over all just a simple souped up 1100!. I have not fired since completion as its been my intention to sell to fund another project.

With the duracaot and all new parts I have about 650$ into it, and would like to see 575$-shipped to your FFL-OR OBO for a FTF in VA!

OR

Would trade for a like equipped Benelli Nova pump 12G -would also consider a used Benelli M1 ( tactical theme) with cash on either end


Please let me know if you have any questions, you will get a honest answer-Note however that the pics I took are about as good as it gets- I have a bad camera, but when I saved these pics to desk top, I was able to zoom in without difficulties.

As noted, this is a good over all souped up 1100 that I am honestly sure any one could spend the time and money to build up, I am just doing the work for you and taking a loss on parts and service.

We start the build with a Cylinder & Slide Tactical II action certifed RC 57 hardness tuned and polished to achieve a crisp 3# pull actuated by a STI carbon/titanium match trigger which allows for super quick reset. EGW CNC machined tool steel parts make up the thick flange carry bevel barrel bushing with .0005"" tolerance to slide and matched mono spring plug, GI guide rod, firing pin, extractor, thumb safety, hi catch mag release, and grip scews. The accuracy comes from a Kart NM barrel with .001"" or better tolerance to bushing and a .055"" radial lug lockup riding on a forged 10-8 performance .200"" diameter slide stop to ensure durability and consistent lock-up. The Wilson Combat grip safety has a beautiful fit which transitions seamlessly to the frame. Slide and extractor are blended perfectly to the frame. Feedramp and rails are polished and cold blued to ensure low friction. Barrel was also cold blued to ensure finish wear does not decrease lock-up in the future. All external parts have been Cerakoted with an H-series black graphite finish. The sights are Harrison-Design fixed rear sights with ramped front sight blended to slide. All springs are ISMI with a 14lb recoil due to lighter weight slide and heavier frame. Comes with case, 2 magazines w/ bump stops, and 4oz bottle of special high-tolerance weapons oil. This 1911 is built with the finest American made products found for the 1911 and would easily cost $2699.95 or more having it built. I would like to offer the Tactical Recon for a low price of $1700.00

Chamber: 9x19mm Luger/Parabellum
Weight: 845 g empty; 1285 g loaed
Length: 216 mm
Barrel length: 136 mm
Capacity: 18 rounds

The development of the GB pistol was started by Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG (now Steyr-Mannliher AG), Austria, in the early 1970s, when the Austrian army announced its plans to replace aging P38s and High Powers with the new pistol. Original design, labelled as PI-18, was developed in 1974, and final version, called GB, entered production in 1981. The production of the GB was ceased circa 1988, after some 15.000 to 20.000 pistols had been produced.

The GB is a blowback-operated, gas-retarded blowback semi auto pistol. It uses some of the hot powder gases, feed from the barrel into the front part of the slide, to slow down the retraction of the slide before the bullet leave the barrel. This scheme was developed by German engineer Barnitzke at the end of the WW2. The gas brake is formed by the barrel, its bushing and the slide.
The trigger of the GB is of double action design, with the slide mounted decocker lever. GB also featured firing pin block that unlocks the firing pin only when the trigger is completely depressed.
The frame and the slide is made from carbon steel with special high-strenght finish. Barrel has polygonal rifling and is chrome lined, and solidly attached to the frame.
The sights are fixed and featured white-dot inserts (one in the front sight blade and two - around the rear sights notch).
Some early GBs were manufactured with steel grip panels, with all the rest manufactured with plastic checkered grips.

Thanks to its gas-retarded blowback design and solid weight, that resulted in low felt recoil, and to the barrel with polygonal rifling, that toesn't move when firing, the Steyr GB displayed wery good accuracy. The reliability is also adequate, at least. While the GB failed at the Austrian and USA Army pistol trials (won respectively by Glock 17 and Beretta 92FS-B), it was used by some Law Enforcement and Special Operations forces, and also was sold to civilians in Europe and USA."

I have a Yugo M59 SKS in my possession that I may be looking to trade for another gun. This is the NOT the M59/66 variant. This rifle came out before that, and was never mounted with a grenade launcher. This rifle is in GOOD condition, according to the NRA condition standards. There is some minor bluing wear, and a spot on the magazine where it looks like an overworked and underpaid Yugoslav messed up the electro-penciling. It wasn't uncommon for the older M59s to be refurbished, and this one is no exception. There is a 1.TRZ stamped on the stock to indicate this was. The serial number on the receiver differs from all the others, and the bore is in very good condition and not dark at all. It is possible that this rifle was re-barreled and shot very little afterwards. Stock is in solid condition, but does have handling marks on it from use/storage, just like any other milsurp rifle. No rounds have been fired out of this rifle since it has been taken out of cosmo. Questions/inquiries are welcome."
