This Revolver is in excellent Shape and in the original box. Please note that the box is torn on one end. The Colt Diamondback is a revolver manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, in calibers of .22 LR, .22 WMR and .38 Special. Colt introduced the double-action Diamondback as a deluxe model. It had a wide serrated target hammer, ventilated rib, fully adjustable target quality sights, and full-length barrel underlug. It is a 6-shot revolver with a swing out cylinder and was available in blue or nickel finishes. Visually, the Diamondback resembles a scaled down version of the Python. Because of the light recoil of .22 caliber ammunition, the .22 version of the Diamondback can be used as a training gun for novice shooters. It has also gained popularity with gun enthusiasts due to the inexpensive price of .22 caliber ammunition. Please Contact Clay at (336) 401-0209 if any questions. Inspired by the successful Colt Python, the Diamondback was manufactured from 1966 to 1988 and was available in barrel lengths of 2Â½, 4, and 6 inches.["

It is in like new condition, shoots great, with everything from the factory. This one is priced to sell, New these shotguns sell for $540.

TriStar's NEW TEC 12 Pump/Auto Home Defense 12ga Shotgun is nothing short of amazing.  This shotgun is designed to utilize two actions on the same frame.  The TEC 12 is capable of operating in PUMP mode and in Semi-Auto mode by just the turn of a dial.  The 3"" Chambered TEC 12 uses an inertia Rotary Bolt for smooth action response (in semi-auto). Finished in Matte Black and features a picatinny rail mounted on the receiver, ghost ring sight and raised front bridge sight with a fiber optic bead, black synthetic stock with rubber fixed pistol grip, plus 1 set of military sling swivels and one set of swivel studs installed.  Includes an External Ported Cylinder Choke and is backed by TriStar's 5 Year Warranty.

Preferred by Law Enforcement and Military, the Idea behind the Pump/Semi Auto is that some lighter loads do not cycle well in Semi Autos.  This shotgun gives you the option to switch to whatever action suits the round of your choice with a flick of the switch. In case of a malfunction you can switch to pump to clear the chamber.

It's unfired, all black, has 1 pmag, and the factory soft case. As much as I like AR's, I hate having almost $2300 bucks in a rifle I can't go deer hunting with. What I'm really looking for is a cheaper AR like a Bushmaster, Core 15, Windham etc in .556 to go plinking with. I know there's a bunch of people that have settled for the less expensive models because that's all they can get their hands on at the retails stores lately.

So here's the deal, if you've got a NIB AR, or even a slightly used one (like 1 mag run through it to sight it in) in perfect condition that you have the receipt on, show me the receipt, pay me the difference between $2253 ($2100 + tax is what I paid at a Wichita gun store), we swap guns and away you go with a Black Rain. I don't need your optics, additional mags, ammo, sling, or other acc. We only swap what came with the rifle new. If you've got the box, sweet, but not a deal breaker. I'll only swap AR to AR, no AK's, or other tactical models. And NO, I don't want to trade for tools or an 89 Chevy Pickup.

If you're not familiar with Black Rain AR's, check out their website. These are top end high quality rifles.

I'd like to keep my total dollars in an AR below $1500. Current retail pricing from local Wichita gun shops only is what I'll consider. If you got hosed on Gunbroker and paid $1500 for an $800 rifle-sorry can't help you. I'm not dead set on any particular model to trade for so let me know what you've got.

If this interests you, shoot me a picture/e-mail about what you have and I'll send you some pictures of my Black Rain. I'm going to be in and out of data range the next couple of days so I might be a little slow responding to e-mail-but I will respond.

Face to face transaction in Wichita only.

Thanks!"

Additional Info:
Insight Technology's AN/PSQ-18 Day Night Sight (DNS) is an enhanced weapon sight and fire-control system designed for the M203 400 mm Automatic Grenade Launcher (AGL). The DNS provides improved firing accuracy over the current quadrant and leaf sight systems for both point and area targets, from 35 to 400 m. Advanced worm gear technology coupled to a real-time data display allows for quick and accurate adjustment in 5 m increments.The DNS attaches to the M203, sliding over the barrel and connecting to the launcher tube to maximise boresight accuracy. It comes with an additional MIL-STD-1913 rail interface, which can be attached to either the top or side of the unit for the use of optical sights or laser aiming devices.For night operation, the DNS incorporates two co-aligned infra-red lasers for precise aiming and target illumination. The DNS provides cant information to the operator, and, in day mode, a bi-colour LED illuminates green when the DNS is oriented vertically and red when canted left or right. During night operations, conducted with Night-Vision Goggles (NVG), the DNS aiming laser will pulsate when canted and will become steady when vertically oriented.A mechanical range scale provides manual adjustment in 20 m increments for firing without a battery or in backup mode. The M203 AGL retains its rate-of-fire of five to seven rounds per minute. The operator can select from five operational modes and has been tested against US Military environmental specifications."

All major metal components on the USP are corrosion-resistant. Outside metal surfaces are protected by H&Kâs proprietary âhostile environmentâ nitride finish. Internal metal parts are coated with a Dow Corning anti-corrosion chemical to reduce friction and wear.

The gunmaker tested the MK23â²s recoil system with over 30k rounds of +P ammunition followed by 6k high pressure proof rounds. After disassembling the gun the Germans found no damage or excessive wear to any of the components.

And then they did some more tests . . .

The ballistic boffins froze the USP to â42 Â°C (â43.5 Â°F), fired it and then frozen it again. They heated it to 67 Â°C (152.6 Â°F) and fired it. They cycled between these extremes several times. They subjected USP to standard NATO mud and rain abuse. They immersed it in water and sprayed it with sea water. They dropped it from six feet, hammer first, onto a steel-backed concrete slab.

H&K employees deliberately lodged a bullet in the barrel and then sent another one down the pipe. The second bullet cleared the obstruction producing only a minor bulge in the barrel. They loaded a full magazine and then fired the gun again with the bulging barrel. The resulting group measured less than 4 inches of deviation at 25 meters â a standard that some new guns would be lucky to hold.

In short, Heckler & Koch , The selected gun by the US Seal Teams."

REVIEWS:
First field test of the SR556- Sheridan, Wyoming. Ruger factory sponsored prairie dog hunt. We were privileged to attend the hunt, and an Impact employee was the first to take an animal with the SR556 rifle!

Function and reliability were 100%. The dog town we were shooting at had dogs out to 360 yards. All ranging was done using the new Ziess 8x binoculars with range and holdover function. Even with a low 10x scope, dogs were taken all the way out to 361 yards. Very impressive for any rifle, and even more so for a carbine!

We were shooting Hornady TAP ammo, 55g, loaded into the P-Mags that are included with each rifle. Effect on the targets was devastating. Multiple hits and complex gymnastics by the dogs were the norm.

All in all, our experience with the SR556 was beyond our expectations. The gas system gives the gun a softer recoil that a standard gas AR, and the chamber/bolt area was much cleaner that a gas AR. This SR556 is a keeper, and a really good value with all the good kit that is part of the base rifle.

We have sold literally hunderds of the Ruger SR556 rifles. They are incredibly reliable and several of our customers report that even after thousands of rounds (some without cleaning) they have not experienced a single malfunction! 

If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.

The snowmobile is currently on consignment at a shop in Marlboro, VT. I'm starting to see some interest coming in. It might go fast for the cash price I'm asking ($1600). Get in touch with me soon if you are interested. If the ad is still up, I still have it.

Shop installed bar-risers with the cable lengthen kit. Having the handle bars up a few inches like this is a must if you like to stand up through the bumps.

It looks a little dirty in the photos from being stored and the trailer ride. I'll get it cleaned up before you come to see it.

I can't think of anything wrong with this machine, except maybe that the windshield had some stickers on it and they have been removed. Some of the sticker residue was left behind. You might be able to clean it off with the right product, or, I think a new windshield is under $100.

 This may be your last chance. I was in a local firearms retailer this week. There backlog of AR orders is 38. Yes 38 and that was 1 out of 5 or 6 local stores. So imagine how many are on backorder across this great country? They said before the last 2 months they were receiving and selling 10 or so AR style rifles per week and now they are only receiving 1-2 per week, if any. So getting on a backorder list is far from a guarantee as they could be BANNED before you would receive one."

If all ammo is purchased, I will sell it all for $2400.  I am in the Plainfield/Naperville area.  FTF is preferable.  Illinois sales will only be to a FOID holder.  I will ship this ammo - buyer pays actual UPS and ORM-D costs to ship.  Will only ship to legal states.

I may consider trades of significant value.  I will only respond if you include your phone number with your inquiry.

Thanks for looking."

Like new in box. This is built on the beefiest stamped receiver on the market, a 1.6mm DC Industries receiver. This is one of the most solidly built AKs I have held.  Take a minute to Google the DC Industries receiver and the Century M70 and you'll go through pages of results and basically see nothing but good reviews. This is a solid rifle it's in great condition, it's an underfolder and it looks cool. Not canted. The stock is very tight--no wobble. I have not fired the rifle but previous owner reported he had fired 23 rounds since purchasing it in 2007 from a valley gun store. It's clean and shows little to no wear so what he says fits with what I see.

I bought this as part of a package deal and although I think it's a nice weapon it's not exactly what I want and so I'd like to offer it for sale. Asking $1000 OBO. I'm mainly looking for cash but would consider a trade that included a decent AK74 or Mossberg 590 (pistol grip), with cash going either way to square a deal depending on what all is included. Please shoot me an email with a contact # if you're interested. Thanks.

Private sale but you must have an AZ driver license and be legally able to own this weapon. No felons no weirdos no tweakers.

Once you BUY/OWN a Lancer AWF Mag....you will throw away your PMAGS!

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips wonât bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

Do some homework and you will figure out this is the BEST MAG MADE!

Description:
Clean-burning propellants provide maximum velocities and maximum energy transfer on impact

This is the legendary CCI Maxi-Mag that is renowned for its effective target and hunting performance. Newly manufactured by CCI, this product is sure to provide many hours of fun and effective hunting with a hard-hitting load. This round is also great for target practice or plinking.

Each bullet is gilded (coated) with a thin copper plating to reduce muzzle build-up and to help the bullet retain its shape during feeding (into the chamber), flight, and to some degree, impact."

500 rds (full case) FN SS198 5.7x28 Green Tip 27Gr Penetrator (banned to buy retail - LE & military only, legal to own)
500 rds (don't have the case, but full case) FN SS197 5.7x28 Blue Tip 40Gr (hard to find right now)
840 rds (factory ammo can on stripper clips) Lake City M196 5.56 Nato Tracers 


The FN ammo is new factory fresh.  From my FN distributor - the EARLIEST civilians will see the next batch of ammo is May - and that if if you can get some.  Military and LEare taking it all.  The 5.56 is Lake City surplus.  

I have determined the following prices based on GB (leading online auction site) auction prices.  My prices are below the average closing price.  This ammo will be for sale locally for 3-4 days, and if not gone, will sell on GB for these prices.  Search for these rounds and watch what a few auctions go for or look at the buy it now prices.

SS198 - $1250 (the price is going up on all sites - none for 4-6 months)
SS197 - $700 (the price is going up on all sites - none for 2-4 months)
5.56 - $550

If all ammo is purchased, I will sell it all for $2400.  I am in the Plainfield/Naperville area.  FTF is preferable.  Illinois sales will only be to a FOID holder.  I will ship this ammo - buyer pays actual UPS and ORM-D costs to ship.  Will only ship to legal states.

I still have the case and the original paperwork too.  It will also come with a stainless steel guide rod (that's an upgrade from the plastic stock rod).

This is a well cared for pistol.  I've gone so far as to polish some of the moving surfaces for a smoother action and less friction when feeding/firing.  This pistol has never failed me.

I can send pic's for those truly interested.  I'm looking for a trade only, no cash.  The only other thing I would consider besides a G17 Gen 3 is gold.  If trading gold for guns then we can maybe talk about me adding a box or two of ammo.

If you're looking for a 26 this could be your only chance for awhile.  Glock is at least 10 months behind in back orders due to current events and the re-elected Marxist."
