Ruger SR556c. This is the short barrel carbine version with the flash hider machined into the barrel. It has the chrome carrier, chrome lined barrel, and the flip up sights. It is in great condition and has only been fired around 500 times. It has excelent accuracy and is a lot of fun to shoot and great for hunting.

I have installed the PWS Enhanced Buffer Tube, Mil-Spec. This buffer tube eliminates carrier tilt and reduces recoil. Here is the companies web site for more info on the buffer tube. http://primaryweapons.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=214&idcategory=21

Includes all 3 magpul 30 round magazines, owners manual, and the tactical bag that came with the rifle.

It's basically the same. These rifles were going for $1800 - $2000 new. These rifles were imported into the county until the president signPed an executive order as of april 1998 stopping all importation of the so called post ban rifles , including the AUG. USR. That started the prices rising again for the post ban USR""s. These rifles are going from $2300 to what ever you are willing to pay. Very few were imported to the US to start , so if you see an AUG. for a great price ( you can hope ) pick one up. I have not personally fired the AUG. family of rifles , but what i had heard from many people is that the AUG. is a very reliably rifle.I had a chance to purchase a pre ban AUG back in 90 for the sum of $1300.00 with six mag""s in mint condition. If i can only go back in time!!!!!!!! Please E Mail me with any likes and dislikes of the AUG family of rifles call REDACTED Jim"

This one does include the famous ""gill"" slide serrations. Essentially its a precursor to the gen4, but with gen 3 internals in addition to the gen 3 sized grip with aggressive texture.  I bought it expecting to transition to the Glock family and wanted the texture without the Gen 4 (has't been vetted long enough for me to buy into it) however I do not foresee myself transitioning to it as my serious use/training/nightstand firearms. As Such I figured would through my hat in the ring and see if anyone out there is interested in a Glock variant that is getting a little harder to find these days. 

Details:
-Glock 17 RTF2 with just under 100 WWB rounds through it, includes 2 factory mags, box, lock, bore brush and paperwork (everything it came with)
-PEW prefix serial number (11-29-2010 test fire date)
-Not looking to travel to far from the Springs, but feel free to contact me we may be able to work something out.
-Price is rather solid as it is like new and I am in no need to move it, however interesting trades are welcome and all trades will be considered (I am thinking I would like to get my hands on an 870 Police or express tactical)

Thank you for taking the time to look, feel free to ask any questions about the firearm, or posit any offers. Pictures will be taken soon and will be available upon request. I will also try to accommodate an photo requests. If interested I will be using a bill of sale with legitimate drivers licence required at the time of sale (to protect you and me, also to act as a receipt), and obviously one should be 21+ with no legal history or reasoning that would prohibit them the legal ownership, possession, and use of firearms."

This is 45 ACP Speer Law Enforcement Grade Gold Dot 185gr. Hollow Point Ammo. Speer Gold Dot Ammunition is designed to deliver the high performance today’s law enforcement officers demand. Each Gold Dot bullet is individually engineered to provide shot-to-shot uniformity and ensure optimum wounding when fired through a variety of barriers. The result is a cartridge that provides officers the ultimate defense in lethal force confrontations. Jacket/core separations are the main cause of bullet failure and a real problem for traditional lead-core, jacketed hollow point bullets. Most bullets perform adequately in soft tissue, but fragment or expand prematurely when obstructed by bone, heavy clothing or any number of other potential real life shooting barriers. Why? Because conventional bullets are made by forcing a lead core into a jacket creating a two-piece bullet design. Gold Dot was the first handgun ammunition to be loaded with high-performance bonded core bullets. SPEER’S superior Uni-Cor® process bonds the jacket to the core one molecule at a time, virtually eliminating core jacket separations. That’s why SPEER Gold Dot is the #1 choice for Law Enforcement Professionals.

This LNIB SA/DA Pistol was bought a few months ago. It sports decocker, loaded chamber indicator, and a crisp trigger.  It has not been carried and has been fired a solid 250 rounds. This gun cost $550 recently at VA ARMS.  Total capacity is 12+1. Comes with original box, blue carrying case, two mags and manual, and two more backstraps. The most accurate compact I have ever shot. The sights work a wonder, it looks and feels futuristic. It solid and durable but a little blocky. The single action is crispy for follow up shots. It would make a great candidate for someones IWB. This is a private sale so just Show me a VA Photo ID letting me know you are a resident of VA, and also verbally affirm to me, that you are a law abiding citizen, eligible to purchase and possess firearms.

Absolutely No trades needed. Just cold hard cash and a speedy transaction.

It has about a box of shells through it and it comes in the box with all the factory goodies that make this an amazing shotgun for the true 870 fan.

Here is a bit about the shotgun:

Weather resistance, durability and functionality are taken to the next level with the introduction of the new Model 870 Xtreme Conditions Shotgun (XCS) Marine Magnum. This gun features 7-round total shot capacity with shell holder stock that can hold up to four additional 2 3/4-inch shells. This rugged, weather-defying 12-gauge, 3-inch capable shotgun features our proprietary TriNyte™ Corrosion Control System, reliable Model 870 pump action platform and many popular utilitarian design features including the convenient SpeedFeed® I shell holder stock. The Model 870 XCS Marine Magnum package begins with the time-proven, solidly-built carbon steel receiver and hammer-forged, smoothbore barrel; both encased in our corrosion and scratch-resistant black TriNyte Corrosion Control System. This extra layer of protection makes the XCS practically immune to the most extreme weather conditions and harsh hunting environments and for maximum corrosion protection, the trigger group components also feature electroless nickel plating. Added durability is provided by the black matte synthetic fore-end and SpeedFeed I stock. This well-designed stock features two magazine tubes molded into the sides of the stock, just behind the pistol grip. With a steel spring in each tube, a simple flick of your finger will release the next shell for quick reloading. With this unique feature, the XCS Marine Magnum is capable of holding four additional 2 3/4-inch shells or two 3-inch shells. With functionality in mind, the Marine Magnum sports an overall black matte finish; compact 18-inch barrel with fixed cylinder choke and single bead sight; 2-shot magazine extension tube for 6+1 total round capacity; patented R3® Recoil Pad which effectively reduces felt recoil over 30% by absorbing and redirecting recoil energy; sling swivel studs; and durable padded sling. When the conditions get tough, the Remington Model 870 XCS Marine Magnum should be your “go to” shotgun"

I have wanted a Taurus Judge for a long time. My wife gave it to me as a gift for office self-defense, snake control, and recreation.  Unfortunately, I forgot to tell her I wanted the 3 inch cylinder Judge. Although they have almost identical ballistics, I am not planning on carrying concealed so I prefer the bigger framed Judge. I am selling this  gun before I ever shoot it so I can buy the 3"" Cylinder Judge.

If you are not familiar with the Taurus Judge, it is capable of firing .45LC AND .410 Shotshells.  This gun is presumably a man stopper at close range.  I will throw in a box of Winchester's .410 PDX1 Self-Defense Ammo as well. This is the best self-defense round for this gun.

This is one of the best running AK variants that you will find on the market today. This ak has some marks and dings. It is a shooter. It has a small amount of very light surface blemishes/rust from being carried, moved around in the safe, and taken out to shoot. It comes equipped with a tapco folding stock, tapco intrafuse handguards, and a black pistol grip. It also has a rail mount that has been welded on top of the dust cover. It is set up for standard weaver mounts. There is no front sight base but these can be found online for cheap. The barrel is threaded and this is the more desirable straight cut receiver. This gun is not perfect but it will serve you well for years to come. The bore is bright and shiny and the rifling is strong. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me. I will consider trades but cash is king. Trades must be extremely worth my while because my asking price is much less than what others are selling for. This baby still shoots like a dream.

And for a rare treat Jefferson Spivey will be there to sign books here are the details:

It was hard to do but it has been confirmed that Jefferson Spivey will be at the Badshot Gun show on the June 23rd & 24th at the Grady County Fairgrounds to sign his books and sell his current production Sabertooth knifes. His real good buddy has collected his original handmade exotic handle Sabertooths for years and from what I am told he has quite a bit several hundred I am told that will be on display at the show.

This is a real treat for people to meet him in person he stopped going to gun shows many years ago and His buddy has not shown his collection to the general public in years as well.

Comes with two adjustable shelves, one drawer and one file cabinet that fits inside. Does not include any ammunition seen in the picture.

Just trying to be upfront and as clear as I can to explain any issues, and if you need more info/pics feel free to contact me. Don't have to sell, and prices are firm and fair. I am in Portland, but come to the Nashville area on occasion so could meet there if I'm heading that way.
