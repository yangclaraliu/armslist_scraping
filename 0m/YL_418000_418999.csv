Brand new in box .243 Remington 700 SPS. I received this rifle from Remington as a result of some customer service issues and have since decided that I do not need a .243. I have never fired this rifle, it may have been factory fired. No scope, though I may be able to throw on a 3-9X40 (older redfield with perfect glass) for an extra 100 bucks. I also have a brand new, still in box, never mounted Nikon Pro Staff BDC 4-12x40 with Leupold bases and rings (also brand new) that I could put with the rifle for 750 total firm. (The scope sells cheapest online for 200 dollars before shipping, bases and rings are another 50 retail)

This scope is also available for sale separately.  

Let me know. .243 is an awesome underrated long range round, and is near perfect for youth hunters, ladies, and first time hunters who don't want the flinchies from jumping right in to a .30 -06.  

I am at work so do not have any pics, but it is the standard version, blued barrel, black and grey stock, Xmark pro adjustable trigger, etc etc. Retails brand new at Cabelas for 599 (back ordered) Gander Mountain for 579, Gun broker has a few for 500 but that does not include shipping or transfer fees."

The MAS-49 rifle, developed by the French state arms factory Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de St-Etienne (MAS), was a logical development of many earlier prototypes, based on the direct gas impingement system, developed by the French designer Rossignol early in the XX century. The same (or very similar) gas system was later used in Swedish Ljungman AG-42 rifle and in Eugene Stoner AR-15 / M16 rifles. France was a major player in the field of automatic rifles since the very beginning. The MAS 44 was improved to accept new, detachable magazines and modified to be able to launch rifle grenades, and then became the MAS-49, or ""Fusil Automatique MAS Modele 1949"".  MAS-1949 (as it was stamped on the receiver), seen heavy combat use in the French Indo-China and Algeria and proved itself accurate and reliable. In 1956, an improved pattern rifle was adopted by Armee de Terre (French Army) as a MAS-1949/56. The MAS-49/56 was lightened, had shorter barrel and forend, different grenade launcher sights and was able to be fitted with spike-shaped bayonet, while MAS-1949 could not be equipped with bayonet. MAS-49/56 served as a first-line weapon with French army until 1979, when it was replaced by the 5.56mm FAMAS assault rifle. The MAS-49 was exported in small numbers to Syria in 1950s, and still can be found in some ex-France territories around the world.

MAS-1949 is a gas operated, semi-automatic, magazine fed rifle. It uses a direct gas impingement system with no gas piston. Instead of the gas piston, the powder gases are fed from the barrel through the gas tube directly to the front face of the bolt carrier. The bolt carrier operates the tilting bolt, which is cammed down to lock into the slot in the receiver floor. The dual stack, box magazine is detachable and rifle can be reloaded with replacement magazines, but it also featured a stripper clips guides, machined into the front of the bolt carrier, so magazine could be reloaded by using two 5-round stripper clips without removal from the rifle. MAS-1949 has a bolt catch, which is engaged by the magazine follower as soon as the last round from magazine is fired. The gas system has a gas cutoff device, which is required to fire the rifle grenades from the muzzle. Special grenade sights are located at the left side of the rifle stock. Standard open sights had a hooded front sight on the front stock band and an aperture (diopter) rear sight on the receiver, which is adjustable for range from 200 to 1200 meters and for windage. All MAS-1949 rifles featured a side rail at the left side of the receiver that allows the telescopic sights to be mounted on every rifle. The safety switch in the form of the cross-bolt push-button is located at the right side of the rifle, at the front of the triggerguard. The large plastic charging handle is attached to the bolt carrier at the right side. Magazine catch built on the side of the detachable box magazine, instead of being mounted on the rifle itself, which is more usual practice. MAS-1949 has no provisions for bayonet mount, but has a stacking hook at the muzzle.

The MAS-1949/56 has shorter barrel and shorter handguards to save weight and made weapon more maneuverable. The grenade launching sights were moved to the barrel, and the gas cutoff switch is mounted at the front of the handguards above the barrel and cannot be engaged when grenade sight is lowered out of use. The barrel is equipped with combination muzzle brake / grenade launching device. Like the MAS-1949, all MAS-1949/56 rifles have the scope rails on the left side of the receiver, and thus could be used as a designated marksmen rifles at the distances up to 600 meters or so."

I just picked this gun up from a buddy who needed the money and never fired it about 3 weeks ago. I put 2 boxes through it and shot amazingly well. I definitely wish I could keep it but with Downhill Mountain Bike season here I need to sell it to get some new gear for the season.

I bought the matching Plano soft case for it the day after I got it and it has been in there ever since. This Shotgun is pretty much brand new. It has never been hunting with and only fired one day. It will shoot 2 3/4"", 3"", and 3 1/2"" shells.

Fired very little then put back in box in climate control safe. They only made 4000 of these and switched to polymer. No lockable features that are seen on newer guns.

With all due respect to Sir Newton, the KRISS engineers have been able to use his law to the shooter’s advantage. Unlike any other firearm ever invented, instead of having all the recoil force slam back into the shooter’s shoulder, causing massive amounts of felt recoil and resultant muzzle climb, the KRISS System absorbs and redirects these forces downward and away from the operator thus enabling him to better control and keep the KRISS firearm on-target. More control equals more rounds on-target, more of the time.

This is the model with the ambidextrous thumb safety, no mag disconnect safety. Excellent condition.

It was bought new in May of last year (2011), I have been the only owner. I had new night sights put on it in June of 2011 shortly after getting it. Smith & Wesson was kind enough to send me a second magazine baseplate with the pinky extension. Includes all of the stuff that came with it new (backstraps, original sights, plastic case, 1 flat magazine baseplate, 2 magazines etc) as well. 

I want to bundle this up with the accessories I have for it. So, included are a custom Zlogonje IWB, its his model 2, in marbled mohogany with a black trim panel, a horizontal magazine carrier, 250 Sellier & Bellot 9mm FMJ, 70 Hornady Critical Defense, 40 Winchester PDX, and another 50 of assorted 9mm FMJ & JHPs.

I don't think I want to split it up, at least for now. Thats not set in stone though, feel free to email...gun just has to go first.

I'm in Steubenville, but I don't mind a moderate drive. Feel free to message me and we can discuss logistics, but I am looking for a FTF to Ohio resident, 21yo+, non-prohibited, etc. Prefer CHL holder.

$600 takes it all. May sound high for an M&P, I know, but if you consider the night sights, the ammo, holster, and mag carrier there's a lot more here.

If you are interested but don't want/need the holster and mag carrier, I can let the everything but those go for $550"

This rifle has only been to the range a half dozen times and has been well cleaned and maintained. 

Here are some pros to this weapon:

- The .223/5.56 is cheaper to fire than other long-range alternatives such as the popular .308 round.
- The versatility and modularity of the AR platform is unmatched if you choose to customize this rifle in the future.
- If you own or plan on owning another AR15, parts and ammunition will be interchangeable with this long-range version.
- The minimal recoil from the smaller round (again in comparison to other common long-range options) allows for comfortable shooting and quick and accurate followup shots.
- 30 round magazine.


My reason for selling this fun toy is that my wife and I are expecting our first child this summer. The time and money normally spent on shooting will need to go elsewhere. I have more pictures if interested. Feel free to text me 24/7 or call me during the day at 8.5.9.5.3.3.2.0.8.9. Serious offers only please and thank you.

Rare French 1895 Chatellerault Berthier Carbine Model 1892 in 8mm Lebel.  This rifle is extremely difficult to find, especially in the US.  It is extra rare due to the fact it did not go through the re-barreling process of the French Army, which most of these rifles did.  This is evident due to the fact it has no “N” stamp on the receiver.

Also included is the original bayonet which would have come with the rifle.  This is also an extremely rare find in the US.  The bayonet is valued at $150.00.

It comes with the following:

1. Bayonet with Scabbard (French Model 1892 Bayonet, Second Pattern)
2. Book on history of rifle and identification of markings and numbers
3. 20 rounds of 8mm Lebel ammo (Prvi) – this ammo is available to order from online retailers

It comes with 2 8 round stainless magazines, factory case, manuals, trigger lock, hang tag, spare black steel guide rod, Kahr swag (pin, catalogs and hat). It has a stainless steel guide rod installed. The serial number indicates that it was built in mid to early 2011 and I have put about 200 rounds through it with no issues at all. The trigger on this pistol is extremely smooth and breaks clean, it features the shorter pull target trigger which lets off about 1/8"" sooner than the standard Kahr trigger. It really is the Cadillac of the Kahr lineup. The small grip on the Kahr series doesnt agree with my hand and shooting stance, this one is really effective as a one handed gun if you have medium/large hands and fits the ladies perfectly. I am really looking for something to use in IDPA, or a really nice carry gun for vacation (and when IL passes CCW)."

For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage). Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs.

bolt body fireing pin whole assembly works but looks like a turd. whoever cut off the original and added this bolt did a bad job on it. i could do better if i found a new bolt handle and ball layin around and weld it to assembly 

looks like the trigger and mag and barrel has all been painted over to, or is not the original finish...

ethier way i got this from a friend who is not the brightestly inclined.... i have not shot it but i pieced it back together since he had a bunch of mosin parts laying around and basicly made this gun from all of them. would be good to use for parts or maybe rebuild and test fire. 

looks like i forgot to mention it has a pitcanny rail above the barrel for attacheing a scope anywho you can call or text me at 1REDACTED if your interested 
i know the value of these 1940's ww2 guns... even thought its been modified the ati stock runs 60-70$ the bolt bodys are 30-40$ and your getting trigger internals mag and internals. so def worth the 100$ if not more even in its condition. i just dont care to clean it up and my buddy gave me it and i dont care much for these guns."

Remington 870 Express Magnum 12 guage- The gun has been used for some upland hunting and waterfowl hunting a few times. Normal wear and tear on the gun, but it is in very good condition. I'd say it is an 8.5-9/10. I also have a Kicks Gobblin' Thunder .655 choke that I'd be willing to sell or trade with the gun.

Ruger 10/22 Carbine- I have only had this 10/22 for a few months. I believe that I purchased it in February and I have only put about 50 rounds of Winchester and CCI ammo through it. I'm willing to add the Bushnell 3-9 scope with it or you can leave it if you'd like. 

I'm looking to trade these two guns for a pistol if I can. I'm willing to add cash for the right deal. I'd be interested in Glocks, Smith & Wesson M&P series, Springfield XD's or XDm's, FNH in 9mm or .40 cal, or I would also entertain a trade for an AR-15 or an upper assembly.

That's why many top 3-gun competitors use this scope.

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semiautomatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. 

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ chrome lined button rifled barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. 

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m.

For those that know, the Chinese made Norinco 1911-A1 is a HIGH QUALITY weapon that is an exact replica of a USGI Colt 1911A1, with one exception. The steel on these Norinco 1911s are made from recycled Railroad Steel!! This steel is EXTREMELY strong (even stronger that the steel used by COLT, Springfield Armory and even Kimber) and makes this pistol perfect for any custom gunsmithing you may wish to have done.

Normally I dislike all Chinese made products but they knocked this one out of the park! You will never have a days trouble with this gun. Do your own research to confirm everything you have read here. You will find that these claims are accurate. DO NOT MISTAKE THIS FOR THE TURKISH-MADE NORINCO 1911. Those are crap! Look at the pics, see the ""Made in China"" right there on the frame. This is a HIGH QUALITY 1911 and it will probably out live you and any abuse you can subject it to.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

Bought new, a little over a year old, good condition except for what is mostly a cosmetic issue. 

I was trying to do a modification to the storage tube inside of the 'gas block' (its not really a gas block and is purely aesthetic, its what would be the gas block on the sig 556) to mount a laser sight in there. Unfortunately, I sheered off a screw tap and haven't been able to get it out due to lacking the proper tools to do so. I also had to cut the storage tube off to allow the front end piece to be snapped back into place as a result. The end result of this whole thing is there is a screw tap snapped off inside of the cosmetic-only "" gas block "" and it no longer has a storage tube. When the front end-cap is in place, you can't tell that anything is wrong.

Function is flawless and I would never have attempted the above if there were any chance that it would effect function. With the proper tools it shouldn't be hard to get the tap out and finish the mod. A cheap laser sight to use for that purpose is included and is mounted on the front rail.

Also includes a foregrip and a total of 3 Sig 26 round magazines and a BSA red dot. Also it has the tri-rails mounted on the front of the grip, these too, are an option and don't come on the gun new. I'll throw in some 22lr ammo as well to get you going in the unlikely event you don't already have a 22lr gun.

This thing has fired every 22lr I have thrown at it. It runs excellently.

This is probably the best of the 'tacticool' 22s, in my opinion. 

Because of the cosmetic issue I'm going to let it go pretty cheap for a Sig 522. First $350 gets it. (They are $450+ New without said accessories.)

I have an M&P listed in the Handguns section too. Whichever goes first wins, I keep the other.

I am in Steubenville but don't mind a moderate drive to meet halfway."

Dr. Winchester says, 
""I want to buy your Old, Rusty, Broken or Fire Damaged Winchester Rifle - Parts missing = OK. Broken, Does Not Work = OK Model, year not important. Older, the better! If you have a project that you will ""get to one day"" and haven't - I want to buy it. I'll use the parts to make another Winchester almost new again! In the medical field you could say that I do ""transplants"" to patients needing a new heart, lung or such. Your old Winchester will live again but in another body. Go now, to the fartherest corner of your shop and dig out that old, tired soldier and send it to me. I'll prepare it for surgery.

I pay CA$H. -or- I have Shotgun Barrels to offer for trade. (choose from 300) I also have over 250 rifle barrels for trade! I might even find a real shootin' gun to trade for yours.""

If you check the msrp on berettausa.com and what they are selling for on gunbroker.com you will see that I took more than enough off to make up for it. I won't ship it, and I am willing to drive somewhere for you to check it out and do the transfer paperwork."

Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

6.  ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY
Warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship."

(TOTAL PRICE $1,700 - Trijicon ACOG NOT INCLUDED)

This is a NEW completely custom built AR15 rifle and requires the normal FFL check/transfer.

This particular build is Duracoated DP Brown and utilizes a Magpul MOE stock and ergo tactical deluxe grip.  I have also added an oversize charging handle latch and a forward vertical grip that can be removed or relocated with a push of a  button.  I installed a standard lower parts kit and the standard trigger group is modified to remove creep and  to allow it to have a cleaner brake when pulled.  It includes 1 20 round pmag.  

On this build, I utilized the MEAGA Arms rifle length MTS (Monolithic) receiver, a low profile gas block, and a mid length impingement tube in order to install the necessary gas components under the monolithic rail making a very clean, minimal look.  I have used these barrels on a number of occasions and the accuracy and consistency is excellent.

The following is a list of the major components used for this build and links to review specific details of each component.
