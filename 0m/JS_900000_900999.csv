The receiver is milled which means it is made out of a solid piece of steel and not from stamped together pieces of metal like the cheap stamped receivers. This Rifle is built like tank. There isn't any wobble anywhere. this is a very solid rifle with no lose wobbly stock or forearm. The Polish Milled ak47's were getting impossible to find before this whole gun ban talk started so you can bet that you won't find one now. In fact I'm pretty sure they quit importing/making the 1960 Polish Milled about a year ago before this BS gun ban talk. So they were hard to find a year ago and impossible to find now.

After selling my Glock 30 Gen 4, I thought I'd try the SIG P220 Carry. So, I bought a new SIG P220 Carry SAS Gen2 with the custom shop melt job to the slide. Needless to say, it shoots great, but is still too big for me. This .45 ACP powerhouse comes with night sights and 3 magazines, which hold 8 rounds single stack. These magazines are hard to find and very expensive, around $45 a piece if you can find them.  Still has the warranty card. 

The gun itself is very rare and is a special edition, which can't be had unless you find someone with the special edition. This P220 Carry is a Gen2 SAS Custom and is single action only with an ambidextrous thumb safety. This gun carries and fires like a 1911. I am not sure there is another P220 Model that comes with the SAS melt job and is SAO. 

The MSRP on this weapon is around $1,050 without the extra magazine. I would like to sell it locally for $800. I have fired exactly 150 rounds and it is just not for me. 

I will ship it if I have to, but shipping and FFL fees would be on you. 

Be sure to check out my rifle I have for sale here as well. If you would like to work out a deal on both, just let me know and we will see what we can work out.

Purchased new by me in the 80's it remained stock and unfired for many years, About 2001 I thought it might be more fun as a tack driver, so I went shopping and found a local guy (in Stockton California) to put it all together. I wasn't disapointed, it's dead-on. 

Today it's a true tack driver, with all Volquartsen and power-custom innards, the only thing left original Ruger is the receiver and bolt housing. Every other single part, spring, and pin has been replaced by match grade equipment. I've still got most all of the factory innards if you want to switch it back, but I'm pretty sure you'll do like I did, and leave it as-is. 

It has a Fajen thumbhole silouette laminated stock, an Adams and Bennet match target bull barrel, and has a Simmons Pro 2.5 to 10X 50mm Wide angle scope.

It comes with 5 factory magazines, and 2 butler Hot Lips 25 rnd mags, all nile new or unfired, I dont recall ever all of the using them, but I'm sure somebody has tried them out at some point.

So - why should you buy this 10/22 from me as opposed to buying a new one for a couple hundred and doing the work yourself? If you're reading this no doubt you know what stock 10/22's are going for these days, and this one is a bargain.

This gun is practically new and in excellent shape, I purchased it earlier this month and have only taken it to the range once.  It comes with the box and everything it came with, two mags, warranty paper work, lock, and a pocket holster if wanted.  Is pretty accurate for a gun this size and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, it just doesnt fit my hands as well as I'd like.

I'm interested in seeing if anyone would like to trade for something that would work better for me.  I am only interested in CCL guns, nothing full sized.  Ftf only, do not ask to ship or do paypal.
I am primarily wanting a Ruger LCR, I would like one in .357 but the .38 is fine too.  I would also be very interested in a Ruger SR9c or SR40c, any of the Baby Glocks (G26, g27, g36), or a subcompact XD or M&P.  These are the ONLY guns I am interested in and I WILL NOT sell it, looking to do a straight across trade.  I do not have to get rid of my nano and I dont need to sell it, I'm just looking for something that would work better for me; if I am not offered anything that I'm looking for I'll just hold onto it, so don't waste either of our time please!

This is my rifle. I hate to see it go but have been thinking about selling it for a while and now might be the time. Those that know their AR's will recognize that this gun is a shooter, built of reliable, reputable high quality components. This gun has probably had about 1500rds through it since new, all by me, and ALL FLAWLESS. This rifle is put together as follows:

- Noveske Upper receiver with 16"" chrome lined barrel (1/7) and mid length gas system
- Larue 9.0 mid length free float hand guard. 
- Troy flip up rear sight, Magpul AFG, Gas Buster charging handle
- Magpul CTR buttstock and MIAD grip with spare firing bin/bolt inside of grip core. 
- built from Stag stripped lower receiver with stag lower parts. 

this rifle can shoot! i have attached a picture of a target. these 5 pairs were shot by a friend of mine at 100yds, his first time shooting a rifle (gun was wearing a 4x ACOG at the time).
the gun also comes with the following:

- Larue discreet soft case
- 2 kydex mag holsters for magpul p-mags
- 5 magpul 20rd pmags (20rounders are legal in denver)
- 1 Larue rifle sling
- 1 detachable carry handle (replaces rear flip up sight)
- 1 bore snake for field cleaning"

Do you realize how badly it sucks driving around in 25"" weather with a plastic trash bag rear window? I had planned on listing the rifle on Gunbroker but figured a local face to face deal will be faster, easier and a lot less hassle for all parties. Take care and hope to hear from you soon...."

I like the way this rifle shoots, especially after I changed the sights. I just want a 10/22 to plimk with.

This rifles comes with the accu trigger, and it is currently turned to its lowest pull weight. The sights on the rifle were just plain matte black and very hard to see and shoot with, so I installed a set of Williams Firesights fiber optic sights. These made a huge difference over the stock sights and make it a lot easier to shoot, especially towards evening. I sighted the new sights in a few days ago, and was reminded why I like these little Savage accu trigger rimfire rifles so much. Very light trigger, easy to see the sights, and very accurate. This will make a very good varmint rifle to have around a farm.

I also installed flush screws in scope base holes, they came open from the factory. Rifle will come with 35 rounds of Federal 30gr JHP ammo and the original box, manual, accu trigger tool, etc."

The price is $1,200.00, in cash (no trades). This will be a FTF sale in the northern Idaho/eastern Washinton/ western Montana area so no shipping charges, sales taxes, auction fees, or other kinds of B.S. will be involved in the transaction. If you are interested, shoot me an e-mail at REDACTED and we'll exchange info and arraign a location to meet up. I've only had this rifle a few weeks and really hate to part with it. A week after buying it, my wife's car was rear ended by a hit and run driver. I need the cash to cover my insurance deductable. Do you realize how badly it sucks driving around in 25"" weather with a plastic trash bag rear window? I had planned on listing the rifle on Gunbroker but figured a local face to face deal will be faster, easier and a lot less hassle for all parties. Take care and hope to hear from you soon...."

P238 SAS. The pistol has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that’s ideal for concealed carry. It’s just a fraction of the size of our full-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. This pistol is extreemly accurate and fun to shoot.

PLEASE READ ALL BELOW!!!!!!!

1900 rounds of XM193F (95-20 rnd boxes) in 50 cal tall boy w/dessicant.

Real AMERICAN MADE Lake City stuff, LC stamped in the 5.56 format.This is not foreign junk, this is the real deal with great reloadable brass.

To all those new AR fans if your barrell is stamped 5.56 (most are) this is what you will enjoy shooting and THERE IS a difference between 5.56 and 223.

The FIRM PRICE is $1400 CASH for 1900 rounds in the can, that's less than 75 cents each, with a free can. Many local gun stores are getting $1 per round loose, your small shops are getting $16.95 for the same box with a couple of box limit. You are paying less and getting 95 boxes!!

Not trying to be a jerk but the price is FIRM!!! I will only split the unit in half at 90 cents per round ($900 per thousand) without the can, as I am shooting to move the whole lot.

You will not find cheaper with this amount, this isn't 100 rnds of loose crap in the middle of no where.

Alll ""gun store rules apply"". You must be 21 to purchase, not appear to be a psycho and act like a human being. I love Armslist and my fellow shootists but with all of the new blood there are some guys that are ruining the soup. If I don't feel comfortable with you I will not sell to you, period.

I am in the Inidan Trail/Matthews/S.Charlotte area. This is FIRST COME WITH CASH/FIRST SERVE. I will not hold the ammo for any length of time longer then the time it takes to meet.

It will sell today, NO DEALS past 5pm, my wife doesn't enjoy my hobby as much as I do.

Earlier last spring, I bought a brand new Heckler & Koch USP Compact .45 with the stainless slide. The stainless versions are no longer being produced and I was bit by the H&K bug, so I grabbed it from my local gun shop. My tastes have changed, so this one goes up on the block for any aficionados out there who have been wanting one!

It's unfired and not been holstered except for one time to check the fit on a holster for a USPc .40 to see if they would be compatible. Date code is AK, and it has standard sights on it. I did have the team at LEED in Tacoma change this from a V1 to a light LEM, and I still have all the parts from the V1 switch in a bag in case you prefer the V1 mode. I'm quite certain Charles at LEED will change it back at no cost since he did the work in the first place.

The pistol will come with two factory eight-round magazines, the case, cable lock, casings, and manual. I also have a black leather RH DeSantis Speed Scabbard that will fit the pistol if you need a holster for it.

Asking $900 FTF/CASH ONLY. I live in Pierce County and will drive a reasonable distance to meet you if you're interested. To facilitate this sale, you MUST have a Washington state Driver's License AND a valid Washington state Concealed Pistol License which I'll need to see.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send me an email: riceboy72 AT hotmail DOT com.

I am at work now so I can't post pictures, but will send them to you if requested.

Thank you for looking!"

This is XM855 specification ammo with the SS109 penetrator bullet. The SS109 is a 62 grain projectile with a lead core and a steel penetrator designed for combat use.

XM855 ammo features a 62 grain, copper jacketed, lead core, steel tip bullet. It is not armor piercing ammunition, but the steel tip does allow it to penetrate farther than other types of ammo. This bullet will attract a magnet because of the steel in the tip, and some ranges will not allow you to use it because of this. However, it will not damage the barrel of your rifle, because the steel is entirely covered by a layer of copper.

The ammunition itself is extremely high quality, and has features not seen on other ammunition of this type. This ammo has a crimped primer, reducing the chances of a blown primer stopping a semi-automatic, or automatic rifle from functioning. It also has a lacquer primer sealant and a case mouth sealant, to prevent the internal components from being compromised by moisture intrusion.

Federal offers a weather resistant ammo can containing 420 rounds of this ammunition. Composed of 14 30-round boxes containing three stripper clips of 10 rounds each, this product is ideal for those looking to store ammo long term, but who also want to be able to access and load it quickly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of the historical increase nationwide of drunken driving death of innocent people young and old, the governor signed legislation into law last night known as the Alcohol Driver Safety Act 2013.

Immediately, every individual who wants to consume and/or purchase alcohol must register with the State. After a thorough background investigation ascertaining that the applicant does not have any prior alcohol related violation, the applicant will be issued an Alcohol Drinking Permit (Permit). A Permit must be presented for inspection as required if the individual wants to purchase and/or consume alcohol. A state database will be maintained of all Permit holders. Permit renewal will be required every five years and disclosure of the amount and type of alcohol in their possession at the time will be mandated.

Alcohol purchased must be through a licensed vendor who is registered with the state. Before sale, the vendor must run a background check of the buyer through the local police department for prior alcohol related violations. The vendor must also report the sale to a new state database. Private sales will still be allowed but the seller must have a state licensed alcohol vendor perform a background check of the buyer through the local police department prior to the sale. The law provides exception for the sale to a spouse or child provided they are Permit holders. Internet purchase of alcohol will be illegal unless shipped to a state licensed vendor. 

There will be a limit on the amount of alcohol and the type of alcohol a permit holder can purchase. Alcohol having a 100 Proof or more will be illegal to possess and purchase. Anyone having alcohol 100 Proof or more have up to 12 months to sell them to out-of-state individuals or licensed vendors. Anyone in possession of alcohol 100 Proof or more could face felony charges. Anyone having possession of alcohol 80 Proof or more will be grandfathered in provided they register it with the state police within 12 months. The new stricter regulation for alcohol will be limited to 70 Proof or less.

If anyone feels this is outrageous, just think how legal responsible gun owners feel about the new laws just passed in New York. Drunk driving kills more innocent lives and amass millions of dollars of property damage every year. The problem with drunken driving and gun violence is the same. The only difference is in drunken driving accidents all of the lives lost other than the drivers’ are of innocent people. Gang violence, drug dealing and criminal use of guns are everyday occurrence all over the United States. It makes up most of the gun violence in the United States. The media distorts the facts because they only cover tragedies involving innocent victims. In addition, the assault rifle which is the primary issue of recent gun control debate is the least cause of gun violence as per statistics. Check it out for yourself in the Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice, a Department of Justice web site, as well as, the FBI statistics website that our leaders, lawmakers and everyone has access to. Hopefully this will shed some light as to the unjust treatment legal responsible gun owners are being subjected to."

What Im looking for is a nice Lever Action 30/30 preferably a Marlin model 336.
and before you try to ask no I'm not trading one-for-one. You'll absolutely need to throw a bit of cash in with that. That being said NO I AM NOT GOING TO VALUE YOUR USED MARLIN 336 AT $500. 500 is the brand new price for a 336BL which most of you wont have. No I am not going to trade you for any of the special edition, or the centennial versions, or any anniversary editions of a marlin either, because I plan to use the gun for hunting, not looking pretty on a wall. Also I've been looking for a nice carry revolver in case any of you have both. But I would accept a nice single action or ""cowboy"" revolver for lack of a better term. But please no ""Dirty Harry"" revolvers.

But of course, being a reasonable man, I will consider any trades thrown my way. and i will not entertain low-ball offers. you can see more common Norinco AK-47 versions on gunbroker selling for a minimum of 1500, of which i have already stated this is a bit more rare, not to mention its before the sporter stocks had to be put on, that bit is just to give you an idea of trade/sell value of this rifle.

I am located near Jacksonville but will travel as far as Warsaw or somewhere equidistant (about an hour-ish) to give you boys in the Raleigh area a fair shot at this rifle as well.

I can take email responses but i prefer Texting 910-five-4-five-37-five-6.

my picture messaging has been screwy lately, so if you have pics of your trade they'll have to go to my email which ill give you if I'm interested in what you're offering.

Cash price non negotiable. But why pay 1500 for a wasr when they used to be 550 brand new when you can pay the same and get an Arsenal quality AK?"

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

Utilizing a precision machined coupler we’ve combined a standard L5 30 round magazine body with a modified L5 body. The coupler ensures the bodies are accurately aligned, maintaining the internal constant curve geometry, ensuring reliable feeding. 
Features: 
* Made in the USA 
* Maximum capacity of 48 rounds, download required for reloading with a closed bolt. 
* Translucent polymer body that is impact resistant through a wide range of temperatures. 
* The L5 body design incorporates a constant radius geometry that facilitates follower/spring travel. 
* Precision machined aluminum coupler developed and supplied by Nordic Components that accurately aligns the magazine bodies, ensuring the internal constant curve geometry is maintained. 
* Chrome Silicon Spring 
* Hardened steel feed lips are permanently molded into the body; feed lips are PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. 
* Rubber coated bottom. 
* Easy to disassemble and maintain."

Don't know the difference from ""S.A.P.I"" and ""E.S.A.P.I""  PLATES? The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) is a ceramic plate fielded by the US military. It was first used in the Interceptor body armor, a ballistic vest. It is now also used in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest as well as the Modular Tactical Vest, in addition to commercially available ""plate carriers"". The kevlar Interceptor vest itself is designed to stop projectiles up to and including 9x19mm Parabellum submachine gun rounds, in addition to fragmentation. To protect against higher velocity rifle rounds, SAPI plates are needed.



E.S.A.P.I In May 2005, the US military began replacing the standard Small Arms Protective Insert plates with the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert (ESAPI). An ESAPI provides protection from .30-06 M2  (black-tip)  OR  Armor-piercing rounds with a steel or tungsten penetrator, but costs about $600 per plate, 50% more than SAPI plates. They are produced by Ceradyne, BAE Systems, and ArmorWorks Enterprises.   

 This performance is only assured when backed by the soft armor of the OTV (or any soft armor which meets military requirements for protection. The ceramic plate is backed with a shield made of Spectra, a material up to 40% stronger than Kevlar. to trap any fragments of either plate or projectile and prevent them from injuring the wearer.

      As I have been in the process of consolidating calibers, it is time for this Mosin 91/30 to hit the chopping block. I have for sale or possible trade, one of the nicest 91/30's you will ever find. I have been collecting C&R's and specifically Mosin's for a long time and this is the nicest one I've had of dozens. Although they are crappy indoor phone pics, the rifle and the pics speak for themselves...

  1938 Tula Mosin 91/30, 98%+ condition, Natural matching numbers, Wonderful shooter, great rifling, Deep Dark pretty pre 40's bluing, Beautiful original finish Laminate stock, Metal is as close to perfect as you will ever find on a Mosin.

Includes:

    Included are the original mag pouches, and spike bayo, original sling, an additional VERY early 91 stock with brass handguard hardware!
Also included is 80rds of silver tip ammo....the good stuff

Price:

     Price for the above package, sold together (will NOT seperate), the price is $200
This is an excellent price for this Mosin considering it's qualities, and the package. Also considering that others are selling beat up everyday hardwood 1940's mosin's at this price.

E.T.A......Because I am consolidating rifles and calibers i don't shoot...DOES NOT mean, I need money, or am interested in low ""offers"". 
I may accept trades, but at this price I don't know what you would offer that I may need.

The AMD-65 is a Hungarian-manufactured variant of the venerable AKM rifle for use by that mnation's armored infantry and paratrooper (""descent"") units. The rifle's design is suited for outdoor use as an infantry rifle but can also be used from within the confines of an armored vehicle as a fire support weapon. This is possible due to the side-folding stock of shaft design that makes it more compact. The 12.6-inch chrome lined barrel is also relatively short for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. The operating mechanism does not require a gas expansion chamber at the muzzle as in the AKS-74U to ensure reliable functioning, but does use a specially designed muzzle brake, which attenuates muzzle flash while aggrandizing the sound.
The rifle comes with one 20 round mag and has the original box that the rifle come in. This rifle is in MINT condition and the stock locks up rock solid. This is not a junk parts kit build, it's the real deal strait from Hungary. No low ball offers or junk trade offers. Don't waste my time. You can call or text REDACTED NO EMAIL PLEASE"

Winchester Model 70

Browning

Action/Bolt/Barrel need to be in good condition, bluing should be in decent shape, as well as the stock (minor scuffs and scrapes perfectly acceptable).  Decent optics would be nice but are not a requirement.

Need to be local to the Raleigh area or willing to travel near there.

Price is negotiable but I'm looking at $400-$600 and $600 would be pushing it.  May have additional guns/accessories to trade depending on your interests.  If you have anything you think I may be interested in please respond and specify what you are looking for and if you are interested in cash only or potentially a cash/trade.  Be prepared to supply pics."
