Panther Oracle, 223/5.56 Carbine, Flat Top, Optic Ready, 16"", 6 Position Stock
. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this carbine features a 16'' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock.



Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

Let me say that again since when I posted this truck on CL I got over forty texts asking 'when can I test drive it?"" The truck dosen't have a transmission. I'm hoping people on here have a little more sense because if not I'm pulling the ad and keeping the truck. You will not be able to remove the bedliner easily. I was going to put spikes in the trim holes and have a Zombie Death Truck but I need the room for my other 6 cars so I'm offering it here for trade for a home defense / tactical shotgun. This isn't a resto project so if that is what your looking for keep looking. If you need a parts truck for running gear this is perfect for that or if you put a tranny in it will haul anything you want. The trans was removed but the bellhousing and clutch setup are still bolted to the engine. Literally bring a tranny put the four bolts in and drive it home.

Gun operates flawlessly and trust my life on it. Has some wear and doesnt sit. I shoot it often just because its a blast to shoot. Especially shooting skeet with it. The red dot has a small imperfection on the right hand side of the glass but isnt noticable and doesnt affect operation. It also holds zero so all you have to do is have the dot close and your gonna hit the target. Asking $350, no lowballs and no trades at this time."

I've hung the little Crimson Trace RailMaster laser on it for fun, but I'll hang on to it if you're not thrilled with it.

Like all SIS's this one is made of stainless steel covered with Kimber's KimPro finish.  The railed frame is checkered and the slide is machined in the SIS style with an ambidexterous safety.  It has the SIS special night sights so you can always see your gun sights.  It will come with the Kimber case and two stainless steel 8 rnd magazines (a Kimber KimPro Tac-Mag and a Mec-Gar tactical mag).

The SIS has everything the Kimber Warrior configuration has (except lanyard loop) and more, being stainless steel.

This gun functions flawlessly, but it is not as pretty as a brand new one.  The KimPro finish has taken a few scratches (not through to the stainless steel, but not easy to buff out either) and the fancy SIS wood grips are a little beat up.  It is a great shooter, but not necessarily one for your pristine SIS collection.

It was purchased a few months ago (DZ serial #). Has had ~250rds through it. Includes box, papers, 25rd mag and lock (because I know you just need another lock to toss in the shoebox full of locks!). I have lots of positive feedback on a local gun board I can point you to, so know that you are dealing with a fair trader. As the ad indicates, I'm in Raleigh, but I head out to Dunn (for IDPA or rimfire matches) and Sanford fairly regularly, if either of those locations is easier for you to meet for a transaction.

Will have pics up later, but it's just like the stock photo below. This is the version with the threaded barrel and flash hider.

Can include extra mags at $15/apiece. These are nearly new mags that have been loaded twice at most, some have only been loaded once. Pick up four of these and you are all set for rimfire matches (usually require 5 mags).

Trades: I'm mostly interested in cash, but trades involving gold/silver coins, factory ammo and trades for non-junk firearms, excluding shotguns and hunting rifles, will all be considered.

Stand in a quiet room and open it.  That’s what the Operative B sounds like firing CCI Minimag!  With the Operative B, we have truly created an integrally suppressed bolt-action .22 rifle unlike any other.  The suppressor core and tube are fully removable for cleaning, and the barrel is conservatively ported to keep inexpensive bulk pack high-velocity ammunition subsonic.

I researched it thoroughly before purchasing this. It is more reliable than a Saiga and more durable than a Mossberg. Short 18"" barrel with a 6+1 capacity, and you can reload between shots without needing to change magazines. Being gas-operated with a steel receiver it is one of the lightest recoiling 12 gauge shotguns ever made, and it blows fist sized holes in things as fast as you can pull the trigger. This is a very well thought out design.

The prior owner purchased it new and had some custom work done to it to make it even better:
*Mesa Tactical Urbano stock with adjustable cheek riser and Limbsaver recoil pad.
*Mesa Tactical 6-round side saddle with Picatinny rail if you want to mount an optic.
*Nordic Components charging handle.
*Nordic Components mag clamp (a mini-rail can be ordered for $17 to mount a flashlight on said clamp).
*Oversized safety installed by Bowers Tactical, who also polished the bolt release.
*Condor Tactical shotgun scabbard with gear pouch.
*Assorted small parts & cleaning kit.
*Manual & warranty card.

VERY LOW ROUND COUNT from the prior owner, mostly Federal birdshot, approximately 300 rds.  I've only owned this shotgun for a few weeks and have not fired it. This is an outstanding shotgun, but just not the right choice for me. Due to an injury I have difficulty handling an 8 pound assault weapon without a sling.

I was going to order the mini-tac rail for the mag clamp (part # TRL-BCT-150) to mount a flashlight and a Tru-Glo fiberoptic front sight, but never got around to it. I highly recommend these items to the new owner. A red dot or holographic sight can be mounted on the top rail, or you can remove it and mount ghost rings. Many possible options.

I did, however, purchase a lot of buckshot: 6 unopened boxes of Winchester #1 Buck, 6 unopened boxes of Winchester Mil-Spec 00 Buck, and a pair of A-Zoom snap caps. That is 60 rounds of the BEST buckshot available, plus a pair of training rounds to practice reloads and dry fire.

It is a great bike at a better price!  It is an 03 she has just under 16000 miles on her.  just two months ago I had the baffles in the exaust cut out making it nice and loud, I also had the card rebuilt and tuned by metric cycles in tulsa.  great riding bike for the money, I can get it to 100 mph no prob and im 300+ pounds!  I can ride with my friends that have shadow 1100s, and sportster 883 and 1200s no problem!!!   The good about the bike is that its low miles for the year, very recent carb rebuild and tune, oil change, new battery, and other fluids flushed and refilled by metric cycles all at the same time (cost over 400$) has new back rest with vulcan insignia (200$) that I installed.  Tires are in great shape.  comes with 2 helmets, and a crossman motorcycle jack (retails over 200 for jack). The (not so) bad is that it was laid over going about 20ish in grass at mohawk park and has some scuffs and scratches most can be buffed out or tuched up.  has some minor surface rust in a few corners of chrome (has been covered parking since I owned).  and after the lay over the blinkers wont work, could be a bad connection, or blown fues but ?  I dont know electical enough to figure it out.  The bike has been rode several times since lay over and has not effected performance just a little on the looks.  a great buy for a great bike.  may do some partial trading for a nice .22, or something tacticool let me know.  no scammers, no rides without money in my hand as collateral. thanks again for looking!"

Beginning in 1871, two members of a family, which would establish a firearms dynasty, cooperated on the design for a series of revolvers destined to change the firearms industry and create what would become ""America's Gunsmith"".

Frank Wesson was well known for his hinged breech and falling block rifles. In Fact, his hinged breech carbine was actually accepted for use as an official secondary arm during the Civil War. His nephew, Gilbert Harrington, was a bright young firearms designer, and was granted a patent for a new mechanism to eject spent cases from revolvers. Together in 1871, they began a company called Wesson & Harrington in Worcester, Massachusetts. This company would continue until 1875 when Frank Wesson sold his interest to William Richardson, creating the Harrington & Richardson Arms Company, one of the most prolific manufacturers of firearms ever to operate in America. The Wesson & Harrington rifles and shotguns of today celebrate this fine tradition in this historic region of firearms manufacture.

Tradition, history and American craftsmanship blend to build today's Wesson & Harrington rifles. Frank Wesson & Gilbert Harrington began their enterprise in 1871 and we continue their proud tradition today, building fine long range rifles in the same Massachusetts county over a century and quarter later.

The Wesson & Harrington 45-70 Government Buffalo Classic and the 38-55 WCF Target Model are true American classics to their very core. Modeled after the Frank Wesson tip-up rifles which were first made in Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1850's, these modern classic fill the need of the long range cowboy action shooter as well as those who just enjoy shooting these great old cartridges.

Both the Buffalo Classic and the Target Model reflect true 19th century styling, including real color case hardening on the frame and crescent butt plate, plus ""one line at a time"", hand cut checkering on their American black walnut stocks and forends. No sights are provided on the high polish blue barrels but a dovetail slot for a post or globe style front sight like the Lyman #17 is cut at the muzzle end of the barrel. The area over the chamber is drilled and tapped to accept a peep sight such as the Williams WGRSHR. As these rifles are designed for competition shooting, a number of sight options are available from a wide variety of specialty suppliers. The shooter's taste and style of competition will dictate the appropriate style of sights.

The Buffalo Classic in 45-70 Government has carved out a very competitive position in today's fast growing sport of Cowboy Action Shooting and BPCR shooting. It features a mid weight 32"" barrel to get all the velocity possible out of the venerable 45-70 Government cartridge. The 32"" barrel length also provides the necessary sighting radius for long range matches.

The Wesson & Harrington Target Model in 38-55 WCF follows the tradition of fine target offerings from the likes of Ballard or Wurfflein in the 1870's. The 38-55 Cartridge traces its roots to the early 1880's when it was developed for target shooting by the Ballard Rifle Company. The Wesson & Harrington Target Model uses a 28"" heavy target barrel and original style rifling for consistent accuracy. This barrel length was one of the most popular for this caliber when it was introduced. The Target model also includes all steel furniture. A high polish, heat treated steel trigger guard and forend spacer are standard on this rifle and are now available as a factory upgrade to the owners of the Buffalo Classic, through the H&R 1871, Inc, Customer Service Department.

Both Wesson & Harrington rifles feature a level of quality and attention to detail which would have made the original Wesson & Harrington proud to have their names affixed to the action.

As far as trade I am always looking for something new and interesting. After everything this gun cost me about $600 so you are getting a hell of a deal for a new mint Ruger, look on budsguns which is the cheapest anywhere even there they are over $500 and that doesn't include transfer fees.

I'm just trying to get most of my money back out of it.  I have fired it exactly 25 times while I have owned it and it functioned perfectly.  It has a rear peep site and front blade sight with brass insert (pretty cool set-up actually, its what sold me).  It is not drilled/tapped for scope.

Here's the deal.  For $250 you get the rifle with the wood stock - thats what I paid for it.  For an extra $60, you get the synthetic Monte Carlo stock currently mounted and remaining 55 rounds of FMJ Ball ammo I have left.   I’m firm on price because one of these sporterized Remington Mosins just sold (14 Oct) on Gunbroker for $350 and it did not include the sporter stock or the ammo.  

I am willing to ship but obviously will not include the ammo.  For shipped guns, I will do a 5 day inspection policy but you are responsible for all shipping costs.  Obviously, I will only ship to FFLs and C&Rs.

Local buyers must show ID and be over 18 years old.  I reserve the right to refuse sale to anyone I suspect of being a felon, thug, jerk, angry, unstable, demented, etc.

with every possible feature that is desirable in a rimfire suppressor. It is 
lightweight, being made with over 95% titanium in its construction, this 
suppressor virtually disappears on the end of your weapon system.  We utilize 
a stainless steel replaceable blast baffle that will allow the suppressor to last 
several lifetimes with virtually no wear on the critical parts.  It has world 
class sound reduction on BOTH a pistol AND a rifle.  It has reduced blow back 
due to the high efficient baffle design that redirects high velocity gasses into 
the suppressor and not back into the gun. It comes apart for cleaning with 
minimal effort.  The tube is not threaded, but rather the endcap threads 
directly into the core,  nor is the tube exposed to the blast energy at the 
muzzle. It has a tapered bore to allow for slight variations in alignment.
