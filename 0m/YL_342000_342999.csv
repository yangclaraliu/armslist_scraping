I picked it up a few weeks ago, but i need the money to fund a new project. The pistol has novak sights, fiber optic front and low glare rear with a 5 inch barrel. It comes with 2 17rd mags, box, papers, S&W Tac Light and all 3 grips ( small, medium and large ) and a G-code holster. I'm also including 250 rds of Winchester Ranger 147gr SXT ammunition, and 30rds of PDX1. I picked this up in a trade a few weeks ago and love it, but i have a 1911 project that needs money to complete.

I would rate the pistol at excellent condition or better.

$600 cash firm. $500 for the Gun minus the ammo .I'm located in Jacksonville, and willing to drive a reasonable distance ( within 45 min to an hour ). We can negotiate travel with the deal if travel exceeds an hour.

The only trade I will consider would be 
Pure Bred puppy to be trained as a service animals so no small dogs.
1911 frame and slide kit from companies such as Fusion Firearms, Caspian, Wilson Combat, Les Baer, etc.
I would also consider a Springfield TRP, maybe others similar to it. Just let me know what you have.

The only thing i will part out is the ammo from the weapon. Its going up for sale in the ammo section of this forum.

To buy or trade for this pistol you will need either a NC CCP or purchase permit and ID.

Let me know what you have. I can provide pics upon request, just include your email address in the message.

This is a great pistol, and i don't need to sell but I'm looking to fund a custom 1911."

One of the magazines has the ""snap grip""... it's a little snap down pinky extension.

It was made in 1896, so it is legal to own with the short barrel. It is considered an antique. 

Has a good bit of original blueing left. I would put it at about 60% original condition. Very hard to find one in this shape. Somebody over the years took great care of it. 

It has nice rifling left. Shoots great, about 1 1/2""- 2"" at 75-80 yards.

Also, most of these were in 44-40 and had 15"" barrels. This 1 is unusual having the 12"" barrel and in 38-40. 

Price is firm at $8500 for cash. Trade value is $10,000

I have received the Winchester letter, which verifies it is real and it was shipped to Nevada from the factory.

Will send pictures to interested parties.

1 tapco galil 30 round mag

with the bullet guide it will feed from tapcos galil mags and will be able to use most AK74 mags and AK .223 mags.  it will not feed factory saiga mags without modifying the mag.(they are way too expensive to buy anyway).  This rifle weighs 9 pounds, its not for girly men who need a 5 pound gun.   I really love this gun, i just perfer my AKs in 7.62x39.  and a tid bit of info for those who dont know, the saiga '.223' is actually chambered in 5.56, its just marked .223 to ease import hassle.  so it is perfectly safe to fire 5.56 in this gun.  i will send more pics to seriously interested parties.

This rifle is in excellent condition fired only a few times by myself. It was restocked, refinished, and set up for post cold war era Russia in 1959 by their Arsenal. It was thought that these were refurbished for internal Police and Governement security use in the 1960's. This rifle shows no service use and came to me packaged for long term storage, cosmoline packed with no visable usage since refurbishment. I believe all the numbers match and it is an 1943 Izzy 91/30 converted to 91/59. It is near perfect condition and very difficult to find these 91/59 version carbines in this condition. It comes slinged and shoots very nice, I am very schooled in Mosin Nagants and will sell or trade this fine firearm for the right deal. Serious buyers or traders please inquire, low ball, riduculus offers will be deleted. This rifle comes with ammo. 7.62 x 54R"

Currently still have all 22s in the top picture, the bullpup in the second picture, and both rifles in the bottom picture.


The first 3 are all .22LRs in the top picture. The one on top is a Remington 597 with a heavy bull barrel, scope, 5 standard magazines, and 1 extended magazine.
The second one is a S&W M&P 15-22. Its basically new, I bought it on a whim and shot exactly 25 rds through it. The third one in the pic is a Ruger 10-22 with the scope mounts, one factory mag, and 2 extended mags. I bought it new a few months ago and dont shoot it much. Probably ran 100 rds through it. I would like to keep one of these, which ever one the last one I have is probably.

The next pics are of various ARs, 2 chambered in 5.56/.223 and one chambered in a 6.8 SPC.
The one on the top is a Bushmaster Bullpup .223. It is NOT a bullpup kit, but a true factory made bullpup rifle. It is piston driven. It has been custom ported using professional machining to reduce heat build up. It is equipped with an EoTech XPS sight on it. THE bottom 2 ARs are SOLD.

The third pic is of a .270WSM and a .22 Hornet. The top one in the case is a  Remington 700 NWTF chambered in a .270 WSM (Winchester Short Mag). I bought this one to keep in the safe for a collector but now I just want to sell it and get other things. It is unfired and the case still has the plastic tabs on the combo locks that you have to take off to set your combo. It is very intricately detailed with engravings. It also comes with the engraved matching knife and sheath. The same rifle is on sale at Cabela's for $1899 (see link)
http://www.cabelas.com/post-falls-gun-library-remington-700-nwtf-270-win.shtml
The second one in this pic is a Ruger M77/22 chambered in .22 Hornet with a Bushnell 3-9x40 scope. It is extremely accurate! It comes with the brown laminate stock and retails for $929 (http://www.ruger.com/products/rotaryMagazine7722/models.html). This one is probably my favorite 22 round and rifle Ive ever had, just dont get a chance to shoot it very much.

The PN-40 comes equipped with a three-axis electronic compass that can provide compass direction while stationery. The electronic compass is disabled when moving and the GPS heading is used. The PN-40 makes it easy to calibrate the compass for use in the field; simply follow the on-screen directions and you’re set to go. DeLorme also includes an accelerometer, which in tandem with the compass provides the ability to figure the angle the GPS is tilted and determine an accurate compass reading regardless of how you are holding the PN-40 in your hand (tilted up, face down, etc.). Accelerometers measure the amount of static acceleration due to gravity; by sensing the amount of dynamic acceleration, the PN-40 can analyze the way the device is moving and make adjustments. The PN-40 comes equipped with a barometric altimeter for providing accurate altitude readings. The barometric altimeter works in conjunction with the GPS to measure elevation when using auto calibration (if auto calibration is disabled, then the barometric altimeter is the only sensor providing elevation information). GPS by itself can only factor an approximate altitude reading, but in conjunction with the altimeter the PN-40 can provide accurate elevation data"

I got this with a group of guns and it's just not a caliber or style I shoot.  The guy who did the build is a craftsman who did exotic car rebuilds and repairs for 45+ years (Buggati, Ferarri, Astin Martin, etc.).  He also was a shooter and loved to custom build guns.  He took a WWII era K98 Mauser action, a brand new barrel, made a custom stock and mounted a scope.  My caliper measures the barrel diameter at the muzzle as .534” or 1.357mm.  Length of barrel from muzzle to where it meets receiver is 23 1/2”.  Add to that the threaded portion in the action for overall length. It's very nicely done and in great shape, but I don't need a varmint gun.  Scope is a 10x32 Midwest Optics.  I believe he built this in the 1960's. and then stashed it in his safe.  All the guns I got from him were at least 25 years old, some had never chambered a round, and in excellent shape.  I have shot this rifle and it works beautifully."

It's a 2011 Colt Combat Elite with FLGR and upswept grip safety with memory bump. Maybe 350 rounds through it total. It went back to the factory for not feeding hollow points and came back with a tuned extractor, polished feed ramp, brass bead front sight, black Novak rear sight, steel MSH, and a smooth solid medium trigger.

Comes with all paperwork, including test target and Colt factory letter for the modifications, and both factory Checkmate 8-round mags. 

NOTE: It originally would not feed Winchester Ranger 230-gr. JHPs, but after returning from the factory ate 100 without an issue. There is a minor ding on the front of the dust cover that I did not put there and was not there when I got it (I suspect some hamfisted person at Colt) and a very slight idiot mark that I may have put there.

What looks like stains on the slide, hammer, and by the top left grip screw are lube marks.

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force. Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun. A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot. a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

I bought this here little over a month ago, and have had a lot of fun with it.  It's a Colt 9mm upper assembly, which fits on any AR15 lower.  Save money on ammo, and still get the feel of your AR.  It's a 10.5 inch barrel, and comes with an integral dummy suppressor to meet fed regs on length.  
Comes with a Hahn mag well adapter, top of the line, and 7 mags. 1x 20 rd, 4x 32 rd, and 2x 40 rd. The 2 40rd mags are Uzi mags, would need slight mod to use on this platform.  
It shoots beautifully. I've used it on my Rock River Arms lower, as well as my buddy's Bushmaster lower.
The ONLY reason I'm letting this go is that I bought a cheap SKS and discovered how much fun that particular round can be, so I really want to get an AK.  
If you have an AK you'd like to trade, I'm all for it.  Otherwise, willing to trade for 550 of your dollars.  I paid $600, and THAT was a damn good deal.  So I know this is worth what I'm asking. I figure the loss of $50 is a fine rental fee for getting to shoot this!  :)
Anyway, let me know if you're interested!
PLEASE NOTE: The first pic is ONLY to show what it looks like on my AR15 lower. The lower assembly is NOT included. The 2nd pic is everything that's included in the sale/trade."

This award was completely independent of the Infantry Combat Badge. The badge designed by Wilhelm Ernst Peekhaus of Berlin (his name preceded by FEC can be found on the reverse of some examples), and was instituted in three classes, bronze, silver, and gold.
Manufacturing and Technical information

The badge is die cast and generally manufactured in zinc, though examples in tombac or aluminum are also found.. It is slightly convex, with the center piece consisting of the national emblem surmounting a crossed bayonet and hand grenade. This piece is cut out and backed with a flat square of blackened steel (magnetic), crimped in place on the reverse. 
 The pin is always broad in the center and tapering at the end. The bar varies in length from between 95 to 97.5mm, and in height from between 25 to 27mm (according to the Juncker, JFS and F&BL types). 
 Known makers are :  
 - Juncker of Berlin (particularity, the back plate is not magnetic) 
 - Gebrüder Wegerhoff of Lüdenscheid (GWL) 
 - Josef Feix & Sohn of Gablonz (JFS) 
 - Funcke & Brunninghaus of Lüdenscheid (F&BL) 
 - Friedrich Linden of Lüdenscheid (FLL) 
 - Rudolf Souval of Wien (RS) 
 - ArbeitGemeinschaft Metal und Kunstoff of Gablonz (AGMuK) 
 - Hymen & Co of Lüdenscheid (H&CL L/53) 
 - No mark
Presentation, Wear and Documents 


 Presentation of the badge was made by the company, Battalion or Regimental Commander (or equivalent). On March 26, 1944, Adolf Hitler reserved the right to personally present the close combat bar in gold as ""the highest infantry decoration"". On August 30, 1944, the gold class recipients were automatically presented the German cross in gold and were permitted to spend 21 days at home.

The Close Combat Badge decoration was to be worn 1 centimeter above the ribbon bar or mounted group. When more than one grade was presented to the same individual, only the highest grade was to be worn (though the recipient kept all grades in his possession).

An award document was given to the soldier (different types exist, it depending on the unit), and there was an entry in his Soldbuch attended with a detailed list of his combat days (unit, date, location). 
 The close combat bar was presented in a cardboard box or in celluloid .
 Below is Hpt. Erhard LISS, 5./Sturm.Rgt.195 Ritterkreuz on April 30, 1945. He wears among other decorations the Silver Close Combat Bar . (Coll.Calero)
Award Criteria


 The badge was presented based on the number of combat days as follows, 
Bronze class for 15 combat days 
Silver class for 30 combat days 
Gold class for 50 combat days 

Criteria for a combat day was as follows, 

All combat days in which the soldier had the opportunity to be close enough to ""see the white of the enemy's eyes"", use close combat weapons to assault the enemy man-to-man and be victorious.   

Days in which the soldier was part of a mayor attack or assault, reconnaissance attack, defense of a position, or single messenger run.

These actions could take place in the front line or in the rear (against Partisans).

The initial combat days were established taking in count the uninterrupted time of engagement on the Eastern front since June 22 of 1941, or in Africa since March 26 of 1943 :  

15 months = 15 combat days  

12 months = 10 combat days  

8 months = 5 combat days  

 This decoration was also awarded posthumously, in which case both decoration and certificate were sent to the next of kin. The Division commander was also able authorize the award to a wounded soldier who, because of permanent injury, would no longer have the opportunity to complete the minimum days, provided he completed the following, 

Bronze Class - 10 days minimum  

Silver Class - 20 days minimum 

Gold Class - 40 days minimum  

The Close Combat Bar was also awarded to members of the Luftwaffe, though it would later replaced by the Luftwaffe Close Combat Bar (Few is known about this badge, and no picture exist of its wear).  

This article be not complete without a mention of the gold bar presentation.  According to Manfred Dörr's book on this subject, about 600 gold bar were awarded.  The bar was in every respect the same design than the other classes, but gilded - a special fire gilded badge does exist.  This badge was presented during an official ceremony, directly by Hitler then by Himmler and Guderian."

The Laserguard platform is particularly effective on compact pistols such as the SIG .380. As the gun's sight radius is reduced, it becomes much more difficult to align conventional sights effectively, particularly under high stress or low light. With a Laserguard, sight radius becomes irrelevant. The LG-492 provides a sleek, integrated sighting system, using our patented instinctive activation system.  As with all other Crimson Trace products, the LG-492 is proudly designed, engineered and made in the USA.

I have a BNIB, never fired *RARE* Springfield Hi-Cap 1911 .45ACP Milspec/GI pistol.  These are no longer made by Springfield-Armory.  This pistol holds 13+1 rounds of .45ACP!!!

I am a 1911 collector and have almost 30 in my collection and this one was going to be a full tactical build that never materialized.  The pistols grip is that of approximately less than a Glock 21.  Very comfortable IMO!

Purchased brand new in 2008, cleaned/lubed and stored in a climate controlled safe since purchase.  This pistol is not parkerized like the specification states, it is finished in Armory-Kote; which is an updated finish. (Came that way from the factory).  Also, has front strap serrations for a positive grip.  This gun uses standard Mec-gar/Para-Ordnance P14 mags.

Comes with everything it did brand new.  Shipping only to FFL or FTF with KY residents with a valid DL and CCDW license.  You pay actual shipping charges to your FFL.

I may be open to trades for other quality 1911's or other guns depending on what you have to offer.  

***  I will not even consider trades on Charles Daly, Armscor, RIA, Taurus, Ruger, Para, Hi-Point and the like.  No series 80 1911's either!

I will consider some Kahr, S&W M&P's, XDm's and some other select polymer pistols as well, chambered in .45ACP. (I may ask for cash in addition to your trade as well).

Price does not include shipping to your FFL or transfer; which will be your responsibility.

This rifle was made in the late 1940's, and has attracted quite a following amongst collectors. This example was a ""pawn shop rescue"", mechanically sound but abused and neglected by a previous owner. The stock and some of the bluing has since been refinished. As shown in the picture below, there is a crack in the wrist of the stock, on the left side, which was repaired during restoration. The crack is now completely stable, stronger than the surrounding wood, and only a minor aesthetic detraction. If there are any questions about the restoration or about the rifle in general, I will be happy to answer them or provide more pictures as necessary.

I really hate to sell this rifle but it has been sitting in my safe for 13 years +. I have $1,400 invested back in 1999 but I will be selling it for a reasonable price at today's rate. Here are the particulars: Remington 700 action custom tuned entails bolt & lugs lapped and bolt trued (blueprinted). All custom work done by Gruning precision. 26"" stainless fluted cryoed barrel, stock trigger that has been tuned. The standard hard rubber butt pad was replaced with a Kick Ease pad. While the H&S stock is aluminum bedded the old design was lacking so it was also aluma bedded for a rock solid platform.  It has never been hunted and has less than 100 range rounds of reloaded recipes put down the pipe. Comes with Forster Bench Rest Die set reloading dies , 40 rnds of brass , box of 20 federal factory ammo, manual and hard case to go with it. I have the perfect recipe for this gun. The harmonics of the barrel are beautiful and with my custom loads it is common to put the bullet down the .25 MOA at 100 yrds, and within 4 inch groups at 700 to 1000 yrds.
