Until you’ve held and shot a Marlin, you don’t know what a lever-action rifle can be. The ultra-smooth cycling and solid feel are created through a superior receiver design, the finest materials and a flawless meshing of these high-quality components. To produce our trademark excellence, our lever actions are built to strict tolerances rivaling those used to craft custom rifles. Further, all major components of the action are machined from heat-treated, solid steel forgings. The Marlin lever action’s swift pointing characteristics, lightning-fast follow-ups, reliability and inherent accuracy have made it America’s favorite. And what started with the invention of the first flat-top, side-eject receiver in 1889 has led us to pioneer every major advancement in the lever-action category since.

A must-have for every gun collector. It has been in continuous production longer than any other rifle in America. Is it the tack-driving accuracy, superb looks or centerfire-like heft that’s made it such a historical fixture? Yes, in all respects, the Model 39A is incomparable to any rimfire in the world today. Remarkably, it can be disassembled in seconds with only a coin. Thanks to Micro-Groove® rifling, a special process that produces less bullet distortion and a better gas seal, this rifle punches tiny groups most other 22s can’t touch. The stock is crafted of genuine American black walnut and adorned with fine cut checkering. It has a rebounding hammer and a hammer-block safety.

It has a set of Pierce Rubber combat grips installed, and the original checkered wood grips are with it, too. This is a MADE IN AMERICA 1911, not from the Philipines or Turkey as so many new 1911's are now. I am asking $650 cash or will consider trades. Following is an article about the gun I found online for your consideration: 

Auto-Ordnance Thompson 1911-A1 World War II Parkerized, .45 ACP 5"" Barrel, Parkerized Finish, 7 Round Magazine

After almost 20 years, still remain hand assembled, American made and produced with finest 4140 steel. For a multitude of purposes; home defense, competition or recreational shooting. WWII Parkerized Basic military version. Features original G.I. detailing throughout right down to the military style rollstamp, plasticgrips and lanyard loop.

Out of the box, the Auto-Ordnance 1911 looks to be a newly manufactured twin to a World War II 1911A1 with some exceptions. The finish is similar to that used by the 1911 manufacturers during WWII, which was either a Parco-Lubrite finish, a manganese-based phosphating process used by Colt, or Parkerizing, which uses a zinc base. The Parker Rustproof Company of Detroit, Michigan developed both processes. The more familiar green-and-gray-hued finish fond on many U.S.WWII military arms came later.

The grip panels are checked brown plastic and the arched mainspring housing has the obligatory lanyard loop. The sights are identical to the WWII guns, with small ramped front and square notch rear. The Auto-Ordnance uses a seven-round Metalform magazine with the normal flat-shelf follower but with an easily removable metal base plate. (The Metal Form Corporation made magazines during WWII, but I''m not sure if the current company and the historical company share a lineage.)

The slide serrations are slanted as is found on Drake-manufactured National Match slides and also the Colt Gold Cup model, rather than running vertically, as on the original. The ejection port window is lower (that is, larger) than on the WWII guns. The Auto-Ordnance 1911 uses a long, grooved 1911 trigger rather than the short, stamped 1911A1 trigger, and the frame is scalloped behind the triggerguard as is normal for 1911A1 pistols."

I have a S&W 317.  This is an 8 shot 22lr and it weighs 11oz.  I've got the box and papers.  I've changed the rebound spring (trigger spring) to a 14# and the hammer spring to a 9#.  I have the S&W springs and I can put them back in with the help of Arnold Schwarzenegger if you so desired.  I have a set of Barami grips on it.  These are the kind with the lip that you can tuck in your waistband without a holster.  The original grips are in the box.   Overall, light and very, very concealable.   I've put about 800 rounds through it.  I bought one for my wife and liked it so much that I bought one for myself.  Now I want something else.  I belong to a club in Efland so if you desired to try it out you’d be welcome to.   I do have an NCDL and CCW  I want $490.

It belonged to a guy who was an officer in the Marines and kept it as a home defense weapon. The gun was made in 1998/1999 according to SA via a serial number look up. The previous owner hardly put any rounds through it according to my FFL and the gun looked to reflect that. There are some scratches and marring that occurred from use. I took it to the range after completely stripping and cleaning it and put 200 rounds through it no problems at all. The recoil in these things is pretty light for a .45 most likely due to its weight.

It is a very solid, well made gun as most 1911's are. Included is the original box (one of the hinges is broken), manuals, 2 magazines, stock wood grips, and a new pair of SA wooden grips that were take offs from a new 1911.

The gun worked perfectly, zero problems, and is a good reputation of the 1911. Unfortunately despite its appeal with gun owners I was not too impressed. Shooting it after shooting my S+W M&P was like night and day in terms of ergonomics which I suppose is not a surprise considering the 100 years between the designs.

Any forend that will fit on the older, longer forend tube will fit. The barrel is original and was a 30'' full choke but it has been cut down to 24''.

I have a very nice lightly used Springfield Champion Loaded version Lightweight Parkerized 1911 45 caliber pistol for sale/trade without the rail.  It is the commander version with a 4 inch match grade barrel, Tritium night sights, 3 - 7 round magazines, factory 3.5 lb trigger, cocobola (sp?) wood grips, quick loader tool, manual, and original SA case.  I have owned this gun for over 12 months and it has been my primary carry weapon.  It is very accurate and has been serviced by Springfield Armory in the last 9 months.  It was sent back for a failure to eject issue, which has been resolved by SA polishing the barrel feed ramp, replacing the extractor, and testing the function.  I have shot approximately 250 rounds through it since receiving it back from SA with no issues.  I love this gun and the 1911 line, but am looking to get a Springfield XDM.  Unfortunately, I do not have the cash to outright purchase a new XDM at the moment.  There is some minor holster wear on this 1911.

This will come with an OWB leather holster (cost $69) for the right trade.  The sell value of this gun is in the range of $700 without the holster.

I also have a Mossberg 12 Gauge with the 28in field barrel that I would be willing to trade as an alternative plus some cash on my part if need be for the right trade as well.  

I am only interested in the Springfield XDM compact (mid-size) 40-45 caliber, maybe an XD plus cash from you. 

Cash price: $700 Or Best Reasonable Offer

This is a harder to find variation of the M39, which is one of the most accurate of the milsurp rifles. It is chambered in the ever plentiful and affordable 7.62x54r cartridge and it is a tack driver. I don't believe that this rifle was ever issued, as it is claimed the B barrels were made in Nazi Occupied Belgium at the FN plant and never made it to Finland before the war ended. This rifle is in great shape, the stock is beautiful with a few handling marks. The barrel is in excellent condition and most of the bluing remains. Numbers match and this Finn was built on a 1913 Izhevsk receiver, so it turns 100 years next year! $400 obo have some ammo and chargers to throw in as well. Prefer local deals, will drive within reason or ship for the right deal."

The 8 rd Power mags are the best 1911 mags around and they sell for $25 each plus shipping, the 10rd tactical mags sell for $28 each plus shipping, plus you get 5 brand new Wilson Combat recoil springs valued at $5 each and 2 holsters plus all the original factory parts. So for one of the best 1911 and most accurate you can get with all these extra I say for $1300 you are getting a great deal."

This one is the type normally found in credit unions and banks and variously called ""teller boxes"" and ""cash tray drawers"" due to their larger size compartments. 

Unit is rectangular in shape, there are six (6) doors - three (3) to each side of the center and placed top-to-bottom. All doors are keyed separately. This is not a thick-walled, heavy safe. It can be used as a lockable storage for valuables; just set it up on a stout end table or closer to floor and ""conceal"" it. It is heavy, but still very transportable until you add your stuff (weight). Could also be used for a built-in application - like banks do. 

Approx. exterior size is 32 1/2"" long X 16"" high X 24"" long. Again, there are six (6) lockable compartments of 15 3/4"" X 5"" X 24"" EACH so these have a lot of room. All have their own lockable door and safe-deposit style keys. Also, each drawer has it's own set of keys. They are keyed separately. 

This is a used, commercial-grade unit and perfect for handguns, ammo and other valuables.

Ok i found a Pistol i Really want for sale but it wont last long.  This AR was built on RRA website for 3 gun matches and ordered with the features i wanted. Features include- Light weight barrel, Tan operator Stock, Quad Rail, Detachable Front sight, RRA tactical Muzzle break, Chromed Bolt and components, Chromed Two Stage Trigger, Dual Loop, Tan houge grip, Flat top, BCM gunfighter charging handle with large latch, Winter trigger guard.  I also added a Magpul fore Grip, Dawson Precision Mag well, 3 Magpul mags with tactical but plates, 5 Military issued mags, Surefire Wepon light with IR filter and external pressure switch. The rifle has no rear sight. This gun has exactly 36 rounds through it of Federal ammo. Still have factory paperwork and warranty card.  The gun is FLAWLESS and 36 rounds from being new.  Was built to be lightweight for 3 gun matches.  I have approximately 290 rounds of Federal brass  cased ammo and about 300+ rounds of silver/brown bear ammo from the last AR. Over 2,000$ in this package + ammo. 

For the gun as it came from factory price is $1400 FIRM. 

If you want all the accessories pictured and listed with Ammo $2000 Firm.
If you add what all the accessories will cost to buy it new you will see that i am giving a very generous price break for 36 rounds though the gun. Accessories would pass for new since only 1 magpull mags was used to shoot 5 rounds.

Unless U are offering a new TRP at this point for trade i would like to have 1600 cash with $400 trade. Dont shy away from offering anything below but i would really like to have the TRP that i found. Thanks"

Like all 10/22 Takedown™ rifles, the barrel and forend are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy.

The friction-fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but rarely needs re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The USA Shooting Team Ruger 10/22 Takedown™ is also shipped in a special red ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features the USA Shooting Team logo. The bag features internal sleeves, which hold the two subassemblies.

External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

I have all the original parts that can be easily reinstalled if prefered. I have 5-8rd Chip McCormick brand new Power mags that have never been used, 3-10 rd Chip McCormick brand new Tactical mags that have never been used, 2- 10 rd Colt mags that have been used very little, 3- 8 rd colt mags that have been used very little. I have 5 brand new never installed heavy duty Wilson Combat recoil springs (recommended to change every 2000 rds). I have a BlackHawk close quarter concealment holster, a Fobus mag holder, and a full size leather holster with the over the hammer snap. This Gold Cup has the throated match grade barrel and Bo Mar adjustable sights and has been shot very little. This has been the most accurate pistol I have ever shot and I'm in no hurry to sell it so please no low ball offers. I am willing to trade for other guns but guns should add up to equal value. If interested let me know what you have I can email pics of the extras. 

Buds gun shop which is the lowest price you can find for guns lol sells the blued used Colt Gold Cup for 950, so a used stainless is well worth $1000 then you have the mag well, extended safety and release, guide rod, beavertail grip safety, extended mag release and wrap around grips is valued at well over $150 not including the price to install them. The 8 rd Power mags are the best 1911 mags around and they sell for $25 each plus shipping, the 10rd tactical mags sell for $28 each plus shipping, plus you get 5 brand new Wilson Combat recoil springs valued at $5 each and 2 holsters plus all the original factory parts. So for one of the best 1911 and most accurate you can get with all these extra I say for $1300 you are getting a great deal."

It's a great gun, this is my second RIA and I will tell you the trigger on this one is a dream! It has had a trigger job as well as a new hammer and barrel bushing installed. Comes with 2 mags, one kimber and another that says shooting star, both worked flawlessly. It also comes with two holsters one is a Front Line IWB holster (leather) the other is a Blackhawk Serpa holster. I had no issues with the gun and really enjoyed it, I am just trying to free up some cash for a larger purchase. 

It has a slight idiot mark. I took a picture of it in macro mode on my camera. It shows up just about as much as you can see it with your own eyes. VERY light mark. 

I am going to be heading to the Gun show tomorrow at the Gwinnett fair grounds and would be willing to meet there or just about anywhere else down 85 from the perimeter to the Hamilton Mill exit. Pretty flexible as far as meeting up goes. I have no problem with trades but would really just prefer the cash. Price is somewhat firm. You could not go out and get a RIA like this for anywhere near this price. I can tell you the trigger job alone makes it worth getting over a brand new one having bought a brand spanking new RIA and now seeing the difference between a stock trigger pull and the 3.5 lb on this gun I can tell you it's amazing."
