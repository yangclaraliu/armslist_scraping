This car is in great condition. Very clean inside and out. I have owned this car since it had 85,000 miles and it still runs just as well now as it did when I got it. I attribute this to the well built 2.4 l. twin cam engine and I have always used a synthetic blend engine oil and changed it on schedule. Transmission shifts great. This car runs strong and has great acceleration and I would trust it to drive my family anywhere.

This pistol in an Uberti 1875 Outlaw. It has a nickel finish and a 7.6 inch barrel. It is chanbered in .45 lc and is new and unfired in the box. A very attractive pistol. Here is a little info on the pistol.

Remington entered the cartridge revolver market in 1875 when it introduced a big-frame, Army-style revolver—a six-shooter—to compete with the Colt Peacemaker. The 1875 Remington single actions kept the solid frame and overall styling of Remington’s 1858 percussion models. Ordinary citizens and Old West lawmen alike recognized the sturdy quality of the new Remington revolvers. The infamous Frank James even carried one for most of his outlaw career.

I have for sale a Smith and Wesson Model 36, one of the most popular snub nosed revolvers ever. It's a .38 caliber, holds 5 rounds and is excellent for concealed carry. In fact, at one point they were the standard issue revolver for New York City police detectives. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson_Model_36)

Not only has it provided a lifetime of service to real law enforcement people, but it's made numerous appearances on both the small and silver screen. http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson_Model_36#Smith_.26_Wesson_Model_36_.22Chiefs_Special.22

Anyway, it's a great shooter, but I just don't use it that much. I thought it might be time to sell it and move on. I'll sell it as part of a set which includes: 

-Smith and Wesson 36 revolver
-60 rounds of .38 special (Winchester ""white box"".)
-2 HKS Speedloaders (#36, especially designed for this gun.)
-Uncle Mike's IWB holster with retention strap (size 36, especially made with the S&W in mind.)
-6 .38 snap caps. Good for storage and dry firing practice."

charles daly rabbit ear 12 gauge shotgun. the only markings i can find on this whole shotgun is ""charles daly"" on each side of the action, ""NO. 997"" on the trigger gaurd which i beleive is the serial number, ""997"" on the foregrip, and ""997"" on the bottom of the barrel.  i think their is a proof mark down in the action where the barrel locks in that is a figure ""8"".  all the ""997""s mean its all original. im not sure the age, but i have researched what i could online and it appears to be a late 1800's shotgun. 

the  barrel has surface rust on the outside and looks rough.

the foregrip looks to be in good condition. it has a dark finish on the wood and shows age with discolor and wear on the wood and the metal. 

the action looks to be in good condition for the age. the right side firing pin appears to be broken. their is play between the barrel and the action. the front trigger is broken off about half way down.  it would not be safe to shoot this shotgun in its current condition, but fixing it might hurt the value.

the stock looks decent toward the rear but at the action its cracked. someone has wrapped it with some kind of tape a long time ago. you can tell the tape has been on a long time. i dont know how bad the crack is but holding the stock and barrel i cant feel any play where its cracked, so it may not be too bad.

this would make a great display gun on  a mantel or wall. it doesnt look like its ever been messed with. all finishes look original. it has a good old look to it.

 For gun fans out there Hickock45 tested this against an Arsenal and there is no difference in performance; he chose the WASR over the Arsenal because of price. IMO Arsenal is overpriced and WASR is underpriced should be the same, like glock and springfield, but glock was first so more expensive (xd is just as reliable with quality parts as glock and better customer service and less expensive. Just food for thought)."

It has all the proper markings and proof/acceptance marks.  It is mechanically excellent and everything functions. (I test-fired it when I first bought it.)  Cosmetically I would rate it at around 80 percent. The finish is intact throughout the gun, although somewhat worn as expected, except for the front strap, where most of the finish is gone. (I have lots of pictures I can provide.)

The complete matching serial number (6771j) is marked on the slide, left side of the frame (along with the” eagle 359” acceptance proof) and on the front of the barrel lug. The locking lug is marked ""771J"" on the bottom, the number ""1"" and eagle firing proof on the left side, and the ""eagle 359"" acceptance proof on the right side. No import marks.

The left side of the slide is marked ""P.38"" next to ""ac 42"" and then the serial number “6771j”. The right side of the slide has a single eagle firing proof flanked by two ""eagle 359"" acceptance proofs of the Walther factory.

The barrel is marked “6771j” on the front of the barrel lug, with an “eagle 359” proof on the left side of the front lug and an eagle firing proof on the left side of the rear lug. The bore is bright and shiny, lands and grooves are strong. There is some very slight - and I mean slight - pitting in the bore. Or it may just be machine marks, I am honestly not sure but want to call it out.

The magazine is marked “P.38” on the left side near the bottom, and “eagle 359” on the spine near top.

The grips are mottled brown ribbed Bakelite, in perfect condition except for a tiny scratch (not a crack) around ½’ long on right grip near the top. No chips or cracks. Each grip has two circular markings inside: “38 Z3” at top inside on both grip,s “P 1528 6” on the inside bottom of the right grip, and “P1529 4” on the inside bottom of the left grip.

Also included is a handbook published by Ray Riling Books.

Asking $735 (cashier’s check or money order) shipped to your FFL, or shipped to you if you have a valid C&R. No trades. This is a final sale, so please ask any questions before committing. I have a lot of other photos (more than 20) if you need them; provide me with your email address and I will send them to you.

It is in excellent condition, and has seen about 500 rounds through it. It has all of the great features of an AR, while shooting the powerful (and economical) 5.45 round. At this time, surplus 7N6 Russian ammo is at about .14 per round...This gun is based around a Spikes Tactical 5.45 upper, which are regarded as the ""cream of the crop"" of 5.45's.

Here's the list of features and accessories included with this gun:

-Spikes Tactical dedicated Melonite treated flat top upper, and 5.45 bolt carrier group  (for maximum corrosion resistance when using surplus ammo),
-Ballistics Advantage chromed 16"" carbine length barrel , fitted with a faux suppressor.
-Magpul MOE handguard in black
-Rock River A2 style front sight, and Magpul BUIS flip up rear iron sights
-Spikes ST-T2 carbine buffer and Advanced buffer spring -
-PWS buffer tube with ambidextrous QD swivel stud mounts
-Magpul CTR buttstock in OD Green
-PCF lightweight polymer lower with Spikes Advanced lower receiver parts kit installed
-Magpul BAD lever
- Hogue ergonomic grip in OD Green

Accessories/extras included:

-Original buffer spring and buffer
-Lower receiver replacement springs
-Original plastic AR grip  
-(4) C-products metal 30rd 5.45 magazines
-(3) Magpul PMAG Maglevel polymer 30rd magazines in OD with Ranger plates

This is an awesome gun. Easy and cheap to shoot and looks great.

I'm asking $925 cash for it, which is far less than I paid for everything included. Everything is top quality, and I've taken meticulous care of it. The treated upper is far more durable than any of the other 5.45 uppers out there (S&W, Adams Arms), and aren't easy to come by.

I'm willing to do a little friendly negotiating on price, but I won't entertain ridiculous offers. If you make an offer, all I can say is ""NO"", right??

Possible trades:
Sig 556 SWAT
Sig M400
Sig 226 or 229 Enhanced Elite in 9mm or .40
Beretta PX4 Full or Compact (+ cash) in 9mm or .40

This saiga runs flawlessly and has never had any issues functioning. This saiga is just like any AK should be. It is extremely reliable and shoots tight groups at 100 yards. Included is one ten round magazine. This saiga is well worth my asking price. I have seen them sell for much more. If you are looking for a beautiful russian akm then look no further. I am downsizing my collection a bit so this one must go. The round count is low and it has never had any issues. This is an amazing AK. Please no lowball offers. My price is firm at $500. You won't find another saiga in this configuration for this price. This saiga does accept 30 round saiga magazines. It accepts standard ak magazines as well. The addition of a bullet guide may be necessary for standard ak magazines to run reliably. This is a $15 dollar part if you decide to go that route. Thanks for looking.

This rifle is LNIB, and appears to have only been fired at the factory.   It is in excellent condition!

This gun will accept Sig P226, Beretta 92/M9, and SW Model 59 magazines, as I have the mag release blocks for all three.  They are designed by KelTec to be easily interchangeable, and can be swapped out by unscrewing two small set screws on the magazine release button.  I will set it up for whichever platform you choose, prior to purchase.

If you own a SW59, Beretta or Sig P226, then this rifle is the perfect complement to your carry weapon, as not only the ammo is interchangeable, but so are your magazines.  Super High Capacity Magazines (30 rounders) are available online for the Beretta, SW and Sig options at websites such as CDNNinvestments.com, or cheaperthandirt.com, which will allow you to run with some serious firepower in this carbine.  This thing will fold in half, and measures a whopping 16 inches long!  Fits in a backpack, a laptop bag and even into some of the larger camelback pouches!  Perfect trail hiking gun, survival gun, etc.   Why take that Henry stowaway 22 when you can pack the punch of a 9mm rocketing out of a 16 inch barrel!  It packs the same terminal ballistics as a 357 at the muzzle, due to the increased barrel length!

Must have valid Photo ID and be over the age of 18 to buy.  Must be willing to sign a bill of sale in order to buy this gun. 

Rifle will convey with the Kel Tec box, manual, lock tool, receiver screw tool, (1) Sig P226 adapter, (1)Beretta adapter, (1) SW adapter, (1)SW 10rd mag, and I'll even throw in (4) Beretta mags as well.  

Local FTF only please.  No lowball offers, please.  Before contacting me with a ludicrous offer, please go on gunbroker and check out the ""Buy it Now"" price for 9MM Subs.  Not entertaining trades, unless you're offering a comparably valued QUALITY optic.  Mainly looking for cash or a reflex or red dot sight for an M4."

It comes with everything from the factory (including 2 15 round mags). I will also throw in a 50 round box of good self defense ammo. I'm really looking to trade for another pistol, but nothing smaller in caliber than a 9mm. Something interesting is a definite plus. Or, if you'd like to buy it, I'll sell for 575obo. I don't have pictures because it's abrand new gun. Just google ""glock 20"". The 10mm round is outstanding and powerful.

Savage model 93 R17 in 17 HMR WITH accu trigger, 3x9x32 Center Point Illuminated Mil-Dot Reticle scope all in like new condition.  Less than 3 rounds fired!!!!   2-boxes of 50 Winchester SUPREME V-Max shells 17 HMR = 100 rounds.

The Model 93 is one of Savage’s rimfire line. The 93R17 is the .17 HMR variant. It leaves the factory with a heavy barrel,  a 5-round detachable magazine and scope bases pre-installed. The nicely shaped stock with its hard plastic buttplate has it going on!

The Savage 93's heavy contour barrel has a 1-9” twist. It’s 21? long, bringing the rifle’s overall length right up to 39.5?. Thanks to the relatively long (for a rimfire) and heavy barrel, the 93 tips the scales at around six pounds (sans scope, rings, and sling). It’s a bit “nose heavy,” but not uncomfortably so. Nor does the balance impose any irregular handling characteristics.
The Savage 93's box magazine is a single-stack design that holds five rounds of ammo, allowing a 5+1 loadout. Push the release and the magazine drops free. 
Savage’s Accu-trigger is an amazing innovation; the 93R17's go pedal is no exception. An average of 10 trigger pulls showed a trigger weight of 2lbs-9.5oz with a standard deviation of only 2 oz. Obviously, Savage built this trigger to inspire accuracy and precision. The 93R17 models have a push button safety located on the upper right-hand portion of the receiver, similar to those on Remington 700’s. 
For varmint hunting, the .17HMR is the hands down winner. It has double the speed (2550 f.p.s. vs 1250 f.p.s. of 22), packs 245 ft-lbs of energy (vs 150 ft-lbs), and can effectively reach out to 200 yards. Prairie dogs don’t stand a chance…

The black finish on the screws are highly scratch resistant, seems to be a black chrome finish. Made of new USA made Mil spec government approved 550 7 strand Paracord. There is a total of about 90 feet of paracord in this sling. In an emergency you can unravel the outer 45 feet of cord and still have a useful black sling. 

The USA made paracord is manufactured to Mil-C-5040H Type III standards. This paracord has seven removable inner strands. Each of the 7 strands of 100% nylon strands are made from two-ply yarns. This is certainly not the lower quality paracord that is made from bulk fibers. Each of these 7 strands are capable of holding 50 pounds. The outer cord is made from 32 strands which are braided together and can hold 200 pounds. Add it up (50x7 + 200) and the cord can hold 550 lbs, therefore it is truly 550 paracord. 

Paracord is like duck tape and has unlimited uses only limited by your imagination. The 7 inner strands can also be removed and used for things like fishing line, or sewing thread.

I usually sell them for $50, but they are now just $25.00. Shipping is only $3.00 per order. I also take Pay-pal or can meet in Louisville or Shelbyville.

The MX-1 is the world's smallest, lightest, simplest-to-use and most rugged production thermal imager. It incorporates digital signal processing with integrated compact optics and rugged packaging with attention to ergonomic detail. It has been designed to endure the rigors of outdoor use, occasional rough handling, and accidental submersion for a few minutes in shallow water. Even with its small design, the image quality is not compromised and maintains high performance at an unparalleled value.
     The MX-1 provides the Firefighter or Security Officer with Thermal Detection capabilities just by reaching into a pocket. Your hands have better things to do than carry large cameras. Easily find your way through the thickest of smoke, render fog useless and see through camouflage and shadows.
     The ""Top-of-the-Shelf"" Amorphous Silicon Microbolometer Technology found inside the MX-1 is what permits the imager to be so small and light. Measuring only 5 inches across and weighing only 13 ounces with the battery, the MX-1 easily fits into the palm of a hand or pocket, perfect for covert operations or convenience."
