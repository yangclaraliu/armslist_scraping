They do make aftermarket 5 and 10 round mags and are available just about anywhere.I am also including 900 rounds of ammo to help you get started. I bought this form the original owner a couple of years ago at a gun show and never really use it. It still needs a rear peep sight disc, about $10 and a hood and hood spring to keep it in place, about $10 each part and can even be bought on ebay. I just never got around to getting this done since I have several others that I shoot. I am asking $400 for it and can meet within a resonable distance. I live in the high desert near victorville but do travel to riverside weekly so I can arrange a meeting place in several different places. This is C&R qualified so it is cash and carry. Even though everyone is scrambling to get AR's and AK's, these go off the cash and carry list and must be registered in 2014. This will be the last year for these as well before you have to go down and register every long rifle you buy or sell, no matter what the age. Gotta love how our rights are slowly being taken away. Any ways, any question or concerns feel free to email me. Thanks and have a great New Year!"

What I would really like is to trade this for a 1911 style of equal value.  If not I'll sell it for $800 firm.  Would like to do the transfer in a Sacramento area gun shop. Thanks for looking.  Here is a youtube video that gives a quick run down.

I am getting a lot of hits from people that want to offer less or do the deal somewhere else.  I say again....I am firm on price.....I want to do the deal in Sacramento. I would rather trade for a 1911 but if not I'll sell for 800 bucks.  If I can't get that I'll keep it, don't waste my time our yours.  This weapon is worth 800 to me.  If you want to spend 5 or 6 hundred there are plenty of brand new firearms out there nowhere near the quality."

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of Sig's popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm. The SP2022 – the only polymer framed pistol engineered to perform, built to protect and good enough to be called a SIG SAUER."

QCB stands for quick change barrel you can change calliber in less than 90 seconds and the barrel even quicker. This allows you a range of options such as a medium size briefcase to carry it in since you can break it down. There is NO barrel nut it uses a cam system to lock the free floating barrel in place. The person behind this is the same guy pushing all the AR development for the last 20 to 30 years he was with bushmaster and I think armalite. Now keep in mind I have seen a video of one of these go from 556 caliber all the way to a 50cal so no worries as far as if it can hold up. I would like to get as much as I can for it obviously I was thinking with the state of things $1200 but let me know just make sure before you contact me you have thought it through and want it so we dont waste each others time.

Everyone has their own opinion and I feel like what I have here is a very practical, personal defense weapon.

What I have is a brand new Sig Sauer P250 9mm mounted into a Enhanced Sig Sauer Adaptive Carbine Platform (ACP). The ACP is a great building block with rails in the 6, 9, & 12 oclock position which are compatiable almost any tactical accessory of your choice. There is already a brand new Sig Sauer STS-081 Red Dot Sight installed.

I was going to add the STL-300J for the fore grip with flashlight/strobe light and laser. Get some high capacity mags and I think that this would make this a really mean looking and functionable tactical weapon that would be great in a close quarter combat. I think that they also offer a folding stock and that most noise suppressors with fit this platform. 

Some say this setup is heavy, just carry a pistol instead but this setup is more accurate, ready for combat plus its really no more heavy than any other PDW with all the needed accessories and ammo during an emergency. I own a few weapons including an AR which I think is great but if you cant find one, they are too expensive, or they get banned then this setup is a great alternative as it can offer the same tactical features as other Personal Defense Weapons. 

Also what I think is important is during a real world life emergency is available ammo, 9mm ammo is much more readily available right now and if/when other defense weapon ammo can not be found this could bail you out. I know that I have more 9mm ammo than anything else and if I was in a pinch Im sure that someone would be more likely to help me if I needed some more.

This is a great, brand new setup that has never been fired, if youre interested in seeing one in action check out the Sig video by going to this link: http://www.sigsauer.com/Catalog/acp-adaptive-carbine-platform.aspx"

Very Nice Calico M100 with collapsible stock(These are damn rare). The magazine for this was broken during a move. They are selling now for $100 plus shipping so take that off the value. Any Calico .22lr Magazine will fit properly. Found here on armslist for $115 shipped. Standard Magazine is 100RD CAPACITY!! On the net this carbine averages between $600 and $900 one as high as $1595(that guy is crazy).

Taking best offer if under $325 don't bother, thank you

Also included is an eotech 512 model that takes double A batteries. The diodes in the eotech are fading a bit. It's hard to see them in heavy light. I'm not particularly sure what the issue is but it could be a battery connection problem or it could need to be refurbished by eotech. From what I have been told, if the sight is in warranty, it will be replaced or repaired for free. If it's not, it will cost you $58 to have it completely refurbished. Nonetheless, it still works fine in lower levels of light. Also included is a Vector Optics green laser. This is a very high quality laser and is extremely bright. The laser alone cost me a pretty penny. Also included will be one, 50 round magazine. I will consider partial trades for steel AK magazines, 7.62x39, and perhaps a few other things that I need. Sell will occur in or around the Salisbury area. I will ship the rifle if you are from another state but it will be at your cost.

The P229® is one of the most popular law enforcement pistols available today. Its nearly indestructible design outlasts, and out performs, other pistols so much so that after extensive testing with over 3,000,000 rounds fired, the Dept. of Homeland Security’s office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) selected the P229 over pistols from five other major manufacturers. Now the P229 is the standard duty pistol for not just DHS but also the U.S. Coast Guard, and is carried by other federal agencies that we aren’t permitted to discuss.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. In use by the US Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few; the P226 has continually proven itself. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this high capacity full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, 40S&W or 357SIG, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. Additional features include a reversible magazine release and easy conversion from 357SIG to 40S&W with SIG SAUER factory replacement barrels.

I have an original pre 1994 AWB (Assault Weapon Ban) Kassnar Import FEG Hungarian SA-85M (AK47 Variant) underfolder that is new in the original box with all its original accesories. Its been taking up too much room for too long and it needs a new home. Its been in the box with each part wrapped in heavy plastic and stored in a climate controlled environment. You will not find a better example of this now rare and collectible AK variant. With an uncertain future looming in firearms legislation on the federal, state and county level, this will certainly become a highly desirable piece to anyones collection. I'm looking to get $3000 for it shipped to your FFL. Trades will be considered but please no ""Tactikool"" or ""Franken AR's and AK's"".

The Walther P99 is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The P99 has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools.
It uses an internal striker as opposed to an external hammer, with a red-painted striker tip that protrudes from rear of the slide when the gun is cocked, as well as a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide.
The original first generation P99 had a traditional Double-Action/Single-Action trigger with a decocker. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Double-Action mode is activated. The trigger travel is 14 mm (0.55 in) long in the Double-Action mode at approximately 35 N (7.9 lbf) trigger pull. On all subsequent shots, the trigger travel is reduced to 5 mm (0.2 in) at 20 N (4.5 lbf) trigger pull. For manually deactivating the Single-Action mode without loading the pistol the P99 features a key or knob on the slide. The Double-Action mode can also be manually activated by moving the slide approximately 10 mm (0.4 in) back.[8] Currently the original trigger is no longer offered and has been replaced by 3 trigger variants.
The striker protrudes visibly and palpably from the back of the slide when the firearm is in a constant partially cocked state. It should however be noted that the striker of the second generation P99QA variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, unless fired, as the firearm is in a constant partially cocked state.
Ergonomics were a key focus in the design of the firearm, and as a result, three interchangeable grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large) to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. This adaptable grip was innovative at the time the P99 was introduced.
The slide and other metal parts of the pistol are Tenifer treated (a nitriding process also used on Glock pistols). The Tenifer finish is between 0.04 mm (0.002 in) and 0.05 mm (0.002 in) in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.[9] The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications),[10] making the P99 particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.[9]
The P99 features four internal safeties, iron sights adjustable for both windage and elevation, tool-less take down, and an ambidextrous magazine release incorporated into the trigger guard.

I am firm on price. I don't really care if I sell this gun or not because its only going to become worth more money. Thanks for looking."

This is a semi-auto version and was one of the last of the open bolt semi-autos manufactured in 1982 before the BATF ruled, due to the ease of converting to full auto, that it was considered a machine gun and subsequently banned in mid 1982 from future production. All of the RPB open bolts produced prior to the ban were Grandfathered in and still remain legal to own. After the 1982 ban, only semi-autos firing from closed bolts were allowed to be produced.

This package includes, The RPB M10 open bolt 9mm pistol stamped with Cobray logo, the original factory Styrofoam packing base with ""INGRAM"" and the Cobray logo formed into it along with the outer cardboard box.   A threaded barrel extension with slotted shroud that has the Cobray logo stamped on the front of the barrel extension(Highlighted in white grease pencil). 9 magazines, 4 original RPB 32 rd, 4 Scherer 36 rd and 1 40 rd.  There are two, 4 mag pouches w/carry sling that have the Cobray logo stamped into the leather on the back.

In addition there is a complete New side cocking upper receiver with threaded barrel and picatinny rail on top.  The pistol has been equipped with an extended mag release and I also have the original mag release lever w/spring if the new owner would want to reinstall it.   Also included is an original RPB Industries Operating Manual No. 2 for the Ingram Submachine Gun with the Cobray logo on the front.   The manual does have a section pertaining to the semi-auto version.

Last but not least is a padded black leather bag with multiple zippered compartments to store all of the items in this package as well as ease of transporting.

I don't care if I sell and don't need money so I'll ignore offers less than I'm asking. I'll consider quality trades, but I'll say ""No"" when you offer me guns for more than what I can buy them for on Gunbroker. If you offer me guns that total $2600 on Gunbroker I'll say ""no""  because it's a lot of work to list these, answer dozens of pointless questions from bored people with nothing better to do, etc. So, if I'm getting trades that need sold instead of cash I'll pass unless I'm improving my position. BTW, I love these guns. I doubt I love whatever you are trying to get rid of. Guns I'm always interested in: FN .5.7, Glocks, Kimber 1911s, PSL-54, Draganuv, Colts, Benelli shotguns....

I have fired this gun 7-8 rounds, cleaned it and put in the safe.  I purchased it new about a year ago.  

The price listed is for the whole package.  

I would consider selling the gun ( WITH original scope AND ammo ) alone for $440, as I wouldn't mind keeping the Nikon scope, bipod and sling for another gun of mine.  

Buy as little or as much as you like.  I'd also consider partial trades for .45ACP pistols ( S&W M/P, XDM, Glock?? )  But would prefer cash.

People, let me lay down the average prices for some of the hyped weapons right now.  Below prices are average for GOOD QUALITY WEAPONS:

Bushmaster AR15 (XM15-E2S) - $900
Romanian AK, WASR10 - $450
SKS - $350-400
Ruger Mini-14 - $750
DPMS AR10 - $1150

This panic will pass just as all the ones before.  Don't buy a weapon you couldn't afford before, and certainly can't afford at twice the price.  Also.. think about the cost of ammo.  Typical AR ammo goes for $0.35 per round at pre-panic prices.  You will have severe buyers remorse when you have to turn around and sell these rifles at half the cost to pay off your credit card bills."

I have many cases on order from many ammo distributers that are telling me now they are looking at April to fill my order, even doubt that. Production is down to a minimum and demand is higher than it has ever been as well as so much uncertainty with anticipated ban and posible civil unrest.

People immidiatly started buying the ammo in massive quantities and just sitting on it after they heard the word ban. I don’t want to rip people off but I would be a fool to give it away and I will be gouged as well when I buy ammo until this crap stops. I have the ammo and if you need it bad enough let me know.
