Really feels like it's buttered up, honestly one of the smoothest draws I've experienced. I have an IWB I wear all the time just like it. Your finish will wear even less than other leather holsters due to them not moving when you move like a leather only would. Unlined Kydex is made for Black Plastic Pistols, not sweet 1911's
The draw is very fast. Some of my friends use them for  IDPA
I carry IWB so much I don't use it, it's maybe been worn once or twice. It's made for a Commander or any 4.25"" BBl 1911. I am very sure you would not care if you have a 4"", being OWB and that is so little of a difference I think you'd be good to go.

Looking to trade my Savage 110 .270 bolt action. Bought from original owner this year. There are only 23 rounds fired through this gun. Looks great the ony blemish on it would be the ""Savage"" on the bolt itself is faded. Took it out to zero the scope this year and it needed no adjustment. Fired 7 rounds through it to test the groupings and scope zero. Dead to nuts, was chasing a soda can at 150 yards with it. Synthetic stock. Tasco scope, sling and hard plastic Plano case included. Health forces me to sell, I couldn't walk around the deer woods if I tried.

Factory Specs (cut and pasted from Ruger's site, may be approximate):
Stock: Hardwood 
Finish: Blued
Rear Sight: Adjustable 
Front Sight: Blade
Barrel Length:18.50"" 
Overall Length:38.00""
Material:Alloy Steel 
Length of Pull: 	13.50""
Weight: 7.00 lbs.
Capacity:5
Grooves:6
Twist: 1:9"" RH
Also has integral scope mounts.

Rifle is used, in excellent condition. I purchased it circa 2001 and put just enough rounds through it to sight in the scope. Only minor wear to finish/moving parts, and the gun functions perfectly - I didn't fire it a lot but I had zero malfunctions.

Comes with:
The aforementioned cheap scope and decent Weaver rings
Leather cheek piece (for the high scope mounting)
An extra pair of adjustable sights (Millet) if you don't like the flimsy factory sight.
Magazines:
2 5-Round Factory Mags
2 10-Round Aftermarket Mags (unknown mfg.)
3 30-Round Aftermarket Mags (one Masen, one Precision Mag Industries, one polymer Ram-Line)
1 40-Round Aftermarket Magazine (Precision Mag Industries)

Regarding the aftermarket mags: they were some of the ones with better reputations during the hi-cap ban, but they are still aftermarket - I've never really used them, some may be fine, some may be finicky, some may require minor filing to make them fit/function properly.

Also comes with 400 + rounds of .223 ammo, mostly US brand ""economy"" ammo (american eagle, UMC), a couple boxes of premium stuff, some czech stuff and some cheap Russian stuff as well. Like I said, I didn't fire it a lot but even the steel jacked Russian rounds seemed to feed fine. Still have the owner's manual lying around somewhere too (I think) not that that's a big deal.

Asking 450.00 for the lot. I'll sell the rifle for less if you don't want the ammo and/or high capacity magainzes and such.

Contact me at REDACTED or REDACTED or REDACTED(ask for room 140 either way) - if you call and i'm not around, by all means leave a message.  I'm in Marana, Arizona (just north of Tucson)."

I am the second owner of the pistol and it is in good shape. The previous owner duracoated it, but did a poor job. The only issue with the gun is that sometimes the slide release will stick. I believe it to just be an issue with the duracoat being a little too thick and causing extra friction. Simple sanding should fix this.  This gun isn’t a looker, but for someone looking for a high capacity .45 1911 shooter, I can think of none better. Included with the gun is a Para hard case and 1 14 round magazine. I have more but I don’t have access to them at the moment.  As for an outright price, I don’t have one, make an offer. And I can add cash for the right trade."

The M22 is the ideal range pistol. The M22 brings you handling and 
performance that is closer to the modern defensive handgun than any other rimfire pistol. Designed for inexpensive high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern pistol practice.
The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a Lothar Walther match barrel, standard on all models, an extremely crisp, 4-lb single-action trigger and adjustable sights.
Each M22 comes with a 10-shot magazine, manual, training target and tools to adjust the front sight and lock the trigger in place."

I do not have any pics up at the moment, but will post them later. Has small handling marks, but glass is great as is the fiber optic rod. Has 5.5 power, with fiber optic collimation and tritium which creates a bright red chevron aiming point. Reticule is specifically calibrated for the trajectory of a 5.56. Look up these scopes online, they have possibly the best glass of all the ACOG's, and go for far more than asking price (even used in the same condition). Fairly firm on the asking price, and will entertain trades of the same value.

The second picture shows exterior flaws as best I could by manipulating the lighting. Under normal conditions it appears as it does in the other pics, I would just rather overstate any of the items flaws than understate them so we can deal with confidence. Also, I am aware that it the base says 3.5, however it is a TA55. From what I understand, Trijicon uses 3.5 (TA11) bases for these optics, as everyone else I know whom owns a TA55 has the same markings on the side. I have also called Trijicon to verify this, so no worries."

This is a high quality Norinco AK47 with proper wood furniture and bakalite handle - A classic icon of Russian weaponry!

These are not the cheap Romanian versions you see flooding the market today. Therefore, they hold their value and are of very high quality (hence the reason Norinco has several contracts with western governments to provide firearms).

What an amazing gun. Fires like a dream. I was able to achieve a 3 in. spread at 150m (which is superb for an AK47). In great condition, fired <200 rounds total.

It has a detachable magazine that holds 5 rounds, it holds 1 in the chamber for a total of 5+1.

I've never met or seen anyone else that had one here in Missouri, or any of the other 4 states I've lived in, it's definitely a wanted item, I've had more offers on this than my AR15 and PS90 combined, so I assume it's a hard to find gun, I've read it has also been discontinued to the civilian market.

It has combat sights on it, is pump action, very fun to shoot, very durable and tough, it's served as my home defense weapon for the last 5 years and has only been taken out to be shot a few times, I'd say about 300 rounds through it since I bought it brand new, I have kept it extremely clean.
I'd say I've cleaned it once a week since I bought it, even if it didn't get shot that week.

Just shoot me an offer with what you have, I'll consider all trades/offers equally.
Prefer to meet face to face, but will ship for the right deal.

I'm not desperate, and I don't need it gone, my girlfriend just wants me to cut down my collection a bit.
Definitely a great gun with a different look to it if you like unique guns or just want to add something funky to your collection.

Chamber Size 3"" Mag.

Shotgun is used, in excellent condition, I've owned it for many years, but seldom fired it (it's not exactly suited for target practice or hunting) - probably put around 20 rounds through it. Only minor wear to blue, mostly some small scratches on the receiver, functions perfectly.

I originally bought the pistol grip model but wasn't happy with it so i replaced the factory grip. The Butler Creek stock isn't as cozy as a fixed stock, but it folds up for concealment, the gun can be fired with it opened or closed, it points ok and (most importantly) it doesn't hurt to shoot.

Comes with approximately 125 rounds of 12 gauge ammo, mostly fiocchi 00 buck, but I've also got a couple of boxes of federal buckshot, some slugs and a little bit of birdshot (that's mostly what i shot). I'll sell the gun for a bit less if for some strange or not so strange reason you don't want ammo.
