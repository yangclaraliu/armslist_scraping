I am selling my CZ model 75 in 9mm for $350 including free shipping to FFL. It is a surplus semi automatic handgun and made in Czechoslovakia. I have only shot 50 rounds through it since I bought it. It does show some wear (see images) around the edges but it will not affect the performance, and it came with one 15 round high cap magazine. Overall condition is Good. Baked Finish. It has new CZ grips, and I will also include the original grips. I don't need to sell it. I just have too many handguns and I want to sell it in order to buy a shotgun. Money order and Paypal preferred.
The gun is at PA 19002. Please let me know if you are interested. Thank you for your time.

SIG Sauer German. 40 Cal Smith and Wesson semi auto pistol. It's excellent condition with less than 500 rounds fired. One of the sweetest trigger double and single action pulls I've seen on a factory pistol. Its never jammed and is quite accurate. It comes w 3 12 round cap factory mags and 1 10 cap magazine, factory case, manual. 1 box of 50 target ammo and the 3 12 round mags are loaded with Winchester Ranger hollow point self defense loads. It comes with a left handed inside the waist band leather holster. This is the same model that many us military and law enforcement agencies carry. Its a mid 90s model. If you know SIGs you know the older models are sought after as new production offerings have been known to have quality control issues, thanks to CEO Cohen emphasizing cosmetics over craftsmanship. New they go for $850. I'll accept $650 for everything to first responsible person who can legally own as handgun. I would consider 1 trade, for a like new third or fourth gen glock ""26 preferred"" and $200 cash.

Predestined for extremely rigorous use the rifle shows off its uncompromising quality. Locking system In 1993 the Blaser radial locking system made a desired dream come true: The straight, steady repetition without rotational movements of the bolt. The bolt rotation that used to be standard had often cost that vital fraction in precision. When the bolt is locked it centers automatically. The shooter is staying firmly in his aiming position. The entire operating is simple, smooth and allows more safety when shooting.. 1 Barrel and scope mount The barrel is easily exchangeable. It is fluted in order to guarantee optimum shooting characteristics. The barrel is equipped with a picatinny rail. It allows any scope to be mounted precisely and very low. 2 Receiver block The receiver block is bedding the barrel and contains the trigger assembly and the magazine. It is shaped out of one block of extremely tough aluminium alloy. This receiver is fundamental to the high durability of the Tactical 2. Thermally related tensions are impossible. 3 The synthetic stock The one-piece synthetic stock is absolutely stable in its dimensions even in extreme temperatures. Butt plate and cheekpiece are adjust­able in length and height. Butt stock Height and lateral position of the cheekpiece are fully adjustable. The butt plate is adjust­able in its vertical position. Length of pull adjustment is possible with spacer plates. Trigger The single-stage trigger is set to a weight of 1500 g at the factory. The trigger pull, the trigger position and the trigger stop are adjustable. Two-stage trigger optionally available. Magazine The magazine is easily detachable with one hand due to its convenient magazine grips. It is single-column and holds 5 cartridges. For the calibers .300 Win. Mag. and .338 Lapua Mag. it holds 4 cartridges. Locking Radial locking system with expansion sleeve. The bolt head is centering itself behind the cartridge when it is locked. The locking elements lock evenly 360°. Scope mount.No trades pls"

This rig was $5,520.95 new and used less than a dozen times, so for all intents and purposes, it's still like new. 
RIB is rated for 4 men, 1100 pounds. It is made of hypolon, not cheap pvc, this thing is TOUGH !!!
I haul it in my SUV, or, you can get a cheap trailer for it. But hauling in the SUV makes you alot more mobile and able to launch anywhere you can drive to, no ramp needed.
This RIB does about 20 mph with my wife and I on it and the 9.9 can be made into a 15 horse for not much $$$ I'm told, but I don't need the extra speed. This is a do anything go anywhere toy. Floats in about 3"" of water with motor up.
Comes with everything needed, including oars, pump, even has a $300.00 carry bag that the RIB is stored in.

FIRM
 THAT'S $150. LESS THAN I PAID FOR IT
 PLUS YOU GET AN ADDITIONAL UPGRADED PAIR OF HANDGRIPS
 AND A FULL BOX OF AMMO!

Brand new unfired in the box with all accessories, Taurus PT-100 Stainless .40 S&W Caliber pistol with accessory rail. Although it currently has genuine Taurus Pealite Grips on the handles, it came with the black hard rubber grips which are included in the box. The Taurus Pearlite Grips are really beautiful, with a deep dimensional swirl which rivals natural pearl in it's appearance. The included black hard rubber grips are nicely checkered with the Taurus logo, and provide a firmer hold for extended range practice and competition. Depending on your mood, you can change out the grips in about 2 minutes. 
The PT-100 is based on the time proven Model 92 platform which has been constantly improved and upgraded over the years resulting in the 9mm sidearm currently carried by the US military. In fact, many handgunners consider the Taurus to be an improvement over the military issue due to the placement of the hammer drop safety on the frame instead of the slide. The .40 caliber chambering is one of the standards of law enforcement now, similar in stopping power to the venerable .45 ACP.
 A Taurus favorite, the PT100 makes a return appearance equipped as a large frame pistol in a popular police caliber. Featuring an ambidextrous three position safety that allows cocked and locked single action carry or the convenience of a de-cocked double action.

I got this pistol about 2 months ago and it has remained unfired in it's original box with accessories since that time. Unfortunately, due to medical reasons I have to sell it to pay some bills. I paid $599. for it at Gander Mountain (you can look it up on their web site) but am willing to take a hit on it ($450. FIRM). Also, you will not have to pay sales tax ($36.), and the pearlite grips were about $60., and a new box of ammo I got with it was $24., so you will be getting about $270. off of what I have into it. And since Taurus has a lifetime warrantee for any owner, so your coverage is the same as if you had bought it in the store.
 Face to face sale cash only, buyer must have Florida Drivers License and be allowed to own a handgun in Florida. If I don't respond to your first email, please try again, as I sometimes accidently delete emails along with the spam we all get."

You can not buy one off the shelf and get the same things for the price. I do not build cheap guns. I build quality guns that will put others to shame.  Please look at what it would cost you to build this rifle using the same parts. I dont use NC Star or UTG knock off parts on my AR's.  Again, you can not buy an rifle off the shelf for this price that would come close to this rifle. Also, this rifle was built as close to a Military issued M4 as I could.  The Matech is USED and the barrel has a few makrs on it from storage. This rifle weighs 7 pounds on the dot unloaded. I will include 2 black PMags with windows and a brand new Otis 5.56 cleaning kit.
Look at the other AR's on here, they dont come close to this one. $1100 OBO For the right deal(or cash), I will change the trigger out and put a new Knights 2 stage match trigger in that is worth over $300.

Certified CCH Instructor
NRA Instructor

By completing this class you will then be eligible to apply for your Kansas Carry Conceal License through the Attorney General’s office.

The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet or would just like to borrow mine I have a .22 Ruger.

I purchased the rifle in 2002 from a gun store in AL. It has a para-trooper side folding stock, gas selector for normal or dirty operations, a flip up sight/gas block for grenade launcher, and it comes with the bayonet. 

I have fired less then 300 rounds through rifle. I bought it more as a collectable piece, but now am trying to scale back my inventory. This gun can be converted to full auto (with the right BATF registation with the purchase of a select fire sear) for around $3000. I just do not have the money or time to do so.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns.

This gun is from my personal collection. Has Keltec Belt clip installed on right side. Can be moved to the left.

 THAT'S $150. LESS THAN I PAID FOR IT
 PLUS YOU GET AN ADDITIONAL UPGRADED PAIR OF HANDGRIPS
 AND A FULL BOX OF AMMO!

Brand new unfired in the box with all accessories, Taurus PT-100 Stainless .40 S&W Caliber pistol with accessory rail. Although it currently has genuine Taurus Pealite Grips on the handles, it came with the black hard rubber grips which are included in the box. The Taurus Pearlite Grips are really beautiful, with a deep dimensional swirl which rivals natural pearl in it's appearance. The included black hard rubber grips are nicely checkered with the Taurus logo, and provide a firmer hold for extended range practice and competition. Depending on your mood, you can change out the grips in about 2 minutes. 
The PT-100 is based on the time proven Model 92 platform which has been constantly improved and upgraded over the years resulting in the 9mm sidearm currently carried by the US military. In fact, many handgunners consider the Taurus to be an improvement over the military issue due to the placement of the hammer drop safety on the frame instead of the slide. The .40 caliber chambering is one of the standards of law enforcement now, similar in stopping power to the venerable .45 ACP.
 A Taurus favorite, the PT100 makes a return appearance equipped as a large frame pistol in a popular police caliber. Featuring an ambidextrous three position safety that allows cocked and locked single action carry or the convenience of a de-cocked double action.

I got this pistol about 2 months ago and it has remained unfired in it's original box with accessories since that time. Unfortunately, due to medical reasons I have to sell it to pay some bills. I paid $599. for it at Gander Mountain (you can look it up on their web site) but am willing to take a hit on it ($450. FIRM). Also, you will not have to pay sales tax ($36.), and the pearlite grips were about $60., and a new box of ammo I got with it was $24., so you will be getting about $270. off of what I have into it. And since Taurus has a lifetime warrantee for any owner, so your coverage is the same as if you had bought it in the store.
 Face to face sale cash only, buyer must have Florida Drivers License and be allowed to own a handgun in Florida. If I don't respond to your first email, please try again, as I sometimes accidently delete emails along with the spam we all get."

This Colt Cobra .38 Special in approximately 90%. Very good condition for a gun over 60 years old, it shows very slight holster wear, locks up very tight, I would estimate that less than 200 rounds with though this pistol. 
It comes with its original holster and approximately 100 rounds of defense ammunition. This pistol fully loaded has a total weight of 17 ounces. 

This pistol will also come with a new pair of Presentation rubber grips for this D frame Colt, right hand grips for bigger hands. Not pictured.

First bought in 1952 here in Colorado, my dad carried this gun but barely shot it, he had a Colt .357 he used much more during our hunting trips in the Rocky Mountains. 

As you can see it is missing the rod ejector head, Colt parts has this part in stock as well as other sites.

I don't have time to invest any money in parts, I need to sell this .38 special to buy 2 tires for my truck. This pistol could use a good cleaning and polishing to show its luster.

I really love the way it feels and shoots, but I’m not seeing myself switching from my CW45 to it for my carry gun.  So, since I’ve finally been able to get back into the realm of EBR’s (Yea, me!!)  I thought parting with this would be a good way for it to find some love…and maybe get me an optic or other stuff for my AR. ?

It’s a BUL Cherokee Compact in 9mm.(A polymer framed version of the CZ75 made in Israel.)  It hasn’t been shot very much at all.  I ran three mixed magazines of different types of ammo and it ran like a champ, then it went into the safe.  It has a 17-round factory mag and two 16-round ProMags, all of which function perfectly.  The original box with the manual, test-fire case, and a mini-cleaning kit(unused) are included.  I found a Blackhawk leather OWB holster that fits it like a glove and it will come with that, as well.

The brass tacks…I love to trade, but for a cash price I’d like to get $425 OBO for the whole carry package.  I’d like to try and keep it close to Central Ohio for a FTF transaction.  As far as trade interests go, well the list is long but I’ll hit the high points and I’m pretty sure you’ll get the idea. ?

Optics suitable for an AR.(BIG dreams first: Eotech or Aimpoint)
I can add some cash for the right deal, but limited funds is why I prefer to trade.
I liked the look of the Burris AR-536, too.

AR Mags, more mags, and more mags. I really like the Pmags and didn’t dislike the C-Products nor the Thermold’s.  Wouldn’t mind trying the Lancers, though.

5.56 Ammo…what good is an AR without ammo for the lots of mags? ?

Sling, I really like what I’ve read and seen on the Savvy Sniper Quad sling, so something along those lines.

Mix and match, as long as we both are happy with the deal, the options are endless.

I had originally got all this stuff with the intent of getting the ATI Monte Carlo stock and weaver scope rail and modifying it.  Instead, I put about 60 rounds through it and stuck in the safe.
 
I was, however pleasantly surprised by the accuracy of the weapon…shooting nice 5 round shot groups and 200 meters with open sights is pretty darn good for a 70 year old rifle.  I never did mount the scope, so the range of this rifle would only be reasonably limited by the talent and experience of the shooter.

800 bucks for a used 500 dollar century arms polish underfolder? With a NON-chromed barrel? Good luck.
SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A DRACO???? That's double the price when it came out, and while it has dried up a bit, you can still find them from vendors for less than 500 dollars. Another hundred bucks and you could buy an Arsenal. What a joke.
2300 for an MSAR AUG clone? You realize that STEYR, the real deal, is coming out with an honest to God AUG made here in America MSRP'd at 2300? Street value for that will be around 2k even. Your gun is worth about 1300 bucks before the magazines. You're in la la land.

400 dollar SKS's, 2500 dollar AR15's....I realize the market has shifted the last year or so, but it's not 1994 again, there's no assault weapon ban driving these prices, just your damn greed.
