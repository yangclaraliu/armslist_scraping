I'm not looking for the whole shotgun, just the 18.5 inch barrel. I'm looking to pay about $50. I'm not going to pay much more than that because I can buy a new one at cabelas for $99. I'm just seeing if anyone has one for sale on here first. Just send me a message and tell me what you have. Thanks"

NEW IN BOX - Ruger BX-25 Magazine for 10/22 or Charger
THESE ARE SOLD OUT AND BACKORDERED (to the point that they've stopped taking orders) EVERYWHERE
People were selling them for $100 at the gun show this weekend.
They are without a doubt THE BEST magazine for the Ruger 10/22 or charger, and I don't really use anything else. I do think that the price is too high, but I can't replace them right now and might not get a chance if a new gun ban goes into place. For $80 I can live without them and offset some of my other recent purchases, for less than that I will just keep them in case things change again and these are no longer available.

If the post is still live then it is still for sale. Please no ""still available"" emails.  Pricing is firm and I'm not looking for any trades on this unless you're willing to make me a great deal. It is hard to rely on people to follow through, so these go to the first person to show up with their cash."

Product Description

For AR-15 / M16 type rifles, optical sights provide superior performance at longer ranges, but iron sights can be more effective for close-range engagements. However, attaching an optical sight either prevents the use of iron sights or results in a setup that produces a front sight ""shadow"" on the optical image, and/or results in problematic transitions from optical to backup iron sights. Not anymore. Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) provide shooters with the quickest possible transition between longer- and closer-range target acquisition, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in battle and competition. these sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45°. This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight. Just smooth, quick transitions that could mean the difference between winning or losing a competition, or more importantly-a gunfight.

Details

Machined from lightweight, extremely durable, 7075 aluminum, Mil-Spec hard anodized
Same height above bore as standard-issue M4 / M16A4 sights
½ MOA elevation and windage adjustments
Ambidextrous sights easily and securely mount to Picatinny rails using a flathead screwdriver
Low-profile sights extend only .2"" above top rail, don't interfere with primary optics or military IR illuminator /laser sight

I purchased this rifle new in early December.  This is an Atlantic Firearms exclusive model with an HK wide style forearm and a welded scope mount on the receiver.  In addition it's powder coated in HK black.  This is one of the features I liked the most as it prevents you from buying a $200 SWAN mount.  It also cuts back on weight as those mounts aren't light.

It's unlikely you'll see any of these around as PTR made them exclusively for Atlantic and as of now I doubt Atlantic will ever get another one as PTR is filling orders from significantly larger dealers.  A link to Atlantic's Youtube video of this model is below. Yes. I am asking more than what I paid, but the rifle I am buying is also inflated, so it is what it is.

This pistol has fired just over 100 rounds flawlessly.  Comes with everything seen in pictures; box, manual, test cartridge from the factory, two Wilson Combat magazines, and lock.

""The Specialist is a 5” 1911 chambered in .45 ACP that is full of features to satisfy an officer’s special needs.

Starting at the top, the slide wears our popular Clark Style serrated rib and like all of our guns with night sights, the Specialist wears dual-colored Tritium night sights. The rear sight is our new tactical ledge rear sight with single amber tritium dot and the front utilizes a green lamp with white target ring.

The forged slide is mated to our new forged tactical rail frame. The frame utilizes the standard 1913 picatinny rail and features 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and a recessed slide stop for use with laser grips (not included) and tactical operations. Each Specialist comes standard with our ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and a detachable two-piece magwell. This duty-ready piece comes dressed with a set of awesome G10 VZ Operator II grips and two 8 round magazines with bump pads.""

After I purchased it I realized I'm not as big of a fan of the stainless finish as I thought, so I would like to trade this for another full sized 1911 with some form of black finish, or sell it outright.  Please TEXT me for a faster reply at REDACTED.  If this ad is still here, I still have it."

My research indicates it is also called a Jericho 941 and is nearly identical to the CZ97B, the difference being a de-cocker on the slide versus the CZs safety lever on the frame.  This is a steel frame firearm and not to be confused with the newest incarnation of the Baby Desert Eagle that is a polymer frame firearm.

This one will still accept Saiga mags as well.  
I purchased this one because you can take it hunting and it is ""ban proof"" in it's current configuration.  Or put the big mag in and dress it up as you like and you have your evil black ban ready rifle!  

A side note:  Read about the Saiga plant filing Bankruptcy and recently shutting down production for good.  Any Russian Saiga's that are in containers coming to America are the last of any Saiga's we are going to see.  There is a finite amount out there now, so get one while you can!

Then I added a magpul foregrip and a bushnell red dot with a riser. Then I went on the Internet and began buying the parts for a folding stock conversion only to find that everything is back ordered. I have ran out of patience so my short attention span is your gain. 
I will include the 5 brand new factory made 5 round magazines, the magpul foregrip, and the bushnell red dot. It will also include the factory 3 set chokes with installation tool, and the front sight and carry handle.

This is an amazing shotgun. It weighs about 6.75 pounds without a loaded magazine. If there is going to be a ban on shotguns, I am sure this will be on the chopping block. Get it while you can. These magazines are $40 a piece when you can find them.

On the top half of the case is a Stag Arms 6.8 upper and lower. The lower has an ambidextrous single point sling adapter and a single point sling. The upper has the free float forend, and a nickel boron bolt carrier group. I pulled it out in the pic so you can see how clean they keep. They dont get any carbon build up on them at all. The optics is a 3-9x50 basic scope zeroed in at 200yds. Its not a super high end scope, but ARs dont kick like mules either. It has been holding up to the 6.8 recoil for around 200 rounds that Ive put down it. It comes with 2 magazines stamped 6.8 and 1 box of Hornady 6.8 ammo.
The lower half of the gun case is a DPMS 5.56/.223 upper with 1:9 twist. It has quad rail forend with all the rail adapters to put over the rails if you want to use them. Also comes with a fold down foregrip attached to it. Standard bolt carrier in it also. The light is a surefire millenium universal ($350) with the M93 mounting base $175(quick release) and the KM3 light head $250 on it (switches between white light and infrared). I have 2 new in the box GI style mags and a bag of loose reloaded ammo leftover from a box I got at a gun show last year.
The 5.56 upper will mount to the 6.8 lower perfectly and will take the 5.56 mags as well. Basically 2 uppers and 1 lower to make 2 different caliber rifles. I target shot a lot with the 5.56 and used the 6.8 to hunt hogs in TX, although I did shoot a doe with it two weeks ago.
The entire set up was almost $2500 BEFORE the stupid rise in value of these 'assault' rifles. The surefire alone was over $500. So that being said, NO, $2000 will not come close. $3500 obo

For the right deal, I'll also throw in my Smith and Wesson M&P 15-22. Excellent shape, no mods. Comes with the box and paperwork.
I also have this listed in Kansas, but I drive back and forth a lot. I'll be back in OKC this weekend. Not sure when I'll be back through there."
