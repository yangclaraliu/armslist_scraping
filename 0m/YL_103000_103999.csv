This is a Beretta 92G Police-trade-in that I bought at Bradis. 2005 manufacture date. Haven't even had a chance to fire it yet. Just took it home and cleaned it up. It does have standard police trade in type of wear. The 92G is really cool b/c while it looks the same as other 92s, the safety is a decocker only. Which means it has no manual safety. Very cool if you're used to that kind of thing.

With it I have 2 magazines, a fobus paddle holster, and lock. Also, the cardboard box it came in. As big as this thing is, in the fobus holster I think this might be the most comfortable gun I've ever carried. Then again, this is the first time I've used one of those holsters, still very cool.

I offer up for trade, an excellent condition Beretta 96D. This is not a LEO trade in. This one was purchased by myself, new about 8 years ago. Has been fired aproximately 500 rounds. Barrel has the standard wear on the sides from firing. Slide and frame have no real blems, or wear to note. Looks great, functions perfect, very smooth, very clean shooter. Will come with factory plastic case, factory cleaning brush, factory mag, and 2 sets of Hogue grips (finger groove and finger groove-less). This firearm has never been dry fired without a snap cap, and in fact will include the snap cap that was purchased with it 8 years ago.

All numbered parts are matching.
These carbines shoot a 208 grain bullet, and are known to be fun to shoot, with a stout recoil and a ball of fire about 6 inches in front of the muzzle.
This particular carbine is in nearly unissued condition with just a few minor scratches on the stock.
I've only fired 10 rounds though it in one range session since getting it some years back.
Comes with two 5 round clips with original 1930's produced cartridges."

It is pump action, handles 2 3/4 and 3"" shells, 20"" barrel and has a few custom touches added on to make it a fantastic hunting firearm.  The gun has an accu-choke, a small flash suppressor, a composite stock with storage for four additional shells, a very nice sling, custom camo paintjob, and Bushnell 1.5-4.5x32 scope.  It functions absolutely flawlessly and only shows a few signs of wear in the paint job (primarily on the receiver, I'll be happy to email close-up pictures).  It's been used mostly as a turkey gun, but would be a great deer gun with a slug barrel or even a home defense gun if that's what you're seeking.

I'm looking for $350 for the whole package (will include all the shells I can find as well..approx 1.5 boxes and is the best deal on AL in this area), which I believe to be a very fair price considering the additional components, but would like very much to sell this weekend and will seriously consider any cash offer or possibly even cash+partial trade (would like a subcompact/pocket pistol or Derringer).

I have for sale a rare Kimber Stainless Classic Combat.  .45 ACP caliber  This was a distributor exclusive (Lipsey's I believe) about 10 years ago.  It is similar to the Stainless Classic, but with Novak low profile combat sights, a low profile extended safety, and a stainless steel mainspring housing (normally plastic).  

For those familiar with Kimber 1911s, this is a SERIES 1 pistol, without the Swartz firing pin safety.  

Functions flawlessly with all types of ammo.  I am the second owner.  It has about 500 rounds through it since new, but is in excellent to like new condition.  Includes 1 factory Kimber 7-rd mag.

TRADES:  Factory built AK-47, FAL, S&W or Ruger revolvers, .22lr handguns, AR-10, AR-15, other interesting firearms.

This pistol has adjustable target sights and are adjusted right on the money, I've never had a malfunction with it. It  has hogue rubber grips and a mag-well for easy magazine loading. It comes with 2 seven round magazines, one of the magazines doesn't work too well, the second one works perfect, but you can pick up 1911 magazines all day on the internet. It also comes with a case. It's very nice but I'm just not into the whole 1911 scene. I'm open for trades, let me know what you have.

Cabinet contains 2 games!! The cabinet has the classic Lethal Enforcers and also has Police Trainer, which is less know but possibly more fun and more competitive for 2 player action (In my opinion). 

The boards have been installed in such as way that you simply have to open a drawer, switch 3 cables which have connectors, and then you are playing the other game. To switch between games only take 20 seconds at the most. 

Both games work excellent. 

The cabinet is in pretty good shape. Both guns are new and it has a new top deck with new plexiglass. 
The coin slots work, but bypass buttons have been installed, so you decide how to enter credits. 

Machine also has new marquee plexiglass. There is no marquee as I was going to have a custom one made but never got around to it. You can get them made for about $30 or make your own with an inkjet printer.

This pistol is in very good condition, with bright blueing as you can see. The barrel has some pitting. I have looked around online and others are asking around $400 for far inferior condition examples. I have fired over 500rds through this thing and had a hand full of misfires, due to the 50 year old ammo I was firing. It is an extremely accurate pistol and is outstanding for plinking. There is still a lot of surplus ammo available for dirt cheap. I believe I have a few hundred rounds left for it. It is in the pattern of a 1911, but for me has a much more comfortable feel and weight. Honestly it is my favorite plinker and is a blast to shoot. I realize the price is a little high, I was just kind of going off of what I saw online. Hit me up if your interested and I will entertain any serious offers. These are great little guns and I'm sure you will not be dissipointed. I believe this one was produced in 1952 and it is Spanish military proofed.

Night sights. Tactical rail. Single action. I bought this new, took it to the range twice, and it has had the dubious honor of being my night stand weapon ever since. If you have researched pistols you know the Sig P220 is arguably the most accurate out-of-box .45 caliber made and this particular one is no exception. It is without a doubt the most accurate pistol I own. Comes with everything that it came with new including carrying case, one 8 round mag, and paperwork. Also includes an additional Sig 8 round mag.

This gun was carried by prev owner and it shows. The Regal finish is well worn near the muzzle and there are some small scratches/marks here and there on the whole gun. The pics do a good job of showing them all. I can send more pics if you are picky about your 1911's. NO RUST and most the wear is on the slide. The two factory mags are 7 rounders. It has a factory full length guide rod but DOESN'T require any special tools to disassemble.

Now for the good. This is a very TIGHT 1911. There is barely any wiggle between frame and slide and when you shake it doesnt sound like a dog clicker.  Has the Para power extractor (PXT). Trigger on these SSP's is great and this one is no exception. The safety is not ambi but is serrated and extended making it very easier to operate. The slide release is also serrated and slightly longer than standard. The mainspring housing has a great checkering and the frame is made in a way that it just fits good in your hand. Novak style rear sight and dovetail front. These use the 3-dot system and are clean easy to see dots that make lining up targets quick and easy. The rear sight has rounded corners to prevent snagging on clothes. Rosewood grips have good checkering still (I think might have been removed for a different set when carried becuase they dont have much wear). 

I have shoot this with 150 rounds of FMJ and 50 rounds of WWB HP's since I have had it. No failure of any kind and shoot great. I will say I didnt do much crazy hard shooting or really try to see what it could do. I will say at 25 yards and less I can hit a 8"" circle no problem even with rapid shots and if I try I get 2-3"" groups easy. Pretty good since its a new pistol to me and I aint that great of a shot.

Everything appears factory except the Pearce finger grooved grip enhancement I just added new and the prev owner installed an Ed Brown barrel bushing. I will say this bushing is TIGHT but I was able to still turn it by hand (hurt my thumb a lil  ) to disassemble. 

Comes with 1911, 2x 7rnd factory mags, grip enhancement (already installed but can easily be removed if you like) and original box. I do not have the original manual but you can get it on Para's website.
