Asking $1,200 or trade for a AR-10. [NOTE: Price goes back to $1,500 after New Years].
Just spent $144.00 at a gunsmith making sure this is in excellent working order.

This AR is not for everyone. It is a collectors item. There are a few people out there who understand what an early issue pre-ban is and understand my price for this AR. Serious inquiries only.

Upper: Colt 20-inch barrel 1:9 twist w/ bayonet lug. Barrel marked ""C MP Chrome Bore""; C for the manufacturer Colt, MP stamp means the barrel was magnafluxed and proofed, chrome bore and chamber. Bolt Carrier manufacturer stamp ""Shield (8 sided octagon) and SE""; Smith Enterprise.

Lower: PWA (Pac West Arms, Milan, Ill.; this was the early LMT company I believe and Rock River Arms bought out PWA. From everything that I have heard they are excellent lowers!) 5.56mm Commando. This is a forged lower not cast. Serial# 11174. (PWA post-ban have a year prefix in the serial number. The serial # cutoff was 35222 for preban status).

Standard two point sling.
Has a new AR-16 cleaning kit (Small Arms Maintenance Equipment Case 8465-00-781-9564).
A1 stock w/ butt storage compartment. 
Have one USA 30 round AR-15 .223 magazine by O'Kay Industries, Inc., New Britain, Conn.

This AR is in great shape and supreme working order. I had it fully serviced (new parts, fired & cleaned) by a gunsmith at Anderson's Gun Repair Shop here in Springfield, MO before putting it up for sale; new extractor spring & gas tube (had a dent in the tube which slowed the gas pressure). I also run some 40 rounds through it and cleaned it. It was flawless.

Let me know what you have and I'll see if we can come to an agreement."

It is my understanding that these are all the parts you can get from SA, last time I checked, you can't buy the extractor yet.  The numbers correspond to the part # in the XD manual, if you don't have one handy, you can check out the diagram at http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/FIREARMS/springfieldarmory_xd.pdf.

Unfortunately, I had to sell my pistol earlier this year and am hoping to find a good home for these brand new parts.  These are great to have on hand for backup for a competition or HD pistol (don't want to have to wait for parts) or as a complete set of what's available from SA for a preparedness-minded individual.  Here is a spare parts thread from xdtalk.com that may be helpful: http://www.xdtalk.com/forums/general-sa-xd-xd-m-talk/94824-xd-spare-parts.html.

(please note, so nobody accuses me of being a cheat, that the pistol originally sold for around $180-$200. Since its discontinuation and growing rarity the value has gone up quite a bit.
Please find one in the same condition for way cheaper before accusing me of hwy robbery.
I like this gun and would rather keep it than sell for less.
Thank you.)

This is the highest end model they offer, and will shoot straighter than you (or I) ever will. It comes as pictured, with original magazines, and scope rail (removable).It even still has its manual and factory test-fired bullet casing in envelope.  I've put around 50 rounds through it, and of course it functions amazing.  Thus, it's as close to new as it can be, but since it's not new you pocket the difference! 

If you'd like a combo, I still have the Trijicon mini-red dot I used on it, with its rail mount.  You can mount this on anything (including even other scopes for close range shooting), but its extremely small size makes it ideal for use on top-railed pistols for those who want to squeeze every drop of accuracy out of their target pistols."

  gun has a heat treated cylinder so it should be fine with modern standard velocity ammunition. Keep away from, or at least minimize use of Plus P ammo.  gun does incorporate a hammer block safety, but in WWII a similar gun was dropped, resulting in it firing when the hammer block failed. A new hammer block was designed and continues in use till today. It may be prudent if the gun is kept loaded to leave the hammer down on an empty chamber.
