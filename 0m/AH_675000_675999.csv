Had this gun about a year or so. Shoots real nice, just kind of thinning the herd as far as pistols go. It mainly sits in my gun safe. Comes with four colt 7rd magazines. The Colt mags feed o.k. not as good as a Wilson mag. It is missing a small piece of the right side grip on the upper part. Doesn't affect gripping the gun, it's just an older gun and the plastic was cracked when I bought it and has since fallen off with use. Very accurate shooter, I've put about 500rds through it in the time I've had it. I would have put more, but I've got other guns that I actually carry that see more action at the range. It's a Llama .45ACP Spanish made.

It will come with (1) Lancer L5 magazine--black. Also, it will come with a PWS FSC556 comp. (currently installed) as well as the factory flash hider. All that for $1300. 

Currently I have a VLTOR EMOD stock (fde), magpul MIAD grip (black and fde), magpul ladder rail covers (fde), magpul xtm panels (fde and black), magpul trigger guard (fde), and a Troy modular vert. grip. If you want everything the price is $1300 for everything (minus eotech and qd attachments). All specs and details are found in the link above! I don't feel like typing it all out.

Then, this is what you are looking for: The H&K P7
5 special points make this gun becomes the most safe and effective handgun as a concealed carry weapon, over the Glock, S&W, Sig Sauer and 1911s in my opinion:

1- The squeeze cooker allowed to carry the gun chambered. When the grip isn't squeeze , the gun in de-cocked position. Squeeze the grip, it's now cocked and will go bang when trigger is pulled. Otherwise, it won't fire ever. Simple and effective. No more worry about cocked and locked, manual safety(1911s), use de-cocking lever to low the hammer down, 2 different trigger pulls DA/SA ( Sig Sauer ) or carrying with anxiety about striker ( Glock and S&W )
2- The polygonal, fixed cold hammer forged barrel gives better accuracy in every shots, in defense situation, you missed-you die. And the low bore axis reduces the recoil and enhances the accuracy 
3- The gun is still functional even the extractor is missing or broke, because the special designed, the chamber is fluted, allowed the shell case  pushed out of the chamber by propellant gases. The extractor can be use as loaded indicator
4- The grip angle, which 110 degrees, gives you the most comfortable and natural POA. Just like you point you index finger at the target. 
5- The special parallel chamber-magazine designed of the P7 which insert the round directly into the chamber. That mean, the gun will feed any kinds of ammunition and jamming is a myth.
**Final**:
The concealed weapon is a tool, a friend who goes with you wherever you go and might save your life. Beside that, it's also a piece to show people around who you are. 
That's it, guys. Enough talking. I'll give you an HK Benchmade tactical folding knife, an HK flashlight and a sticker of the HK P7 pistol. The gun in your hip, the extra mag on other side, the flashlight and knife in the pocket and the sticker on your windshield. You are all set for any defensive situation "" DON'T TREAD ON ME ""
Gun comes with original box, manual, test fired target at factory, 2 magazines, takedown tool, brush, original German P7 holster, original HK flashlight, knife and sticker. You won't find any deal for cheap like this. The NIB P7 runs over $1400-1500 with no extras like mine.

The P7 is a German 9mm semi-automatic pistol designed by Helmut Weldle and produced by Heckler & Koch GmbH (H&K) of Oberndorf am Neckar. It was revealed to the public for the first time in 1976 as the PSP (Polizei-Selbstlade-Pistole—“police self-loading pistol”)

The decision to equip West German police with an advanced 9mm service pistol and replace existing 7.65mm-caliber weapons was prompted after the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre. The new firearm was to meet the following requirements: chamber the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge, weigh no more than 1,000 g (35 oz), the pistol's dimensions would not exceed 180 x 130 x 34 mm, it should have a muzzle energy of no less than 500 J and a service life of at least 10,000 rounds. The pistol was also to be fully ambidextrous, safe to carry with a loaded chamber and able to be quickly drawn and ready to fire instantly. As a result of a competitive bid the German police forces selected three different pistols into service: the Swiss SIG-Sauer P225 (designated the P6) and two German designs—the P7 (officially designated the PSP) and the Walther P5.
Series production of the P7 started in 1979. Shortly after, the pistol was adopted by the German Federal Police's counter-terrorism unit (GSG 9) and the German Army's special forces formations.The P7 was produced primarily by H&K but also under license by the Greek defense firm Hellenic Arms Industry[citation needed] as well as in Mexico by the Departamento de Industria Militar (DIM), as a sidearm for general officers and staff. The pistol was also exported to several countries

A schematic of the P7's gas-delayed blowback system.
The P7 is a semi-automatic, blowback-operated firearm. It features a unique gas-delayed blowback locking system modeled on the Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol (and ultimately on the Barnitzke system first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5, which used gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and fed them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined—after the bullet has left the barrel—hence allowing the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case.
The chamber has 18 flutes that aid in the extraction process by allowing combustion gases to flow between the fired case and the chamber walls, preventing the case from ""sticking"" to the chamber walls. The drawback of this system is that the breech ""opens"" slightly prematurely to allow the slide to initiate its rearward motion. The high temperature gases cycling through a tube located below the chamber area and above the trigger made the early versions of this pistol uncomfortable to shoot after the content of two magazines were fired due to heating. The advantages of this system are a simpler manufacturing process due to the absence of a locking system and a high mechanical accuracy due to the barrel being fixed in the frame; the barrel does not execute any sort of lateral or vertical movement during the operating cycle as with the prolific Browning cam-action systems used extensively in other locked breech pistols.
The P7's spring extractor is contained within the slide, while the fixed ejector is a surface on the slide catch.
The grip of this pistol features a built-in cocking lever activated by gripping the pistol handle. Before the pistol can be fired, this lever must be squeezed. Thus this lever acts as a safety. The pistol has an innovative trigger (with a squeeze cocking lever located at the front of the grip, beneath the trigger guard) and is striker fired.[8] Squeezing the cocking lever with a force of 70 N (15.7 lbf) cocks the firing pin. Once fully depressed, only 2 pounds of force are required to keep the weapon cocked. The weapon is then fired by pressing the single stage trigger rated at approximately 20 N (4.5 lbf) As long as the lever is depressed, the weapon fires like any other semi-automatic pistol. If the lever is released, the weapon is immediately de-cocked and rendered safe. This method of operation dispensed the need for a manual safety selector while providing safety for the user carrying the pistol with a chambered round, and increased the speed with which the pistol could be deployed and fired. The trigger and firing mechanism's method of operation (and the unique slide catch) were protected by U.S. Patent 4,132,023, issued on January 2, 1979.
The P7 is fed from a single-stack box magazine with a capacity of 8 rounds, which is held inside the firearm's frame with a release located at the heel of the grip. After the last round has been fired, the slide will remain open thanks to a slide catch that can be released by pulling the slide further back or pressing the squeeze cocker.
The firearm uses a fixed, polygonal barrel (hexagonal with a 250 mm twist rate) and a fixed notched iron sight with contrast dots that enable shooting in low-level lighting conditions. The pistol is completely ambidextrous and two-handed use is enhanced through the use of a profiled and enlarged trigger guard."

About Nickel boron Coating
WMD is the industry’s leading source for high-performance Nickel Boron coatings. But beware: there are imitators out there, and not all Nickel Boron coatings are equal. Do not confuse Nickel Boron with Electroless Nickel, Electroless Nickel with Teflon, or Electroless Nickel with Boron Nitride, which fail to deliver the performance levels of NiB-X.

I am selling a Glock 26, a Draco AK 47 Pistol, an AK 47 with MANY MANY mags and accessories, a KELTEC 9mm, a Smith and Weson 38, and a Ravin 25 auto. 

This is the information for the Romanian “Romarm/Cugir” 7.62x39mm Draco AK-47 Pistol. Bought brand new, less than one year old, this gun doesn’t even look like its original self. Besides the normal light scratching from sliding safety/fire switch up and down, gun is in near mint Brand New Quality. Comes with a soft zippered case, four magazines, over 100 Rounds, and so much more. This gun has had over $200 dollars in modifications and accessories installed; all original hardware and furniture is included along with everything else.

Original wood and grip have been replaced. The front wood replaced with CAA Command Arms Black RS47SET UPPER & LOWER Hand guard w/4 Rails for Accessories, also is vented to allow gun to cool quicker when emptying those big clips in a matter of seconds. Grip has been replaced with a Black Hogue Soft Pistol Grip. Also has Black Steel Sling Plate installed between Grip and Receiver for Ambidextrous Quick-Detach of Single or Double Point Sling Attachments (can mount left or right side). Original welded blank cap that comes standard on Draco’s has been removed and a Tapco 687 Cage Muzzle Brake Flash Suppressor has been added, this can be removed and any threaded muzzle can be used depending on what look you like. Original dust cover has been replaced with tri-rail cover for any accessories. Has a Brand new FireField COMPACT 4 Reticle Pattern Red and Green Holographic Reflex Sight Installed.

Also comes with 4 magazines, 2 Brand New Tapco Black 30 Round Magazines and 2 Brand New Metal 30 Round Magazines one Black, one Grey. Included is also a Magpul MS2 CAGE 1Lx50 Multi Mission Sling System. This is a Swiss Army Draco! I will also include 100 or so rounds so you can fill your magazines right away. I dreamed about putting this gun together for years, then had my car die, that is the only reason I am parting with it. Have fired only 5 or 6 magazines through this. I have treated it like a member of the family. I love this gun and what I have done to it more than life itself, but I need to buy a new car. This gun works as great as it looks.

$750 or Best offer , this is an almost unused gun in brand new condition with at least Three HUNDRED dollars in extras added and included. I need cash, not interested in trades unless you have a car.

Eotech XPS3-0 Transverse Red Dot Holosight - Night Vision Compatible 

Eotech Transverse XPS 3 Holo Sight is EOTech's shortest model sight yet! Smaller than previous models including the EOTech 550, the Transverse XPS Three runs on a single 123 battery. It also has a longer battery life than other models of HOLO sights. The XPS3 is smaller, lighter and always fast.  This is the-0 reticle options. With the new single battery configuration, the Night Vision Xps allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights or NV mount. 

G23.FTS

The G23 offers fast transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, incredible field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. The G23 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

It offers a comfortable eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand. The Flip to Side mount is incredibly durable and operates by pressing the lever on the side of  the mount causing the magnifier to ""flip"" to the side and out ofthe way. The G23 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.


3x magnifier with Flip-To-Side mount and quick detach. Works with thhe XPS3

The wood on this gun is very good in my opinion.  The receiver has some wear in the blueing and a few very minor scratches.  

THE BARREL BLUEING IS VERY POOR.  Probably 50% gone.  Not sure how it got like that as it was like that when I got it but it almost looks like someone tried to clean it with the wrong stuff and it was removing the blueing.

""STRUCTURALLY"" and ""MECHANICALLY"" the barrel is 100%.

You probably have a better chance of seeing Bigfoot before you could find another Type 44 from this series.

I have a WWII vet bring back Jap Arisaka Type 44 that I would offer for sale. It is a first series, third variation, Kokura Arsenal, Arisaka Type 44 Carbine. Only 9,000 were ever manufactured in this series. From what I can tell it is a numbers matching rifle either by the last three numbers of the serial number (276) or via an assembly number stamped on the bottom of the receiver (516). I am pretty sure I found all the numbers stamped on the rifle and they match either one of those numbers.  It has two nice cartouches stamped on the underside of the buttstock and several small japanese acceptance marks stamped on parts throughout the rifle. The ""MUM"" has been ground off the receiver in some kind of ceremony from what I have read. 

The serial numbers are laid out as follows; 

276 
Rifle Bolt Stem 
Safety Knob 
Bayonet Housing 
(Firing Pin is not marked) 

516 
Stock and Handguard barrel channel (also has the 1st series character stamped) 
Trigger 
Ejector 
Extractor 

The stock and handguards are solid with no cracks or splits. The bore is in good shape. I have more pictures if you would like to see them just let me know.  This website is not picture friendly.

This is a really nice rifle that is rare to find.  If you are a collector of Japanese or WWII weapons then you know this is a must for your collection.

$700 will get the rifle shipped to your FFL anywhere in the lower 47 states (Sorry California).  If you have a C&R the same applies.  If you live in Alaska or Hawaii the same applies but ad $30.

I will consider trading for a M1917 (P17) of Winchester or Remington manufacture only, USGI M1 carbines, other Jap firearms, 1903A3.

Since I have no idea if/when I'll be able to get another one, the price must go up to meet the demand.
Anyone who has already contacted me about this rifle will not be affected by the increase.

Anyone who's familiar with the AR-15/M4 platform will tell you that Mr. Stoner's design is pretty awesome. One of the things that makes it such a great platform is that it's all modular.
The downside of this is that after a while, they all start to look the same.
Not so with this one!
I started with a S&W M&P15 M4 configuration AR-15...then I went nuts... :)
The photos will give the full story, but I've outlined the highlights below.

- Custom Duracoat in Lady Pink and White. Every part of the gun was disassembled, cleaned, degreased, abrasive-basted to remove any contaminants, then sprayed with 2 coats of Duracoat in either pink or white
- Free floating carbine length quad rail. Rock solid attachment to receiver, no slop or wiggle.
- Badger tactical Charging Handle Latch for easy cocking with gloves or ""in a hurry"".
- Removable A2-style carry handle with sight

*Note: It's not visible in the photos, but there is something a little odd going on with the shell deflector. When I got it, it had these strange little ""craters"" in the surface. I was afraid it was a flaw in the receiver forging, so I sent it back to Smith & Wesson. They checked it out and told me it was just cosmetic and didn't affect the integrity of the receiver at all. It didn't bother me much, so I coated over it and moved on. I just thought you should know about it.

This would make an excellent gift for the lady shooter in your life, or for yourself if you want one of the only truly unique AR-15's in the country.
Don't believe me? Do a google search for ""Pink and white AR-15"", see how many hits you get. As far as I can tell, there's maybe 3-4 that look anything like this one, and a couple of those are Hello Kitty-themed. Huh?
When's the last time you searched for ANYTHING and didn't get a million hits on what you wanted?

The price is pretty firm, but I will consider partial trades for other firearms, mostly handguns or tactical-type long guns.

If you already have an AR, but would like yours Duracoated similar to this one, I can do it for $400.

I am able to accept credit cards as payment through Square, but they charge me 3.5%, so you'll have to pay that extra fee if you want to use a credit card."

 Here is a Norinco / Polytech AK 47 . This has the receiver that is milled from a solid blllet of steel instead of the stamped sheet metal versions.  These are the most desired versions for collectors and ""End of the world scenarios"" because of their strength and adaptability. They are also the most accurate and dependable and work in the extreme climates from the sub zero arctic to the swamps and jungles. As you can see this one has had very little rounds through it, if any. The magazine catch is barely scratched.
  Please do not email me telling me my price is too high. I have already sold a similar one and they are gaining in value at an incredible pace since the election of the gun grabbers. I can sell this face to face with an Iowa ID and you are welcome to come hold this one in your hand and know what you are getting before you purchase.

HK's are made by magic Nordic Valkyrie's. They are forged in the
Valhalla and personally hammer-stamped by Odin. The shipping cost
from Valhalla is necessarily steep, and Valkyrie craftsmanship being

Here is the deal - for this Friday only, November 23rd, I will sell the whole package - rifle, scope, bipod, case and ammo for $400;  That is HALF what it would cost to put it together.  The catch is, between work and family commitments, the only time I have available is lunchtime Friday. SO, you must be able to meet me around noon in the Highlands area of Denver.  Cash in hand.  Show up without cash and the deal is off because I only have a 30 minute lunch.  I can guarantee I will NOT sell this gun for less. I am going out of town for work on Sunday, so if it does not sell on Friday I will be pulling the ad until I get back, then it will go back up at a higher price.

Like new Savage 93R17TRR .17HMR. Approximately 150-200 rounds fired. Rifle has bipod, heavy fluted barrel with recessed crown, tri-rail scope mount, Accutrigger and came from the factory with a Boyd's Tacticool stock (wood, not plastic). Will also include a case.

I took it to the range recently and at 100 yards, had 4 shots in 1/2"" with the 5th a flier opening the group to 1"".

Also includes 100 rounds ammo: 50-20gr and 50-17gr.

Ruger’s classic .22 LR pistol. The Mark III pistols are simple, rugged and boast the perfect combination of proven design and reliability.  22/45 pistols have all the smooth-shooting characteristics of the Mark III, but have a grip nearly identical to the familiar 1911.

This is a pistol build of a Vector V-89 40 with a 10mm barrel. It has a Trijicon Tritium front sight and comes with two locking pieces for using low and high impulse 10mm cartridges. It also comes with two fully functional bolts - an RCM Bolt as well as the Vector original. I am also including an HK sight adjustment tool, and 4 high quality .40Cal/ 10mm HK magazines in addition to a vector magazine. This gun is SBR ready if that is your desire. The barrel is threaded for a silencer and the thread protector fits underneath the flash hider. This is not from a shot out parts kit. All parts were brand new when I sent them in for fabrication and I have not fired the gun. I received it back from Mr. Turner on 26 October, so this is brand new aside from his safety and test firing.

It shoots a .30 cal round. After WW2 there were tons of M1 Carbine parts left over. They were going to be scrapped until Plainfield Company bought them and made more M1-carbines out of the parts. Therefore all the parts are from WW2 but the actual rifle was assembled after WW2. Some consider this a ww2 rifle and some don't consider it a World War 2 rifle but either way, this particular rifle has a great history.
I do not have a magazine for it. The back sight is missing off it but I have a replacement back sight for the m1 that can be installed.
I havent installed it yet personally but it isnt too difficult to do. 
The magazines arent too expensive but will run you about $20. $450 obo on the m-1 carbine. Also have a ww1 british eddystone .303 drill practice rifle used to train soldiers in ww1. Asking $400 on that one or $800 for the pair obo.

Black Hole Weaponry Barrel (on line price $269 check their website)
They employ the use of 416R, match grade stainless steel. BHW Barrels specialize in Polygonal rifling; The shape of the lands and grooves are based on a circle, so there are no sharp corners or edges for the bullet to conform into. This means there is a tight seal and thus less bullet deformation. This rifling form is unique in its ability to allow the bullet to be centered and fully supported by the barrel’s bore. This arc shaped rifling has long been held in very high regard for its accuracy, increased velocity, reduced gas cutting and ease of cleaning.
