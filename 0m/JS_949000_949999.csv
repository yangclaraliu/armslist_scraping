I have done my research and my price is beyond fair compared to what they have sold for in the past. This revolver was made in 1998 and is stainless and has the original wooden ruger grips. Only reason I'm getting rid of this gun is because it is an odd ball caliber in my collection and I'm more of a semi auto person. Cash price is $800 and trade value is $850.

M620V
The compact M620V Scout Light® produces 150 lumens of brilliant white light or 120 milliwatts of invisible infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps; attaches to Picatinny rail with a Swing-Lever™ rail clamp. Simply twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between output modes. In either mode, the M620V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for short- to medium-range applications. The high-efficiency LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. Comes with a momentary/constant-on pushbutton tailcap switch and a momentary-on pressure-activated tape switch with a 7"" cable that can be positioned where you choose. Also available are optional dual SR pushbutton/pressure pad switches. The M620V clamps solidly to any long gun equipped with a Picatinny rail via its integral M93 Swing-Lever™ rail clamp, which self-adjusts to off-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from vibration or recoil. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission, the M620V is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-proven and built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black (BK) or Desert Sand (TN) body color. 

Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends to equip your weapon with multiple integral forend rails.)

That's 240 rounds of .223 ammo!

The upper is made by LMT (Lewis Machine & Tool), a company that has been supplying the US military, law enforcement and government agencies with the highest quality weapons, components and modular weapon systems for more than 30 years. Here are a few words written about it from various online publishers:

Defensive Carry.com:
“You know it's built it to run, to last, and take punishment. Its specs are tight and you don't have to ever second guess your purchase with LMT.”
“LMT is probably the best MIL-SPEC rifle going.”
“Colt gets a lot of critical review because while it makes rifles TO spec, it does not go out of its way to make rifles ABOVE spec. LMT certainly meets the TDP (technical data package), and is often considered slightly above it.”

American Rifleman:
“My overall impression of the LMT MRP system was outstanding… The fit and finish of the rifles were top-rate...”

Small Arms Defense Journal:
“Like the barrels and as per Mil-Spec, all LMT bolts are proof tested and them magnetic particle inspected.” “LMT has been a forerunner in new developments and innovation, which will bring the M16/M4 well into the new decade and beyond.”

The lower is made by Gunsmoke Enterprises, a company that specializes in manufacturing custom AR-15 type carbines and match rifles. The company’s owner is Ed Basile, a Navy veteran. Their receivers are CNC machined from 7075 T6 Aircraft Aluminum forgings and are 100% mil spec.  Every receiver is laser engraved with the GSE logo, a modified Navy SEAL trident, surrounded by the words “Duty, Honor, Country”.

SWAT magazine reviewed their rifle, conducting tests at the Criminal Justice Institute at Ocala, FL and stated:  “…the flawless function, reliability and accuracy that were apparent after 4 days of rigorous drills fired from multiple positions and distances with the variety of ammunition deserve my highest marks.”

I have a  Sevylor Caravelle K116 GT 4 chamber inflatable boat with a Gamefisher 3.0 motor and mount. I bought this a couple years ago for fishing but soon after I bought a 15'  fiberglass boat and never did use this one. It's in good shape. It has been sitting for almost two years and after putting in a little gas, the motor started right up. The only deficiency I saw is that it was dripping a little fuel from the fuel on/off lever. I removed the screw and lever and it looks like the o ring seal just needs to be replaced (a 50 cent part at Ace Hardware). I'll sell or trade the boat and motor as a set and don't want to split it up. If sold, I'm looking for $400.

413,http://www.armslist.com/posts/949413,For Sale:  45acp AMT BACKUP - deep cover handgun,"Parker, Denver, Colorado",$ 500,"Listed On: Monday, January 28, 2013",Handguns,Arcadia Machine and Tool                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The AMT Back Up pistol was specifically developed as a CQB weapon. It's design and diminutive size makes it a formidable 45acp deep concealment weapon. It's definitely not a target range gun, so traditional iron sights would be pretty much useless with this platform. That being said, the BackUp 45 excels as a carry weapon when the operator becomes proficient with Point Shooting technique.
It is a double-action-only(DAO) semi auto chambered in .45 ACP. It features a locking barrel action, a grooved slide sight and fiberglass checkered grips.  It has nothing that would snag on clothing-  no sights or sharp edges.  It has been ""dehorned"" meaning all the edges and angles have been filed and smoothed.  It has a extremely simple user interface - DAO, with a very strong trigger pull and no safety.
The manual that came with my AMT .45 recommends 230 ball full metal jacket ammo. Personally, I don't have a problem with .45 ball in a defensive sidearm, especially one designed for use at very close quarters--- 230 gr ball ammo hits like a sledge hammer at close range.

The very heavy DAO pull is the unfortunate product of both the geometry and the physics involved in getting a high level of functional reliability with a powerful cartridge into a package this small. Some judicious work by a skilled pistol smith familiar with the design can make some marked improvement, but no miracles.

The Back Up was designed to be used to deal with imminent threats at very close range as quickly and decisively as possible. The grooved slide 'sight' is perfectly adequate to index the weapon on its intended target with reasonable accuracy in those conditions. With some practice, I've been able to place all six rounds into the ""A"" zone of an IDPA target rapidly out to 10 yds.
Stainless steel, 3"" barrel, weighs 25 ounces. Length is 5.75"", width 1"", height 4"".
There is a belt clip mounted on the right side for inside the belt carry.
Comes with two 5 round stainless magazines."

But there is a catch: they would the fall under the National Firearms Act, the law regulating machine guns and other Class III devices. We would have to register each and every gun, be fingerprinted and photographed, and get permission from our local chief law enforcement officer to keep our own property, not to mention a tax of $200 apiece to keep what is already ours. This is just on guns; magazines apparently are handled the same way as well. It will bankrupt people to keep their property.

To top this off, they will not be transferable. You can't sell them or leave them to your heirs, so even our children will be punished. 

Also When you die, under her proposal, guns would have to be turned over for destruction."

If you are interested, please find my ad on Need4MoreGuns.com as I don't check the email associate with this account often. Here is the link if you want to copy and paste it:
http://guns.need4more.com/classified/new-saiga-12-w-full-conversion-done-by-fime-quad-rail-brand-new

A new Saiga with conversion typically sells for around $1200-$1300. I tried to look at the listings and mark my Saiga on the low side of what the rest of the guns were selling for. I hope I picked a reasonable price, if there is such a thing these days. If they get banned, maybe they will be worth 5 times as much. Who knows?

This is a Brand New Saiga 12 guage, semi automatic shotgun with pistol grip and professional conversion done by Fime out of Las Vegas. They are a sister company and use the same parts as Arsenal, who does quality work. Here is a link to a review of the rifle. http://www.k-var.com/shop/SGL12-07.html

The rifle is brand new and you will be able to register the warranty unless you want to maintain it as unregistered. I thought I needed two of these, just in case, but I really don't. It comes in the original box, with manual and papers, cleaning kit, one 5-round magazine and a forward grip quad-rail. You can get 20 round mags for these and I will be listing some of those this weekend if the show up in the mail.

As much as I like shooting this old rifle, my old eyes don’t adjust well to open or peep sights anymore.  Rather than drill and tap the receiver to accept scope bases, I thought I would offer to trade it for a lightweight bolt action .308 or  30-06 sporting rifle already set up to accept my Leupold scope.

I am partial to Remington rifles, but will consider a Winchester Model 70 rifle on trade, give or take some cash.

Top is a CZ 550 chambered in .375 H&H magnum. The minimum legal caliber for hunting elephant in Africa. Kicks hard, but will take down anything within 200 yards. It is an expensive round, but I've always seen a good variety in stock in hunting and gun stores. If the proper trade is found, 36 rounds rated for Cape buffalo and larger game will be included.

Middle is a S&W 686 in .357 magnum. Also fires .38 special. 6inch barre, older, but well cleaned and incredibly accurate. Ammo can usually be found.

Lowest in the picture is a Marlin 336 in 30-30 win. Has some scratches, but well cleaned after hunting."

993,http://www.armslist.com/posts/949993,For Sale:   GA Precision Complete Rifle System GAP-10 in 308 Win,"denver, Colorado, United States","$ 8,000","Listed On: Monday, January 28, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here is a turnkey package: GA Precision Complete Rifle System GAP-10 in 308 Win. This uses the SR-25 magazine system (same as the Magpul LR mags) -- a very important point. This does not use the older Armalite AR-10 mag system which require a different mag.

I used it to engage steel targets at unknown distances and the ranging system of the first focal plane made it easy to 'bracket' the target and engage for pretty much 100% hits. Your results may vary.

I don't drive AR 308 rifles often and did not get a chance to shoot for groups as when I was dialed in, I began engaging targets -- too much fun to stop ... about 120rds down range.

This YouTube video will blow you away! This is not uncommon to encounter this degree of precision for GAP-10. Please be warned that if you watch this, you will PM me. I only have one of these for sale.
Only interested people should contact
