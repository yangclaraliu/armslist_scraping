The only reason I'm looking to trade is because there is an accessory I need to add on the slide and it isn't compatible with the ""Fish Gills"" design on  the RTF2 slide.  I can buy a new slide but I like to keep the serial numbers on the Glock the same for the frame, slide and barrel.

I am the second owner of the gun but I have not fired it.  The original owner only shot 200 rounds through it and shot it with a threaded barrel. So the stock barrel is pretty much unfired except in the factory. So needless to say the gun is in very good condition.  I expect your gun to be in good condition as well. Only Gen 3 or 4.

The gun is stock so there are no upgrades to it I just want to trade straight accross.  You keep your magazines and I keep mine.

If you must have it and don't have anything to trade. Feel free to email me an offer but know that I will not sell it unless I can use the same amount of money to buy me another Glock 17."

Both rifles are very accurate and reliable.  The Romanian rifle has had the stock refinished and has a Bushnel 6-9 power scope.  The Marlin has a Tasco Proghorn fixed 4X32mm scope.  The Marlin is almost NIB I bought it six years ago and then got deployed over seas, I have shot 12 rounds through it and still has the original box of ammo along with an extra full box of ammo for it. Asking $500 for both, $400 for the Marlin and $150 for the .22 if split up.  

*****Full disclosure, the .22 has a custom trigger job to bring it down to a crisp 1.5 pound trigger but in doing so the safety bar had to be removed.  The rifle has no safety mechanism other than your finger but I have not had an accidental discharge in 7 years of using it.****************"

""Very cool weapon"" This was a short production run offered from ruger chambered in the 6.8 Rem SPC and it makes for an awesome hog rifle/deer rifle/home defense weapon. You cant get these anymore and that's a shame! I have three factory magazines that come with the rifle. Accuracy is much better with this than the old model minis, not sure if its the heavier barrel, caliber or what but you can actually shoot good enough to hunt with this one.

It is considered by many as the smoothest, most compact, handiest and most beautiful lever action ever offered by Winchester. Shoots two great calibers in one -- the .357 Rem. Mag and the .38 Special...both suitable for hunting and Cowboy Action duties.

Attention to detail is something you will notice, like the one-piece steel crescent buttplate just like the originals, and a Marbles gold bead front sight that adds a dose of traditional class. This rifle features a convenient rear tang safety -- but don't despair, companies (like Marble's) offers one made to fit should you desire to add a tang sight later.
 Produced in limited quantities. 
•Receiver – Steel; Gloss blued. •Barrel – Round 20""; Gloss blued. •Action – Lever; Tubular magazine. •Stock – Oil finish; Grade I walnut; Straight grip; Crescent steel buttplate; Short forearm w/ steel FA cap. – Marble’s gold bead front sight, Buckhorn style rear sight;

I've acquired a Dan Wesson Valor from the original owner.  The owner has informed me the firearm has not been shot, but has been taken out of the box and handled for pictures, etc.  If you don't know about the Valor series it's Dan Wesson's higher end 1911 design.  It can be considered a high-mid end 1911, generally a different class than Colt, Springfield, Kimber, Sig Sauer, etc... and is a closer comparison to Nighthawk Custom, Ed Brown, Wilson Combat, Les Baers.  This isn't a custom built like the higher end models listed, and there isn't a 1+ year wait time.  However, from what I've heard the Dan Wesson is capable of keeping up with some of the higher end 1911s and at a fraction of the cost.  You can be the judge.

I've got an all stainless Regent R200S 1911 in .45 ACP up for sale. Pistol has Hogue grips and comes with one factory magazine. Approximately 600 rounds through her, so she's broken in and all the kinks are worked out. Feed ramp needed a good polishing and the stock magazine that came with it is junk, but I'm including it anyway. I'd include some other aftermarket mags but this gets me out of the 1911 game entirely and they're already gone. 

Definitely not a big name custom 1911, but it feels great in the hand, has a great trigger, outstanding accuracy and is very affordable. I'll throw in a box of Aguila 230 grain FMJ to ride home with her. Also included is the original tupperware box and paperwork that came with the gun.

Hopefully my price point of $550 will make this a great deal for someone. $600 retail plus tax (and/or shipping) if you can find them and I'm tossing in some ammo and a little bit of smith work (polishing the ramp).

Specifications Length 8.70 inches Width 1.66 inches Weight Empty 6.4 ounces Weight Loaded 2.02 pounds Description MAG5-60 The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

Outdoor string lights have been around for years, but have just recently grown very 

popular. They are perfect for outdoor get-togethers, patio dining, or for the simple use of 

lighting walkway. Instead of the modern varieties of lighting, many people are opting for 

string lights because of how competitive they are in price, as well as their durability. If 

you are buying string lights, then there are several types that you should be familiar 

with. Outdoor string lighting is available in a wide numerous designs, colors, lengths, 

styles, and models.

When shopping for string lights you can discover the following:

Traditional: This is the model that many think of once they consider Christmas lights. All 

of the bulbs are on one circuit, meaning when one light goes out, then all the string will 

go out as well. Some suppliers are making them so that if one bulb does turn off, then the 

rest will stay lighted. However, this is common with most thread lights. The bulbs are the 

cheapest quality of string lights, and they also break easily. They are remarkably 

affordable though.

Rope Lights: These are LED bulbs which are enclosed in clear plastic-type tubing. Because 

of the tubing, it resembles a rope, hence the label. The rope string lights are flexible 

and can be manipulated to fit in different spaces. Fortunately they are easy to hold and 

useful to store after use.

Net Lights: This model of lighting is designed specifically for bushes or trees. The lights 

are connected on mesh so that they can cover larger spaces at on one occasion. The bulbs 

are generally LED bulbs.

The lower has a CMMG lower parts kit installed, but still needs a receiver extension/stock. It also has the color fill on the fire selector, if that matters to you. Everything is brand new, never fired, but the P-mags have been removed from the packaging. I was going to start a new AR build, but it looks like it might be hard to finish for a while. 

Looking for the best offer, I'm not expecting to get $50 per magazine and $400 for the lower, but I do know that this stuff is already hard to find, and may get worse in the future. Just email your offer through Armslist and I'll get back to you. Might trade for other guns. Thanks for looking."
