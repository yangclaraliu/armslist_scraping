Ive fought for the Bill of Rights and am still fighting so I can give you my opinion!!!! You suck!!!!! Walmart hasnt raised their prices but .90 a box. You guys stand there and wait and by it up taking anyone elses opportunity and then gouge it!!!!! Supply and demand is because of thousands of assholes like you. You might as well be in the white house as well!!!! Again SHAME on you!!!!

Me: Yeah Yeah, Shame on me and everyone else who is doing it. I'm not forcing anyone to buy it from me. 

Right now it is supply and demand. There is a shortage and it is not available. I have an available supply for a price that reflects the demand.  I have been trading and selling on here for the last year and have so with the most respect. 

You responded to my ad. If you don't want to buy it that is fine, but I don't need your opinions. Keep your thoughts to yourself please.

Open your eyes and see what is going on. It is much bigger than just me selling some ammo for profit.

Him: Straight out of Walmart $7.97 & $21.97 per box. Shame on you!!!!! You are not helping whats happening!!!!!

Now I have been selling and trading on here for the last year and have met lots of good people and made lots of friends. I always try to be respectful even when I disagree with others and understand people are entitled to their opinions even when they are not asked for, but for someone to use profanity and carry themselves in this manner in my opinion is giving our community of friendly shooters a bad name. Please keep an eye out for this guy and hopefully no one else has to be treated like this.

Depending on caliber and bullet weight, penetration is between 9 and 14 inches.

At CORBON, we believe that velocity is king! Higher energies enhance bullet performance and increase stopping power.

The 500AB is the 500A Mossberg shotgun with some upgrades......specifically a Walnut stock VS. the various hardwood stocks found on the regular 500A model. This 500AB also has some metal etchings ,as seen in 1 photo, that the 500A doesnt have ...and it has a 30"" barrel. (Every part on this 500AB is interchangeable with the regular 500A).
This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. 30 inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer and Water Fowl...and predators of any nature. You get the 75-100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun. Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances. It functions flawlessly and it looks good. It isn't perfect in appearance, the blueing and the wood show some wear, but it looks good. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle. It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too. It has the weaver/picatinny scope mounts already on it. If you have a scope with weaver/picatinny rings, it will mount right up to the shotgun. I will trade this gun."

This rifle will be worth MUCH more with or without the possible ban. ** This will go on to auction site if not sold locally and in person by month's end. The most recent auctions for NEW in the box have all closed over $4400 ( can provide listing numbers as proof )**

DESCRIPTION FROM LWRC WEBSITE:
LWRC M6A2 SPR Semi Automatic Rifle, 5.56 NATO 14.7"" Hammer Forged Spiral Fluted Barrel with Pinned Flash Hider, Magpul ACS Stock, Magpul MIAD Grip, SPR-MOD Railed Handguard, 30 Round Mag, Gas Piston, Skirmish Sights

""The SPR features our enhanced fire control group, a Magpul MIAD pistol grip, and the new Magpul ACS stock. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The M6A2 rifle can be used in various roles from close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas, an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters."""

Any violation of 922r IS A FELONY! With this gun there are no worries because it has several USA made parts in it more than what is required. I bought two of these and decided I only need to keep one. Check online gun auctions and see what these are going for and remember that is FOR a sporterized SA-85M. This one is Full Throttle! Must have a valid FL license and a CWP . Must sign a gun bill of sale. Thanks for looking."

I got this brand new from airsoft gi about a year ago. It has custom woodland camouflage paint and a king arms 4x zoom scope with illuminating radical. You can make it red, green, or you can keep it black. There are knobs on the side of the scope where you can adjust the color from dimmer to brighter. This will also come with 2 king arms 120 round midcap magazines and about 2000 .25g bb's. This gun is LiPo battery ready, and will shoot about 21 rounds per second with a LiPo battery. However, this gun will NOT come with a battery or iron sights. 
Gun is in fantastic condition, but there are a few small white scratches from tree branches and such. Scope is in near perfect condition, as I have used it in about 5 skirmishes. Magazines also have a few white scratches, but work perfectly. 
Gun has 400+ fps with .20g bb's, but with .25g bb's it will be around 380 fps. 

I will miss this gun, but I want to sell it as I don't do airsoft much anymore. Thank you in advance! 
Brand new, gun was $330.

-Stag Upper Receiver with Forward Assist and Ejection Port Cover
-Stag Bolt Carrier Group
-Nikon P-223 3-9x40 Scope W/Lens Covers
-Yankee Hill Quad Rail in Extended Carbine Length ( I had to check I was pretty sure it was called Specter when I ordered it but that option wasn't there when I went to check. Its the length that is just slightly longer then a Mid-Length
-Rock River Heavy Barrel 1in9 .223/5.56 with Standard Compensator ( The barrel does have a section that is unfinished from where I took the standard front sight post off. This just needs to be finished and it will be just fine. I just haven't done it yet.)
-Troy Low Profile Gas Block & Mid-Length Gas Tube
-I forget the name of the Bi-pod but a Bi-Pod also lol

The AR will come with 3 - 30 Round Metal Mags and 2 - 20 Round Metal Mags, Soft Case, MagPul Back up Sights, and the Front Sight Post that originally came on the barrel Asking price was $2,000.. now 1,800!!! I would like to keep it local since I don't know what it takes to ship a rifle, I would consider some driving to meet in the middle.

I'm not set on selling it, just trying to see what it's worth right now. I will NOT respond to lowball emails, I will just delete them. Do a quick search as to what this gun is going for right now on websites and wherever you can find one before you make an offer.  I will not respond to emails saying ""what is your asking price"". I don't have one. I am curious to see what this gun is worth which is why I am posting. Email me your offer. It can be a cash price, or a trade offer, but I would prefer cash. I will only trade for handguns in good shape. I would prefer a handgun that isn't rare that I can shoot a lot and get some cash as well like a CZ-75 or Berreta 92fs. I will also trade for a 7.62x25 AR upper but I doubt there is anyone out there with one that wants to trade. Cash is king. If I get a good offer I'll let it go. If not,  I'm keeping it. Moving on. 

Everything you could want from a full size 9mm. Sig quality, rare Blackwater etchings on top of slide, engraving on side of slide, custom Blackwater grips etc etc. Look up all the specs too much to list about sights and features of this gun. Short reset trigger is so quick. 4, yes 4 20 round magazines. Gun has been shot, but is very good, almost like new condition. Zero blemishes on the gun, just been shot a few times. Sig case and all 4 mags included. 

No I will not send you pictures. The gun is in very good shape. Pictures posted are stock but look identical. If I get a good offer then I will take the time to take whatever pictures you want or let you see it in person."

The vest stops a 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullet at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50[expand acronym] of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s).

This allows a soldier to tailor-fit his MOLLE and body armor system. While not specifically designed for it, the loops can also easily attach All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment (ALICE)-based equipment, MOLLE's predecessor, as well as many pieces of civilian-made tactical gear, and also features a large handle on the back just below the collar which can be used to drag a wounded person to safety in an emergency.

The Modular Sleep System (MSS) is a modular sleeping bag used by the United States armed forces.

The MSS consists of a camouflaged, waterproof, breathable Gore-Tex bivy cover, a lightweight patrol sleeping bag, and an intermediate cold weather sleeping bag. Compression sacks are included to store and carry the system. The MSS is available in colors compatible with the universal camouflage pattern. The patrol bag provides cold weather protection from 35 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The intermediate bag provides cold weather protection from minus 5 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit. Together, the patrol bag and intermediate bags provide extreme cold weather protection in temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit. The bivy cover can be used with each of three MSS configurations (patrol, intermediate, or combined) to be comparable with the environment in which the system is being used; the bivy cover provides environmental protection from wind and water. Sleeping bags are made of ripstop nylon fabrics and continuous filament polyester insulation; camouflage bivy cover is made with waterproof, breathable, coated or laminated nylon fabric called Gore-Tex; the compression sacks are made with water-resistant, durable nylon fabric."

Got a case of 45 - $20  a box / name brand stuff . Ordered a number of glock and kci mags , all shipped in the last 2 weeks , so why is everyone still screwing their friends and neighbors ? 
I can understand some guns going up , but 2500 for a 750 Ar ?  2000 for a 650 mini ? 

I'll give you the 2x on the mags , I'd be skeeeered too if I didn't have a few ( remember what they taught some of us in boy scouts ? BE PREPARED )  

But why are the pistols that are not , NOT going to be touched by any ban going up so high ?  $ 300 for a little Kel Tec P32 , seriously ?  I say that because I picked one up on a local listing for $ 170 , that was asking price , it was fair , I bought it .

All I can say is , those that are paying these crazy amounts for things that will not be effected by any new laws must not have anything else to do with their $$$ . 

Hopefully the magazine Mfg's are in super high gear / overtime , and can get caught up with the supply before / if anything goes onto the books .

You need to go READ the proposal , it has some things that are NOT good for any of us. I especially didn't like the part about me not being able to ""heir"" my grandfathered in guns and mags to my son . 

My local shop I'd be faithful to finally turned to the dark side on me last week . Won't say any names , but went from selling trade in's with the 3 mags down to 1 mag . Oh well , they stayed the course longer than most , have to give him that , guns are still priced decent , can't have everything !

Stay safe and be nice to your brother / neighbor !

First of all It really saddens me to see fellow Americans trying to take advantage of a tragedy, and use it to rip fellow Americans off!  Many people had no concern for owning a AR15 until the CT tragedy and the President made his announcement!
Now everyone wants one and the ones who have them are gouging prices!  I can understand making a little profit , but doubling the price.
I have toted one of these for 25 years as. US Marine!
I swore to protect American lives and defend a great nation!
