I'm really looking for certain guns, but I'm open to all trades. First I have a Springfield Loaded Ultra Compact 1911 in Stainless Steel. It has Trijicon Night Sights, Titanium Firing Pin, Lowered and Flared Ejection Port, Aluminum High Speed Adjustable Trigger, Delta Combat Action Hammer, Slimline Cocobolo Grips, Ambidextrous Safety, Carry Bevel Treatment, Flat Serrated Mainspring Housing, and the Slide, Barrel, and Frame are all Forged Fitted from Stainless Steel. It is in great condition and has a low round count.  It has a 11th Gear Holster, 11th Gear 2-Magazine Belt Holster. 3 6 round factory Magazines, 1 7 round Chip McCormick, 1 7 round Kimpro Mag, and 1 8 round Chip McCormick Promag Mag. This gun sells for over $1,000.00. I have 4 extra mags, and I'm asking $850.00 cash, and $900.00 trade value.

      The next gun is not a handgun, but a really nice assault rifle. It is an Olympic Arms lower with a Palmetto State Armory upper chambered for  300 Blackout ammo. It is decked out with all the extras. It has a UTG 6 position Butt-Stock, UTG Free Floating Quad Rail. UTG Pop Up Combat Iron Sights, Ergogrip Pistol Grip, UTG Metal Foldable Foregrip, a Barska Holographic sights with infra red reticle, and I have a 3x magnifier for it. A BSA Weaver Rail Mounted Laser. I have one 30 round factory magazine, and a 30 round Magpul magazine for it. It comes with a 16 in. Stainless Steel Heavy Barrel that is Threaded for a suppressor and has a thread cover. I also have about 100 rounds of the ammo for it. 20 rounds of Silver tips and 20 rounds of Ballistic Tips. The 300 Blackout round is amazing and is way better than any ar-15 or ak-47 round out there. It also shoots 300 Whisper ammo and you can get supersonic or subsonic ammo for it. The recoil is very light and is a great assault rifle, and is in mint condition. I will take $1,250.00 cash or $1,350.00 in trade value.

   The last gun is a Taurus Millennium PT 140 Pro 40 cal. It has hardly been shot. I've ran less than 20 rounds through it. I usually use it when I walk my dog at night so it rarely gets used. It looks great though and is a great little shooter. I have 2 10 round mags for it as well. I love the crisp trigger pull on the Millennium series from Taurus. It's a great gun for everyday carry. I will sale it for $340.00 and trade value of $375.00. I can send pics upon request."

I have taken extreme care of this scope and it is in near new condition. It has only very slight mounting marks. The glass is as new and free from scratches or defects. This scope has only seen 3 range sessions and needs some use. 

Burris has gone to extremes to engineer the ultimate in high-performance optics — XTR Xtreme Tactical Riflescopes. Extra-large, ultra-premium lenses produce unsurpassed resolution, clarity, and brightness. The propietary HiLume ultra-clear, index-matched multi-coating used on XTR Riflescopes has been enhanced with new StormCoat. The ultra-low-surface tension coating causes water to form into tighter beads and slide off the glass, leaving more “clean” surface through which to clearly see your target. The enhancement is exclusive to XTR scopes.  All XTR scope tubes are 30mm, resulting in 25% thicker main tubes and 42% more strength. Double-force coil spring suspension locks the inner tube in place for unfailing accuracy. 

The XTR-14 1X-4X riflescope features the innovative XTR Ballistic 5.56 Gen2 Reticle.  For further info on scope and specs visit: www.burristactical.com. 

I will include: AR-P.E.P.R.™ Mount Proper Eye Position Ready for combat riflescopes, this mount provides 2"" of forward scope positioning on the M-4 and AR-15 platform. Ring bases are milled as a single, tough unit, and ring tops feature Picatinny tops for mounting additional accessories."

Got the upper in on a trade and mated it up with an extra lower that I have. Since I already have my plinker AR and my 20"" battle rifle AR, I really don't need another plinker. This is a great starter AR that you don't have to worry about dinging up or wearing down. It has had less then 200 rounds through it. 20 or so that were shot by the previous owner. 180 that were shot on Friday with no FTEject, FTFire, or FTFeed. The gun performed flawlessly.

There is one bad though with this particular AR. The area where the bolt hold open release is located is pretty mangled. This was done during the install when I had attempted to use the taped up vice grips to get the roll pin on. Don't know how; they slipped off and managed to get at the lower receiver. It's only concentrated to that area (the ears of the release) and that's it. I threw some blueing over it to keep it from rusting and have just shot it. It really is just a fun rifle that you don't have to worry about scratching up or dinging up. If you want to make it into something of a show piece then just throw a coat of Duracoat in matte black or desert tan and you're set!"

FASTFIRE™ RED DOT REFLEX SIGHT 
The FastFire Red Dot Reflex sight is the most versatile red dot sight on the market. Mount it on your favorite handgun, shotgun or hunting rifle for greater accuracy and faster target acquisition. You won’t need to worry about sight alignment, eye dominance or finding your target. Just put the red dot on your target and pull the trigger.

Compact and lightweight, the FastFire won’t affect the balance or handling, plus it offers unlimited eye relief, parallax-free 1x magnification and simple operation. 

Ideally suited for use on pistols and AR-15s where fast target acquisition is desired, the FastFire red dot sight will also match up well with carbines, lever guns and shotguns. Both the FastFire II and III are ruggedly designed, impervious to the elements and will hold up to years of punishing recoil. You’ll find a wide selection of mounts for either model that will fit on most popular shooting platforms.

I'm really looking for certain guns, but I'm open to all trades. First I have a Springfield Loaded Ultra Compact 1911 in Stainless Steel. It has Trijicon Night Sights, Titanium Firing Pin, Lowered and Flared Ejection Port, Aluminum High Speed Adjustable Trigger, Delta Combat Action Hammer, Slimline Cocobolo Grips, Ambidextrous Safety, Carry Bevel Treatment, Flat Serrated Mainspring Housing, and the Slide, Barrel, and Frame are all Forged Fitted from Stainless Steel. It is in great condition and has a low round count.  It has a 11th Gear Holster, 11th Gear 2-Magazine Belt Holster. 3 6 round factory Magazines, 1 7 round Chip McCormick, 1 7 round Kimpro Mag, and 1 8 round Chip Promag Mag. This gun sells for over $1,000.00. I have 4 extra mags, and I'm asking $850.00 cash, and $900.00 trade value.

      The next gun is not a handgun, but a really nice assault rifle. It is an Olympic Arms lower with a Palmetto State Armory upper chambered for  300 Blackout ammo. It is decked out with all the extras. It has a UTG 6 position Butt-Stock, UTG Free Floating Quad Rail. UTG Pop Up Combat Iron Sights, Ergogrip Pistol Grip, UTG Metal Foldable Foregrip, a Barska Holographic sights with infra red reticle, and I have a 3x magnifier for it. A BSA Weaver Rail Mounted Laser. I have one 30 round factory magazine, and a 30 round Magpul magazine for it. It comes with a 16 in. Stainless Steel Heavy Barrel that is Threaded for a suppressor and has a thread cover. I also have about 100 rounds of the ammo for it. 20 rounds of Silver tips and 20 rounds of Ballistic Tips. The 300 Blackout round is amazing and is way better than any ar-15 or ak-47 round out there. It also shoots 300 Whisper ammo and you can get supersonic or subsonic ammo for it. The recoil is very light and is a great assault rifle, and is in mint condition. I will take $1,250.00 cash or $1,350.00 in trade value.


         The last gun is a Taurus Millennium PT 140 Pro 40 cal. It has hardly been shot. I've ran less than 20 rounds through it. I usually use it when I walk my dog at night so it rarely gets used. It looks great though and is a great little shooter. I have 2 10 round mags for it as well. I love the crisp trigger pull on the Millennium series from Taurus. It's a great gun for everyday carry.

I think these guns were only manufactured for 2 years. They are hard to find. I am the original owner of the gun. I have the original box for it. It has 2 clips, one of which has a pinky extension for extra grip. Has a good holster and four boxes of ammo with a little bit shot out of each box. The gun has always shot very good for me. Makes a great conceal and carry pistol. Small gun with alot of power. Because of the light weight and large bore it is a beast to shoot. I would consider the gun to be in very good condition.

I might possibly be interested in trading this gun for a taurus judge if it was the right model."

Detachable rear sight installs easily to flattop receivers with Picatinny-style rails. Designed to function with any standard AR-15 front sight. Features 500 meters of elevation. Aluminum and steel construction.

Technical Information

Material: Steel and Aluminum 

Notes: 
•  Designed to attach to the Picatinny rail system on the Flattop Receiver 
•  Sight is set so that the height of the sight will line up with standard front sights. 
•  Sight offers up to 500 meters of elevation. 

This is a nearly brand new DPMS detachable rear sight with elevation and wind-age adjustments as well as dual apertures.  I have never used this sight as it came with my rifle brand new and I use optics instead so I don't really need this one.

But he has since moved on to bigger and better things. Well maintained, only used for the duration of his hunting safety course. That said, there is a bit of wear. The 22 barrel was never used, but the 20 ga barrel has some light wear (detailed in one of the pictures). Still have the box and the little carrying sack for transporting the broken down rifle. I'd post the specs but there are a million reviews for the gun out there on the internet (and what can I say, its a Sunday). Drop me a line if you're interested. We could work a trade for some beat off old bolt action rifle. Thanks for taking the time to read this ad, and God Bless America.

Here is history on the gun.==================The two main camps, Mauthausen and Gusen I, were labelled as ""Grade III"" (Stufe III) camps, which meant that they were intended to be the toughest camps for the ""Incorrigible Political Enemies of the Reich"". Mauthausen never lost this Stufe III classification, the worst. In the offices of the RSHA (Reichssicherheitshauptamt) it was referred to by a nickname - Knochenmühle, the bone-grinder.[6] Unlike many other concentration camps, intended for all categories of prisoners, Mauthausen was mostly used for extermination through labour of the intelligentsia, who were educated people and members of the higher social classes in countries subjugated by the Nazi regime during World War II.[7] The prisoners transferred to the ""Hospital Sub-camp"" received one piece of bread per 20 inmates and roughly half a litre of weed soup a day. =================================== Extermination through labour- The political function of the camp continued in parallel with its economic role. Until at least 1942, it was used for the imprisonment and murder of Germany's political and ideological enemies, both real and imagined.[3][20] The camp served the needs of the German war machine and also carried out extermination through labour. When the inmates were totally exhausted after having worked in the quarries for 12 hours a day, or if they were too ill or too weak to work, they were then transferred to the Revier (""Krankenrevier"", sick barrack) or other places for extermination. Initially, the camp did not have a gas chamber of its own and the so-called Muselmänner, or prisoners who were too sick to work, after being maltreated, under-nourished or exhausted, were then transferred to other concentration camps for extermination (mostly to the infamous Hartheim Castle,[21] which was 40.7 kilometres / 25.3 miles away), or killed by lethal injection and cremated in the local crematorium. The growing number of prisoners made the system too expensive and from 1940, Mauthausen was one of the few camps in the West to use a gas chamber on a regular basis. In the beginning, an improvised mobile gas chamber – a van with the exhaust pipe connected to the inside – shuttled between Mauthausen and Gusen. By December 1941, a permanent gas chamber that could kill about 120 prisoners at a time was completed.[22][23]================================= The treatment of inmates and methodology of crime , Although not the only concentration camp where the German authorities implemented their extermination through labour (Vernichtung durch Arbeit), Mauthausen-Gusen was one of the most brutal and severe. The conditions within the camp were considered exceptionally hard to bear, even by concentration camp standards.[39][40][41] The inmates suffered not only from malnutrition, overcrowded huts and constant abuse and beatings by the guards and kapos,[29] but also from exceptionally hard labour.[22] As there were too many prisoners in Mauthausen to have all of them work in its quarry at the same time, many were put to work in workshops, or had to do other manual work, whilst the unfortunate ones who were selected to work in the quarry were only there because of their so-called ""crimes"" in the camp. The reasons for sending them to work in the ""Punishment-Detail"" were trivial, and included such ""crimes"" as not saluting a German passing by. The work in the quarries — often in unbearable heat or in temperatures as low as -30 °C (-22 °F)[29] — led to exceptionally high mortality rates.[41][c] The food rations were limited, and during the 1940–1942 period, an average inmate weighed 40 kilograms,[42] roughly 88 pounds. It is estimated that the average energy content of food rations dropped from about 1,750 calories a day during the 1940–1942 period, to between 1,150 and 1,460 during the next period. In 1945, the energy content was even lower and did not exceed 600 to 1,000 calories a day; that is less than a third of the energy needed by an average worker in heavy industry.[2] This led to the starvation of thousands of inmates. The inmates of Mauthausen, Gusen I, and Gusen II had access to a separate sub-camp for the sick — the so-called Krankenlager. Despite the fact that (roughly) 100 medics from among the inmates were working there,[43] they were not given any medication and could offer only basic first aid.[5][43] Thus the hospital camp – as it was called by the German authorities – was, in fact, the last stop before death for thousands of inmates, and very few had a chance to recover. ""Stairs of Death"" Prisoners forced to carry a granite block up 186 steps to the top of the quarry. April, 1941 visit by Heinrich Himmler The rock-quarry in Mauthausen was at the base of the infamous ""Stairs of Death"". Prisoners were forced to carry roughly-hewn blocks of stone — often weighing as much as 50 kilograms (110 lb) — up the 186 stairs - one behind the other. As a result, many exhausted prisoners collapsed in front of the other prisoners in the line, and then fell on top of the other prisoners, creating a horrific domino effect; the first prisoner falling onto the next, and so on, all the way down the stairs.[44] Such brutality was not accidental. The SS guards would often force prisoners — exhausted from hours of hard labour without sufficient food and water — to race up the stairs carrying blocks of stone. Those who survived the ordeal would often be placed in a line-up at the edge of a cliff known as ""The Parachutists Wall"" (German: Fallschirmspringerwand).[45] At gun-point each prisoner would have the option of being shot or pushing the prisoner in front of him off the cliff.[14] Other common methods of extermination of prisoners who were either sick, unfit for further labour or as a means of collective responsibility or after escape attempts included: Being beaten to death (by the SS and Kapos) Icy showers - some 3,000 inmates died of hypothermia - after having being forced to take an icy cold shower - and who were then left outside in cold weather.[46] Mass-shootings Medical experiments Aribert Heim, dubbed ""Doctor Death"" by the inmates, was there for seven weeks, which was enough to carry out his experiments[47] Another of the Nazi scientists to perform experiments on the inmates was Karl Gross, who purposely infected hundreds of prisoners with cholera and typhus in order to test his experimental vaccines on them. Between 5 February 1942, and mid-April 1944, more than 1,500 prisoners were killed as a result of his experiments[48] Hanging Starvation Injections of phenol. (A group of 2,000 prisoners who applied to be transferred to the sanatorium were declared mentally sick and were killed by Dr. Ramsauer in the course of the H-13 action)[46] Drowning in large barrels of water (Gusen II)[49][d] Beating to death or starving to death in bunkers[50] Throwing the prisoners on the 380 volt electric barbed wire fence[50] Forcing prisoners outside the boundaries of the camp and then shooting them on the pretense that they were attempting to escape[51] After the war one of the survivors, Dr. Antoni Goscinski reported 62 ways of murdering people in the camps of Gusen I and Mauthausen.[46] Hans Maršálek estimated that an average life expectancy of newly-arrived prisoners in Gusen varied from 6 months between 1940 and 1942, to less than 3 months in early 1945.[52] Paradoxically, with the growth of forced labour industry in various sub-camps of Mauthausen-Gusen, the situation of some of the prisoners improved significantly. While the food rations were increasingly limited every month, the heavy industry necessitated skilled specialists rather than unqualified workers and the brutality of the camp's SS and Kapos was limited. While the prisoners were still beaten on a daily basis and the Muselmänner were still exterminated, from early 1943 on some of the factory workers were allowed to receive food parcels from their families (mostly Poles and Frenchmen). This allowed many of them not only to evade the risk of starvation, but also to help other prisoners who had no relatives outside the camps — or who were not allowed to receive parcels.[53]=======================================http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauthausen-Gusen_concentration_camp Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp (known from the summer of 1940 as Mauthausen-Gusen Concentration Camp) grew to become a large group of Nazi concentration camps that was built around the villages of Mauthausen and Gusen in Upper Austria, roughly 20 kilometres (12 mi) east of the city of Linz. Its history ran from the time of the Anschluss in 1938 to the last week of the Second World War. The largest prisoner of war contingent was Soviet, the second largest was Spanish. Initially a single camp at Mauthausen, it expanded over time and by the summer of 1940, the Mauthausen-Gusen had become one of the largest labour camp complexes in German-controlled Europe.[2][3]"

You can rapid fire 30 rounds and immediately remove the bolt carrier and it's clean and cool. Do not try that with a direct impingement AR rifle.

The BCG as pictured looks like the fluted design that is no longer offered by Sig due to the LWRC law suit.  Nice to get a BCG designed for a $3,000 AR.  You can no longer buy this BCG in a Sig 516

Gas piston Sig 516-16 Upper.  Puchased by me directly from Sig Sauer about one year ago.  The POF lower is VERY difficult to find; new or used, and is VERY expensive.  Includes iron sights and two magazines; one magpul and one steel military. Several questions about flutes in the bolt carrier so I changed one picture to show BCG.

http://www.pof-usa.com/

The manufacturing date of the complete lower is 4/30/2010.  All POF lower receivers are machined from 7075 aluminum, and are MilSpec type III hard coat anodized.  They have a flaired magwell for speed loads.

The manufacturing date of the SIG US516-16 upper is 4/13/2011.  SIG SAUER® advanced short-stroke pushrod system. This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment.  Features a free-floating, aluminum, M1913 quad rail and 1:7 right-hand twist bore configuration.

An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts.

The pictured optics (EOTech XPS-03 and Magnifier) and bi-pod are not included in this sale.  They work great and you can find them on-line for just over $1,000 for the pair new.

The Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semi-automatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Beretta designed innovative locked breech with rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. 

The Beretta Px4 Storm Pistol in F versions are equipped with an ambidextrous safety lever positioned on the slide that disconnects the linkage between the trigger and the sear, allowing to decock the hammer (if cocked or if positioned on the half-cock position) with maximum safety, thanks to the rotation of the rear part of the firing pin. The safety may be engaged also with the hammer decocked and with slide open.

I have a nice Ruger SR22 .22lr pistol. Put about 350 rounds through it. Gun has worked flawlessly, no FTE or FTF. I like it, but I was planning on making a  target pistol out of it, and I feel there are better options. Would trade for a nice Mk II/III bull barrel (not 22/45) or a buckmark, or would sell outright for $300. Comes with ruger rug, two mags, mag extensions, box, paperwork, lock, shell and two different size grips and a hogue slip on.  Can get photos on request. Please let me know, thank you!"

I heard about Bike & Build over the summer while I was volunteering with Habit for Humanity Orange County NC. I actually had the opportunity to meet the Bike & Build participants who where riding from NC to San Diego when they stopped in Chapel Hill for their first build day. I have always been really involved with Habitat for Humanity and I thought it was amazing that they were advocating, raising money, and building affordable housing while biking across the country. Since learning about Bike & Build I have become obsessed with the idea of cycling across the country and promoting affordable housing.

Please assist me in making this dream a reality while also supporting the worthwhile cause of promoting affordable housing.

You can donate by going to the bike and build website and searching the 2012 cyclists...  Hint, I'm cycling the northern US route...

I would consider it to be in far better than average condition . Original front/rear sights. All #'s matching and original remington butt pad with white spacer. Millet rings and base. I have never fired it but have cycled a few rounds through it and it appears to function just fine.

The Kalinka Optics BP-02 is an update of the original Soviet BP-02 side mount. On several models we've added an additional side-mounted tactical weaver rail for mounting lighting, laser and other accessories. These rock solid mounts come either off-set left in the traditional Russian style or centered over the weapon's bore line. The Weaver rail measures 140 mm giving you a large range of scope positioning options. The mounts are made of solid seluminium for extreme strength and will accept any standard weaver rings. Standard models sit high enough to allow unrestricted use of the iron sights for co-witnessing while the low profile models sit close to the receiver for great cheek weld. The AK â€˜V' clamp can easily be mounted to any of these rifles with the standard side rail: AK-47, AKM, AK-74, Vepr, Saiga, K-var, KBI, Hesse, Century and Arsenal USA copies, Romak1/2, SLR-93, SLR-95, SLR-101, MK-11, SAR, WUM, SA85M, WASR (check for installed rail), Maddi, Norinco and Poly-Tech copies. The SVD/SKS clamp will fit any of these rifles with the standard side rail: SVD, SKS, NDM-96, Russian Tigr, Romak-3, SSG-97 and PSL rifles.

They are getting rarer everyday, especially VG Hensolt scopes.
