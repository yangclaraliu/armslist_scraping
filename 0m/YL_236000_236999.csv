PEARLS-.38 cal.,"Ohio, Ohio, United States","$ 4,999","Listed On: Friday, November 25, 2011",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This exceptionally rare and all original condition SILVER PLATED with ""New York"" or ""American Scroll"" style engraving and Mother-of-Pearl grips . Double Action Medium Frame Third Model .38 caliber Pocket Revolver is in wonderful ""Excellent"" to ""Near Mint"" condition! It has outstanding ""suction"", an important condition aspect where revolvers are concerned. Silver plated and engraved Merwins of any type are incredibly rare and hardly ever come on the market, as once a collector of Merwins obtains one for his collection, he inevitably keeps it. This beautiful Merwin would be a fantastic and unique addition to the collection of any advanced collector firearms! This Merwin is chambered for the proprietary .38 MH caliber black powder center fire cartridge, and will also chamber the .38 S&W cartridge. This revolver has the two(2)screw sideplate on the left side of the frame. It has a 3.5"" round ribbed barrel, standard open flute five(5) shot cylinder, a knurled tip folding hammer spur and an uncommon large webbed trigger. There are only two(2) pins in the frame retaining the trigger mechanism, one(1) directly over the trigger itself and one(1) over the rear of the trigger guard, instead of the usual three(3) pins found in this area of the frame. I have never seen another Merwin configured like this. I believe this means this may be a very rare variation of this model. (See picture # 7.) The outstanding machine work and highest quality hand fitting makes these revolvers something to be amazed at even today! There is some very, very minor original silver finish loss or fading caused by polishing the silver plating over the years. This polishing of the silver plating over a long period of time has also caused a softening, or loss of sharpness, in the edges of the engraving."

The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.
Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries
THIS IS THE REAL THING, ALL ALUMINUM & STEEL CONSTRUCTION, not the cheaper copies like the Colt & Smith & Wesson .22's
Also Included is an Walther PS 55 Illuminated Reticle tactical scope

This particular MAK 90 was in customs when the 89 ban took affect.Because of this the bayonet lug was ground off and the slant break compensator was replaced with a solid metal fitting then tap welded on for compliance with the ban.There were a small number of these that made it through without being tap welded.This is one of them therefore that makes it more sought after.the metal piece was removed and a slant break was installed. The contractors also tap welded a rear fixed stock screw port for the thumbhole stock.This has been removed and the proper folding stock had been installed."

Collapses with easy storage - The AR-Rest is a great way to sight in your rifle, pistol or shotgun. When done, it comes apart quickly and collapses completely for easy storage in your bag or range box. The AR-Rest also gives you a stable shooting position in a wide variety of conditions.

Durable & strong - Each rest is powder coated for durability and cut with water jet technology (by a Vietnam veteran-owned vendor) from 5052 Aluminum for strength. For extended life, the hardware is stainless steel and corrosion resistance.

This is a Mauser P.08 Luger that was manufactured in 1938 for the German Wehrmacht. Chambered for 9mm Parabellum, the Luger was Germany's first-line handgun in 1938 and the pre-war quality remained high. This pistol is in excellent overall condition. The serial numbered parts are all matching, including the magazine. There are NO import markings and the finish is completely original. I'd grade the blue finish at about 95% with some minor wear on the usual high spots and some very fine freckling at the very front of the right frame rail. The grips are in very good shape however the left grip has the typical small chip beneath the safety lever. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is in good shape with bright, sharp rifling. This Luger also comes with the original June, 1945 dated ""Capture Paper"" authorizing Private Pete Milah to bring the gun home as a war trophy."

I am looking to sell my Advantage Arms .22lr conversion kit LE 19-23. This kit fits Glock models 19, 23, 25, 32, or 38. It is simple to use. Just take off your slide and slip on the Advantage Arms slide and you're shooting .22lr. The whole conversion takes 10 seconds. You get to shoot and train with your Glock grip and trigger etc... but shoot the inexpensive .22lr cartridge. I mostly used Remington Golden Bullet Value Pack, which runs about $18.00 for 550 rounds at Walmart. It is also great for training young or new shooters, plus just plinking. This kit is in perfect condition, works great, always meticulously cleaned, and has everything that it originally came with. There is a small crack in the fitted carrying case (it came that way). But does not affect anything. There is also a Ghost sticker on the case that I put on. I hate to get rid of it. But, I sold my Glock 19 and have no need for it. I'll take $240.00 shipped, PayPal as a personal gift (no fees) or snail mail me a check or face to face for cash in the Marco, Naples area. No FFL needed to ship this. I can provide more pictures if you want to see a certain view etc...

I have spent many years putting this collection together. I have collected autographs since I was a kid and I have enjoyed the hobby for many years. Now, my time with this great collection has passed. Over time, I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on this collection. The majority of my collection consists of vintage baseball autographs such as Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Joe Dimaggio, Ty Cobb, Roger Maris, and many more vintage baseball stars. All of my autographs have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. Below is a list of every item in my collection. You will also see a value for what each item typically sales for. These are not my asking prices. The total value of the collection is approximately $24,265. This is not my asking price. I am only asking $3,500 for the entire collection. I know I am taking a huge loss but I am in a must sell situation. My wife and I have found a piece of property that we are interested in purchasing but we need a larger down payment. So we do not miss the opportunity to buy our dream home. As I said, this is a must sell situation so I will listen to all reasonable offers. I was asking $5,500 for the entire collection. I have dropped my price by $2,000 because we really need to sell the entire collection as soon as possible. This is really going to be an amazing deal for someone. You will not find a nicer collection at a better price. I have thousands more invested in this collection than my asking price. I am taking a huge loss on this collection. I really hate to see this great collection go but I honestly have no other choice. We really need the money right now. My loss is your gain. This would be a great investment opportunity for someone. This would even be great for someone that sells on ebay. You could list these items for sale individually and you could make a large profit if you just have the time. We do not have the time to do this. We need this collection gone as soon as possible. With Christmas right around the corner, this would also make an amazing Christmas gift for the baseball fan in your family. This collection will not last long at this price. If you have any questions or would like to make an offer, please feel free to contact me by email. Thanks for looking.
