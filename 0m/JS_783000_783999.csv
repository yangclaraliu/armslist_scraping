Type: semi-automatic
Gauge: 12 (3"" - 76mm chamber)

This shotgun, developed in the late 1980s or early 1990s by the famous Italian arms manufacturing company Pietro Beretta, is, basically, an upgrade over the preceding model, Beretta 1200. The 1201 was manufactured in two versions, 1201F,intended for hunting and sporting, and the 1201FP, intended for police and other such duties. Interestingly enough, the 1201 is extremely similar to the  BenelliM1 Super 90 shotgun, and had the same recoil-operated semiautomatic action,developed and patented by Benelli. The production of the Beretta 1201 shotguns had been completed.

Since the basic action of the 1201 is similar to such of the Benelli M1 shotgun,for the technical description please refer to the appropriate article at this site. The 1201FP was available with polymer furniture and stock, either with classic or pistol grip. Since the recoil spring is located in the buttstock,this shotgun cannot be fitted with the folding buttstock. The 1201FP can be found with either ghost-ring (large aperture diopter) or open rifle-type rearsights, and with the blade front sight."

Very collect-able and 'hard-to-find' 1st model 2nd variation 'Safety Automatic Hammerless' revolver. Patent dates are on top of the barrel, newest patent date is 1893 and the serial is 'B xxxxx', showing that it is from 1896. This revolver in .32 S&W from Iver Johnson Bicycle and Gun Works has both the first model's single top post with side latch but also has the 'glock style' trigger safety (that was suppose to only be on the second model according to some people -- wikipedia for instance).  The first model was made in 1895 and 1896 only. The first variation was similar, but had no trigger safety and had a similar but slightly different mechanism inside for activating the transfer bar. The second version is the one you see, and is nearly the same but with the addition of the trigger safety. The first variation was only made in 1895 and the second variation was only made in 1896.

Ask Bill Goeforth, the worlds leading expert on vintage/antique Iver Johnsons, and he will tell you that ""This is an early example of an Iver Johnson's Arms and Cycle Works .32 caliber Safety Hammerless, Automatic, Double-Action Revolver. This particular gun is called a Model 1, First Model, 2nd Variation. It has the early style Single Top Latch design (latch is located only on the left side) with its serial number in the B prefix range which indicates it was manufactured in the year 1896. These were only produced for a short time before the Model 2 was introduced with the double latch design in 1897. ""

The barrel measures 5"" with the barrel clearly marked:
IVER JOHNSONS ARMS & CYCLE WORKS. FITCHBURG MASS. U.S.A.
PAT'D APR. 6.86. FEB.15.87. DEC.26.93. PAT'S PENDING

The finish is blueing overall with what I believe are a case colored trigger guard, case colored trigger, case colored side latch and case colored hammer shroud.  What I think is case colors are somewhat weak on the trigger, but stronger on the rest. Believe it or not, the blued finish is actually rarer than the nickle finish. Contrary to what we often think of today, a blued finish was actually more expensive back then because it required extensive polishing to look acceptable. The vast majority of the I.J. revolvers back then were nickle plated because the process automatically covered up imperfections and made an acceptably smooth and shiny looking weapon with virtually no labor hours wasted on actually polishing it! Given how rather thick these nickle platings were and the poor adhesion properties cheap plating had back then, the nickle models you see today are often covered with black pits where nickle is missing and many have nickle still flaking off. This is made worse when you see the yellow brown guck around the edges of these pits and flakes that is often the tell-tale sign that someone cleaned/soaked it in a gun cleaner that has ammonia, like Hoppes No. 9 (great for everything else, but really really bad for nickle). Even blued guns with NO finish left often look better than the majority of the old nickle plated ones.

This revolver has the ORIGINAL checkered hard rubber grips featuring the Iver Johnson Owl's Head logo, these grips are in better shape than most. They are the correct grips with foreward facing owls, not the later ones. Left hard rubber grip is excellent with no chips, cracks, or repairs, Right has minor chip in less noticible spot and has had a small repair which doesn't look that bad (Its surprisingly easy to look over/miss. I've had several 'gun' people fondle and examine it without noticing it). 

Action works perfectly. Latch is tight and locks barrel to the frame with very little play or wiggle. (If it wasn't an antique and meant for black powder cartridges I would shoot it myself) Please note that even though 'semi-smokeless' and 'smokeless' powder had recently been invented, it did not become widely used untill after 1910 (even later in shotguns). Thus, given how old these revolvers (both first and second models) are, Iver Johnson produced these revolvers specifically for black powder and they are not designed to withstand the pressures of modern ammunition. Also given the fact that this was a black powder gun, the bore could be a lot worse, some semblance of rifling is left, there is a little medium and some light pitting inside it, but I have definitely seen a lot of barrels that were much worse off than this one. The outside of the gun is in very nice shape, not much blue left, but very ittle pitting and what there is is pretty light.

It's not very often anybody comes across an Iver Johnson revolver in this condition with a definitive antique pre-1898 serial number -- and is guaranteed as such by virtue of being a first model which were only made 1895 and 1896. (many of the I.J.s sold as antiques are not legitimate, for instance the two largest years of production for the safety hammerless was 1902 and 1903, and the second model was made from 1897-1908 making it difficult to impossible to differentiate the 1897 & 1898 made second models that are legit antiques from the 1899-1908 made second models that are illegal to sell as an antique).

This is a nice conversation piece since Glock is trying/has tried to patent its trigger safety several times claiming that they invented the concept and some other modern pistols have copied it -- yet Iver Johnson built this feature into cheap pocket size revolvers well over a century ago! This particular pistol being one of the earliest examples of any gun with this trigger safety concept, and this is THE earliest one of any of I.J.'s ""Safety"" models with a trigger safety. This I.J. ""Safety"" model is to be considered the earliest pistol of ""modern"" style/design which used a trigger safety, only two other pistol models using such a safety predate it -- both were made by I.J. also, but aren't considered ""modern"" because they don't feature a transfer bar system (I.J. called it the ""hammer the hammer"" system back then). While the engineering/design might be considered ""modern"", this revolver is still an antique since it was made in 1896, a couple years before the cutoff for antiques.                        

I am asking $190 OBO

Like I said, this revolver is fairly collectible and is considered an 'antique' because of its age, since it was made before 1898.  The .32 S&W -called .32 S&W short by some- is still made today in limited batches, but ---AND I HAVE TO STRESS THIS--- this modern ammo is NOT safe to fire in this gun (this gun was from back when they still used black powder in the .32 S&W; the same shape/size of cartridge, but a whole different animal entirely on the inside). Given its age and collect-ability, this one is probably better off just being used to start a conversation or to simply admire while it sits in a case on your wall or as a paperweight on your desk--but it should do a good job of it!"

about your lights.

Reason number 2: They are Flexible

Another substantial advantage of setting up string exterior lights is that they are 

exceptionally flexible. These lights can be set up wherever, from the edging around  your 

veranda, to railings on steps, to putting them around shrubs and floras. Whatever you 

intend to light up, possibilities are, you can find many kinds of outdoor light string that 

are capable of doing it.

Reason number 3: They're Celebratory

Another reason for the continuing attractiveness of string lighting is that the lights are 

fun and there's no better way to light up the party. And best of all, since they're 

amazingly inexpensive as well, you can usually manage to purchase them in numerous designs 

for numerous types of events. So whether you're throwing a Hawaiian nature d luau or you 

want the outdoor Fourth of July picnic, there's sure to be a bit of lights that you may 

use!

String lights are the amazingly powerful means that you can illuminate your home. Outdoor 

string lights are flexible, economical, and some of the best party lights that money can

NOT IN A RUSH TO SELL BUT IF SOMEONE WANTS THEM MORE THAN I DO HERE IS THEIR CHANCE TO GET ONE.

Am I asking top dollar? Yes I am, however these are the same prices that your beloved Buds Gun Shop is getting everyday on their auctions. I am simply cutting out the auction hassle for you.

The bottom line is I cannot go out and replace these at the same price I paid for them. I bought them as investments and I believe now is the time to cash out on my investment. Prices may continue to price, in which I will have lost out on some potential profit.

Honestly, if you can find these elsewhere at lower prices you should probably get one. i believe these prices reflect the current pulse of the market. You may disagree. We are after all living in the greatest nation on the face of this earth and I respect your right to have a different opinion than me. Please respect my right to set a price for my commodity without your sanctimonious comments. The reality is prices have gone up in the AR market and there are none to be found. You can buy here while you still can or wait and see if prices come back down. Your choice. Stepping off my soapbox now.

I know what you're thinking. ""Will AR prices continue to go up or down?"" Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself.

Tactical Solutions has transferred the innovation from the X-Ring™ series SBX barrel over to the AR-22 conversion. The AR-22 SBX barrel is a 6061-T6 lightweight aluminum threaded end* barrel with a 4140 button rifled steel liner and Hogue® free float forend. The SBX barrel has bore length of 12.25” with a permanently attached shroud for an overall length of 16.5” allowing the user to attach a suppressor without adding length. This gives the user all the advantages of a short barreled rifle without the time consuming and costly SBR paperwork. As with all of our AR-22 conversions, it includes our CNC machined bolt assembly with 416 stainless steel bolt and precision ground tool steel guide rails for strength and smooth, reliable, functionality.

Am I asking top dollar? Yes I am, however these are the same prices that your beloved Buds Gun Shop is getting everyday on their auctions. I am simply cutting out the auction hassle for you.

The bottom line is I cannot go out and replace these at the same price I paid for them. I bought them as investments and I believe now is the time to cash out on my investment. Prices may continue to price, in which I will have lost out on some potential profit.

Honestly, if you can find these elsewhere at lower prices you should probably get one. i believe these prices reflect the current pulse of the market. You may disagree. We are after all living in the greatest nation on the face of this earth and I respect your right to have a different opinion than me. Please respect my right to set a price for my commodity without your sanctimonious comments. The reality is prices have gone up in the AR market and there are none to be found. You can buy here while you still can or wait and see if prices come back down. Your choice. Stepping off my soapbox now.

I know what you're thinking. ""Will AR prices continue to go up or down?"" Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself.

Feinstein’s website and a draft of the bill obtained by NRA-ILA, the new ban would, among other things, adopt new definitions of “assault weapon” that would affect a much larger variety of firearms, require current owners of such firearms to register them with the federal government under the National Firearms Act, and require forfeiture of the firearms upon the deaths of their current owners. Some of the changes in Feinstein’s new bill are as follows:

Reduces, from two to one, the number of permitted external features on various firearms.  The 1994 ban permitted various firearms to be manufactured only if they were assembled with no more than one feature listed in the law. Feinstein’s new bill would prohibit the manufacture of the same firearms with even one of the features.

Adopts new lists of prohibited external features. For example, whereas the 1994 ban applied to a rifle or shotgun the “pistol grip” of which “protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon,” the new bill would drastically expand the definition to include any “grip . . . or any other characteristic that can function as a grip.” Also, the new bill adds “forward grip” to the list of prohibiting features for rifles, defining it as “a grip located forward of the trigger that functions as a pistol grip.” Read literally and in conjunction with the reduction from two features to one, the new language would apply to every detachable-magazine semi-automatic rifle. At a minimum, it would, for example, ban all models of the AR-15, even those developed for compliance with California’s highly restrictive ban.

 Carries hyperbole further than the 1994 ban. Feinstein’s 1994 ban listed “grenade launcher” as one of the prohibiting features for rifles. Her 2013 bill carries goes even further into the ridiculous, by also listing “rocket launcher.” Such devices are restricted under the National Firearms Act and, obviously, are not standard components of the firearms Feinstein wants to ban. Perhaps a subsequent Feinstein bill will add “nuclear bomb,” “particle beam weapon,” or something else equally far-fetched to the features list.
Expands the definition of “assault weapon” by including:

Three very popular rifles: The M1 Carbine (introduced in 1944 and for many years sold by the federal government to individuals involved in marksmanship competition), a model of the Ruger Mini-14, and most or all models of the SKS.

Any “semiautomatic, centerfire, or rimfire rifle that has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds,” except for tubular-magazine .22s.

Any “semiautomatic, centerfire, or rimfire rifle that has an overall length of less than 30 inches,” any “semiautomatic handgun with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds,” and any semi-automatic handgun that has a threaded barrel.

Requires owners of existing “assault weapons” to register them with the federal government under the National Firearms Act (NFA). The NFA imposes a $200 tax per firearm, and requires an owner to submit photographs and fingerprints to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), to inform the BATFE of the address where the firearm will be kept, and to obtain the BATFE’s permission to transport the firearm across state lines.

Prohibits the transfer of “assault weapons.” Owners of other firearms, including those covered by the NFA, are permitted to sell them or pass them to heirs. However, under Feinstein’s new bill, “assault weapons” would remain with their current owners until their deaths, at which point they would be forfeited to the government.

Prohibits the domestic manufacture and the importation of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The 1994 ban allowed the importation of such magazines that were manufactured before the ban took effect. Whereas the 1994 ban protected gun owners from errant prosecution by making the government prove when a magazine was made, the new ban includes no such protection. The new ban also requires firearm dealers to certify the date of manufacture of any >10-round magazine sold, a virtually impossible task, given that virtually no magazines are stamped with their date of manufacture.

Targets handguns in defiance of the Supreme Court. The Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects the right to have handguns for self-defense, in large part on the basis of the fact handguns are the type of firearm “overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose.” Semi-automatic pistols, which are the most popular handguns today, are designed to use detachable magazines, and the magazines “overwhelmingly chosen” by Americans for self-defense are those that hold more than 10 rounds. Additionally, Feinstein’s list of nearly 1,000 firearms exempted by name (see next paragraph) contains not a single handgun. Sen. Feinstein advocated banning handguns before being elected to the Senate, though she carried a handgun for her own personal protection.

Contains a larger piece of window dressing than the 1994 ban. Whereas the 1994 ban included a list of approximately 600 rifles and shotguns exempted from the ban by name, the new bill’s list is increased to nearly 1,000 rifles and shotguns. Other than for the 11 detachable-magazine semi-automatic rifles and one other semi-automatic rifle included in the list, however, the list appears to be pointless, because a separate provision of the bill exempts “any firearm that is manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action.”

The Department of Justice study. On her website, Feinstein claims that a study for the DOJ found that the 1994 ban resulted in a 6.7 percent decrease in murders. To the contrary, this is what the study said: “At best, the assault weapons ban can have only a limited effect on total gun murders, because the banned weapons and magazines were never involved in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders. Our best estimate is that the ban contributed to a 6.7 percent decrease in total gun murders between 1994 and 1995. . . . However, with only one year of post-ban data, we cannot rule out the possibility that this decrease reflects chance year-to-year variation rather than a true effect of the ban.  Nor can we rule out effects of other features of the 1994 Crime Act or a host of state and local initiatives that took place simultaneously.”

“Assault weapon” numbers and murder trends. From the imposition of Feinstein's “assault weapon” ban (Sept. 13, 1994) through the present, the number of “assault weapons” has risen dramatically. For example, the most common firearm that Feinstein considers an “assault weapon” is the AR-15 rifle, the manufacturing numbers of which can be gleaned from the BATFE’s firearm manufacturer reports, availablehere. From 1995 through 2011, the number of AR-15s—all models of which Feinstein’s new bill defines as “assault weapons”—rose by over 2.5 million. During the same period, the nation's murder rate fell 48 percent, to a 48-year low. According to the FBI, 8.5 times as many people are murdered with knives, blunt objects and bare hands, as with rifles of any type.


Traces: Feinstein makes several claims, premised on firearm traces, hoping to convince people that her 1994 ban reduced the (relatively infrequent) use of “assault weapons” in crime. However, traces do not indicate how often any type of gun is used in crime. As the Congressional Research Service and the BATFE have explained, not all firearms that are traced have been used in crime, and not all firearms used in crime are traced. Whether a trace occurs depends on whether a law enforcement agency requests that a trace be conducted. Given that existing “assault weapons” were exempted from the 1994 ban and new “assault weapons” continued to be made while the ban was in effect, any reduction in the percentage of traces accounted for by “assault weapons” during the ban, would be attributable to law enforcement agencies losing interest in tracing the firearms, or law enforcement agencies increasing their requests for traces on other types of firearms, as urged by the BATFE for more than a decade. 


Call Your U.S. Senators and Representative: As noted, Feinstein intends to introduce her bill on January 3rd. President Obama has said that gun control will be a “central issue” of his final term in office, and he has vowed to move quickly on it.

The following is the description from the site I purchased the gun from back in early summer:

Colt SP6920 AR15 Carbine. The Gold Standard of AR15's 

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. 

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. - Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components - Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) - Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire - 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations - Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications - Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures - Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud - Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance - Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories - M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification - Cleaning kit, sling, and 1 magazine are standard. - Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation - High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness. 

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 5.65 lb - ideal for tactical use."

Also included is a new, water tight ammo can and 5 new Magpul P-Mags. Everything fits perfectly in the ammo can for compact storage. Since these have become hard to find, I'm putting a trade value of $550 on this package. That's approximately $0.75 per round, $25 per mag and $25 for the ammo can. It's a good deal considering anywhere you can find it in stock wants $1 - $2 per round. Not looking for cash as the dollar is so weak. Won't buy much in the near future in regard to dairy/food, gas, etc. Thanks for looking :-)

The X-Sizer Die features a specially designed mandrel that eliminates the need for repeated trimming after an initial trim of .020"" off the maximum case length. The mandrel contacts the case mouth during sizing and reduces the growth rate. Because of an extremely close tolerance between the mandrel and die neck wall, the neck wall of the case does not thicken as the case length is pushed back. Cases repeatedly sized in the X-Die will initially grow a few thousandths of an inch, then stabilize below the maximum case length with no discernable loss of accuracy or case life.

Also, click on ""Listings by this user"" for my Rolex I am looking to trade also... ON TO THE GUTAR

This is an extremely rare opportunity to own an unique item. First off, the electric guitar was made by Jarrett Guitars, 50 guitars were scheduled to be built in the limited ""Commemorative Series"" and this is guitar number #19 in the series, serial number CSX2002-34, but only 40 ended up making the production run from what I have found out. The Guitar comes with certificate of authenticity from JARRETT GUITARS, CONNECTICUT USA, authenticated by Jack Camarda. All of this can be verified by contacting Mr. Camarda at Jarrett, he was the program's director, he actually returned my call when I was researching the Guitar almost 10 years ago when I bought it. (You can google his name & Shelby Guitar, and get the history of the project).

Anyways, it's a rare piece both for collectors and players, and an extremely unique piece for Shelby Cobra fans. 22 frets, humbuckers, 3 way selector switch. Volume and tone controls push/pull to split the coils in the humbuckers. Set neck with pearl inlays, and custom Shelby Cobra graphics. If you Google this guitar and read the Harmony Central reviews, you will discover just how amazing this guitar really is. This guitar has lived it's life in it's case which is included. The guitars originally sold in the 4k-8k range due to the limited number made and have never seen one that was autographed, period.

As for the autograph, being a Shelby Cobra owner I have attended several events at Boulder, Colorado's ""Shelby American Collection"" museum. Mr. Shelby signed this at one of the annual Christmas benefits (December, 2007) and all monies collected from the benefits were donated to help operate the museum and to the Carroll Shelby Foundation (http://www.cscf.org/). As such it comes with a certificate of authenticity from them. I had Mr. Shelby inscribe it to me and my name can easily be removed if you want me to remove it. Just takes some rubbing alcohol because the inscribed signature was done with a Sharpie and since the guitars finish has several layers of clear coat built up on it, the Sharpie couldn't have penetrated through the finish. I am the original owner of the guitar and have owned it for almost 10 years. I have rarely come across these guitars and have never seen one that has been autographed. As you know Mr. Shelby has passed away and therefore I wouldn't anticipate a signed example making it to the market..

To get an idea of value's you can check out these current auctions for similar guitars, first ones aren't autographed, second one is signed but a different style of Shelby Guitar. It's just to give an idea, I don't need any insulting low ball offers, I paid a lot of money just for the guitar...

Lewis Machine and Tool is the real deal and they make top quality products and this upper is no exception. Due to the current climate I don't think I will ever be able to find a LMT lower for it as I had hoped when I bought it new 2 years ago. So it has just sat in my Safe and now I am deciding to sell it instead. 

Price is $1200 

Again this has been unshot by me but if you know any thing about LMT they are serious about testing their products before sending them out and it must meet a stringent checklist which includes test firing more than just one or two rounds.  This is a chance to own an operator grade upper. 

If the post is still listed the upper is still available. Please do not send me a message if the upper is still available as I will take down the post when it has sold."

The new Para Tactical Target Rifle with its Delayed Impingement Gas System™ (DIGS™) gets you back on target faster than any other rifle of its kind. The recoil spring is over the op-rod so there is no “twang” in your ear as your head rests on the rifle’s stock while the bolt cycles between shots. 

Having the recoil system up front over the barrel puts it where it naturally pushes the rifle back down on target instead of up and into your shoulder. 

The TTR’s gas system not only improves target acquisition but it also keeps the chamber area cleaner. The gases that flow through the tube inside the op-rod are expelled through the Manifold Injector System™ (MIS™) in the bolt carrier making it the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world. 

Bailing in and out of a Humvee or MRAP vehicle with a conventional rifle can be slow and awkward but the Para Tactical Target Rifle with its DIGS recoil system gives you the advantage of compactness without having to shorten the barrel and lose velocity. 

The Rapid Deployment Stock™ (RDS™) reduces the overall length of the Tactical Target Rifle by almost 10-inches when the stock is folded. The unique 5-position sliding stock means that whether you are 5-foot 4"" or 6-foot 4"" the Tactical Target Rifle will fit you. 

""For the past decade one of my top secret weapons in the competition world has been the Tactical Target Rifle. I have trusted it and used it exclusively for over ten years. Its unique design lets me get on target faster with accuracy and reliability unmatched in any other rifle. And it is just fun to shoot."" - Todd Jarrett, World Champion Shooter and Instructor

You don't see these very much and you sure don't see them with the original matching magazine and barrel, and a low serial number. The Ballester-Rigaud was built for a very short time between 1938–1940. It was designed to offer the Argentine police and military a less-expensive alternative to the Pistola Colt Modelo 1927, which was itself a licensed copy of the Colt M1911A1 (and was built under the supervison of Colt engineers). So now you know the Colt engineers were there and the quality is high. The basic difference is there is no grip safety. Get your own 45 for hundreds less than everyone else does. I can ship it from my FFL to yours; unless you live in Northern Virginia. You can come pick it up with the proper ID. Check, money order, back check accepted. Once it clears it will be sent out with a tracking number. It is also listed elsewhere, so I reserve the right to remove the listing if it is sold. Happy new year.

The rifle itself is your basic Ruger M77 hunting rifle, wood stock with checkering, bull barrel, Mauser action. There is slight wear on the stock, and it looks like it might have been like this from the factory. The bluing has been refinished to be a very nice charcoal bluing and it is just about flawless. The gun has no sights from the factory. I have a Leupold Vari-X III 6.5 x 20 mounted on it and it drives tacks!! I also have attached a nice leather sling to it. The gun came to me with a nice soft cover which will also go with the gun. I have taken as many pics as I could to display this rifle is, but the pics do not reflect how nice it really is. 

From the pics you would be able to see that the bore is nice and clean as well as the breach and bolt face. There is a 4Mb limit on pics??? Anyways, this gun has very little wear on it, a few spots where the bolt rides have some of the bluing wore down a little, but overall I would rate this gun at 97% There is a slight amount of rust on the site rings; I actually hadn't noticed it until I took the up close of the chamber. It is only on the ring, I immediately pulled the scope off to inspect and found everything else satisfactory........but you will now need to site this rifle in again!!

To be honest I have only shot this gun to site it in and have not killed any coyotes yet; we'll chalk it up to bad luck and worse weather :-) Every time I have shot this gun it has been thoroughly cleaned. I will only send this to a licensed FFL holder so please include the gun store where I will be sending it when you respond. Shipping is included in the listed price."
