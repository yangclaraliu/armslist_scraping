The Misunderstood KAR 88 Carbine ""Commission"" Rifle 

By Mike Hudson




KAR 88 carbine. Photo by Mike Hudson.
After hunting season last year, I paid a visit to my eye doctor, who told me I needed an operation. A few weeks later, he removed the cataracts that had clouded my vision to the point where I could no longer drive at night, slipped in a pair of permanent contact lenses that corrected the nearsightedness that had me wearing glasses since I was 12 and restored my vision to a perfect 20-20.

When I thought about possible applications for my new super vision, it occurred to me that since I had never been able to hit the broad side of a barn since turning 30 without the use of telescopic sights, maybe I could return to the simplicity and moral uprightness of my forebears and try hunting with an iron-sighted rifle.

The next thing I knew, I was the proud owner of a German KAR 88 carbine, rather a poor man’s version of the 1903 Mannlicher carbine so beloved by Hemingway, Chuck Hawks and anyone else who has ever had the good fortune to hold one in their hands. In fact, some authorities believe that the KAR 88 served as the prototype for the later 1903.

Manufactured at the Erfurt arsenal in 1896, my GEW 88 sports a 17-1/4” barrel with an excellent bore, a nicely turned-down butter knife bolt handle and a full length Mannlicher stock and nose cap. The action is incredibly smooth and the bolt will slide in or out simply by tipping the muzzle in the appropriate direction. The three-position safety, located at the rear of the bolt, would be familiar to anyone who has handled a Mauser of any vintage.

With an overall length of 37-1/8” and weighing in at just 6-1/2 pounds, the KAR 88 would certainly meet anyone’s definition of light and handy. While it fires a significantly more powerful cartridge, the specs are nearly identical to those of the popular Winchester 1894 carbine.

The nose cap is stamped “A.M.X. 5. 13.” This means that it was the 13th carbine originally issued to the 5th Artillery Ammunition Supply Column of10th Imperial German Army Corps. An Army Ranger, who purchased it in a Kabul bazaar, brought this particular rifle back from Afghanistan.

It’s unfortunate, but the KAR 88 and the full-length rifle known as the GEW 88 or “Commission” rifle, have received perhaps the worst press of any military rifles ever, with the possible exception of the M-38 Carcano short rifle used in the assassination of JFK, or the straight-pull Ross rifle, which would occasionally leave the shooter with the bolt sticking out of his forehead.

“You can’t shoot that with modern ammo,” I was told. “It will blow up.” The amount of misinformation out there today about the M-1888 series is staggering and I am convinced that most of it comes from people who have never even seen, much less fired, one of these fine old arms.

The bad rap given to the 88 series began almost as soon as they were in introduced into the Imperial German service. Some proto-Nazi wrote a pamphlet referring to the new rifle as the “Judenflinte,” because the guns were primarily being manufactured at the factory of Ludwig Lowe. Since Lowe was Jewish and there were some problems with the first run of the new rifle, deliberate sabotage must be the answer, the rabid anti-Semite concluded.

The truth is that little was known in 1888 about the pressures generated by the new smokeless powder and, indeed, an unknown number of barrels did burst during early trials. These original guns had a bore (land) diameter of .318” and the later 8x57JS cartridges were loaded with .323” bullets, though the bursting problem had nothing to do with bore size and had in fact occurred in the Imperial German service rifles before the JS cartridge was introduced.

By 1896, the problem was solved by reaming out the chamber throat for a short distance, thus allowing the case neck to expand properly and relieving pressure. The groove diameter on both the 8x57J and the 8x57JS designed for use with the Mauser of 1898 is, and always was, identical.

Finally, in 1903, barrels on existing stocks of M-1888 rifles were replaced entirely with barrels bored and chambered to fire the later 8x57JS round. Guns that have had the modification have an “S” (for spitzer) stamped on the receiver ring and rifles and carbines that had their barrels replaced entirely for the modern ammo are stamped “nm” (for new material) on the side rail. Still, as with any vintage arm, the M-1888 rifles and carbines should be checked over by a competent gunsmith before firing and the bore should be slugged to determine whether or not a particular specimen has had these modifications performed.

I have been unable to track down a single verifiable instance of one of these modified rifles or carbines blowing up over the last century, despite extensive correspondence and research, and the fact that many people seem to think it happens all the time. Tens of thousands of M-1888 rifles and carbines saw service with the German Army in WWI and thousands more remained in reserve at Turkish arsenals as recently as the 1990's. Obviously, the Germans and the Turks were not issuing two different kinds of 8mm ammo. One can only imagine the logistical nightmare that would result from such an arrangement.

This should not be taken as an endorsement of firing modern, full power 8x57JS ammo out of your surplus M-1888. The newest of these guns are more than 100 years old. The same holds true for the use of surplus military ammo in these old guns, as much of it was loaded considerably hotter than even modern European sporting loads. However, I submit that the M-1888 action is every bit as strong as the 1892 Krag, many of which still see service as hunting rifles across America today.

The carbine I purchased had both the “S’ and “nm” markings and the bore slugged out as .321, within the acceptable range for the 8x57JS round. The two locking lugs, located on either side of the bolt head, are backed up by the bolt handle itself, which acts as a third (safety) lug.

Despite the fact that I was convinced about the carbine’s shootability, I wasn’t about to test it with any of the high-speed 8x57 loads available today. Like most of the early Mannlichers, the KAR 88 loads by means of an en-block clip and the four I found at a gun show recently were already charged with remarkably fresh looking RWS cartridges dating to 1933.

Interestingly, the original box the ammo came in was stamped “8mm Mannlicher-Mauser,” and a number of early 20th Century commercial advertisements I have seen for surplus KAR 88’s use the same name. These rounds employ a 227 grain round nose bullet at 2213 fps, generating muzzle energy of about 2500 foot-pounds. That is not too far off from the current 220 grain load for the .30-06 produced by Remington.

I fired a few and the accuracy was promising. However, these cartridges are collector’s items themselves and I bought them mainly to get the clips.

Remington’s 170 grain Core-Lokt loading is kept within the SAAMI maximum pressure limit of 37,000 cup and is safe to use in shootable M-1888 rifles and carbines. With a muzzle velocity of 2181 fps generating 2102 ft. lbs. of muzzle energy, this load is comparable to the .300 Savage and may be used on most any North American game at ranges out to 200 yards.

Better for my money is the Privi Partisan 196 grain ammo, which is also loaded to SAAMI specs. With a muzzle velocity of 2181 fps and muzzle energy of 1911 ft. lbs., this well-designed bullet boasts a respectable sectional density of .271 and is a near twin, ballistically, of the venerable .35 Remington.

Offhand at 75 yards, I have been able to get consistent three-inch groups using the old battle sight, entirely satisfactory for the sort of hunting I do. I would just as soon not have to find out how it performs against the big bears, but for whitetail deer, black bear and wild boar at typical Eastern Woodlands ranges it should do fine.

The M-1888 rifles and carbines have been imported by the tens of thousands in recent years and interest in them has been such that author Paul S. Scarlata recently wrote a book, “The German GEW 88 Commission Rifle.” At least three Web sites are dedicated entirely to collecting and shooting these arms and contain a lot of useful information.

Their history is wild and varied, having seen service in China during the Boxer Rebellion, Africa during the Boer War and in World Wars I and II. How mine came to be in Afghanistan is anyone’s guess, but it probably saw service there as well.

This season, I’ll be saying goodbye to glasnost and heading down south of here for a crack at black Russian boar. With any luck at all, my German carbine loaded with good Serbian ammo will help settle some old scores and bring home the bacon.

Rifle is sold with the Leupold 3x9x40 Vari II scope pictured, it is a sweet set-up.

The Safari has the deluxe walnut furniture, engraving, gold trigger and the quality that Belgium manufactured FN / Browning firearms are noted for. The Browning Bar II is rated amoung, if not the best semi-autoloading magnum-caliber rifle made. Dependable, reliable, powerful !  

The .338 is ideal for any large, tough skin, dangerous North American game. Being an auto-feeding style rifle the recoil is managable yet has exceptional knock down power at distance.

This is probably the most accurate handgun I've ever fired. It has a very smooth double action trigger and a very crisp single action trigger, better than that on a CZ 75 or Sig 226. This thing makes it very easy to put all shots into one ragged hole at pistol distances, really easy to hit cans with at 50 yards, didn't go further than that. It also is the softest recoiling 9mm I've fired. This surprised me as it's very light weight....around 23 or 24 ounces I believe.

I don't pay full retail for anything. What I will do, is offer you more for your firearm than you will get at a Pawn Shop, trade in at a dealer, or what you will get at a gun show. If you need to sell today I can buy today. 

Always keep in mind this is a business transaction, don't take it personal if we don't agree on your items condition or price. I have my opinions you will have yours, been burned on some deals so I want to be as straight forward as I can.

Here is the spill.  I determine the current market value of a firearm using the NRA grading standard, and start my base evaluation at the buy it now price on the major auction sites (gunauction.com for instance). This gives me the current market value of a firearm either NIB or NRA Excellent. I search out the lowest new in box price and start from there. Taking in consideration the gun(s) you are selling are not new, and may have been fired, also whether or not you have the factory boxes, and manuals along with any accessories. I come up with an offer. For optics, I priced them separate from the rifles using the same method. If I can buy it now, in an auction, new in the box from a dealer for less than you are asking, then why would I buy it used from you? Boxes and Manuals are always a plus.

My offers are subject to inspection. Initial offers are based on an assumption of a grade of NRA Good to Excellent. If I find any blemishes or condition issues upon inspection that have not been previously discussed it will affect the offer. My offer is good for 30 days.

Once we agree to a price I will be happy to purchase your firearm, I will provide you with a bill of sale, a copy for you and a copy for me. This is to protect both of us. The bill of sale will have to have the Make, Model, and Serial number of the firearm, along with your Name, DOB, and TDL #. You must be at least 21 years old to sell a sidearm, and 18 years old to sell a rifle or shotgun in Texas. The sale is private party to private party. If you agree to the terms and price we can do business."

The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Features contrast sights. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. Two finishes are available; Two-tone and corrosion resistant Nitron.

It pains me to do it and I've already listed it for considerably less than what I have invested, and what my bank showed me it was worth. Here are some details.

Only 86,000 original miles! Lots of life still in it. Drives great and sounds great. Newer $3000 paint job that looks excellent. 4wd works without a flaw. It has a 350 V8 and 700r4 trans, almost all options available at the time A/C, power windows, power locks, cruise, tilt, and upgraded stereo. Newer GMC steering wheel but have original and the original stereo head unit if you want to keep it stock. Interior is in great shape probably 8.5/10 except for some cracks on the dash. All lights and windows work, back glass goes down quick. Top comes off good and seals good. Good tread on tires, which are Bridgestone 32's. Brakes are good. Suspension and joints are good. Everything about this truck has been meticulously maintained. Have many receipts of all the work and upgrades. About a year ago it had fresh spark plugs and wires, and a brand new dual exhaust with Flowmaster mufflers were installed. Truck sounds amazing and gets compliments.

Here are what few minor things I know of, I want to be honest and not omit any important detail. On the drivers side rear quarter panel is a few scratches from me taking the top off and letting it fall. It makes me sick to scratch such an excellent paint job. Most will buff out but I'm not sure if it all will. The A/C at the moment needs charged. The dash is cracked, a nice carpeted dash cover would make it look great. Oil pressure sensor gauge does not work, and sometimes the service engine light comes on, but the shop tells me it's just the sensor and everything is fine. I've driven it that way since I got the dual exhaust and there's never been a problem. Probably just an O2 sensor.

This is a very reliable truck in extremely hard to find condition, I'm sure a person who appreciates older trucks will love it! I know I have. If interested please email! I also have more pics I can email or text."

Serial number is 37120XX which indicates manufacture between January and March 1944.  It was a DCM rifle from years ago and I've had it for about 7 years.  I've checked almost every part using J.C. Harrison's book, ""The M1 Carbine III"", and it appears to be significantly correct/original.  There is only one part that I'm pretty sure is a replacement and that's the late war, swing type safety.  But there may be a few more parts but I'm not sure.  I have not changed or altered the rifle except for adding the sling and mag pouch.  Finish and wear is even and good on all metal parts and the wood is solid with a few dings and bruises.  This rifle comes with a correct magazine stock pouch dated 1943, correct sling, five or six GI 15 round magazines (one is correct IBM), and about 200-230 rounds of GI Lake City .30 carbine ammo in an ammo can.  I'll also include a copy of ""The M1 Carbine Owner's Guide"" by Ruth & Duff.  This is a great collectible piece that wouldn't require much, if any, restoration.  I'm selling this as a package deal for $1,200.  Feel free to ask questions.  Serious inquiries only.  The buyer can request to go through Harrison's book with me to verify rifle's ""correctness"" if they feel it necessary.  Thanks."

Purchased new and assembled by myself, Sako TRG-22 .308 with Nightforce 5.5-22x50 optics (mrad knobs). Other features include: Sako Muzzlebrake, Accushot rear monopod, NEAR engineering picatinny rail. Trijicon rings and bases.

Also included is all documentation, a sniper style fold out drag bag/shooting mat, and Kestrel hand held weather meter (same model used by US military).

The rifle is currently sighted in for Federal match-king 168 gr factory rounds, and comes complete with a range card out to 1000 yards. The range card was made by myself, and hasn't failed me yet, as the rifle is very well taken care of, and the optics are renown for holding a zero even in less than ideal situations.

If you do any research on this rifle or Sako, you will find a strong standing of quality, and an outstanding history of Finnish rifle making. Really don't want to let this beauty go, but I'm building a race car, and I believe that someone else will truly enjoy this rifle, instead of just letting it sit in the safe.

thanks for looking, feel free to throw me any offers, no lowballing, this rifle is the real deal."

Included is everything in the last pic, Barrel, bolt, firing pin, gas block, FSB, and D-ring assy. Asking $150, will trade + cash for a 20"" A1-profile in a 1-9 twist, or a DSA nitrided M4 barrel. Would prefer FTF so buyer can inspect barrel him/herself, but will ship @ cost under assumption of as-is.

Ultimate CCW pistol.  To achieve this, the gun was designed from its inception to be small, roughly 5.2 "" x 3.7""; to weigh a mere 13.5 oz; to be slim and smooth, devoid of any sharp edges or protrusions; and to have no external levers or controls to be manipulated. To get into action, one simply has to pull the trigger, which is a double-action only. The Rohrbaugh R9 is manufactured with space-age technology, using state-of-the-art CNC machining, which keeps tolerances to a minimum, thereby maintaining complete consistency in functioning. It is ergonomically designed to work seamlessly with the human body to point naturally and keeping the wrist and forearm in line. The design of the grip is also designed to push the recoil to the center of the palm, thereby reducing felt recoil.

State of the Art:
This firearm is designed with the use of CAD/CAM programs. CNC machines perform the manufacturing. Then each gun is then hand fitted and assembled in our state of the art facility. The materials used are of the highest grade, including quality stainless steel, 7075 aircraft aluminum, G-10 grips and Wolff springs."

The GSG 5 is an identical replication of the MP 5, except one great thing: Its a 22 cal. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG 5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux suppressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low-cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies and departments that use MP5's in the field.

it comes with a custom 4 cavity NOE 368 280gr fn mold that has only cast around 100 boolits, a set of hornady dies, over a box of speer 270 gr bullets, and 18 rounds of ammo loaded with my favorite load. (load data is on the box) i have a few more pieces of brass around here that i would just throw in with it. the stock looks to be refinished. the bluing is excellent. i have not gotten to shoot any of the cast bullets from this rifle.

the only wear is on the bow of the trigger guard from hunting. 
i'm asking $700 for the rifle and the entire lot of accessories. IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOLD, I'LL DROP THE PRICE TO $625. please feel free to ask any questions or for more pics. i might be interested in partial trades, but i need cash for christmas. i am looking for either a 93/95 mauser action or a 98 turk action. (or entire rifles). i might be interested in a partial trade of rifles in odd cartridges, project rifles, etc. make me an offer, the worst i can do is say no.

i figured my price as follows: rifle $500, dies $50, mold/top punch/lyman size die $100, bullets $25, brass/ammo $25, grand total of $700"

The gun is in geat condition and shows only minimal holster wear on a few minor sections of the slide near the end of the barrel. Overall I would grade the gun between 90-95% condition (I am a Gander Mountain firearms specialist and I grade used firearms that we buy and sell on a daily basis).

This is probably the most accurate handgun I've ever fired. It has a very smooth double action trigger and a very crisp single action trigger, better than that on a CZ 75 or Sig 226. This thing makes it very easy to put all shots into one ragged hole at pistol distances, really easy to hit cans with at 50 yards, didn't go further than that. It also is the softest recoiling 9mm I've fired. This surprised me as it's very light weight....around 23 or 24 ounces I believe.

Its a  DPMS Oracle flat top with A2 Colt buttstock with trap door, this is the forward assist/dust cover version, not the slick side. It has a Rock River Arms Half Quad free float kit, 16"" bull barrel with A3 flash hider. The rifle is all black but had a desert tan 30rnd Circle K (USGI) mag in it at the time so that may be a sign if you come across a bunch of black accessories and one tan mag. The gas block is the only silver part on the rifle, its homemade (cut down front sight) low pro and is partly covered by the rifle length HG. Also there was a 30mm Vortex StrikeFire red dot that was well used with plenty of tool marks on the mount, the dust cover has a hand engraved American flag on the inside etched upside down so that when its flipped open it's right side up, the stars are just dots.

If you come across this rifle if at all possible call the police, it has been reported stolen and they have the serial number and a open case on it (so they say), if for what ever reason you dont call the police just contact me, I will not ask your name or any questions about you, I wont even give the police any info I talked to you, I will either deal with it myself of give the detective the info as if it were first hand. Please any info would help, we all know CPD isnt actually doing shit to find it and if I want it back its up to me."
998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/210998,For Sale/Trade:  Custom Rossi .223/5.56 bull barrel Sniper/Varmint rifle,"North West side, Evansville, Indiana",$ 450,"Listed On: Thursday, October 20, 2011",Rifles,Rossi-Braztech                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Single Shot                                                                                ,Rifle,"I was a sniper in the Army, and wanted a rifle that I could practice 600+ yard shots with. I started building up this rifle because I had a surplus of 5.56 rounds that I wanted to use up, and since this is a single shot you can use .223 and 5.56 rounds in it without issue. I had a $1200 Leupold mil dot scope on it and fired 65 rounds through it before I made the mistake of letting my niece fire it. She shot it, then picked it up by the scope and scratched the hell out of the lens. I don't have the money to fix the scope any time soon, so I'm going to throw on a new Tasco scope, let this go.

This started out as a $300 Rossi single shot, with a bull barrel. 
Package consists of:
$38 Tasco 3-9x50 scope (not yet zeroed)
$39 bi-pod
$60 ATI M4 6 position buttstock, and foregrip
$14 223 shot shell holder
$50 GMG butt pad/mono-pod (not in the pictures)
$23 bore snake
$48 soft case
$5 shot shell sleeve on the original wood furniture
$20 box (29 rounds) of 5.56 FMJ
$80 (160 rounds) of FMJ .223 

I've added the prices so that you know why the rifle costs more than a new, plain Jane Rossi. After googling all of the individual pieces, the cheapest I can find everything as a package is $600. 
I don't need to get rid of this rifle. It's a super accurate little plinker/hunting rifle. Only selling if the price is right to go towards a new truck.
The break open is tight on this rifle, because the foregrip (that holds the rifle together at the hinge) is brand new. It will loosen up with time and use.
The price on this rifle will only go up, because I'm always adding new things to it. This will soon have a shortened/threaded/compensated barrel that will add $150+ to the cost."
