So I decided to get a .22 pistol and rifle. Walter P22, Sig Mosquito, and Ruger 10/22 are my favorite, but I'm open to all offers.

I'm located in Charlotte, but don't mind to drive a couple of hours for a decent gun. Before you make me an offer check budsgunshop.com - there are only 2 things that stop me from buying there: shipping and FFL fees. Keep that in mind when you make an offer.
I require  a signed bill of sale with DL information. If you are not a NC resident, please don't bother - I'm not interested in paying additional FFL fee. 

Thank you and have a great day!"

Personal Protection 44 Magnum Ammo and an extra Hogue rubber full grip set (new) (I like the combat grip sleeve myself..).

 Excellent condition MR / IMI (Israel Military Industries) Desert Eagle. Very few rounds down the pipe in it's life. I bought it from an Air Force guy who wore it as his back-up protection for bears in Alaska. The muzzle area has some bluing loss from being in his leather holster, but nothing else wrong with this great hand cannon! I bought the soft shoulder holster to carry concealed. I've run approximately 80 rounds through it. I also bought the spring rebuild kit and field strip / cleaning kit (both new and unopened) because I like to have the 'official' parts when I need them. The Magnum Research folks say the springs should be replaced at somewhere around 3000 rounds, so I picked up a set, just to be safe.

 An important point about these DEagles is that you can NOT shoot handloads / reloads through them unless the the rounds are put through a total final sizing die. They will jam if there's any kind of case 'bulge', so have to be perfectly sized per new ammo tolerances. New ammo is the only way to go with these anyway, to assure consistent accuracy. Fully jacketed ammo is the best to use, so the gas port doesn't get fouled with lead, but semi-jacketed ammo works just as well. 

 Just so you know, the Desert Eagle was never intended to be any type of combat weapon. It's heavier than most (to lessen the recoil) for it's design purpose of being an accurate target pistol. It's amazingly accurate at up to 100 yards, and doesn't have as much recoil as you might expect. I found it VERY manageable, with pretty quick target reacquisition. I was really impressed with it! Definitely a fun shooter! Yeah, you can use it as a home defense / personal defense / concealed carry weapon too, which is what the concealed carry shoulder holster is for.... but this is not for the small handed / framed person to be able to handle quickly. If you've ever wanted a Desert Eagle, here it is! They are just plain FUN to shoot!

You could buy a Ruger, and they are good and tough, but they don't have the soul and handling that this gun does.  You could also buy a Colt, if you're wanting to drop $1,200+ on it.  I wouldn't do anything but the Cimarron.

The EOTech on it will NOT come with it unless you want it, if so we can most likely work something else out (it's used so I'm not going to want full price for it but I really do like the sight so I won't part with it without something for it)
I build/get/buy guns for pleasure not for profit so the price partially reflects all the stuff on it (alot of stuff on ARMSLIST [especially the OK section] are overpriced and that kind of sickens me but I belive this price is fair for a souped up AK. I am willing to negotiate but no low ball offers. I'm not pressed to sell or trade this but I do have another project in my sights and liquidating this for that will definately help. My loss your gain.

I bought this gun used and ran 200 quality rounds through it. I bought the gun used so I cannot guarantee how many rounds over all she has seen but the bore is bright and shiney and rifling is strong so I would say not that more more than a thousand or two if that.

**Also The AR Pistol in the picture can go too for the right amount though right now with everything I have for it I will not let it go for less than 1000."

If you have a rare one (dragoon, finnish, etc) I might be able to pay a bit more but only if the numbers match.

Ammo and accessories (bayo, pouches, clips) is a plus.

Might be interested in a semiauto pocket gun.  .32 or .380, not looking for a revolver or derringer.  It'd be for pocket carry as a backup or primary in summer.  Doesn't have to be fancy.

I have a few guns I may be willing to trade and I have non-firearm stuff I can trade if you are interested.  Asking for cash is ok too though, don't hesitate.  I prefer to deal in the Columbus/Delaware area and will only drive further if it is a really good deal."

It was basically produced as a RPK replica. complete with steel bipod.

-They originally came with a wooden thumb hole stock but I found it to be very awkward and uncomfortable. So I removed it and put on an adjustable folding stock with quad-rail. It makes the gun lighter and more like a typical AK-47. 

-NHM's have a longer barrel which greatly increases accuracy at long distances. (Shoots like a SKS) Also the barrel is chrome lined and double thick which keeps it much cooler than a typical AK-47. 

-This gun is no safe queen but is in very good condition. Which is why I am willing to sell it for less than the recommended $900.00 price. You can look these up on several web sites and will find them going for as much as $1100.00.

Original Wood stock

The shotgun is a 12 gauge pump, 2 3/4 inch, made around the mid 50's, no serial that I can see.

It works just fine, and spits spent casings pretty far! 5 + 1 capacity.
No choke, and has a 27 inch barrel that hasn't been cut down, so it's set up for hunting, or could be modified for home defense if need be.

It's over 60 years old, so obviously it's been used, the bluing is a bit faded in spots and the wood has some dings and stuff, but it's still nice and strong, and I don't see any rust.

I'll also include some 'extras':
1 soft carrying case
2 boxes of birdshot
and some cleaning rods and such, just to get you started (if you want them)"

I will also throw in a new box of 50 federal HST 147gr 9mm rounds and a box of 20 speer gold dot 147 gr 9mm rounds. There is one problem with the gun and that is the paint chipped off near the trigger pin area. I had a local gunsmith 'attempt' to work on the gun (he said he knew how to work on CZs) and he put the chip on the paint. Good thing I stopped him after I saw that he didn't even know how to take out a trigger pin. I ended up shipping it off to czcustom. The two chips are really small and if it looks like the metal is chipped its not. CZ's just have a really thick poly coat.

The price is FIRM. I can't meet up far away because I no longer have a car so we'll have to meet up in the Seattle area.
Please bring CPL and license or I wont sell the gun to you.

Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the M2 12-gauge shotgun and 20-gauge shotgun are built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism. The Inertia Driven® system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12 gauge cartridge, from 2-3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums.Benelli engineers have also adapted the ComforTech® recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48% and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the shooter back on target up to 69% faster than with any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new ComforTech® system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you will ever shoot.----------------------------------- This gun is used, absolutely love it and never had any issues. I have never had any issues with this gun skeet shooting or quail / pheasant hunting.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

""Leupold CDS™ models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged. How the CDS™ System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account.""

Make offers if you'd like, whether it be cash or firearm, maybe even both, but no low ballers because I will just ignore them. Everyone wants to get full retail for their guns on here, so if you're going to try that shit on me, I'll do the same in return. Used guns are and always will be ""used"" whether you shot it or not. No different than buying a car and parking it in your garage until you decide to sell it. It's still ""used.""

It was basically produced as a RPK replica. complete with steel bipod.

-They originally came with a wooden thumb hole stock but I found it to be very awkward and uncomfortable. So I removed it and put on an adjustable folding stock with quad-rail. It makes the gun lighter and more like a typical AK-47. 

-NHM's have a longer barrel which greatly increases accuracy at long distances. (Shoots like a SKS) Also the barrel is chrome lined and double thick which keeps it much cooler than a typical AK-47. 

-This gun is no safe queen but is in very good condition. Which is why I am willing to sell it for less than the recommended $900.00 price. You can look these up on several web sites and will find them going for as much as $1100.00.

Excellent condition.  450 rounds through it flawlessly.  No magazines- the one's that came with the gun were not very good so I sold them.  But extra pair of slim line cocobolo grips included and Wilson Combat lo profile holster that is a almost new as well but a little broken in which is a good thing- it came tight.  I would recommend Wlson Combat mags.  Dan Wesson 1911s are some of the best you can get for the money.  Accurate and reliable and well thought out designs that true 1911 enthusiasts can appreciate.  This Guardian is an excellent carry gun- with a light weight alloy frame.  And when you pull the slide back and forth it is smoother than any gun for the same price.
