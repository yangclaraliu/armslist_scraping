Barrel is bright and shiny with excellent riflings. The Serial number 118XX. The Ballester-Molina pistol was designed and built by the Argentine company Hispano Argentina Fábrica de Automotores SA (HAFDASA). The Ballester was originally called the Ballester-Rigaud (c. 1938–1940). The Ballester was designed to offer to the Argentinian police and military a less-expensive alternative to the Pistola Colt Modelo 1927, a licensed copy of the Colt M1911A1 built under the supervison of Colt engineers. Production of the Ballester-Molina began in 1938 and ceased in 1953. The history of the company dates back to 1929, when two Spanish entrepreneurs, Arturo Ballester and Eugenio Molina, established a branch of the Spanish Hispano-Suiza in Buenos Aires. Some years later, HAFDASA hired two engineers, the French Rorice Rigaud and Carlos Ballester-Molina, a relative of the founders. Rigaud became the chief designer of the firm, while Ballester-Molina was appointed chief executive officer. As the Ballester-Molina was designed to serve alongside the M1927 that was currently in Argentine service, it bears a striking resemblance to the Colt M1911A1. The Ballester-Molina and the M1911 share an identical 7-round magazine, barrel, recoil spring, and barrel bushing.  It's a great shooter!"

Laser System Smaller and Smarter

NEW IN PACKAGE

Subcompact V3 laser by LaserLyte® is the company's most state-of-the-art, smallest and versatile rail mounted laser to date.  Now half the size of the previous model, the Subcompact V3 needs less than ¾-inch of Picatinny rail space to easily mount onto even the smallest firearms.

Constructed of T6 aluminum for extra strength and durability, this updated unit offers a smart, cost-effective auto-off feature. If left on for five minutes, the unit begins to display a unique flash for one minute, indicating to the user that the unit will automatically shut off soon. After one minute in flash mode the unit shuts itself off to extend battery life, prevent accidental activation and battery depletion. Press the unit's button at any time to reset this feature for five more minutes.

The Subcompact V3 easily mounts with a hex drive crossbar screw and features windage adjustment, elevation adjustment and programmable constant on and pulse modes. Additionally, the unit is ideal for left- and -right handed shooters with two separate activation buttons located on the backside of the laser. Not only will the laser fit nicely on the smallest of sub-compact railed pistols, it works great on modern rifles as well.

The Subcompact V3 laser is powered by four 377 batteries that provide five hours in constant on mode and ten hours in pulse mode of normal usage. Normal usage is defined as one minute on and one minute off. This test mimics actual usage where the unit is turned on and off and the battery is given time to automatically regenerate.

The barrel is super easy toninstal. My first one I put on took m about 12-15 mins' but on my last MAC it took 4 mins to change the barrel. Its just a super well built easy to work with and has all the treads you'd ever need to have. I have them on all my MACs and M-11's. I just order one too many this last order, my fault will end up your win!

This barrel is very cool because it allows you to have multiple threads on just 1 high quality made barrel. I have them on all my SMG MAC and the first one i installed is still on and probably close to 24-28k rounds through it and still as accurate and has not faded any since the day it was installed. That's why I have them on all 6 of my SMG's .

For the barrel being sold, I opened the package to make sure it was perfect in aesthetics and to check the thread quality. At this time i felt the threads and they are very smooth with no rough marks. I tested the 1/2x28 threads with my AAC Ti-Rant 9 and it fit perfectly and snug on the 1/2x28 threads. I then checked my Bowers Group CAC Suppressor on the barrels other threads, the 3/4x10 threads and they fit tight and smooth as well. It truly is one of the best threaded barrels I own. I can honestly its just as good if not better that some of my several hundred dollar Jarvis Barrels I use on my high end pistols. If I'd had known about these sooner, I have no doubt I'd have them on more pistols.

It truly is a GREAT GREAT DEAL !

The 1/2x28 threads are standard on .22 as well as on a standard 9mm barrel so you can thread on suppressors and muzzle brakes. The other thread ¾ X 10 is the standard thread for the M10/9 and M11/9 which will also fit any sub gun silencer like Gemtechs Viper or Bowers CAC, just to name a few. This Barrel Fits any MAC, M/10, M-11 SMG, Semi Auto and MPA mid sized 9mm."

88,http://www.armslist.com/posts/670088,For Sale:  M-11 9mm Semi/Full Auto Double Threaded Barrel,"Middle TN, Tennessee, United States",$ 75,"Listed On: Monday, November 19, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If you want the versatility of a standard 3/4x10 9mm thread and also want a 1/2x28 thread, then this is the barrel for you!!!!

The barrel is super easy toninstal. My first one I put on took m about 12-15 mins' but on my last MAC it took 4 mins to change the barrel. Its just a super well built easy to work with and has all the treads you'd ever need to have. I have them on all my MACs and M-11's. I just order one too many this last order, my fault will end up your win!

This barrel is very cool because it allows you to have multiple threads on just 1 high quality made barrel. I have them on all my SMG MAC and the first one i installed is still on and probably close to 24-28k rounds through it and still as accurate and has not faded any since the day it was installed. That's why I have them on all 6 of my SMG's .

For the barrel being sold, I opened the package to make sure it was perfect in aesthetics and to check the thread quality. At this time i felt the threads and they are very smooth with no rough marks. I tested the 1/2x28 threads with my AAC Ti-Rant 9 and it fit perfectly and snug on the 1/2x28 threads. I then checked my Bowers Group CAC Suppressor on the barrels other threads, the 3/4x10 threads and they fit tight and smooth as well. It truly is one of the best threaded barrels I own. I can honestly its just as good if not better that some of my several hundred dollar Jarvis Barrels I use on my high end pistols. If I'd had known about these sooner, I have no doubt I'd have them on more pistols.

It truly is a GREAT GREAT DEAL !

The 1/2x28 threads are standard on .22 as well as on a standard 9mm barrel so you can thread on suppressors and muzzle brakes. The other thread ¾ X 10 is the standard thread for the M10/9 and M11/9 which will also fit any sub gun silencer like Gemtechs Viper or Bowers CAC, just to name a few. This Barrel Fits any MAC, M/10, M-11 SMG, Semi Auto and MPA mid sized 9mm."

106,http://www.armslist.com/posts/670106,For Sale:  Hi-Lux CMR 1-4x24mm Green Reticle,"Parker, Denver, Colorado",$ 437,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 25, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi-Lux doesn’t believe a true military grade tactical scope should be prohibitively expensive. So using the real world experience of Special Operations combat veterans, competition shooters and sportsman we developed our 1-4x24mm CMR (Close Medium Range). This highly flexible design offers great speed up close yet precision at longer distances. With a magnification range starting at 1x it allows a rifleman to keep both eyes open, like a red dot sight, during tactical situations or when hunting dangerous game. Increasing the magnification to 4x allows distant targets to be identified, ranged and engaged. 

This combination of capabilities makes for a far more flexible and useful optic than competing red dot sights, fixed power scopes or larger and heavier designs. Built on a compact yet robust 30mm tube, the CMR doesn’t add unnecessary bulk or weight to your rifle. Due to this the CMR is the perfect match for tactical and hunting rifles. In keeping with our name, the optical performance of the CMR is excellent. High quality fully multi-coated lenses are utilized to provide a clear and sharp image. Use in low light conditions hasn’t been overlooked and light transmission is the best in its class. 

An extremely practical circular reticle aids in quick target acquisition by drawing the attention of the shooter’s eye to the center of the scope. This allows extremely rapid engagement of close-range targets. To insure targets are easily visible when scanning, the Bullet Drop Compensating illuminated reticle is uncluttered and easy to use. The upper half of the Field of View remains clean and uncluttered for unimpeded observation. To allow rapid engagement of distant targets without touching the elevation turret, short bar aiming points calibrated for standard 5.56mm and 7.62mm service ammo are provided. 

The reticle also provides quick ‘no-math’ rangefinding of distant targets. Plus red or green reticle illumination is available. If a rifleman has time, ballistic adjustments can be dialed in using the CMR’s low-profile uncapped finger adjustable turrets. The single-rotation turrets provide audible and tactical adjustments and features Leatherwood’s new “Zero Locking System”, which does exactly what it says. Once the shooter has the scope sighted in, this system allows that alignment to be locked in place. A rheostat allows easy adjustment of the illuminated reticle’s intensity and provides Night Vision settings for use with Night Vision Devices. Our 1-4x CMR scope was built to survive in the toughest of conditions, a military environment. 

It has successfully passed abusive European military testing not only mounted on a rifle, but on a General Purpose Machine Gun as well. Other features include tough, wear resistant Perma-Coat soft luster blue-black finish, lenses polished to photographic quality, “Tri-Center” spring tension for positive windage and elevation adjustment, and a Fast Focus large diameter ocular lens. Hi-Lux’s CMR scope offers exceptional performance at a shockingly affordable price. About Hi-Lux Optics: Hi-Lux Optics’ roots reach back to the ART series of sniper scopes adopted by none other then the United States Army and successfully fielded during the Vietnam War. The top scoring sniper of this conflict utilized an ART scope designed by one of our founders, Jim Leatherwood. 

Over the years Hi-Lux Optics has developed innovative optical sights for the sportsman, competitive shooter and armed professional. Today Hi-Lux Optics has assembled a team of highly skilled engineers from the US, Europe and Asia to develop and manufacture a new generation of high quality military grade optics at affordable prices. Our goal is a simple one, to be recognized as China’s first premium optics manufacturer building high quality optics you can be proud of and rely on.

For most large ring Mauser style rifles and carbines based on the German 98K design with a flip-up rear sight hinged in the front and including the Turkish M24/47, Czech VZ 24, German Model GEW 98, KAR 98, Yugo M48, Persian (Iran) copies of the Czech M24, Argentine 1909, Spanish 1943, and others based on the original 1898 Mauser design.

The Mauser 8x57 cartridge is in the same class as the American 30-06 and is popular for hunting big game in the United States. Take advantage of the inherent accuracy of your Mauser carbine or rifle by adding this 2-7x32MM scout scope and increase your rifle’s effective hunting range by 250 yards or more.  Most big game is taken at ranges under 100 yards, but for those long shots across a pasture or from a hill top, this variable power scope provides a wide range of magnification to see your target out to 350 yards or more.

Some vendors are selling mounts that use two short bolts threaded into the sides of the mount through the “ears” of the rear sight base.  With extended shooting these bolts strip out the threads in the aluminum scope mount and the mount becomes loose.  Our mount has been threaded completely through and is fitted with a full length threaded cross bolt and retaining nut that securely attaches the scope mount to the rear sight base. This mount will not shoot loose.

It was Duracoated at Nash Glockworks, they have pics of my gun on the site. The mods are, Duracoat black finish with skull pattern on the slide, Lone Wolf stainless barrel with compensator, stanless pin kit, stainless recoil assembly,  and extended slide stop, and slide release. The gun is perfect without a mark on the polymer bottom, and the slide was just coated less than a month ago. I have it listed in a couple of places, and have had many people ask me to hold it.  The first person that meets with me to buy it, gets it. I can not hold it.

I have a very nice P250 subcompact.  This has been my wife's CCW weapon but it is a little to big for her to carry comfortably.  It is similar size as a glock 26.  But this is a good shooting little gun, she has put about 100 rounds through it without an issue.  It came with 1 flush 12rd mag, and we bought two full size (I believe they are 16rd) mags with the grip extension pieces.  With the extensions these were $45 each!  Also have a Desantis IWB soft holster.

We have about $550 into this package.  We will let it go for $450.  We would also be interested in trading for a Sig 938 or S&W shield.  We would be able to add cash or ammo, or other guns to even out a trade if yours is worth more.  Would also be interested in an AK.  Maybe other guns"

Smith & Wesson Model 29-3 in 44 Magnum with the 8 3/8"" Barrel.  This is the blue version, finish is decent, has some holster wear.  I have more pictures that show any flaws I can find, send me an email if you are interested and I can send them to you.  This is the model that Clint Eastwood used in the Dirty Harry movie series!

This revolver was made in the mid 80's, and features the wide trigger and wide hammer spur.  It also has an adjustable target rear sight that is removable (for adding a scope mount - it is factory drilled and tapped).  Great gun for show off, hunting, shooting (recoil is manageable with the long barrel).

Please email me with any questions.

It is a self-loading double-action pistol offered in .45 ACP initially, and later in .40 S&W and .357 SIG. The Mauser M2 is dimensionally similar to the SIG P229 pistol, also manufactured by Sig Sauer. Unlike most SIGs, it utilizes a rotating barrel like a Beretta. It's also striker-fired, like a Glock pistol.
 Mauser is a German arms manufacturer 
The M2 by Mauser could arguably be called ""the safest handgun on the market today"". Several safety features are integrated into the M2's design. The pistol features a loaded chamber indicator on top of the slide, which provides a visual indication that a round is present in the firing chamber. The pistol's magazine disconnect is designed to prevent the. pistol from being fired with the magazine removed from the pistol, even if a live round remains in the chamber. The pistol is equipped with an automatic firing pin safety that will not release the firing pin unless the trigger has been pulled. A disconnector prevents out of battery firing. The double-action only fire control system (in conjunction with the striker firing system) holds the striker at half cock which will not fire the cartridge should it be accidentally released. The manual external safety, located on the back of the slide, allows the owner to quickly observe if the handgun in is the safe mode while in the holster and can be quickly operated with the shooting hand.

Looking for a Taurus 845 (blue slide) for $350, or a RIA 1911 .45 (full size, not compact) for $400. If used I expect, the weapon to be in very good shape. Don’t need any fancy accessories or twenty extra clips.  Just the standard weapon and stock accessories/clips.

I will pay cash and expect a bill of sale (it doesn't have to be anything fancy, just something that says it's mine).  I have a pistol purchase permit.  I will meet you in a public place or gun shop around the triangle for the transaction.

I have no more time for this project. Gun is super sexy but does have scratch on front of barrel (cosmetic only) from removal of front sight and bayonet lug. I was planning on shortening this part of the barrel and having it threaded and adding a permanent muzzle break to keep it CA compliant length. 

Gun shoots good, but does need some trigger adjustment. The bullpup trigger linkage is adjustable so it can be easily adjusted. I was also thinking of having the oem trigger worked on to be a little more sensitive. BUT, like I said I ran out of time, money, and interest in this project. I also have the original SKS stock which is in fantastic condition. I have over $500 into the stock alone and would consider selling just the stock if I dont get any takers on the package. I have a major project I am working on so I need to clear some room in the gun safe, with that said I will entertain all offers but would rather smash the gun on the ground into a million pieces before I give it away so please no LOW BALLER'S.

Has only been used with Triple Se7en pellets at 80, 90, and 100gr loads behind 275 and 295gr powerbelts and powerbelt clones.  [By the way, you might be able to use this to hunt hogs during small game season, too, when centerfire rifles are prohibited but not ML.]  This barrel is long to get a complete burn on 150 grains, so it also absorbs recoil well and shoot very precisely.  I've hunted three seasons with this.  Great rifle but with age I need something lighter for next year.


Haven't hunted the 24 inch 45/70, just fired 405gr cowboy loads at the range.  Fires a supersonic bullet weighing more than twice what a 30-06 would.  That's knockdown power.  With the ML recoil pad, these are almost as comfortable to shoot as a 150gr 30-30.  


.223 also just range practice and only a handful of rounds.  Not really my caliber.  This barrel and the 50 came with the original rifle.  This barrel is .223, not .5.56, and has 1 in 10 twist, so it's really for varminting with 35gr to 55gr bullets.  Hornady ammo with NTX and V-Max should shoot better from this barrel than from a standard 1 in 9 AR. Price is negotiable if you are a veteran or member of NRA but be reasonable.
More pics available.  The extra scope rail is included.  The scope in the photo is a beat up old BSA 3-12x50 from an older rifle I no longer have but the scope still holds zero on the 45/70.  You can have that at no extra charge."

The SIG SAUER® P232® is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 19oz in the Blued version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today."

First off, the blade is made from pure ELMAX® powdered steel for the extreme edge retention, high strength, and toughness a hard-use knife demands. It rolls out of the handle on the KVT ball-bearing system so deployment is rapid and it's ready when you need it. 

The handle is 3-D machined black G-10 on the front, and equally 3-D machined titanium on the back. A framelock with a lockbar stabilizer ensures a rocksolid lockup every time. So that this good sized knife carries comfortably, Zero Tolerance has skeletonized the liner and machined pockets in the titanium handle and framelock allowing for greatly reduced weight. To top it all off, the 0560 is equipped with ZT's new deep-carry pocketclip.

For those of you who are not, let me explain. 

These little known knife manufacturers are credited with making some very high quality, well designed yet affordable folder knives especially suited for every day carry purposes. In fact if you have any contacts within the knife/cutlery trade you will find out that Ganzo, Sanrenmu and Enlan's other activities include manufacturing knives for numerous western brands such as Benchmande, Spyderco, Buck, and SOG. So believe me when I say you're getting a lot for your money with a Ganzo blade.

Like Sanrenmu's line, the Ganzo brand can go head to head with many other, more expensive folders...many costing up to five times as much. That's what make these great EDC knives such an amazing find! 

If you're a Benchmade fan the Ganzo G711 is an EDC knife to take a look at. Just released, this is a very high value budget alternative to the Benchmade Mini Onslaught...and for a FRACTION of the price. Equipped with a swooping G10 handle design, a 440C stainless steel blade, and an Axis Lock locking system the Ganzo G711 offers a lot of bang for the buck.

So if you're looking for a solidly built, high quality, and affordable every day carry knife, look no further....now you're ""in the know"".

Have a look at the Ganzo G711's specs:

- 440C Stainless Steel Blade

It is 85 - 90% bluing is nice and shiny the wood is nice only a few noticeable imperfections.   The worst one is pictured looks like another gun my have rubbed against it.The stock is a custom stock with longer grip . In this condition the same gun sells for 900 -1100 on Gunbroker . This gun is as tight and smooth as when it was new . Opens , closes & locks better than a brand new stoger coach gun I have. The barrels are smooth and look like mirrors inside. They don't make guns of this quality anymore. Your chance to own a classic double barrel. Will sacrifice for $500.00  I am narrowing my collection to only .223 , 7.62x 39, 30-30 ,45acp 9mm or 380 may trade for guns in these calibers."
