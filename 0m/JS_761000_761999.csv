This is a sealed box of 1,000 rounds, I will not break it up, or even open it.  Price is .70 cents a round.  Pick up is in Jacksonville, NC, near the newer WalMart only, absoloutely no shipping.   If you don't like my price, you have two choices, make me a good offer on it, or buy it from someone else if you can find it, but don't email to complain about it, it is that simple.

I've just completed selling my magazines on gunbroker.com, and this is all the ammo I have left that I want to sell, but I don't need to.  My price is reflective of what bidders are pricing the value of this ammo at auction on GB, so that is why I have no problem in asking this much, supply and demand is the rule of the day, and I'm going with the flow.

FYI, I sold my magazines on GB, 110 of them, both new and used, USGI and PMAGs, and my starting price for new mags was the same as an internet retailer would sell them for.  The average price of the magazines I sold was driven up to 28.09, by the bidders, so before you begin complaining about the price you are paying for ammo, magazines, rifles, etc., take a look around at all the folks buying in a panic, depleteing the supply chain, driving the prices up through the roof.  Before you complain about the sellers and their asking prices, realize that they are simply eliminating the long wait for an auction to end, at a price that is ridiculous, by pricing their items at what they are worth right now, and would likely be bought by someone to resell for a higher price anyway.  Think about it, it isn't confusing.  My personal opinion is this, the panic on the rifles and magazines may be warranted, but I don't believe it is on the ammo, in fact, I'm almost positive.  That being said, I am more than willing to make a profit on the ammo I worked hard for, to purchase when I could afford it, so that I can make money to buy the things I need that I can not afford at the moment.

Have a great day, and a Happy New Year!

I am in the process of consolidating calibers, and 8mm has hit my chopping block. I offer up for trade or sale a VERY nice 1945 Turkish K.Kale true bent bolt mauser. For the collectors that don't know, the Turkish K.Kale short rifle is the most sought after of the Turkish mauser breeds, with only 15,000 ever made. This is a true short rifle with correct stock, correct bent bolt, and the BOLT and RECEIVER are NUMBERS MATCHING!!....collectors know this is much more rare for the Turk rifles than other C&R rifles. The bluing is original, and extremely nice, bolt is extremely nice! Shoots Great, has typical dark bore, Has great wood, and the top handguard has no splits! (usually do). The rifle comes with a non number matching yet correct turk mauser bayonet. Comes with sling (incorrect sling). comes with some ammo and brass strippers...let's say about 20 rounds or so.  Overall a must for the mauser collector...a VERY nice rifle, and priced cheap. I got a great deal on this rifle at $250, and I am not seeking a penny more.

Just wanting to vent on here because I am sick of the idiots on here that do not read, or think they will magically change our minds by offering their bullshit. I have met many good people and made many good deals on this site over the years up until the past 4 months or so.

It comes with one magazine and the factory storage case.  Bought new this past year, never fired only used as carry weapon.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters."

Specs and info:

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon.

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling.

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters.

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs.

The Bushmaster A2/A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are shipped complete with 30 round magazine, safety and operational manual, and carry sling.

The thompson 1927-A1  is so impractical for anything but hanging on wall . its no fun at range at 15#'s with full drum , slips off shoulder and needless to say the third hand and chambering a round in a new gun you may want to buy a groin protector.
I however am looking for a wall hanger , remember these are bidens last concearn he wants to end current access to military type weapons and ammo used in war today by making them unable to be sold to civilians. I am looking simply for a wall hanger thompson tommygun pistol version used condition , they go $700 - $800 brand new I am offering to start talking at $500 depending on condition and give you some extra cash to get a blk rifle before the presidents executive order makes it impossible to get one.

You'll save a ton of money considering .22 ammo is a 1/10 the price of .223 (if you can still find any).

By the first of the year, these guns will all be gone...

This gun is new, in the box.  NEVER BEEN FIRED.  It includes a collapsible stock, threaded barrel (for suppressor), quad rail, removable sights, lightweight polymer upper & lower.

Smith & Wesson is the best of class in the .22LR AR style guns.  Buy the best!"

These are considered to be some of the best milled AK rifles ever. Made in Bulgaria, these rifles were imported in sporting configuration. The SA-93 is a copy of the original Type III AK, with a 45 degree gas block. The SLR-95 has a 90 degree gas block, and some sport a muzzle break that is pinned in place. The SA-93 rifles are dressed in a wood stockset, while the SLR-95 wears polymer. These rifles have original chrome lined hammer forged barrels and Bugarian milled receivers, some of the best. Chambered in 7.62x39 and will accept all AK mags. A must have if you are into milled receivers or are looking for a base for an AK47 build.

That said buying to put away is smart. Those saying this and that will be back in stock in January and Feb and March have no idea. Maybe stock will be available and maybe not. But how do you get off with so much knowledge that you advise people not to buy and to wait. In case you can't read they will try to push legislation through this January. The proposal I read is MUCH WORSE then the last AWB. So you roll the dice if you buy now or wait. And you say not to buy from individuals here as well yet many dealers and distributors, large and small, have either raised prices on inventory they already have on hand, stopped selling guns, or pushed ammo to the back room to gouge later. I say buy what you need if you feel a AWB is near. I certainly wont buy mags at 40 or 50 bucks but I would certainly  buy a 1200 to 1400 dollar AR or multiple AR's as long as its not a plastic one."
