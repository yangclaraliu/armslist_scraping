2,http://www.armslist.com/posts/344002,For Sale/Trade:  Insight M6 Light/Laser with LED upgrade kit,"Sulphur, Texoma, Oklahoma",$ 200,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 27, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have up for sale and Insight M6 that has been upgraded from incandescent to LED this made the light much brighter and upped the battery life considerably. The light alone will run you almost $300 anywhere else and the LED kit is another $70 I've also got box and papers. So im selling this at a huge discount the only reason im selling is I had this on a Glock switched to a Sig 1911 and the trigger guard sticks out a little to far to let the light fully lock onto the Sig its worked great on Berettas, Sig P229, XD, M&P, and it fit great on my Kimber as well.

The only problem with this light is the black plastic cover came off the mode selector and I cant find it. This does not affect the functionality of the light at all it just makes it a little harder to twist the selector that controls whether the light only, laser only or both comes on when you turn the light on."

I bought the gun new in the grease pouch.  I has maybe 300 rounds through it.  Te gun is very accurate, fun to shoot, and cheap to shoot.  It's chambered in .762x39.  Single stack AK's aren't super popular nowadays, but they shoot the same as their heavily ammo laden counterparts.  These guns are becoming increasingly hard to find.  They are also easily modified to accept hi-cap mags if you so desire, I just never got around to it.

""The WASR-10 is a post-ban version of the AKM rifle in 7.62x39mm caliber. Factory-original rifles only support single-stack, low-capacity magazines (ten rounds), but are frequently modified by Century Arms to accept double-stack, regular-capacity magazines (thirty rounds or more). Pistol grip and thumbhole stocks are both commonly found."" - Wikipedia

There are also three extra brass dispensing valves that would be for powder flasks also. Also is an assortment of what appear to be early shot shell paper cartridge reloading tools and equipment; wad cutters, crimping tools, of which the newest looking is marked Pat. Sept. 1891, an assortment of powder measurers and what appear to be powder/shot compacting tools ? some what appear to be primer presses ? I do not reload and am sure this stuff is much older than I am ? ( I am a grandfather by the way) so this stuff is all quite dated, With my limited knowledge of loading/reloading I am am speculating on a lot of this. Also several brass containers of UMC #2 and #5 primers and more assortted tools and equipment. Some of this stuff was also inside an old wooden cigar box labeled Okoporto Conchas with a label attached that reads Meyers, Tice & Co. Dubuque, Iowa and the tax stamp on the cigar box is dated  Feb. 30, 1892 which may help date some of the contents. Also a hinged wooden box with a bunch of holes in it that were partially occupied by a bunch of what looks like hand cut round paper/cardboard wads, the box appears to be some sort of commercially made product ? There is alo some other old misc. stuff in this box.There was also several pages of the Minneapolis Star newspaper dated October 1950 used as a box liner on the bottom of the box which to me would probably indicate when all this stuff was packed away and put in the attic. Sorry I do not have any pictures or a method to take any to post and if you are still reading this ad then this ""stuff"" is still available. If seriously interested please include a phone contact number in your first reponse or Due to all the spam out there I will not be able to answer your inquirey.  ? Thanks."

Info on the rifle:      

SAKO TRG-S is based on a TRG sharpshooting system.  This is a bolt action hunting rifle with a detachable clip magazine. The receiver is made by cold hammering method. The action is designated: Long action M995 and it is made for calibers 30-378 Weatherby and 338 Lapua Magnum. The magazine is detachable, reliable centre fed box magazine.
The single-stage trigger pull is adjustable from 1 kg to 2 kg (2 to 4 lbs). All models are available with a single-set trigger as option. The design of the stock and pistol grip makes the rifle suitable for both left and right handed shooters. Due to the straight stock, the recoil comes evenly backwards, therefore giving easy recoil control even under difficult hunting situation. The stock is made of polyurethane, reinforced with a rigid injection moulded skeleton.
The buttplate is the same as on the TRG shooting system. The stock length and heelplate angle can be easily adjusted with straight or angled spacers. Integral rails for the scope mounts are on the top of the receiver.
The totally free-floating barrel is cold-hammer forged.  The Sako TRG-S is perfect rifle for hunters looking for synthetic large-action performance. The extremely accurate rifle is based on the world renowned TRG-design and technology. Massive bolt with three symmetrical locking lugs and short 60° lift. Detachable magazine that feeds straight into the chamber. Black, high-tech composite stock with integrated reinforced skeleton for increased rigidity and accuracy. Available calibers are 30-378 Wby Mag and 338 Lapua Mag.

I shot about two boxes through this when I first got it about 10 years ago. Then put it up and haven't shot it since. Just bought 4 boxes of ammo for it last weekend for $60. Then had the opportunity to buy the .40 S&W that I've been wanting. Just want to get the $60 back that I spent for the ammo, and half of what I paid for the gun. These guns aren't the highest quality, but still good for plinking around. If you keep it CLEAN, it'll never have a problem. If it gets gummed up inside, it can jam. Like new condition.

Description from the Chiappa website:

The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric caracteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

358,http://www.armslist.com/posts/344358,For Sale:  NIB Franchi SPAS 12 (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun) pre-ban model,"Wisconsin, Wisconsin, United States","$ 2,795","Listed On: Thursday, March 22, 2012",Shotguns,Franchi                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,no type,Shotgun,"Type: selective pump-action or gas-operated
Gauge: 12
Chamber: 2 3/4"" (70 mm)
Length: 1041 mm
Barrel length: 546 mm.
Weight 4.4 kg
Capacity: 8 rounds in under barrel tube magazine
Manufactured from 1988-1990 for US import 


The SPAS-12 was designed by the Italian company Luigi Franchi Spa as a special purpose, military and police close combat weapon (actually, SPAS stands for Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, or Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun, depending on the source). It featured a selective action for greater versatility, and can be used as a gas operated semi-automatic repeater or as a manually operated pump action repeater, depending on the mission and ammunition used. Since its introduction SPAS-12 became a very popular police and special-forces weapon, being versatile, reliable and with good firepower. On the other hand, it is heavier than most other similar shotguns and quite complicated, which results in relatively high prices.

SPAS-12 utilizes somewhat traditional for shotguns gas system with annular gas piston locating around the under barrel magazine tube. It operates the bolt with vertically tilting locking lug that engages the barrel extension to lock.SPAS-12 can be switched between gas operated self-loading mode and manually operated pump mode by pressing and holding a button at the bottom of the forearm and pulling the forearm slightly forward for AUTOMATIC mode or backward for PUMP(or MANUAL) mode. Earlier models of the SPAS-12 had the lever type safety at the front of the trigger guard, but due to some deficiencies this was latter replaced by the push-button (cross-bolt) safety at the same place. 

SPAS-12 could be fitted with stamped metallic butt-stock that folds to the top of the receiver when not in use, and with a pistol grip made of plastic. Alternatively, solid plastic butts-tocks with pistol grips are available. Barrel has cylinder bore with screw-on muzzle devices (cokes of flash hiders). Sights usually are of rifle type, with post front and open notch rear sight.

If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.

The Super Black Eagle  also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech™ system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech™ system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle I is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever.

Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Model B in 41AE caliber. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi.

The UZI pistol was developed by Israel Military Industries (now IWI Ltd) during early 1980s from the famous Micro-UZI submachine gun. Intended users for the UZI pistol were various security agencies and services which wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, and civilian shooters (mostly in USA) which also wanted such gun with ""cool Uzi style"". Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock. 
UZI pistol is blowback-operated semi-automatic weapon which fires from closed bolt. It has a stamped steel receiver and the bolt is fully enclosed inside. Bolt is of 'telescoped' design, that is, it is hollow in the front and encloses the rear part of the barrel when in battery. Uzi pistol has a single action trigger and utilizes an internal sliding striker (firing pin). Manual safety of sliding type, and is located above the grip on the left side of the gun. Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage.

Description 
Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Pistol Model in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. 
The UZI pistol was developed by Israel Military Industries (now IWI Ltd) during early 1980s from the famous Micro-UZI submachine gun. Intended users for the UZI pistol were various security agencies and services which wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, and civilian shooters (mostly in USA) which also wanted such gun with ""cool Uzi style"". Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock. 
UZI pistol is blowback-operated semi-automatic weapon which fires from closed bolt. It has a stamped steel receiver and the bolt is fully enclosed inside. Bolt is of 'telescoped' design, that is, it is hollow in the front and encloses the rear part of the barrel when in battery. Uzi pistol has a single action trigger and utilizes an internal sliding striker (firing pin). Manual safety of sliding type, and is located above the grip on the left side of the gun. Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage.

It's a slab side pre-ban carbine with a 16 inch barrel, 1 in 9 twist, and is in 90% condition or so.  Given the condition of the bolt and gas system, I'd estimate that this has seen less than 100 rounds through it.  The original stock, which is an aircraft grade high gloss aluminum, comes with it.  The previous owner swapped it out for a DPMS six position stock since the Colt original is only two positions.  The rifle itself is in great condition with little wear outside of a few minor cosmetic scratches here and there from handling.  

I'm looking for something a little more modern, so I'm selling this Vietnam era carbine.  I'd be willing to trade for a mid-range AR-15 like a DPMS, Delton, or Palmetto State Armory with cash on the side so I could purchase a decent optic.  I'm not after AKs, SKS, pump action shotguns, or anything of the ilk.  I'm only after AR-15s.  More importantly I'd prefer cash.  

You can check Gunbroker if you'd like, but I've seen this rifle selling for 1900 elsewhere in similar condition but I'm pricing it to sell.  Only serious offers considered, please contact via e-mail option in Armslist."

Model: LAM-100
Laser: Infrared (IR) Aiming Laser, Visible Aiming Laser
Light: Fixed Focus IR Illuminator and 100 Lumen Bulb
Power: Powered by Two 1.5V AA Batteries
Control: Toggle switch or remote
Mount: Mounts Glock style pistol rail, or Beretta 92 series

Originally designed in response to the U.S. Navy S.E.A.L.'s Assault Pistol program, the Laser Aiming Module, (L.A.M.) pioneered new ground and set the standard for multi-laser/white light capability in a compact pistol mounted package. Today, L-3 Insight Technology's LAM-1000 is known to the U.S. Military as the ILWLP. This Model will mount on all standard Glock Pistols.

Comes with plastic mounting device that attaches to Beretta 92 series pistol, so that you can add the ILWLP to your Beretta.

Check gun sales websites, amazon, or anywhere online for the insight ILWLP and they cost upward of 1,500-1,800.

Not only does it have a light and laser you can see, but it's got an IR light and laser that you can use along with a night vision device, but no one else would be able to see. Light up a room without anyone but you knowing!

Only selling it so cheap because I bought it for a deployment that fell through, and now I have no use for it. It has never been used. Cannot buy these as a regular civilian through the retailer. Only military/LE can buy them, but they are completely legal to own.

It is the White multifuel engine which means it will burn gas, diesel, oil, bio-diesel... etc.. basically everything combustible except for rocket and aviation fuel (says so on the dash). Engine is the LTD-465 MF. (amazing torque)

This is the most amazing specimen of this truck I've seen. It has fresh (as fresh as you can get in the civilian market) paint, which is bio-weapon resistant. It has a brand new tarp cover for the back and the engine and transmission were overhauled before it sold at DRMO. It is in immaculate condition.

I've personally driven this thing for a few thousand miles, and done the maintenance myself, which wasn't much.

The tires are BRAND NEW.

There are exactly two things wrong with this truck. I needs a new wind-shield wiper blade, and a new e-brake cable (any parts store has the cable, the wiper has to be ordered on line for $12)

Of course, when you put it into 10 wheel drive low, it's like a tank.

Gun has been customized by professional gunsmiths to provide the best in function and looks. It has been disassembled and rebuilt from top to bottom to make sure every part is in top condition and will continue to run reliably for many years to come. The serial number and caliber have been professionally engraved on the side giving it a real one of a kind look. The back plate was replaced using precise welding techniques to ensure that it could NEVER crack or break off, a problem that can be common in some blow-back operated shooting systems such as MACs or UZIs. It was also polished for a real smooth, clean look. For optimum rustproofing, the entire weapon was parkerized prior to being painted with Dura-Coat, which is in my opinion the best firearm finish on the market. The gun has been kept clean and oiled and has been treated very carefully at all times. The finish on the gun is virtually flawless with no scratches or chips. With the accessories and all of the work involved anyone who prices it out will see this gun is worth much more than what I'm asking. Call or text Mat at REDACTED if you are interested.

Official Product Description:

Night Vision: ITT Night Quest 260 Generation III Binocular 

ITT has been the world leader in night vision equipment development since their inception in 1959 and are now the sole supplier to the U.S. Military. Proven by U.S. and Allied Forces in Operation Desert Storm, ITT's Generation 3 night vision products are light years ahead of the surplus Russian equipment being pawned at army surplus stores. 404 precision engineered processes go into the assembly and manufacturing of each viewer. Several features set ITT's products apart from anything else on the market. These are: a state-of-the-art image intensifier tube with their unique MCP (microchannel plate) which contains over 6,000,000 microchannels. Each channel is 20 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Covering the microchannel plate is a thin protective film that's less than 100 atoms thick. The phosphor screen has a resolution 20 times higher than the typical television set, and all night vision products are sealed under clean-room conditions in such an ultra-high vacuum state that no other manufacturer can compare. The end result is clarity and resolution unmatched by others.
Night Quest 250/260

Compact, lightweight and weather resistant, the 250/260 binocular is a vital visual aid for peace of mind. These units were tested to rigid military specifications and were used in Desert Storm. Ideal for search and rescue, security and recreation, the Night Quest comes in both G2 and G3 Models. Superior clarity and resolution even in extremely low-light conditions allows the Model 250/260 to capture even the slightest speck of starlight to provide excellent night-time viewing. Ruggedly constructed, water resistant and lightweight (26 ounces), the Model 250/260 is easy to handle and has automatic gain control and electronic focus. The units feature F/1.4 optics and a 40° field of view. Runs on a 6V lithium camera battery.

It was thought that these were refurbished for internal Police and Government security use in the 1960's. This rifle shows no service use and came to me packaged for long term storage, cosmoline packed with no visable usage since refurbishment. I believe all the numbers match and it is an 1943 Izzy 91/30 converted to 91/59. It is near perfect condition and very difficult to find these 91/59 version carbines in this condition. It comes slinged and shoots very nice, I am very schooled in Mosin Nagants and will sell or trade this fine firearm for the right deal.

I am not trying to be rude but I know what it is worth and the condition it is in. Some people think all Mosin's are $99 dollar guns and they are not! Thank you"
