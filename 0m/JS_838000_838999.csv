Can send pictures to your email if so desires. These tubes are a little over 12' long with a diameter of about 1 1/2 inches. I can put a little over two boxes of 38 special or a whole 550 round box of 22 ammo into one of these. They are made of thick plastic and have an O ring seal. They are waterproof too. I put one with sand in it into a bucket of water. A few days later I opened the tube and emptied the sand. It was bone dry. I am selling these for $2.00 each or 3/$5.00. You can carry about thirty of these loaded in a back pack so it keeps your hands free from carrying a bulky ammo can. Put one in your pocket loaded with 22 ammo and you will be walking about with over 500 rounds at your disposal. Need to leave it in the woods. Simple. Dig a hole and bury it, or hide it in a creek where nobody will be looking for it. Also great to store anything you don't want to get wet: jewelry, matches and the like. I can send pictures upon request."

.40 S&W. Stainless steel slide and frame. Rosewood grips. Has Siglite night sights and Short Reset Trigger (SRT). Very low round count. Outside looks new. Only starting to get smilies on the barrel. Comes with (2) magazines, of which only one has been used. The other is still sealed in the plastic. Includes everything in original box as new.

I also have a Sig factory .357 Sig conversion barrel. If the person that buys the Sig does not want it, I will sell it separately. But not until the 229 sells. 

I looked and could not find one of these in stock anywhere. The out of stock prices were over $1300 plus shipping and transfer.

I will sell this for $1100 FTF and give the buyer the option of buying the .357 Sig barrel for $100 more.

If you have any questions just ask. I am located in East Tennessee. 

Please do not email me talking about how good a Sig 2022 is and that this should not cost any more. The truth is these do cost more…….a lot more……about 4 times as much. If you only have enough money to buy a Sig 2022, I suggest you buy one, they are great guns. If you want to make an offer, that’s fine, but please look these up wherever you find them and base your offer on that. I think you will find my asking price is more than reasonable.

When you consider what we have all seen guns selling for lately, I am selling this at a steal. Please don’t waste your time with ridiculous offers, because I will not waste my time replying.

I am not interested in any trades. If I did not need the money I would not be selling it. But don’t read into that statement that I am desperate. I am not. 

I should not have to include anything in the last few paragraphs in this add. But past experience has led me to do so. Not that those people could probably comprehend what it is saying anyway.

This gun has quite a bit of character rubbed into it but still has strong rifling and a very good replacement W.R.A. (Winchester Repeating Arms) trigger group.

The wood stock is a pretty beat up but it is original, nothing some sand paper and stain couldn't fix right up.  Finish is pretty worn on gas tube with some minor pitting, nothing deep. If only we could find out which battles left which scars.  She ain't the prettiest, but she is a good shooter.

Unlike all the other AR style 22LR's this is full metal construction. This has absolutely zero rock back and forth between the upper and lower. Overall this gun shoots great. I've put about 100rds through it, sighting in the holographic red dot and it never jammed once. 

This comes with (5) 30 Rounds Colt clips. Unlike most off brand clips these things lock in solid with almost zero rock back and forth. I think someone that shoots more would get more enjoyment out of this gun and with all the AR style popularity I'm sure someone would get more use out of it than I. This gun was bought about a month ago so it is essentially new in the box.

Overall just a super fun gun. So many people want to get a 22LR conversion for their AR...this gives you a dedicated .22AR. The great part about it is you could shoot all day for $30 or $40 where as with a .223 you could go through $50 in 10 minutes. Once you shoot it you'll love it!

- All steel receiver.
- High-contrast Brown/Black wood laminate stock
- 28"" full vent rib barrel with single bead sight
- Screw-in choke system with Modified choke installed
- Matte black finish on receiver and barrel

This 870 has obviously not been shot much. 
The action bars don't even have much wear on the finish.
The stock has a few minor dings from normal use, and there is very minor finish blemishing on the receiver. It appears to be merely finish discoloration and very well may clean up, I haven't tried.
The only thing ""wrong"" with the gun is that it's missing the sling swivel on the magazine cap. That's easy enough to fix for a couple bucks.
I picked this up in a partial trade and have no need for another shotgun, but it would make a great gun for any type of lowland or upland game with the simple addition of a different choke tube.
The price is somewhat negotiable, but please don't lowball me. The gun is worth the asking price and requires no paperwork or tax hassles.
I'm mostly interested in selling it to recover cash outlay, but feel free to offer something in trade, all I can do is say no. :)
FTF preferred, but I'm willing to ship if you pay the shipping and don't mind buying a gun you haven't shot or seen in person."

It clamps directly to the Ruger factory ring mounts so you can add halographic sights and magnifiers. This one has the regular front sight without the muzzel brake so future compliance should not be an issue you can add the cool stuff later. It is unfired so there is no guessing how many rounds have really been down the barrel it or what kind of ammo was forced through it. Buy it now and get grandfathered in before an executive order comes along. I accept postal money orders or wire tranfer and this must go through your local FFL in legal areas.
 I am from Eastern Iowa and have family and business associates in the Twin Cities who can verify who I am.

I have never oiled it so it should clean up really well and and it should be in perfect working condition.   I would be interested in trading it for high capacity Glock 9mm or .40 magazines.

This is a left handed 54 calibre flintlock I got about ten years ago. I probably have a couple hundren rounds through it altogether. Havn't done much with it in a few years. Has been a very well behaved flintlock and shot very well. The only time it gave me any trouble was when I tried some flints that were a little on the small side. Replaced the flint, No problem. It is still in great condition and ready to shoot.

I am selling my MSAR STG-556 in order to buy a motorcycle, I hate to part with it as it is a great rifle but alas I must make the sacrifice. 

I have heard mixed reviews on this specific rifle but I have never had a single problem with it what so ever. It only has about 100-200 rounds through it and is in perfect condition. Cleaned regularly and maintained to the highest standards.

Comes with 1-10 round magazine and 1-30 round magazine, also comes with a Bushnell T-Dot optic sight mounted on the top rail of the rifle. The rail is a perfect height to mount any optic you may own. The optic itself is valued at $250 but despite it's price I've had a great experience with it, you wont find a better optic for that price. If you have no need for the T-Dot and wish to mount your own optic I am willing to knock $25 off the price as I am not really adding the value of it to the price of the rifle. This rifle also features a forward assist and an M-16 style bolt hold open device. It takes both MSAR mags and the original AUG mags. In my opinion these are far superior to STANAG. 

Keep in mind MSAR no longer makes this rifle so you won't find very many floating around pretty soon. It will only go up in value as the new Assault Weapons Ban approaches.

Contact me if interested, and please take good care of it as I have, this truly is one of the best firearms I've ever owned and it kills me to part with it.

I have had this rifle quoted at $2,200 with no accessories and seen it priced for up to $2,600  but I need the money fast so I'm knocking $200 off the value I was quoted. Due to that the price is firm, I am not willing to negotiate. I will however consider trades for a decent Sport-Bike (motorcycle). 

I apologize but I do not have any pictures of the rifle itself, I lost them all when I reformatted my computer. I can assure you it is in perfect condition and I will post pictures of the exact model, keep in mind some of the pictures may have optics mounted on the rail that are not the same as the one on mine.
This rifle comes in it's original box with the original guides etc.

Remember, we have a probable Assault Weapons Ban coming up and this rifle is discontinued so it is going to be pretty hard to find very soon and the value will only go up. Feel free to email me with any questions."

- I have fired about 100 rounds through this gun and it has shot flawlessly, never once jammed, however, the gun was bought at a gun show and I am not the original owner and cannot speak for what the gun as been through before I obtained it, but I have never encountered any problems.
- I apologize in advance but the gun does not come with the case, holster or any other supplies, just the gun, magazines and ammo, I was never given a case or brush.
- Reason for selling is because I have recently bought a Glock 30 and like it better (just personal preference).
- This gun was shot today 1/12/13. It preformed great and was accurate as usual. Afterwards the gun was field stripped and cleaned thoroughly. I have always cleaned the gun after each use.
- I work and go to school full time so I am very busy, please understand that if a deal is reached I will not be available to travel all the time, but that can be worked out when the time comes. Please be respectful and I will try my best to respond to emails, phone calls and or text messages in a timely manner.
- All unreasonable offers will be ignored and or deleted, I reserve the right to refuse any offer and am under no circumstances obligated to sell my firearm.
- I am not particularly in a hurry to sell my glock 19 just trying to see what kind of offers are out there. 
- Right now glock 19s are not that easy to find and 9mm ammo is about impossible to find, I understand that everyone wants a deal, but please do not try and rip me off, and I will do the same. I know a lot about guns and what they are worth.  I am not really interested in any trades at this time.

Thanks for looking feel free to contact me if you have any questions, I apologize for the lengthy description, but I tired to answer most possible questions to leave the messaging for offers etc.

The second is a fully camo'd (professional decals) bad boy buggy style hunting outfit.  It's all electric and has a large lift kit with very aggressive tires.  It's a two seater with a nice bed on back and lights up front.  It's extremely quiet and very easy to sneak into the woods.  

I would trade either, or both, for various pistols, rifles or ammo.  In particular, BMG, ar15 outfits, ak47, sigs etc.  Each buggy is valued at $3,000."
