The gun pissed me off at the end of the barrel the are pliers marks on it now it was in excellent shape before it pissed me.  I think the tip of the barrel can be sanded down and re-blued..This gun was left to me so what pictures you see are it i do believe everything is there but  the hand grips..

Otherwise the bluing on this gun is remarkable, no pits no scratches. like i said the only place is the end of the barrel because i put it back together wrong and got it stuck."

591,http://www.armslist.com/posts/157591,For Sale:  AR57 SBR/Pistol Upper,"NW, Gainesville, Florida",$ 675,"Listed On: Monday, July 4, 2011",Rifles,no type,5.7x28mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I'm selling my AR57 12"" complete upper.  For more information on the AR57 setup, check out their website at www.57center.com.  Economic realities are forcing me to consolidate calibers, so this upper has to go.  I have fired exactly 50 rounds (one box) through this upper...it is absolutely in brand-new condition.  The upper will come in the original box with the original AR57 buffer...everything is included per new.  In addition, I'm including 2 brand-new in-box genuine FN P90 magazines.  These are not the cheap Korean copies, these are the real-deal FN magazines (I paid $70 each, price tag is still on the boxes).  I've also got 2 boxes (100 rounds) of FN blue-tip ammo that are included.  Lastly, I'm including a Magpul PMAG in foliage green that has been hollowed-out and sanded down to use as a spent cartridge collector.  The AR57 ejects cartridges down through the magwell of your lower, so this customized PMAG will hold a full 50 spent cartridges.

This upper new is $700 alone, and I'm including about $200 in extras and ammo.  I'll let the whole setup described above go for $675.  This is a great chance to get an entire AR57 upper setup for less than the upper alone sells for.

Note that one of the images below shows this upper on my SBR.  This is just to show you what the unit looks like on an AR15 lower....I am not selling a complete rifle, only the upper as shown in the other photos and the accessories described above.  Nothing else from the rifle photo is included in this sale.  

Also please note that all NFA rules apply.  Please be sure that you are not breaking any NFA rules by purchasing this upper.  Without an SBR tax stamp, you are allowed to use this upper on an AR15 pistol lower ONLY.  Use of the upper in rifle configuration requires a tax stamp.  Check out www.atf.gov for more information.

Please email me with questions."

Price is $180. 

Would consider a trade for a very good condition:

Beretta 21-a (.22)
or 
Taurus PT22

I bought two sets of black LG-401 (front activated) Crimson Trace lasergrips for a 1911 Government &/or Commander last year (2010). I'm now down to one 1911 so I don't need both sets. Besides being a great way to improve your shooting technique, I've often felt that in a CQB scenario it would provide an advantage. I know it would make me think twice if I saw a laser dot on my chest - or any other body part. 

Includes everything that came with it (as seen in the pic). Box, bag, batteries, hex wrenches, manual, etc. 

LG-401 1911 Government & Commander picture by duboismd - Photobucket

I've seen them on-line from $249 to $300+. 

Prefer a meet on the NE side of Indianapolis. 

Thanks for looking."

Has been rechambered to fire .308 or 7.62x51 NATO rounds, very common to see on these, OT- serial number, from what I read that means 50,000 made of these total. Looks like it has been fired some, but bore looks pretty good and everything seems to cycle alright with .308 ammo. Numbers match except magwell floorplate, didn't see any numbers on the stock anywhere. One crack in upper handguard, but it still does the job, could be glued easily. Nice looking rifle in pretty good shape for the age, shows normal wear/tear, but nothing I noted bad aside from the upper handguard crack. I couldn't find hardly any Spanish Mausers with the double crossbolt setup through the stock like this one has, may be of more interest to someone because of this. No crest or other markings besides the OT- serial numbers.  Will consider trades, I'd say a trade value of around $175 on this."

The reason this is about $400 less than it should be....I have no idea what caliber this thing is.  I took it in on trade and neither did the guy I got it from.

However there is no damage to the gun, and I am confident that the finish is still good enough to prevent the gun from rusting.  It shoots great from what I've seen, I just don't have a use for it (though I hate to see it go).

Retail is $584 so this is a great deal. Just replaced the bulb and batteries. Open to trades but really would like the cash so I can get a scope for my AR10. Make me an offer, the worst I can say is a polite ""no"". Product description is as follows.


The M910A attaches by means of a dual thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail on the underside of the forend. It produces a brilliant beam configured for close- to medium-range applications, and also features two low-output navigation lights available in white, red, or blue. The primary beam output is 125 lumens for one-hour of runtime using an MN10 lamp assembly (included) or 225 lumens for 20 minutes using an MN11 lamp assembly (included). The M910A has four primary beam switches: two momentary-on pressure pads to activate the main light (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), a constant-on rotary switch for the main light, and a system-disable switch that locks all lights in the OFF position to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage. The navigation lights are operated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. The optional KT4 conversion kit replaces the standard 1.62"" diameter head with a 2.5"" diameter head that produces a more focused, extended-range beam. 

FITS: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the underside of the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends to equip your weapon with multiple integral forend rails.) 
Features 
High-output incandescent lamp with mid-size reflector for close- to medium-range applications; 2.5"" extended-range reflector available 
Secondary LED navigation lights available in white (WH), red (RD), and blue (BL) 
Switches—Primary beam: two momentary-on grip pressure pads, constant-on rotary switch, system-disable rotary switch. Navigation lights: momentary-on pressure pad

The Vaquero in the traditional .45 Colt chambering can be loaded hot for hunting or very mild for competition and plinking.  

$495 and must be shipped to an FFL or B.O.S. if sold FTF.  No trades please.

You don't see these for sale very often so this one won't last long.  Thank you for looking."

The micro-compact Carry 9 gives you 9 rounds of 9mm firepower in your hand. At 24 ounces, it is one of the lightest and smallest 1911-style carry pistols you can own. The non-reflective black finish helps maintain the low profile you want, and PARA's exclusive Power Extractor(TM) ensures faultless reliability. The light-gathering fiber optic front sight puts you on target in low light conditions.

Description:
The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided.

The Ruger Semi-Auto Rancher rifle in caliber .223 or 7.62x39 is very popular with police and sheriff departments in the United States. Coyotes kill many young calves during the Spring calving season and this rifle is  a favorite with cattle ranchers  to keep the coyote population under control. 

As popular as this rifle is, it can be difficult to scope. The fixed integral scope bases limit the type of scopes that can be mounted.  A long scope with a smaller objective lens works best unless high Ruger rings are used.  The top hand guard interferes with large objective lenses and shorter scopes cannot be moved back far enough to obtain the proper eye relief.

A long tactical or varmint scope can be “bulky” on this compact rifle, so we tried mounting a mini-scope.  Our solution was to use an extended Picatinny rail adaptor that attaches to the fixed receiver bases and mount the scope using heavy duty Weaver style tactical rings. 
The mil-dot reticle is helpful in estimating the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to handle your Rancher in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

I have a Sig 556 ER model for sale here.

I have a Griffin charging handle for the bolt (this allows you to comfortably chamber the rounds while running optics), and the single push-pin take down pin. Both the original pin and the charging handle will be included with the rifle. 

It comes with the blue Sig case, and I will include the pictured windowed PMAG with the rifle. The Sig mags were junk, and this thing loves PMAGS.
