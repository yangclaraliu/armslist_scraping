Given that it's ""like new"" and ""one of a kind"" I'll set the base price at $1000.  Now lets get into the fact that all the numbers match.  I don't even know what this means, but that's gotta raise the value by at least $250.  Very low round count.  I took it out shooting once and only put 20 rounds through it therefore the round count is low.  Round count started over once it was in my hands therefore it's only had 20 rounds through it since the day it was built.  That should make it worth an extra $100 easily.  It is the ""Tactical"" model since I put a $60 folding stock on it raising the value yet again by another $150.  Now I know what you're thinking...  How can a $60 folding stock increase the value by $150.  The answer is easy.  I installed it and the original stock is included!   Also included in this lot is a sling, oiler, and 40 rounds of Wolf ammo that were left over from my glorious range day, raising the value by another $50.  Ad all this up and you come up with the price of $1550.  The extra $450 is due to the fact that I have the internet and through the use of google and gunbroker found another SKS priced for a similar amount and added $500.  The extra $500 is because it's ""my baby"" and has sentimental value.  Extremely accurate!  I would know because out of the 20 rounds I put through it, 6 of them were on paper at 25 yds.  Don't miss an opportunity to take advantage of such a sweet deal!  No pic because I'm an idiot and would rather text you one because everyone is comfortable giving their phone number out to total strangers on the internet."

The second pistol is a VZ-52, not a CZ-52. CZ-52 was the wrong designation given by CAI when it was imported. This VZ-52 is not surplus, it had never been fired and was imported by Czech-point. Unfired, they are 310 shipped from that site. I may also willing to sell it aswell."

Can you shoot 4 MOA rapid fire without a bipod or rest?  Can you do it with a rack-grade rifle and surplus ammo?  Can you do it with iron sights?  Join us for an Appleseed Rifle Marksmanship clinic on August 11-12, 2012 in Cannonsburg, KY and find out.

See if you can answer these questions - which every American who loves his country should be able to answer:
1. When and where was the American Revolution won, according to John Adams?
2. When and where did the Revolutionary War break out?
3. What caused the British Regulars, the most well-trained, well-disciplined army in the world, to break and run at Concord's North Bridge, after only two minutes of musket fire by shopkeepers and farmers?
4.  What caused this reversal of British military opinion:

BEFORE April 19, 1775:
""Americans are raw, undisciplined and cowardly"". John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and 1st Lord of the Admiralty 

""With a thousand British grenadiers I would undertake to go from one end of America to the other and geld all the males, partly by force and partly with a little coaxing"". Major General Alured Clarke 

AFTER April 19, 1775:
""Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about..."" Lieutenant-General Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland

Experience the rugged reliability Ruger is renowned for in a new rifle that redefines the AR platform. Its chrome-plated, two-stage, piston-driven operating system offers improved dependability over gas-driven rifles. A four-position, chrome-plated gas regulator allows the shooter to tune the rifle to specific ammunition or conditions. The bolt, bolt carrier and extractor are also chrome-plated to enhance performance and durability. A cold hammer-forged, chrome- lined, mil-spec 41V45 barrel delivers consistent accuracy. Troy Industries folding battle sights are adjustable and co- witness with mil-spec optics so they can easily be removed to make room for high-powered scopes. The Troy Industries quad-rail handguard provides a rigid mount for the piston-driven transfer rod. Rail covers for unused rails make for a more comfortable hold. A six-position, telescoping M4-style buttstock can be used to adjust length of pull. Includes three 30-round MAGPUL PMAG magazines and a soft-sided carry case.

You can go to www.goochlandpits.com or hoobly bullys to see how much they actually go for. If you are interested please text me at REDACTED I am open to anything just want to get them sold fast before school starts in a few weeks. I dont want junk please but I am not asking for a top notch gun either. Please offer something resonable as my dogs are of some of the best bloodlines in the nation.

Here is the description from Sig:

THIS P250 is a compact .40s&w! The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

It is cosmetically flawless.  The gun was my grandmothers and was unfired since she bought it in the 1980's. I've shot a couple hundred rounds through it and bought it fishing a few times.

I bought this new in 1993 - maybe 1000 rounds through it.  I recently added an adjustable rear competition sight.  It comes with one Mec-Gar magazine.  The finish is in great shape (85%) with some bluing around the grip worn.  The gun shoots true and I recently have been shooting it in a bowling pin league.

The only issue it has - it is picky about which mags it uses.  Stick to Mec-Gar and or Wilson Combat and you are fine.

Will trade for a nice .22 semi auto"

A new front sight from brownells will only set you back $5 -$10 depending on how fancy you want to get IF you even want to replace it.

I installed a ATI folding six-position tactical stock and added a Vortex Strikefire red/green dot optic. This rifle is ready to go for steel challenge matches or just having fun, especially with the kids! Included in this package deal is the following:

Ruger 10/22 Tactical rifle
ATI folding six-position tactical stock
Original Ruger synthetic stock (forgot to take pictures of this)
Original Ruger 10 round magazine
FIVE Ruger BX-25 twenty-five round magazines (forgot to take pictures of these)
Original box/papers

I am the original owner of this rifle and only bought it in the last couple of months. I have fired around 500 rounds through this gun and it is a blast (no pun intended) to shoot. Everything is in excellent condition. I hate to sell it but I have other priorities right now so I gotta let this one go :-( Price on this entire package is only $520 FTF in Edmond/OKC area.

If you don't want the Vortex Strikefire I will sell the rifle with both stocks, the ten round mag, and the five twenty-five round mags for $400 asking price.  If the rifle sells without the optic I will list the optic separately afterwards.

I could sell the rifle without the optic or twenty-five round mags for $325."

Got it new last year. Love it to death- so definitely NOT in a hurry to get rid of it- unless the right TRADE comes along. Fun shooter, great home/vehicle defense piece. 

I'm pretty much just testing the waters to see what offers I get. I know what it's worth- NOT LOOKING TO SELL (unless somebody is silly enough to over-pay by a LOT)- but I'll consider offers for trades. 

I'll trade straight gun-for-gun for a regular Romanian AK (full-sized rifle with the built-on-side scope-mount) if someone is interested- that way we each can keep whatever magazines, ammo, and goodies we each have and only trade weapons. I like long-range target shooting and while fun, the DRACO doesn't reach out (accurately) to 600 meters.

If anyone happens to have a Mosin Nagant M-91/30 PU Sniper, I'll give you the DRACO, all the mags & ammo, and of course the appropriate amount of cash to make it worth while...but only if its the true Sniper version with the 91/30 with the correct scope- from the factory. 

Other than that- I'm open to suggestions...go ahead and ask- the worst I can do is say no, right? Obviously if your trade is worth a substantial amount more than mine, the difference from my end would need to be compensated- I expect the same. Don't try to trade me a 50 dollar .25 auto pistol. :)

Face-to-Face deal ONLY. I will not ship to anywhere, I will not drive across Texas. If you're not in the Austin/North San Antonio area, then you're doing some traveling. This IS technically a PISTOL so you must be a LEGAL citizen of 21 years of age- I WILL ask for an ID for proof."

I really dont need to sell this gun right now so price is firm. I traded a rifle for a couple guns and this was one of them. Im really more interested in trade offers but will listen to cash of course. It has a quad rail with rail covers on it, two 20 rounds mags, a BSA tactical rifle scope made for accuracy and distance shooting, also as shown in these pics it has a tube extension to avoid sun reflection. It has 364 rounds of .308/7.62x51 ammo, has the original fore end if you dont want the quad rail. Mono grip and bipod to help reduce weight and steady shot for accuracy and a ammo can for extra ammo. 

*****Im firm on the price, The ammo is worth $250 at least and the optic is worth $250-300, so basically your getting this gun and bipod, quad rail, mono grip, ammo can ect. for $500.. I have done research and this gun i have found from $850-1000, so this is a fair price for a person who is more interested n trades than money right now.

will do straight trades for nice ak47's gun for gun without extrasor plus cash, unless they are arsenal  or c39 sporter ak47's or high dollar ak47's i will possibly do extras added. but i will not do an gun plus extras for a $600 gun thats not smart on my part so please lets be fair on both sides

The gun is still in ""like new"" condition with no scratches or wear marks with one exception. It has sat on display on the wall its entire life and the way it sat before I bought it left a mark on it. Its not rust, but the pewter plating there wore off. Its small, but noticeable.

The empty shell case is from 3/16/12.

I bought it new unfired. I have put no more than 100 round through it and it shoots great. I have just decided to move to a G19.

The 30 comes with everything you get when you buy new plus 2 installed Pierce magazine floor plates, the original Glock floor plates, a Pierce grip plug, and a Foxx IWB RH tuckable holster. 

The Pierce floor plates do not add any capacity or length, just a similar texture as the rest of the grip for the pinky. The sights are standard white U rear and dot front. The Foxx holster from what I can tell is similar to the crossbreed. The only thing I would mention is that the 30 is not super snug in the holster by itself. When worn no problems at all.

I'm asking $550 for everything.

I would consider a trades for a similarly outfitted Gen4 G26 or 19, or 9mm ammo + cash. 

I will need to see a IDL and a LTC. I am near Knox and work in Michigan City and willing to drive a reasonable distance.
