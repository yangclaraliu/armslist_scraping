1 magazine. Come to the beach to pick it up and I will include a 50 round box of Sellier & Bellot Ammunition. Can also include a hard or soft case. Pistol is in good condition with signs of use, but no abuse. Some of the bluing is gone on the slide but there is no rust. The gun is still tight and it has an adjustable rear sight with green dosts and a blade front sight. The gun is a double / single action and has a de-cocker safety.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

 Keeping a few extra factory magazines around is never a bad idea; extra magazines save loading time at the range and also serve as a backup for those days when you simply cannot remember where you put your primary magazine."

This rifle retailed for $1476 through Bushmaster before all the talk about bans, and without the extra mags, scope, rings and bases.

Cleaned after every use.  We are selling it only because we purchased another AR-15 in .223 and a bolt action .308.

It has only has about 300-400 rounds through it thus far and is in great condition(has been cleaned). Originally the rifle came with no sights but I added a UTG Detachable Front Sight and a UTG Detachable Match Grade Carry Handle with A2 Rear Sight. These aftermarket sights work well with the rifle and are accurate. Even though this is one of the cheaper AR's it has served me well and has had no problems. the only reason I am selling this is ammo cost. Recently ammo has become hard to find and cost way to much for my taste so ill just stick to my 10/22 for now. Also included with the rifle(but not pictured) are ""Nikon AR-15 P Series Mount (1"" Scope Rings)"". These scope rings allow you to use standard rifle scopes on the AR-15 and at $50 dollars they were not cheap. the scope rings also some with the screws for mounting them to the rifle and the wrench for tightening them. The rifle came with (2) 30 round steel mags that function great and also comes with (1) Tapco 30 round polymer mag, (2) ""GI"" Style 30 round Colt mags, (1) Olive drab 30 round P-mag and (2) black 30 round P-Mags still new in the packaging. 

AMMO included: 

40 rounds herters(actually rebranded TulAmmo) 62 grain HP(Steel)

35 rounds PMC X-TAC 5.56mm 62 grains Green Tip Light Armor Piercing(brass) 


This rifle also comes with the owners manual and I will have to right up some sort of bill of sale to complete the sale. I will not sell to anyone under the age of 18 and you must not be a felon. the price IS negotiable and I will consider only a few trades(plus cash)
I will accept reasonable offers.

The FNS™-9 pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism and a manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety. Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS™-9 results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate. Benefits Fast and Accurate Shooting The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting. The FNS™-9 has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability. The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy. Maximized Safety Systems In addition to the manual safety, the FNS™-9 features Four Major Safeties: Trigger Safety Firing Pin Safety Drop Safety Out-of-Battery Safety 1. Trigger Safety The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a presure on the trigger. The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger. 2. Firing Pin Safety The firing pin safety prevents the striker from passing. The firing pin safety is lifted out the way when the trigger is pulled. 3. Drop Safety Part of the fire control housing prevents the sear from rotating down to release the stricker unless the trigger is pulled. 4. Out-of-Battery Safety When the slide is not fully forwards the sear cannot release the stricker even if the trigger is pulled. Enhanced Ergonomics The FNS™-9 pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as: - Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better prehension - Front serrations for easy press check - Three interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt to the pistol to the shooter's hand size. For Right- and Left-Handers All operating controls are fully ambidextrous: - Slide stop - Magazine catch - Manual safety Durability and Unequalled Reliability The pistol features a 4'' hammer-forged stainless steel barrel and ultra-hard coating on stainless steel slide and barrel. The high quality material is fully tested and fired under severe conditions prior to dispatch. The pistol accepts all military and law enforcement duty ammunition."

In stock and ready to ship. If you have questions about this auction email us via Gunbroker.com or submit request via our website WWW.TheGunChest.com Must pay within 7 days of auction close. The FNS™-9 is the latest handgun innovation by FN Herstal. The FNS™-9 pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism and a manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety. Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS™-9 results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate. Benefits Fast and Accurate Shooting The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting. The FNS™-9 has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability. The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy. Maximized Safety Systems In addition to the manual safety, the FNS™-9 features Four Major Safeties: Trigger Safety Firing Pin Safety Drop Safety Out-of-Battery Safety 1. Trigger Safety The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a presure on the trigger. The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger. 2. Firing Pin Safety The firing pin safety prevents the striker from passing. The firing pin safety is lifted out the way when the trigger is pulled. 3. Drop Safety Part of the fire control housing prevents the sear from rotating down to release the stricker unless the trigger is pulled. 4. Out-of-Battery Safety When the slide is not fully forwards the sear cannot release the stricker even if the trigger is pulled. Enhanced Ergonomics The FNS™-9 pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as: - Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better prehension - Front serrations for easy press check - Three interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt to the pistol to the shooter's hand size. For Right- and Left-Handers All operating controls are fully ambidextrous: - Slide stop - Magazine catch - Manual safety Durability and Unequalled Reliability The pistol features a 4'' hammer-forged stainless steel barrel and ultra-hard coating on stainless steel slide and barrel. The high quality material is fully tested and fired under severe conditions prior to dispatch. The pistol accepts all military and law enforcement duty ammunition."

980,http://www.armslist.com/posts/882980,For Sale:  SOLD,"Maryville, Knoxville, Tennessee","$ 1,400","Listed On: Wednesday, January 30, 2013",Rifles,Bushmaster                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is a highly customized Bushmaster Carbon 15. The rifle has been built buy a very competent gunsmith from the ground up as an ultralight, high speed carbine. It has a carbon fiber upper and lower receiver that are both lighter and significantly stronger than the forged aluminum receivers, much similar to the materials and durability of a Glock vs. a 1911. The carbon fiber upper and lower allow the rifle to return to its original form after being crushed or dropped from a building. Likewise, it creates an extremely lightweight design without compromising durability--this is certainly the future of rifles!

The rifle has a low profile gas block installed that can accept a folding iron sight if you desire to use one, while still keeping it out of the way of the optic with the low profile, lightweight design. The barrel is a thin, chrome-lined barrel chambered in .223 or 5.56 with a 1:9 twist that provides great accuracy while still keeping the weight down. Moving down the barrel, there is a custom made and custom threaded free-floating carbon fiber handguard. The free floating design maximizes accuracy, and the carbon fiber material cuts down on weight while still being very strong and heat-resistant. This whole handguard and ring were custom made to this rifle--they cannot be bought or installed without heavy gunsmithing, which of course has already been done for you! 

The optic is a Sightmark Ultra Shot reflex sight with 5 brightness settings and 4 different reticles, including the popular 2 MOA Aimpoint dot and the EOTech ring/dot. The sight has a rock solid, low profile design that will hold a zero under the harshest of environments. 

The trigger is a Jard single stage adjustable trigger that is set to 2 lbs right now. It can either be stiffened or loosened depending on your trigger preferences. The break is crisp and sharp, which allows for very precise single shots. It of course was installed by the same gun smith as well. The lower has a very low shelf that will allow a registered drop in auto sear or lightning link to be installed for some full auto fun!

The buffer tube is a rifle length tube with an Ace Skeleton stock. The rifle length tube reduces both the weight and recoil, and the stock also cuts down on weight while still providing an excellent cheek rest and a length of pull that fits most shooters.

A Hogue pistol grip was installed to replace the stock plastic one. This Hogue grip is rubberized and provides a slip-free grip that is comfortable, looks good, and reduces the already minimal recoil.

Included with the rifle are as follows:

- 1 metal C-Products mag with anti tilt follower
- 1 Bushmaster metal mag with anti tilt follower
- 1 box of M855 green tipped light armor piercing rounds
- Original box and literature from Sightmark reflex
- Neoprene cover for the Sightmark
- Original literature for the rifle and trigger
- Hard case
- Sling and mounting hardware
- 2 picatinny rail risers for an optic
- Rubber recoil pad for stock
- Original trigger, disconnector, hammer, and springs
- Original gas block with sling loop
- Original Bushmaster double heat shield handguard
- Original delta ring assembly

*Please note that both mags come loaded with high quality brass cased PMC! That is 80 rounds of combined PMC and M855 green tipped penetrators.

The price is slightly negotiable, but bear in mind the amount of custom gunsmithing work and parts that have gone into this rifle. I hate to see it go, but I must fund another rifle project that I am working on. NO bill of sale is required. I don't sign them, nor will I make you sign one. You can reach me at (8six5-7sixsix-7fivefivefive). Text is preferred. Please do not email me, as Yahoo has problems with replying to Armslist emails, so I may not be able to reply to you. I am not looking for any trades at this time. Please don't hesitate to shoot me a text if you have any questions or want additional pictures of the rifle. Thanks for looking and God bless!"
