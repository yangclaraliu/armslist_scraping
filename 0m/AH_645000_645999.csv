Gorgeous, and VERY accurate Sig 556 piston driven 21"" 5.56 / .223 rifle.  I attached a 1/4"" by 1/2"" 3 shot group from 100yds.  That is how accurate this gun is.

This is a rare rifle that was only imported by Sig for 2 years.  The design was then changed to a shorter 18"" and I still haven't seen one of the new ones for sale.

For those that don't know what DMR is.  DMR stands for Designated Marksman Rifle.  The Designated Marksman program was a small unit sniper designation that the USMC gave to accurate infantrymen.  They were given upgraded optics and a longer barrel than the standard 16"" M4 that was issued at the time.  DMR guns were required to use standard AR magazines with 5.56 chambers, and have increased accuracy over the standard M4.  It was very successful and continues to this day.

Came from the factory with:
Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle Sniper) buttstock.
Flat top picatinny with quad rail foregrip.
Adjustable 2 Stage trigger (VERY LIGHT from factory!)
Harris Bipod and Bipod mount
21"" Forged partially free floated Bull Barrel with target crown.
Sig Sauer adjustable piston system.


I can also include Nikon M223 3-12x scope on quick release burris picatinny mount, MBUS sights, and Grip Pod for additional.

These guns were made for about 30 years or so, (from around 1930-1969) and almost all of them were in .38 special.
 Only about 47K were made in this caliber, and were often used as police training pistols for target practice in conjunction with their .38s.
 Most all of the Colt Official Police .22s came with the blued finish, and usually sell for in the $700 plus range, with the scarce original nickled versions going for around $1200. 
 This one has been refinished, so it is priced accordingly. It is a wonderful 'shooter'- & is mechanically very tight, cheap to shoot, & darned accurate. Barrel length is 6"". Bore is perfect.
 This gun was made in 1953, and wears the original Colt grips. 
  If you want a rare Colt .22 in the scarce Nickle finish, that is a great shooter/plinker with old school American quality & accuracy....You'll love this Vintage Colt!
 This is a predecessor to the Python with smooth action & timing, and overbuilt for a .22....It'll be 60 yrs. old next year and is barely broken in.

here's an update.  Some users believe that it is acceptable to be assholes and agree on a price, then change that price several times and say since it takes several minutes to respond its like an auction and prices go down.  then they have the audacity to talk to the owner like crap, and put our good Lord's name out there like its okay to do treat others poorly.  here's what he doesn't know.  I keep a list of all of my deadbeat buyers and not only do I have your first and last name Douglas S.  I have your plate number,from your speeding ticket, your address, phone number and birthdate.  and according to what I was told you were once charged with a felony in lets say 1992.  perhaps somebody should check into you???????????????????????????????????????

I have this rifle zeroed in at 100 yards, and the scope mounted is a Simmons 3-9x40, it's does the job. I also mounted a bipod that allows me to shoot from a lay down position, also it makes it easier to shoot when at the range.

Great condition.  One owner.  Comes with turkey choke and slip-on Pachmayr.  

I bought this gun brand new for my daughter about 10 years ago, and have loaned it to three other kids over the years since.  It has a lot of good memories, but I'd rather it get passed along to another kid to keep making more.  The last two kids only used it for turkey hunting and the other screw in choke tubes got lost somewhere along the way, so you will need to buy a $15 screw-in choke of your choice for dove or squirrel.

==== ABOUT ====
This is an AR-10 that DPMS designed as a base-model .308 semi-automatic precision match rifle to start your build from.  It is just as it was when it left the factory as no modifications have been made. Exactly 64 rounds have been fired from this rifle so it still remains in excellent DPMS manufactured out-of-the-box condition.

The rifle performed much better than I had expected a semi-automatic match rifle to  perform.  With precise and consistent loads, it throws sub-MOA groups at 300 yards regularly.  Unfortunately, the ergonomics just simply didn't gel with my body shape, so it was hard for me to find a relaxed natural and neutral position.  This made things awkward for me at 700-1,000 yard distances.  For me personally, a bolt-action platform better suits my needs and shooting preferences.

I do still like this rifle and am in no big rush to part with it; however, I would like to find it a home that might fit the furniture more comfortably and/or be better able to take full advantage of its performance potential than me. It would allow me to more quickly start moving forward with a bolt rifle.

Anyway, I wanted to see what the interest level is out here and to tell any of you serious shoppers looking to build a semi-auto .308 precision rifle to feel free contact me anytime, I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.  Thanks!


==== ADDITIONAL NOTES ====
I live in Lake Jackson TX (50 miles south of Houston) and if anyone wants to come down to check the rifle out first, just let me know. I'm happy to oblige and happy to make any sale in person. Unfortunately, my transportation options are limited right now.

For anyone outside of this area, I have an FFL around the corner that will ship it out to you right away.  Just let me know!

MUST have a valid state photo ID (to be photocopied onto both of our transaction receipts)

I am unable to take credit cards nor can I take personal checks.

Cash is fine if the sale is in person

Money orders or bank checks are acceptable as long as I am present at the time that you have it drafted."

Great for kids. Low recoil. This is a new bushnell scope and it will not interfere with ejection of ammo. Will trade for AK-47 or fine handgun. Otherwise $500 firm.  Manufactured in New Haven Conn.
One of the primary reasons for the .30-30's popularity amongst deer hunters is its light recoil. Average recoil from a typical 150-grain (9.7 g) load at 2,390 feet per second (730 m/s) in a 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) rifle is 10.6 pounds-force (47 N) of felt recoil at the shooter's shoulder. This, combined with the cartridge's ability to take the majority of large game in North America, as long as the game is within 200 yards (180 m) of the shooter, results in a highly effective hunting round.

Great for kids. Low recoil. This is a ne bushnell scope and it will not interfere with ejection of ammo. Will trade for AK-47 or fine handgun. Otherwise $500 firm.  Manufactured in New Haven Conn.
One of the primary reasons for the .30-30's popularity amongst deer hunters is its light recoil. Average recoil from a typical 150-grain (9.7 g) load at 2,390 feet per second (730 m/s) in a 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) rifle is 10.6 pounds-force (47 N) of felt recoil at the shooter's shoulder. This, combined with the cartridge's ability to take the majority of large game in North America, as long as the game is within 200 yards (180 m) of the shooter, results in a highly effective hunting round.

it has a six inch barrel and a custom tuned competition trigger 
that is like no other i have ever seen. 

it is a double single action model. when the trigger is locked into single action 
it breaks with almost no trigger movement what so ever.

a competitive shooter used to own this pistol. you must see and feel the trigger work to appreciate this fine revolver.

i know that a 14-2 in this condition usually goes in the 600.00 range
but this is not your usual 14-2

i am asking 800.00 for it , but i am open to trade offers also.

The new bi-directional, X-Tac frontstrap and slide treatment offer enhanced grip and improved durability over traditional checkering in severe and hard-use environments. Scientifically designed to work with dry or wet hands, with or without tactical gloves, the X-Tac pattern redefines secure shooting comfort and gunhandling without the coarse, often painful nature of other grip treatments. In tandem with our G-10 Starburst grips, the X-Tac tread pattern locks securely into the firing hand and will reduce muzzle flip without snagging on clothes or cover garments. The X-Tac proudly wears our newest rear sight, the Wilson Combat® 1911 Battlesight. This high profile rear sight has a .145” wide U-Notch for optimum sighting in low-light, dynamic range conditions. The rear blade of the sight is serrated, while the notch area is recessed into a semi-circular pocket for a crisp, protected sight picture.
