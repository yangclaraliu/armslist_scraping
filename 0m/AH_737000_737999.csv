I am not asking top dollar but current market value. As in the past, if you disagree with our free market society, feel free to shop else where or move to a socialist country where everyone can get the same price for everything.

If you believe in the free market and want a quality AR collectible at a fair market price, buy this. It is a COLT with Colt heritage, and Colt quality. It is not some frankenAR slapped together in a machine shop or basement by some guy who has never before installed a trigger group. There is a reason they say ""never fired"" in those listings, they are afraid to. My price is firm and non-negotiable. Please do your homework prior to contacting me. Only compare apples to apples, not Colt SP1 prices without roll marks. You will see this is a bargain in today's market.

Colt AR6721 Tactical Carbine, 16"" 1/9"" Twist HBar

NOT NEW IN BOX. Has been fired. Overall Finish at 92%

The AR-15A3 model AR6721 is an exceptional patrol rifle 
with tactical accuracy chosen by federal, state and local agencies. The 16.1"" (40.9 cm) heavy barrel with 1 in 9"" (229 mm) rifling twist allows flexibility in ammunition selection. The telescopic butt stock adjusts to four positions to enhance mobility and fit to a wider range of operators. In position, the removable carrying handle provides an M16A4 target style sight adjustable for windage and elevation to 600 meters. Easily removable, the flat top upper receiver allows for easy mounting of optical, night vision and other tactical sighting systems. The tactical carbine is the answer to all the requirements of modern law enforcement.

Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1:9
Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness"

This rifle has never been shot and the magazines that came it have never been loaded. Factory 10 round and thirty round mag included with owners manual. 

The AR-180B has a barrel that is just under 20 inches in length, has a one-in-nine inch twist, and is slim in comparison to most AR-15 type rifle barrels today. Thankfully, ArmaLite has not saddled the AR-180B with an HBAR-type barrel. Most AR-15 type rifles are fitted with barrels that are too heavy for their intended purpose. On a varmint or target gun a heavy barrel is acceptable, but it is a detriment to handling on an assault-style rifle. The polymer lower receiver, trim buttstock, and slim barrel result in a weight of only six pounds for the AR-180B, which is a full pound lighter than most 16 inch barreled AR-15s. The bolt operating handle is attached directly to the bolt carrier, eliminating the charging handle of the AR-15, and giving the shooter a simpler and better method of chambering a round. The AR-180B now has a fixed buttstock rather than the folding unit of the original, which was prone to breakage under rough handling."

Why am I selling and why the price? 
1 is because I need to finish off my stripped lower and don't have the money.
2 is that I can just see in the stupid upcoming ban, they will probably add the green tip ammo to it. Along with all the other things, the idiots.

Here's some one clearly taking advantage of the current situation. 3500 dollars for a 300 black out? Come on dude that's  retarded. First off you have it built on a new frontier lower. That's a solid 120 bucks there. Maybe!! 600 for the upper. So 750 in it maybe. Oh I forgot  a 60 dollar Walmart scope. Not to mention paying 2 dollars a round  to shoot it.

This is a year old CMMG Complete lower.  VERY high quality with a nice tight fit to all uppers I've put on it.  The stock has NO wobble and is fully adjustable. Here's what you get:

-CMMG 5.56 marked lower receiver
-CMMG Lower Parts Kit with upgraded trigger and hammer springs
-ERGO Grip with storage compartment in FDE
-High Quality VLTOR Modstock in FDE with 2 storage compartments, sling attachments, and buttstock pad
-6 position adjustable Milspec buffer tube, spring, and buffer

This lower has had about 400 flawless rounds of 5.56 fired through it with no problems. 
The previous owner thought that the magwell was a little tight with some of his crappy metal mags, so he filed the edges a little bit (you can see in the picture) so his mags would drop free. This does not affect fuctionality and all of my Pmags drop free with no problems. Like I said, I've never had a problem with this lower, but I need money because I've got a baby on the way.

This is being exacerbated by idiots on here saying there will be a ban and asking stupid prices for their junk guns.  I even have received calls from friends and relatives asking when the ban goes into effect due to all this hype.  I have a background in politics so let me explain why there won't be a ban.

The current House of Representatives has 231 Republicans and 201 Democrats.  Now, most, if not all, Republicans will vote against the ban.  Many democrats will jump ship and vote against it as well (many Democrats that are more moderate, sometimes called blue dog democrats, are progun.  Here in Ohio Ted Strickland, our previous governor, had an A rating from the NRA.)  The ban won't make it through the House.

""BUT WUT IF IT DOES???""

It won't, but even if it did it would have to get 60 votes in the Senate.  It is not a budget measure so it can be filibustered.  There are currently 52 Democrats in the Senate and 45 Republicans (two empty which will be abstain votes).  Even if all the democrats vote together on the ban (they won't) and a few republicans jump ship and vote with them (one or two might, but no more than that) they will still be short of the 60 votes.

""BUT WUT ABOUT AN EXECUTIVE ORDUR???""

Executive orders can be made by a President and have the full power of a law passed by congress.  HOWEVER, the President can only make an executive order if:
1. It pertains to a power granted to him by the Constitution (Article 2 section 2);
2. It is a power granted to him by Congress (i.e. Congress passes a law saying the President can act on x, y, z);
or 3. It pertains to the enforcement of a law already in place (e.g. the President can tell departments under the executive branch to not enforce certain things, take priority on something else, reorganize themselves, etc)

The President can make an executive order on these things but none of them include a law that forbids the sale or purchase of a particular item.  It has not been granted to him by congress, nor by the constitution, and it doesn't involve the daily workings of a department of the executive branch.  

The President theoretically could make an executive order, but there isn't a court in the country that wouldn't immediate throw it out and label it as unconstitutional.  Not only would it be a gross overreach of power (far worse than anything he has ever done, or any US president before him for that matter) but it would be pointless to do it, expending political capital, just to have it be smacked down and ridiculed by every Constitutional scholar in the country (well, not all of them, but most of them).  

Here's my prediction of what will happen.  Obama will propose a ban on high capacity mags and try to limit in some fashion the sale of ""assault rifles"".  It will enter the House and fail, be introduced as a separate bill in the Senate and be filibustered.  Obama will then blame Republicans for every gun related death following the bills' defeat. 

So no ban, just more politics as usual."

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with overmolded, finger groove grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. This new SIG SAUER P238 is ready to go in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Straight talk, real talk. Prices are still going up. This will not last at this price. If you are sitting on the fence I suggest you decide before the next round of increases. The $2000 guns from last week are bringing $3000. They are expensive but available now; better than totally unavailable later. Or the prices may drop as fast as they rose. I don't know. You roll the dice.

I wish I had bought gold at $300/ounce. I did not and the price went up to current market values. I have always maintained that the price of these Colt's with restricted roll marks would sky rocket but no one believed me and yet here is the proof. Type in ""colt restricted"" in the search block to see current market prices. I am not asking top dollar but current market value.

If you believe in the free market and want a quality AR collectible at a fair market price, buy this. It is a COLT with Colt heritage, and Colt quality. It is not some frankenAR slapped together in a machine shop or basement by some guy who has never before installed a trigger group. There is a reason they say ""never fired"" in those listings, they are afraid to. My price is firm and non-negotiable. Please do your homework prior to contacting me. Only compare apples to apples, not Colt SP1 prices without roll marks. You will see this is a good deal in today's market.

I deal in cash, FTF, and require a Concealed Carry Permit or Pistol Permit, NC ID and a signed Bill of Sale.
