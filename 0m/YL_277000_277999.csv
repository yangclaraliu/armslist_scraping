212,http://www.armslist.com/posts/277212,For Sale/Trade:  Dell Inspiron 1720 gamer laptop,"bentonville, Fayetteville, Arkansas",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, January 15, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a laptop that plays games and cost $2000 when it was new. Would trade for a m&p pistol or block. Could also throw ina ruger P95 into the deal. Below is a post of the specs, thanks.

I have a silver and black Dell inspiron 1720. SPECS: Intel Core2Duo 2.00GHz, GeForce 8600GT 1GB video card with VGA monitor and S-Video out running at 1440x900 native resolution, 17 inch gloss screen, 4GB dual channel memory/RAM, 250GB hard drive, Microphone, integrated Wireless and 10/1000 lan card, 4 USB ports, DvD/CD Rewrite drive, headphone and microphone line in jacks, multimedia keys, running Windows 7 64 bit Ultimate edition. THE BAD: Minor scratches and marks by the keyboard on the inside of the laptop, from normal use. Thats about it, everything works as it should. I have 4 (four) charging cords so you won't have a problem if you lose one, if one dies, you can carry one everywhere you go. Battery was recently replaced with a brand new one from Dell. This is a few years old, however, it plays World of Warcraft, Starcraft 2, Call of Duty, I have even played the new Star Wars the Old Republic MMO on this thing and we watch movies and shows on our TV with it. Why am I selling? I don't game much anymore, recently got married and I have gotten a tablet that does what I need it to. I don't want to sell this, but I don't use it. That being said I'm not interested in low ball offers. This laptop will play games that new laptops in the $500's-$600s can't because of the video card (and it cost nearly $2000 when new) thus the price is quite reasonable and firm. I may be interested in trades depending on what you have, shoot me an email or text at 479 - four two six - 4983. Please, no calls. I receive emails on my phone so be assured I will answer them."

Specs:

AR15 / M16 A2 Upper half with 16"" M4 contour barrel and A2 Upper receiver. Item # AR-UHM4A2. This 5.56mm cal barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports M4 contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function in full or semi auto. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of Mil-spec M4 contour (.750 under the front sight base) complete with the M203 groove in the front. This contour is the perfect balance between light weight, heat dissipation, and accuracy. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights. The barrel is mounted on a A2 upper receiver with built in carry handle made from certified 7075T6.511 alloy forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec. This upper has the newest Mil-spec A2 adjustable sights that feature finger adjustable elevation to 800 meters and more than 30 minutes of windage adjustment at 1/2 MOA per click. The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover. This upper receiver is complete less bolt/carrier assembly and charging handle. The upper is fully assembled."

The pictures you see below is the gun I have for sale, note the forward hand grip: it is NOT an AOW as it has a total factory length of 27” and there is no way to affix a stock to this. It has perfect wood and nice bluing, although there are a few very minor safe rubs. This one came with a 13” barrel, it also comes with (6) 32rd stick mags. I am looking for $1800 cash but will consider reasonable offers, prefer trades.

The lower in the middle picture has already been sold. There is only one lower in this ad and it is the one in the bottom picture that is attached to the upper.

I don't know much about the short upper other than it shoots nice and looks cool. It does come with the Bushnell red dot scope that is in the pic. I also have a couple magazines and about 100 rounds of .223 that will go with it.

The larger upper in the second picture is an Olympic Arms heavy bull barrel upper chambered in a 25 WSSM (Winchester Super Short Mag). If you dont know much about these you can research them. They are extremely fast and are capable of taking game at 600+ yards with ease. The upper will work on any AR lower and so will the magazine. I have a box of shells and 1 mag that goes with it.

The full complete rifle (bottom pic) is a century arms AR-15. It is fun to shoot.  It has the non-detachable carry handle. I have a quad rail handguard setup on it. Makes it heavier than the standard rails. I will also include the stock handguards. It also comes with the adjustable bipod (5inches to 10inches?) shown on it as well as the scope mount rail system that is mounted on the carry handle. I have a couple magazines and about 100 rounds of loose .223 ammo that will also go with it.

I received these on a trade. I have quite a few ARs and need to clear the gun case out. Looking to get $900 obo for the 25WSSM upper with box of shells, $650 obo for the shorter upper with a couple mags and ammo, and $900 obo on the Century Arms AR.

Let me know which one(s) you want and what you have to offer.

Will sell all 3 with 1 25WSSM mag and 1 box of 25WSSM shells, and 6 AR 30rd mags with 200rds of .223 ammo for $2200."

OPS-4 upper w/ LAR ss bolt carrier group and ambidextrous charging handles provides smooth, reliable cycling, the side mounted charging handles providing the perfect platform for scoped ARs, as they do not interfere with optics. The LAR receiver group fits perfectly without play between upper and lower, and it can still be taken down by hand. 

The Benny Hill comp, in combination with the adjustable gas block, eliminates muzzle rise, maintaining sight picture. Adjustable with a small allen wrench, it can be tuned to any load.

The JARD trigger group is adjustable, and it is by far my favorite trigger group on the market. It is smooth and crisp, and this particular model does not interfere with the pistol grip in any way.  

I built this rifle as an experimental project, and it couldn't have yielded better results. I am selling it in order to build a 7.62 version in the same format. It has less than 50 rounds through all new compenents. The rifle has zero recoil, and it maintains sight picture with minimal muzzle rise. It is very similar to shooting an accurized 10/22, though the effective range and report give it away as a 5.56. I do not know what the maximum effective range is because there is not a long enough range in my area to begin to max it out. 300 yards is boring, and, with the correct optics, I think it will easily take out varmints at 600. Feel free to email me any questions you might have. 

The scope is a Millett I canabalized from my old hunting rifle and is optional. I would not recommend this scope for this rifel, but I will gladly include it with the rings for 160, or just the rings for 60."

Absolutely like new with a ton of extras. A very good copy of Glock technology but tiny in size. Very high quality fit, finish, and machining. NOT like a Keltec. This particular model is the one with actual 3 dot sights, not the just released cheaper one with the slide machined with little nubs for sights like a Ruger LCP. I have fired exactly 38 rounds through it and it has been flawless (10 Speer, 28 Winchester FMJ). Comes with the list of accessories below. 
This was my wifes gun that sat in the safe and was never carried. Holster shows minor cosmetic wear on edges, I used this for a few months with my personal DB380 that sold a few weeks ago (not nearly as nice as this one). I am the original owner. 

New prices for comparison

Diamondback DB380 with 3 dot sights- $360 ( low average with tax)
Extra Diamondback magazine- $25
Pair of finger extentions (also flat bases)- $15
Crimson Trace Laserguard Laser- $170
Clament Leather holster- $40
10 Speer personal protection rounds- $10
New box of 20 Magtech personal protection rounds- $20
22 rounds of Winchester FMJ- $5
Rubber laser cut grip tape overlays- $12

You can see I have $657 into this package.

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50 or can be negotiated in the price. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. The barrel and gas ports have been re-worked to cycle lighter birdshot loads for which saigas typically do not cycle reliably. Please contact me by email to make a cash offer or a trade offer. Thanks."

SKS is the predecessor of the AK47, using the same ammo, but more accurate due to a slightly  longer barrel.  Can be easily and afford-ably modified to a modern tactical style w/ replaceable stocks, magazines, mounts, bi-pod stand, etc., etc. etc.

This gun has been broken in and tested with Winchester white box FMJ, S&B FMJ, Hornady Critical Defense FTX, and Winchester Ranger +P Bonded HP ammo.  It has performed flawlessly, and it shoots like a dream.  It's been respectfully handled, maintained, and stored for the 6 months or so I've owned it.  It comes with all the accouterments it came with: extra mag, manual, box, etc.

This is a superb gun.  I'd always wanted to spend some time with one after I first saw them come on the market a few years ago, and I've had my chance.  But alas, I'm a Glock 19 guy at the end of the day, and I don't want to spend too much time working with a DA/SA system on a semi-automatic platform (even though I like the grip on this gun better than the Glock), in order to keep my training consistent.  At the same time I'm beginning to spend some time with revolvers, and I'm kind of thinking along the lines of a .357 Magnum S&W with a 3"" or 4"" barrel for a bedside gun.

Sooooo, the CZ can go, and I'm up for possibly bringing in a used revolver of high quality--thinking along the lines of a Smith & Wesson 686 or 686PLUS with a 3"" or 4"" barrel.  I hear there are other manufacturers who've made similar guns, but I'm not too familiar with revolver-land.  Basically, if you have a revolver you think may suit my evolving tastes, and you're considering a 'Wonder-Nine', please get in touch.  This gun puts the XDs, Sigmas, etc. to shame with both its styling, fit, and function--it's much more on par with a Glock (I would imagine there are some Jeff Cooper acolytes out there who would smack me for that, squeal 1911, and run off with my CZ while I pull myself together.)

Feel free to throw me a wild card, too, like:

-a Kel-Tec PMR-30, PLR-16, PLR-22, SU-22, SU-16, Sub-2000, or PF-9
-subcompact Glocks of 9mm or .45 caliber
-33 round 9mm Glock magazines
-new Ruger 10/22
-quality used riot shotgun

You never know...

Please be able to share high quality photos of your trade before meeting, and be an Indiana resident willing to give a quick look at driver's license in order to maintain legality of trade.  I'll do the same.

I also have a Kel-Tec P-3AT with lots of extras I'd be willing to throw in to sweeten the deal if things get interesting.

I'm looking for something in a .40 or maybe a 9mm if they're very cheap. I know I won't get a bite for an M&P, but I'll do 300-350 for a good striker action handgun.

Please e-mail me if you have something to sell in this price range, and don't mind delivering. I'm either getting a handgun, or I'm going to be stocking up on pepper spray. All I have to protect myself at the moment is my fists and a small pocket knife, so a quick response would be ideal.

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

The Magpul MOE Stock – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement butt-stock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

I'm being modest rating this rifle at 98%. I need to get it in the hands of someone who will give it the care it deserves.
The only time I ever shot this gun, I got excellent groups out of it at 100 yards. I can't remember exactly except they were pretty good for a rank amateur.
After exhaustive research, I believe this gun was built in the mid 50's by 300 Gunsmith Service in Englewood, CO.
The single shot L46 action has a rare solid floorplate. Most singles were pinned. I think this one was referred to as the target model.
It has a Weaver K8F scope, a bedded stock, a split adjustable match trigger, and a 19-1/4 inch heavy barrel.
I might consider taking certain S&W revolvers or 1911 style 45's as partial trade, but otherwise this is a face to face cash sale.
The strange stuff on the trigger and checkering in the picture are artifacts from shrinking the image. Hi res pictures are available on request, or come check it out in person."
