New In Box with All Accessories - Never Fired

This is not a FIME Group marked receiver.  This is probably the last new in box Arsenal SGL-21 in the country.  

Increasing in value daily with the current news.  You already missed it at $2500.
The price will go up again.

If they come back in stock, (and you are still allowed to purchase one) you might be able to buy a FIME Group gun that is identical for much less.  If you are looking for a shooter, that or another quality rifle probably makes a lot more sense.   

However, if you are a collector, investor, or just always wanted a real Arsenal SGL-21 this rifle is for you.

As an added bonus, if you did decide to shoot this rifle, you would be covered under warranty by Arsenal, where FIME GROUP rifles will be handled under a different customers service department.

This is the SGL21-63 - Which means Warsaw (authentic AK) length stock and OD green furniture.  This is a close as you can get to a legal Russian AKM in the US without special paperwork.

Possibly interested in partial trade for other AK variants or firearms.
I don't have much room to move on the price unless your trade is spectacular.

The price is listed as what I would expect a collector to pay.  However, I reserve the right to hold off on the sale to wait for other possibly higher offers at my discretion.

Very nice pistol.  Like new condition with little evidence it has been fired.  Has the rare S&W embossed CTC laser grips in desert tan.  Original box and it's entire contents are original and complete.  Anyway it is 99%, the pics distort the image (it looks like the cocking serrations are checkered- they are not, everything is original) - pics on this site don't do it justice.

The Vinci Cordoba features GripTight, a synthetic high-tech over-coating bonded to the stock and fore-end that`s weather-resistant and provides a sure grip, wet or dry. In addition, the innovative design of this semi auto shotgun raises the standard in firearms technology. Driven by a passion for efficiency and simplicity, Benelli engineers have advanced the cutting edge. The superbly balanced Vinci embodies a new way of looking at shotgun design. The revolutionary new In-Line Inertia Driven operating system, with superior reliability and lightning fast speed, is the simplest semi-auto shotgun operating system ever devised. Advanced ergonomics assure fluid gun movement. Combine that with the ComforTech Plus recoil reduction system, and Benelli puts in your hands the world`s softest-kicking shotgun. In recent lab tests, the competition had up to 72-percent more felt recoil than the Vinci. It`s modular design makes Vinci the easiest shotgun on the planet to assemble and disassemble. No wonder it`s named for Leonardo da Vinci, the great Italian Renaissance inventor, artist, and thinker who shattered the technological boundaries of his world.

Today the US Stock Mkt took another dive based upon news from Bernanke on how to ""fix"" the economy.  Consequently Silver and Gold spiked as a result of the falling US dollar.  Don't be fooled holding onto paper money, funds in retirement accounts (based upon same paper money) thinking you are secure.  Hard assets including Silver and Gold will protect against the coming collapse of the US dollar.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.

To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.5mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

It does have some holster wear as i have carried it but no rust. I'm not quite sure what the discoloration is on the barrel is, but it's a stain of some kind. I know for sure it is not rust. I would like $1200 for everything, $1000 for just the gun. MSRP On Kimbers website is $1617, I paid a little over $1500 for just the gun."

This Wilson was made and sold in 2007 for $2,300.  It is the compact size, 4” barrel with the short handled (Officers or Ultra size) frame.  I purchased it from the original owner for $2,000 and since then I have had it to my gunsmith who did some trigger work on it, and I added the Crimson Trace grips.

The pistol, as described above, comes with the following extras:

Wilson Combat range bag
3 Wilson Combat magazines
1 Tripp magazine
Wilson Combat black leather OWB holster
Haugen Handgun Leather black leather IWB holster
Lleen Bore Pockit cleaning kit
Blade-Tech quad magazine holder
Original Wilson grips
2 Ahrends grips
4 Esmeralda signed and numbered grips
Factory build sheet
Factory DVDs and manual
Factory recoil spring (Heavy Duty 20 pound recoil spring installed)

Pistol is beautiful, has a very light trigger pull and smooth action.  The slide has two scratches and two marks on it, the frame has a slight “idiot mark” on it.  The front night sight dates back to 2007, still glows but it is 5 years old.

Total round count is in the neighborhood of 2,800.  I have not had any problems with the feeding, or shooting of the pistol.  The only problem I had (and the reason for the trip to the gunsmith) was trying to insert a magazine.  When I would do so, the magazine would stop at the point of the trigger and I had to play with it to get it fully in place.  Dropping a magazine was no problem, just the insertion.  The problem turned out to be with the trigger stirrup, which needed to be worked on and fitted properly.  Since then, everything is as it should be. 

The only trades that might interest me would be for a FN FS2000 in 5.56 using AR-15 magazines, an H&K USP Compact Tactical, or an H&K SL8-6.  Trade value on my end is calculated at $2,500.  Additional cash on your end would depend on what you have, condition, and extra items and/or features.

I am selling this pistol as a part of my reductions in my 1911 collection.  I am not in need of any cash, I am not in a hurry to sell, and if it does not sell I will gladly keep it and continue to watch the value go up.

I would prefer to sell, that way I can play around some more.  My FIRM price is $2,200 and I am not into driving very far.  This is a FTF transaction to Oregon residents (no I am not going to ship, so don’t ask) and I will ask for ID.

I am located in Myrtle Creek, south of Roseburg, just off of I-5 at milepost 108.

The preferred method to communicate with me is to call Ken at 541-863-6465.  I am retired and usually home, unless I am not, in which case leave me a message and I will be certain to call back."

Also large power tools, air compressors, table saws.

Comes with original box, 2 10 round factory mags, and one 15 round mag. $500 cash, not interested in any trades. Call text or email. Will require copy of drivers license or ID in a face to face transaction.

This is the upgraded latest model that comes with the locking mechanism for easy storage. Asking 25$ firm and not a penny less.  Thanks!

UP for sale is my Armalite AR-10 with Bushnell Banner Scope 6x24 x40mm scope.  There is a scope cover/barrel cover that fits snuggly over the scope for storage.  Also attached on the gun is a scope rail on the carry handle so that you can still use the iron sights (very useful if you are sighting in long range, and need to quickly intercept a closer target).  There is an extendable bipod, and collapsing stock (not quick collapsing so it wont collapse accidentally).  The picatinny rail system will allow you to add all the other extras you might want.  3 magazines are included with the sales, (2) 10 round magazines, and (1) 20 round magazine.

There are a couple very minor, purely cosmetic scratches around the trigger and guard assembly.  I just list this as a 100% disclosure, not really as a negative effect on the rifle.

Not really interested in trades, but will always entertain offers.  Would seriously consider a High quality 300 blackout AR platform.

I will not save the rifle unless someone is currently driving to meet me.

Yes, I had one just like that a few months back and he gave his name as Dan Podilla (Hispanic-sounding name.)
