This is definitely a collectors piece. I am more of a shooter myself so I would like to trade it for something I will get to shoot more often or sell

Perfect for conceal carry. It's only 0.9 inches thick across the slide and super small, but still carries 6 - 9mm rounds. It definitely packs a lot of punch for it's size. This is the metal frame Kahr pocket pistol. Because it is metal - and heavier than a PM9 or CM9 -it has MUCH LESS recoil than those light-weight guns. It is actually one of the lowest recoil guns in this size (by any company). Even though it is a metal frame gun, it is still lighter than other commonly carried guns like the Springfield XD subcompact and the HK P2000SK. Weighs less fully loaded than a Glock 26 fully loaded - but it's much smaller and thinner (and metal). Super easy to conceal. 

This is the rare two-tone MK9, with a black slide and grey steel frame. Looks very cool. It comes with the awesome Crossbreed MiniTuck IWB holster, which hides it VERY well! You are really ready to CCW with this setup... nothing else required (except a CCW license). I have replaced the grip screws with machined hex screws that do not loosen easily (never had to tighten them). The gun also comes with a Hogue Hand-All grip for subcompacts (see in pictures). 

Includes:

-  1 Kahr MK9 9mm 6+1rd pistol
-  2 6rd 9mm magazines
-  1 7rd 9mm magazine
-  1 Crossbreed MiniTuck IWB Holster

-  1 Original plastic Hardcase with original paperwork
-  2 A&G Grip Sleeves for the 7 round Magazine  (not shown)
-  2 Pearce Grip Pinky Extensions  (not shown)
-  2 aftermarket return springs (but the original is the best)
-  1 spare Kahr MK9 Striker Spring (unused)
-  2 pairs of the original grip screw

I've had NO failures to feed or fire this gun. Put around 300 rounds through it - and it shoots very well - easy to control. Center mass and head hits are very easy for me. It has been meticulously cleaned and maintained. No visible scratches or blemishes. Looks brand new. 

Please do not insult me with low-ball offers. The gun retails between $650 and $850 and includes only 2 magazines. For what you get - this is a GREAT DEAL. I am selling the gun to finance a rifle purchase.

Ideally since my other pistols are chambered in 9 mm, 40 cal, or 45 AUTO I would like to  trade for a firearm of similar calibre.  I will also accept cash, just make an offer. If you are unsure of a trade feel free to make an offer because I have yet to fully make up my mind on what type of firearm I want next."

Sharing all the family traits of the world-famous Desert Eagle pistol, Magnum’s Micro Desert Eagle pistol, chambered in .380 ACP, is the ultimate in compact personal protection. Small enough to nest comfortably at home, in a pocket or in a purse, the double action only Micro Desert Eagle is proudly made in the U.S. and weighs less than 14 oz. But don’t let its size fool you. The Micro Desert Eagle provides big-time protection with a gas-assisted blowback system for ultimate reliability and amazing accuracy. Which only goes to prove that good things do indeed come in small packages."

The action (DAO) is very tight and completely functional. The black finish is original, complete, and without flaw. The original Bakelite grips are in immaculate condition. The cartridge ejector works fine and the barrel's grooves are still visible. Overall, this pistol would easily rate at 95%.

This webpage has some detailed history of the pistol: http://www.nrvoutdoors.com/ENFIELD%20SNUB/ENFIELD%20SNUB.htm. In the first photograph on the left margin (with the red velvet background), my pistol is almost identical to the one in the middle. However, my pistol has the distinction of having a factory-installed lanyard loop in the frame at the base of the grip, similar to the pre-WWII pistol pictured at the top. Research shows that this feature is quite rare and indicates that this particular pistol was a British officer's pistol which would have seen little, if any, battlefield usage. This would also account for this pistol's pristine condition.

Provenance from the early 1960s can be provided. The original Hunter leather holster is included in this sale as well as three (3) new 50-round boxes of .38 S&W Remington Express cartridges. Attached are photographs of my actual pistol.

I bought it several months ago for $1050 and just zeroed the iron sights. It does have a paint job on it so I am selling for below what its worth because I know some people don't like that. The paint job looks great though and this is a great rifle. Kind of unique since it has a 14.5"" barrel with a permanently attached flash hider which gives you a little extra maneuverability. I have another AR-15 and would kind of like a little more variety. The rifle comes with box, manual, sling, and 3 30-round magazines. If you are interested in ammo and a quality chest rig for it I will throw those in as well for a good price. Contact me with any questions. Asking $800 No low-ball offers please, I am not in a hurry to sell it.  FTF in Colorado Springs preferred but I will travel a reasonable distance for serious buyers. Thanks for looking!"

Legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

The paint job looks great though and this is a great rifle. Kind of unique since it has a 14.5"" barrel with a permanently attached flash hider which gives you a little extra maneuverability. I have another AR-15 and would kind of like a little more variety. The rifle comes with box, manual, sling, and 3 30-round magazines. If you are interested in ammo and a quality chest rig for it I will throw those in as well for a good price. Contact me with any questions. Asking $800 No low-ball offers please, I am not in a hurry to sell it.  FTF in Colorado Springs preferred but I will travel a reasonable distance for serious buyers. Thanks for looking!"

Action is smooth and bore is clean and shiney. As mentioned, it's been sporterized with a turned down bolt to clear the scope and receiver has been drilled & tapped (these are good things).  It's properly fitted with a brittish 308cal heavy sniper barrel.  The stock is original walnut that's been shortened and has had proper inletting for the heavy barrel.  At some point, someone spent some real money at a gunsmith to modernize it.  Stock is refinished OD green with base coat of rust-oleum industrial black under top coat of rust-oleum camo...tough stuff. Since it has no historical value, being cut down and all, I figured may as well put a useful protective finish on it. It has Leopold scope mount with a generic (but pretty nice) 3-9x40 scope.  I just changed the scope so it'll need to be sighted in again.  Other than that, it shoots great and is ready to go!!  Great for cheap and reliaable hunting or plinking!

One is demilled and the other is not.  Each kit will ship with the following 922r parts in addition to ALL of their FA original parts i.e. bolt/carrier/TG/paddle/sights.  I have gone through each and they are 100% complete not missing any small part as is common in many kits. Both kits have a green and black set of furniture (one kit is missing a butpad for the 2nd set as can be seen in the pics) I expect to see more chopped kits come in but nothing with original hammer forged, foreign assembled barrel assemblies...get this and any other original barreled kit while you can and before the price goes up when o-bamma gets back in.  

922r parts list:
1) JLD Enterprises receiver (now collectors items as PTR-91 inc. bought them out)
2) Trigger
3) Sear
4) Hammer
5) Cocking handle (hk21 style - much easier to grip)
6) American bolt head (unknown manufacturer but marked USA - keep this as a spare) 
7) Thermold 20 round mag (counts as 3 parts)

Total of 9 us parts so have no issue at all with compliance or need to hunt them down.
Ready to send to your builder, or build yourself if you are handy.

Some of the extra furniture is US made and could also count to the 922r compliance as well as the extra flash hider pictured in one of the kits. I also forgot to mention that one carrier is not marked and can be seen in the pics (this is the way I received it).

Each kit must goto a FFL as I wont separate the kits from the receivers.
I take USPS MO or discrete PP via gift option.  Shipping will be exact shipping to you with insurance.
Others here are selling the kits alone for almost what I am asking for one kit with everything above.
No trades at this time as I need the cash.
PP payment due within one day of purchase, MO within Five days of purchase. Thanks for looking and PM me if you have any questions. 
Price is $900 per pkg or $1,750 for both.  These kits are cross posted.

**** Bonus****
If someone takes them both I will toss in a couple of navy lowers and mag pouches as well.

731,http://www.armslist.com/posts/318731,For Sale:  Spencer 1865 carbine - great condition,"Asheville - Fletcher, Asheville, North Carolina","$ 5,000","Listed On: Monday, February 27, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1865 Spencer arms repeating rifle from private collection.

This excerpt taken from the blue book of gun values:
Previous manufacturer located in Boston, MA between 1860-1868. Spencer manufactured approximately 144,000 rimfire rifles and carbines, of which approximately 107,000 were contracted to the United States Government during the Civil War.  
The brainchild of young Christopher Miner Spencer, more than 13,500 Spencer M1860 Army rifles, 800 M1860 Navy rifles, and 48,000 M1860 Army carbines saw action during the Civil War.
In late 1864, the Chief of Ordnance directed modifications, including reducing the bore from .52 to .50 caliber, and shortening the barrel from 22 inches to 20 inches. The new carbine was designated the Spencer M1865 carbine. Nearly 19,000 were produced by the Spencer Repeating Rifle Company, and another 30,500 by the Burnside Rifle Company, although all were delivered too late to see action in the Civil War. Model 1865 carbines and refurbished M1860 carbines became the mainstay of America's troops on the Western Frontier until replaced by ""Trap-Door"" Springfield carbines after 1873.

 This one is in exceptional condition in metal and wood finish as well as bore.  I have a copy showing that the value should be somewhere between $5000-$7000."

The scope and mount are easily removed with one screw or the iron sights are still usable while the scope is mounted. The pistol comes with two factory magazines. I purchased the pistol brand new and before I even shot a single round with it I disassembled the gun for modifications and functional improvements. I've done a ton of work to this gun (too much to remember while writing this ad). The hours spent refining the gun would probably cost you $100 or more at the gunsmith. A few main points from memory:

- Removed 0.020"" from the rear of the underside of the breech to reduce hammer drag

- Polished the extractor

- Radiused and polished the trigger bar ears as well as measuring them with calipers and then fine adjusting them to contact more of the slide

- Leveled the breach block and safety bar to lower the drag

- Re-profiled, squared and polished the hammer tip for smother operation

- Polished the feed ramp for better feeding (especially for hollow point ammo)

Not many AR-15/M4 rifles can be called unique. The modular, cookie-cutter nature of the platform kinda makes them all the same to some extent.
This one is about as original as you'll find, without commissioning a custom rifle from one of the boutique shops, and dropping several grand.
The gun itself is fairly basic internally. It's a Precision Aero lower, branded and sold by Surplus Ammo and Arms out of Washington State.
The upper is Mil-Spec M4 config, made in NC by Timberwolf Tactical.
16"" barrel, 1:9 twist, M4 profile, M4 Feed ramps, A2 flash hider, Flat top with T-Marks.

The photos will give a better feel for the whole package, but here are the highlights:
- Full custom Duracoat finish on upper (including bolt carrier) in Magpul Dark Earth color.
- Full length (12.5"") free floating quad rail with XTM 2-tone covers (plain rubber available if you prefer)
- Magpul MBUS flip up Front/Rear sights in Dark Earth
- Magpul MOE pistol grip, custom Duracoated in FDE (Flat Dark Earth, same as the upper)
- Magpul extended trigger guard, custom Duracoat FDE
- Magpul UBR stock system, custom Duracoat FDE
- Magpul (Genuine OEM) PMAG 20 round mag, custom Duracoat FDE
- Magpul RSA (Rail Sling Adapter) in Dark Earth
- Magpul AFG2 (Angled Foregrip) in Dark Earth
- Custom color fills on the safety selector pictograms. Red for fire, White for safe, HK-style.
- A little minor internal polishing and adjustment to clean up the trigger. Has zero creep and pulls lighter than most stock ARs.
- Polished M4 feed ramps to smooth up chambering under high fire rates.
- The scope and mount shown are NOT included, nor is the Bipod (both go with my varmint air rifle).
Both are for sale, just not included in the price.
- I also have a clone of an Aimpoint T-1 Micro Red Dot sight.
It drops on the rail nicely and looks sleek. I'll sell it for $75 extra.

**NOTE: Everything Magpul is Magpul PTS, unless otherwise specified. That's why it's $1,200 and not $2,000. :)
No PTS parts were used on internals or any parts of fire control.
Basically, it's only the furniture and cosmetic stuff that's PTS.

Not sure what else to say, I've spent MANY hours on this build.
The Duracoat process was by far the most complicated part of the build.
I tore down everything to individual parts, including disassembling the stock and other components, to ensure that everything was fully coated.
The gun was cured for a full 5 weeks before test firing to let the Duracoat harden. I used the new Duracoat SL on this build, which is supposed to be self-lubricating, and therefore more abrasion resistant. I have no idea if it works or not, that's just what Lauer Custom Weaponry (maker of Duracoat) claims.

Email with any additional questions.
Prefer FTF sale, but will ship upon receipt of payment via USPS money order or credit card (+3% charge). Buyer pays shipping and insurance via method of your choice.
Not really looking for trades, unless you have other rifles or handguns of interest. Even then, probably not. I need the money for other projects. :)
Feel free to ask, though. You might have something I really want."

I bought this gun about 6 months ago and I've tons of fun with it.  I didn't plan on selling it but I want something in a larger caliber.  
  It's in better-than-new condition….I’ll explain.  When I got this gun I cleaned/oiled everything and went to shoot it for the first time.  I broke it in with 200 rounds of CCI minimag followed by 100 rounds of Winchester Super X and 100 rounds of Blazer followed by about 30 failed attempts with American Eagle.  I snaked the barrel every 100 rounds.  I was hoping it would shoot the AE but, sadly, I had more misfires than I had fires.  Oh well, the Blazer shoots as well as the MiniMags and it's just as cheap as AE.  When I got it home that night and stripped it there was a small gash in the finish on the side of the bolt-rail (see red arrow below) from several burrs on the bolt caused by the laser cutting of the stainless steel.  It should have been taken care of at the factory but apparently they all go out like that.  I just cleaned up the burrs with fine sandpaper, polished the bolt and it solved the problem.  I was gonna send it back to S&W on warranty for the gash but it's really just superficial and has no effect on performance.  I've put about 2000 rounds through it since then with zero problems.  After polishing the bolt it only took about 2/3 the force to cycle the action which felt kind of gritty from the factory.  I also polished the feed ramp and readjusted/polished the throats of the magazines which makes the rounds feed perfectly.   I've put a lot of care into this gun and you can tell when you shoot it.  It truly is better than new.  
  The M3 model has an upgraded match-grade 6"" barrel (threaded and ready for a silencer) and a two-stage trigger that's fully adjustable for first-stage travel and force of pull.  These two features make this gun super-accurate and a pleasure to shoot.  The trigger stop is also adjustable.  It comes with two 10-round magazines, smooth rails for the top and bottom,  Picatinny rails for the top and bottom ($20) that allow for the use of any optics/laser combination, Tru-Glo sights ($30) and the original steel sights (both fully adjustable), extended European-style magazine release ($20), gun lock, tool kit, a key for the secondary lock and paperwork, all in a very nice foam-lined rugged plastic case.
   This gun is really easy to field-strip as well.  Unlike a Ruger MkIII or Buckmark that may require a hammer and/or engineering degree to take apart, you only have to remove 3 allen head screws to take this bad boy down.  I can strip it and put it back together in only 2 minutes.  
  My price is $375.   If you've done any research at all on these guns, you know you can't get an M1 model for this price after FFL fees and taxes.  Face to face only with valid identification.  You will be required to sign a bill of transfer.  I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have or send better pictures.  Thanks for looking."

I got this in on a trade deal and I would much rather have a remington 700 tactical.


There is absolutely nothing wrong with this rifle,its just a personal preference of mine that I want a remington.

Specs in this rifle are far from stock. The accutrigger was removed and a rifle basix adjustable trigger was installed and is set rather nicely. Crisp pull,pre and post travel stops are set just right.
The bolt was blueprinted and lapped into the receiver.The 20 inch barrel was sent out and professionally fluted,after fluting the barrel and receiver were sent out and cryogenically treated and Cerakoted in OD green. It also has a Leupold 1 piece scope base in the same OD green. It is set in a factory Savage stock. This is a really nice rifle,and shoots extremely well. Im just a remington guy.

Im looking for 1000 bucks.Added up,this rifle is close to around 2000.

The scope and bi-pod are not mine and will NOT be included in deal."
