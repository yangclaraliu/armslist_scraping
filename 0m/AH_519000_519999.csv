(at the time this was the manufacturer of Ziess rifle scopes; in fact, Hensoldt made Ziess' rifle scopes until 2006)
This rifle scope is in amazing condition.  I am not sure as to its age, but it came off of a very beautiful and clean model 54 Winchester with a manufacture date of 1925.  I have been doing a bit of research and very few of this model are still around and those that are have been going for as low as 400 and as high as 900.  This one, I believe to be manufactured in the late 50's.  After WWII, the Ziess company was split between Wetzlar and Jena due to the Wall and all that jazz.  
The optics are incredibly clear.  This scope may be old, but it is as or more clear than my new Leupolds.  The scope has a post with horizontal wire reticle."

Marietta - Ohio - Made in Italy.
For the South is the Spiller and Burr Revolver. One of the rarest Civil War revolvers prized by collectors today. Only 1451 revolvers were actually produced from the 15,000 guns commissioned by the CSA. The barrel is a blued 7"" tapered octagon 1 in 30"" twist.

AAArms began distributing the AP9 in the early 1990s and did so until 2001. The AP9 looks like a small submachinegun, but has no automatic fire function. This firearm is basically a large pistol that looks very much like the Intratec TEC-9. 

The standard AP9 has a 5"" barrel; the AP9 target began with a 12"" barrel (AP-9/12), but this was later reduced to 11"" (AP-9/11 Target); they both have a separate fore end and a fluted barrel. These firearms were banned by most states after the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and other pieces of legislation, even after more cosmetic changes designed to make them appear to be less threatening. After the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 a ten round magazine was introduced. Original magazine capacities included 5 round, 10 round, 20 round and 32 round capacities. 

This firearm has a forward handle, a flash suppressor and recoil compensator as well as a barrel extension.

Also, a old model Ruger Single Six, that was made in 1957. It will come with a nylon holster, and some pachmayr grips. $300 Both of these are priced to sell and priced fairly, so please dont bother low balling me, and offering trades. If you want one of them, and you have the cash to pay my asking price today, then come and get it..  If you're not legally able to purchase firearms in WA, then dont bother.

When I bought it I was told it was unfired. I have never fired it. Been cleaned and stored in climate controlled safe.

I have too many guns (I know, not possible, but wife says so) so this is one that has to go.

I also have a Colt A2 preban roll stamped ""Government Carbine"" that I am asking $1400 for. Might deal if you want both.

676,http://www.armslist.com/posts/519676,For Sale:  Custom High Quality Paracord Gun Slings,"Nanty Glo, Pennsylvania, United States",$ 50,"Listed On: Friday, August 17, 2012",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking for a unique sling for your favorite rifle or shotgun?  Why not try paracord?  Paracord, also known as 550 cord, is parachute cord with a breaking strength of 550lbs.  It is made from nylon materials with 7 inner strands in an outer core.  Total breaking strength is 550lbs, making a sling one of the strongest you'll ever find!  

Why paracord?  Easy - it's lightweight, unique, and is an essential tool for any survival situation.  The woven sling can be unwound to provide 80+ feet of usable 550 cord.  Should you ever get lost in the woods, cordage is handy for creating shelter, snares, tying off wounds, dragging game, or anything you can imagine.  The inner strands can even be separated out for use as fishing line or to sew wounds.  

Our paracord slings are made from authentic 550 paracord from a US military contractor, not that cheap Chinese crap!  Each sling includes swivels and is custom made to your desired length and color combination.  Choose from a wide variety of camo, solid colors, or just about any combination that you can imagine!  

Not only are paracord slings strong, they're also extremely supple and quiet.  The weave is stiff but has ""give"" to be comfortable on the shoulder no matter what you're carrying.  

Each sling is made to your custom order.  Simply reply to this ad with what you would like and we'll get right on it!  Turnaround time is a max of 2 weeks, but most often will be on its way to you in just days.

Great grips, but my only complaint is that there is no on/off switch for the laser grips. The laser is activated by a small sensitive button on the crimp portion of the hand (2nd knuckle from tip of fingers), and there is no on/off selector switch, thus you ultimately fire using the laser every time (of course unless you switch grips constantly). 

However, minus the lack of on/off switch these grips are extremely helpful for dry-fire practice to determine how much you're moving your hand just prior to fire. 

Also, a huge selling point for me was that these grips are low profile on the cylinder side of the gun allowing for easy-in use of speed loaders.

Grips are simple to install and come with a back-up set of batteries and all original packaging.

Located in Chico, CA and would be willing to drive as far as Yuba City, Red Bluff, or equal distance.

From Wikipedia:
The Karabiner Model 1931 (K31) is a magazine-fed, straight-pull bolt-action rifle. It was the standard issue rifle of the Swiss armed forces from 1933 until 1958, though examples remained in service into the 1970s. It has a 6-round removable magazine, and is chambered for the 7.5x55mm Swiss (also known as Gewehrpatrone 1911, GP11, or unofficially 7.5x55mm Schmidt Rubin), a cartridge with ballistic qualities similar to the 7.62x51mm NATO/.308 Winchester cartridge. Each rifle included a 6 round detachable box magazine with matching engraved serial number. A stripper clip loads the magazine from the top of the receiver."

VERY stout pistol, easy to shoot and an excellent CCW piece. I wanted the biggest ""small"" revolver I could find and this fit the bill. This is an older piece, which is good as it doesn't have the stupid integrated lock that the newer guns have. Old school Smith revolver quality. I've owned this gun for almost 20 years. Trigger pull is smooth and lock up is tight. Will include two speedloaders. I have and will include the original huge Houge rubber grips, but I replaced them with the low profile Pachmyr grips seen in the pics to aid in concealment.

It's got right around 100 rounds through it. I really don't want to sell this thing, but I'd like some extra money to help pay for school expenses. 

Like I said, it's got less than 100 rounds through it. It functions perfectly and is a blast to shoot. It will come in the original box, with all factory paperwork as well as the factory magazine. It will come with the Kel Tec sling, was well as the kel tec picatinny rail attachment that goes under the fore end. I've also got a couple of Glock factory 22 round magazines available which work perfectly in this rifle, though those aren't included in the price. 


Possible full or partial trades for a Colt SAA clone of some sort in .357, and/or ammunition in the following calibers: .38 spl, .357 magnum, .40 S&W, 7.62x54r, or .223 rem/5.56 NATO. I'm not interested in steel-cased ammo.
