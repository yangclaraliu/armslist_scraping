It is in excellent mechanical condition.  It locks up extremely tight, like the cylinder is welded kind of tight.  The trigger is smooth and crisp, especially in single action.  The blued finish is in about 95% condition, with a few spots of minor (very minor) pitting.  It has a vintage '80s Hogue Monogrip on it.  It is plastic, as opposed to the newer rubber Hogue grips.  It is very comfortable.  The grip is missing the screw that attaches it, as well as the ""saddle"" part that goes on the bottom of the frame for the screw to screw into.  You can get both parts directly from Hogue for cheap; I called them to see.  Even without the screw holding the grip on, it is a very tight fit on the gun.  It feels like it IS attached with a screw.  You could probably shoot it as it is without the grip shifting, but that is your call.  I am asking $350 for this gun.  Call or text me (text is preferable) at 317-529-seven two nine nine.  Text is preferable, and I can text you more pics of it as well.

I am the original owner, and purchased the rifle this summer. I have exactly 90 rounds through it; zero malfunctions; only factory brass-cased ammo. Zero modifications, this is exactly how it was spec'ed at the factory; it comes with Magpul MOE goodies including hand guard, stock, pistol grip, vertical foregrip, Gen2 rear MBUS, trigger guard and 2x30rd PMAGs.

Includes box and everything that came with the rifle - manual, cleaning rod, brushes, sling. No taxes, no shipping, no FFL transfer fees, and you get a rifle that is nearly new and has been well cared for in the few months I've owned it.

I hate to sell, but I have too much money tied up in firearms and need to trim my collection. Red dot optic (Vortex Strikefire) not included, but if you want it, we can negotiate a price for that.

Ruger Mark III pistols represent the evolution of Ruger .22 LR pistols, continuing the legacy created by the Ruger Standard, Mark I and Mark II pistols and yet incorporating many new engineering refinements. They are simple, rugged, and affordable, making them a great value for any sporting purpose - whether target shooting, plinking or small game hunting.

The Ruger Mark III Hunter includes rigid barrel/receiver connection; automatic bolt-hold-open latch; comfortable, rugged steel grip frame; contoured ejection port; easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears; and rigidly mounted sights for consistent accuracy. Simply stated, Mark III Pistols offer the most versatility and value of any rimfire pistol on the market today.

FEATURES:
- Patented loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded.
- Accurate sighting system features light-gathering HiViz  fiber optic front sight (with six interchangeable LitePipes) , precision-adjustable rear sights and drilled and tapped receiver for Weaver-style scope base adapters (included FREE) for easy mounting of optics.
- Smoothly contoured, comfortable grip features natural pointing grip angle with checkered grip panels providing a non-slip hold. The manual safety and magazine release are conveniently located on the left side of the frame.
- Manual safety positively locks the sear when applied. Also features an unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in the “SAFE” position and allows you to safely secure the firearm when not in use.
- Magazine disconnect prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed.
- Internal cylindrical bolt construction: ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving-slide designs.
- Includes two magazines and hard plastic case.

When you run the lever down to load it's fine. when you go to bring it back, I assume it should cock the hammer it comes just shy of cocking it, IT DOES COCK manually. no issue there, maybe this is modified, maybe something is loose, or needs adjustment, maybe its how it works? I dont know much abot old stuff. has been NCIC checked we can meet at my local police station to sell/trade which I prefer!  but up to you.  well used, seems to be in working order, has correct sights, I know the rear is worth $100+ alone so the gun has some value just in parts. Case color good. stocks worn, less scratched than they look in the pic, but less orange too, they look darker IRL. everything seems to be there.

Here's a classic Savage 24 22lr over 3inch .410. The gun has been around my family as long as I can remember and has probably dispatched more squirrels than most. It's in good condition for being nearly 50 years old and hunted a lot. There are some specs of bluing loss and freckling on the barrels, but the receiver and case hardening look great. It has the side selector as opposed to the trigger-spur selector for the barrels which makes this version more desirable. There is about a half dollar sized patch of missing finish and dent on the left side of the stock. 

It still shoots and functions perfectly, and I managed to collect a couple bushy tails this past weekend in Naugatuck (one with the 410 and another with the 22). 

It's be a great gun for teaching kids with CB's, or for one you sentimental folks looking for a gun you used to have.

Sorry for the pictures being cruddy. I'm not great at this photography thing. 

$375 OBO. I'll travel a reasonable distance. This is way cooler than that goofy looking plastic version they just came out with. Prefer not to trade at this point unless you've got a Remington 600 350 rem mag, Remington Model 8 .35 rem, or Model 71 in .348 (I'd obviously add cash on my end).

The difference in handling between the 18"" and 20"" is almost non existent, also the extra velocity with 2” more barrel helps with the heavier bullets. In fact most people that were shown the rifle thought it had a 18"" barrel! Picture does not represent upgrades.

It shares many parts with the 870 shotgun and the 742 semi-auto rifle.  Should you want to put a long barrel on this, you can use 870 barrel with a gas hole drilled.  This old girl served many years as a truck gun with a pitted receiver.  It has been refinished and while not a beauty queen, is in 100% working order.  As you can see it has a 20” cylinder bore barrel (2 ¾ chamber) with adjustable rifle sites just waiting to meet the deer of your choice.

The barrel is coated, not just the slide.  

•NiB-X offers a unique combination of wear resistance and a low 
•coefficient of friction (superb lubricity).  There are harder surface 
•treatments available (but they have no lubricity) and there are more 
•lubricious coatings (teflon scratches off) but there are no coatings 
•that optimize this combination of performance attributes like NiB-X. 
•The NiB-X process does not affect the part through excessive 
•temperatures like some other technologies you may consider.  And there 
•is no hydrogen embrittlement of the part due to the process.  The 
•maximum process temperature is 195F with an optional post coating 
•precipitation bake to further harden the coating performed at 450F.  All
•temperatures are low enough as to not be detrimental to your parts.
•NiB-X is harder than chrome and has a Rc70 hardness.  This is much 
•harder than Nickel Teflon (~Rc45), and MeloniteTM  (Rc55).  The process 
•temperature for Melonite and other salt bath nitrocarburizing is 1050F 
•and too high for many components.  PVD coatings are harder than NiB-X 
•but are only a couple microns thick and do not have the low coefficient 
•of friction.  NIB-X provides higher reliability operation for longer 
•durations and allows for reduced maintenance and easier clean up.  
•Nickel Boron nitride is essentially electroless nickel with boron 
•nitride mixed in the matrix, very similar to the Nickel Teflon process. 
•Whereas NiB-X is a single coating and structure throughout the 
•thickness, Nickel Teflon and Nickel Boron Nitride are duplex layers with
•a layer of electroless nickel and then a thin layer of EN+Teflon or EN+
•Boron Nitride (.0001”-.0002”).  Once the telfon or boron nitride wears 
•off you are down to only electroless nickel.

Upgrades are,  Carver Customs Magwell,  Stainless polished pin kit,  polished extended forward facing slide stop release, Punisher billet aluminum rear slide cover plate,  stainless extended  slide lock/takedown lever,  17.5 pound recoil spring and stainless Guide rod,  Buffer Technologies Recoil Buffer,  5mm Laser.

The slide was pollished by Glock Polishing. The barrel was fitted to the gun by Hyatt Gun shop. It shoots perfectly, with very good groups. I have included a pic of the last target I shot with it. It was at 25 ft, rapid fire, with my friends 25 round clip.  This gun is lots of fun, and shoots great.  Any Questions, Call me at 704 66eight 377four.

Low wear on the front and mild wear on back tire, bike honestly didn't get used much and has low hour count. Only non factory parts are the gear shift and the handlebar pad. Great bike, but far too small for me nowadays and time to move on.
Only blemish is a small crack around the bolt on the right side *visible in picture* No performance issues.

This revolver has a 6” barrel, adjustable target sights and checkered “diamond” target stocks. The steel is blued and in remarkable condition. The bore of this revolver is bright and the rifling is sharp. Serial number starts with K7615xx. This is an earlier gun, probably produced in the mid 1960’s. Pinned barrel, firing pin on the hammer, the real deal. These are the most accurate revolvers ever made. When firing this revolver in double action everything is butter smooth, lock up is tight, timing is perfect. When shooting single action the trigger is very light with no creep or play. Using light target loads and wadcutters this is an ego booster. It is also the perfect handgun for teaching beginners. I own several of these or this one would be staying with me.

The rifling is sharp. The action on this revolver is as smooth as silk in double action and the trigger is light as a feather in single action. The trigger breaks like a glass rod. Lockup is tight and the timing is correct. The serial number is D3377xx. This pistol is pre-lock, has a hammer mounted firing pin and a pinned barrel. The way things should be! With smooth ramp sights and six rounds of .38 special this old revolver will continue to serve as a glove box gun, outdoor companion or just be a good old plinker. A .38 revolver with light loads is one of the best ways to introduce new shooters to the world of handgunning.

It functions perfectly and is very accurate. This particular gun was built in Germany. It comes with white dot combat sights, original magazines (2), box and papers. According to the box this pistol was manufactured in April of 2001. There is some finish wear on this gun and a scratch or two that can be clearly seen in the photos. There is no rust or pitting. This will make someone a great concealed carry pistol at a very good price.

Below is some good info about the rifle, and if you have ANY questions please feel free to ask. **I would be will to do a partial trade for a top tier 1911 and/or AR**

The Tactical 2 is the most advanced version of the precision rifle developed by Blaser.
Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform
possible. Exceptional accuracy was one of the key principles during development, with
effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more, depending on caliber and
ammunition. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet
of design. The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull
action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking
groove in the barrel – the bolt head is auto-centering and self-headspacing. The straight
pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum
movement. The rifle can easily be converted for left or right hand shooters. Interchange
calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in under a minute, without special tools
and no change in accuracy. Barrels are cold hammer forged, fluted and plasma-nitrided to
provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is
fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting
systems. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake. The receiver is
machined from aircraft grade billet aluminum alloy and is the interface for the barrel, bolt
assembly, trigger assembly and magazine. A recoil lug of hardened steel is integrated
into the receiver. The entire unit is fixed to the stock, eliminating temperature induced
distortion. The outer surface is hard anodized. The ergonomically correct stock is injection
molded out of fiber reinforced polymers and is absolutely stable, even under extreme
temperatures.

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

NEW IN BOX, comes with 2 15-Round Magazines, speed loader, replaceable backstraps, and bore brush.
