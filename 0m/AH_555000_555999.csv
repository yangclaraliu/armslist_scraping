The Smith & Wesson Model 4506 is a third-generation semi-automatic pistol from Smith & Wesson's 4500 series of handguns. The 4506 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge and, with the purchase of special springs, the stronger .45 Super. It is constructed almost entirely from stainless steel and is thus extremely resistant to harsh weather conditions. The 4506 is a traditional double-action/single-action pistol. The first shot is fired in double action mode. Each subsequent shot is fired single action mode. It features one-piece Xenoy wrap-around grips with either a curved or straight back strap. The 4506 was produced from 1988 to 1999.

Like all 3rd generation Smith and Wesson semi automatic pistols, the 4506 features a combination safety lever and decocker mounted on the slide, a plunger type firing pin safety, a magazine disconnect and a pin mounted, pivoting spring actuated external extractor."

The gun has a really low count because i cannot go to the range as much as i would like due to being disabled. It is in amazing shape and modified from head to toe to make it the perfect full size 1911 for everything from self defense to range shooting.I am looking for a compact 1911 thats really light so that i can better carry and won't have as much trouble with due to my medical issues. The gun really is the best gun i've ever had, not only is it extremely accurate it's also modified to cut the recoil in half.

I have done so much to the Mil-Spec 1911A1 that I'm not sure where to start, Heres a few things that have been done to it:
-Skelitonized hammer
-Skelitonized trigger
-Trigger reset
-Custom comp spring
-Parkerized Mil-Spec Black Grip Style Guide Rod
-Parkerized Mil-Spec Black Recoil Spring Plug
-Modified Black Wooden Grips & the original ones
-Magazine Parkerized Catch
-Enhanced Grip Spring
-(2) Specialized Metal Match Mags
-(1) Chip McCormick X-mag 1911 Magazine
It has in my opinion the perfect trigger pull, it's got a really amazing how well the trigger job was done to comp Springfield specifications.
Almost everything From top to bottom has been worked on/replaced with superior enhanced parts or modified to make the best 1911 i could make.

I have had all the work done by Springfield custom shop and by professional gunsmiths. I hate getting rid of it but would like something a bit lighter because I'm disabled and can't carry the full weight of a 1911 anymore. 

If your interested in doing a trade my number is REDACTED feel free to text email or whatever is good for you. 
Thanks for checking out my post and hopefully we can make a deal!

Below dealer's cost.

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol is the most advanced sub-compact sidearm of its kind. Built around Beretta’s latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower.

Available in two calibers (9mm and .40 S&W), the Px4 Storm Sub- Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system.

A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant, perfectly suited for concealment close to active, perspiring bodies. The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable backstraps ncluded). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters.

A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller and larger size button (optional).  An interchangeable slide catch can also be replaced with an optional low-profile configuration.  A standard Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD- 1913) allows for an array of aftermarket accessories.

The TCP offers 6+1 shots of .380 ACP or 8+1 shots with an included extended magazine, durable polymer frame and low-profile fixed sights.

the TCP has a reliable, short, crisp single action/double action trigger pull. No detail was spared in the creation of the feature-laden model including ambidextrous magazine release, unique fish-scale pattern on the slide for positive pull and functioning and generously sized trigger-guard for quick, intuitive access.

 Went to Wal-Mart and ask the mental defict working the sporting goods department for a box of 12ga slugs, he says ""here you are, a box of Remingtons"" and he put the box in a bag and took the payment. I figured the guy knew what he was doing so I did not bother checking the print on the box, but when I got home I realized it was a box of 20ga sluggers not 12ga., I went to take it back to Wal-Mart and they said "" No Returns On Ammo"".

Rifling in barrel is very good, better than 95%, and appears to have been shot very little. I do not know date of manufacture but I bought this to do a build and have consistently shot well within 1"" groups at 100 yards with my own reloaded ammunition. Barreled action has been fiberglass bedded in a laminate thumbhole stock and the barrel has been blasted and duracoated in 'extreme tactical gray' and is fully free floated. I have the original synthetic stock that I can transfer as well. I have also adjusted the trigger pull to around 3 lbs. as I cannot stand the amount of pull the new triggers have in these rifles. It now is one of the smoothest rifles I have shot without upgrading to a timeny, jewel or other trigger system. Having said that, Buyer acknowlegdges that this may void any warranty and assumes all responsibility for care, maintenance and safety of firearm. I have not had an issue nor do I suspect there to be one but in our age, disclaimers evidently need to be put in everywhere.

This gun is almost exactly like what I carried in Afghanistan last year.  I also have a brand new EOTech 512.A65 holographic sight still in the original box with all paperwork---again, this is exactly what Uncle Sam is issuing in Afghanistan right now except that the Government models have Night Vision Goggle capability.

Price for everything is $1200; price of the rifle and everything else without the EOTech is $850.  I am firm on these prices because I was just at the Charleston gun show yesterday and saw what they wanted for this type of gun and how little they will deal right now on ""black guns""---this gun and sight are below new cost but are definitely priced right for the condition they are in.  Open to trades but nothing black powder, older than 50 years unless they are US military or cheap guns.  I will trade this straight for a Colt Gold Cup National Match .45 or equivalent custom gun; interested in older civilian S&W revolvers in good or better condition.  All emails will be answered in the order in which they are received---if you want to trade let me know what you have and the worst I can say is No Thank You!

This was a bit over $200 at Dick's Sporting Goods new.  I purchased it as a field rifle, and inherited a Marlin 39 just a couple days later, so I have no use for this rifle.  This past weekend I got the scope mounted and sighted in, so it is ready to go.  Loves the cheap CCI Blazer ammo, and was more accurate than my friends' Marlin 795 and Marlin 60. 


The picture was taken last week before I mounted the scope.


The only plastic this rifle has in it is the trigger guard; everything else, including the receiver, is good old solid blued steel.  The barrel is full-floated from the factory.  Very nice rifle.

It has the correct ejection port cover, rear aperture, and front sights. The muzzle device is a modern 3 prong from Brownells. 

 The charging handle is an older gray one that has a metallic discoloration to it. It is hard to describe the color. I got it in a box of demilled and rusty parts. It has a black latch because it did not come with one.

 The stock is the late model type with a trapdoor. The buffer tube, buffer, and spring are modern DPMS from MidwayUSA.

The lower receiver is a Tactics re-profiled to a partial fence and refinished. I purchased the lower this way from the EE. The lower parts kit is DPMS, but I have replaced the magazine catch, ping pong paddle, and selector with gray ones from gun shows. The selector does not have a tick mark. The magazine release button, and take down pins are still black. 

The bolt carrier is an older Colt C marked carrier with an MPC marked bolt. The firing pin, cam pin, and cotter pin are DPMS.

The barrel is a C MP C marked A1 barrel, it was on the upper when I bought it. It is a vintage correct barrel with the 1-12 twist rate. The handguards have two busted teeth, however, I have a better set on the way, and will put them on the rifle. I will also include a modern black sling and Colt 20 round magazine from a 6971 accessory package.

I have this posted on another site also, please use email for contact. Any questions please dont hesitate to ask, I will also get better pictures up because these aren't the greatest.

Kit is is great shape and works wonderfully, includes factory papers with shotshell recipes  for up to 2 Oz loads.  I used it until I started shooting more and moved up to a bigger press.  10 gauge is wonderful but shells can be expensive with limited choices available locally--load your own and shoot the size and type shot you want.  Great for older guns which need lead shot.  You can easily and cheaply get 10 Ga wads and hulls online, powders primers and shot are readily available, 10 Ga shells aren't.

LASER DEVICES INTRODUCES BA-6 LASER AIMING DEVICE FOR HK AND WALTHER HANDGUNS
For Immediate Release

Monterey, California, February 4, 2001 -
Laser Devices Inc., (LDI), a leading provider of laser aiming devices and tactical flashlights to law enforcement and military agencies, today introduced the BA-6 , a next generation laser aiming device for HK and Walther handguns. The BA-6, an upgrade to the popular BA-5, features a quick-release slide-on design that allows the handgun to be carried in a standard security holster and quickly attached to the pistol in seconds when needed.

The BA-6, waterproof to 20 meters, fits a variety of pistols including the HK USP, USP Compact, HK 2000 and Walther P99. A red low battery indicator light in the rear of the unit provides the user with 15 minutes of notice that the batteries need to be replaced while a yellow activation indicator light notifies the user that the unit is active. This is an important feature for professional users using an Infrared tip-off filter or an IR laser module with night vision equipment. Installation tools are not required as the BA-6 does not modify the handgun. In addition, LDI has integrated a windage and elevation tool into the body of the BA-6 for fast field alignment while improved switch placement allows additional clearance between the trigger and the switch, making it easy to activate the laser from outside the trigger guard.

The effectiveness of a handgun can be improved with the addition of LDI's waterproof TL-2 tactical light. The TL-2's focusable beam can temporarily blind or disorient an assailant. A 3- or 6-volt (rated at a blinding 95 lumens) TL-2 light can be quickly attached to a factory installed optional accessory rail located on the bottom of the BA-6. Both laser and tactical flashlight are manufactured from 6061T-6 aircraft aluminum and are hard black anodized to MIL-SPEC for rugged durability.

The BA-6 laser, which retails at approximately $387.00, is supplied with a Super Power Point (635nM) diode and an optional Infrared diode (835nM) is available to law enforcement and military units using night vision equipment for covert and low light operations.

No longer in production. Best internet list price I could find for one was $300.00 (none available).... you got a great deal!"

I am the original owner and I've only used it lightly. Its in really nice condition as you can see and it shoots great. Its perfect for when you can't conceal anything larger! It comes with a hard plastic case and two magazines (one original and one aftermarket). I will also send you at least one used holster for it -- two if I can find the other one! The price is $210 (postal money order or cashiers check only) shipped to the FFL in the lower 48 of your choice. The gun will ship after payment has cleared and my FFL and received a copy of your FFL's license. Sale is of course final, so please ask any questions prior to buying.

For local buyers, I've had a past experience selling a firearm locally and privately that wasn't the best in the world, so unfortunately you will have to go through an FFL. You can come to my FFL who is also located in Lake Worth, or I am more than happy to have the weapon shipped to any FFL of your choice. Please keep in mind that if you do not have a concealed permit that Palm Beach County has a waiting period of I believe 5 days, so if you are not close to here, you should pick a FFL close to you to avoid having to make the drive twice. 

I can be reached by email at REDACTED. Please note that this item is listed on gunbroker and more pictures can be found there. It is first come, first serve. 

Thanks!

Lastly, A Rossi .22/.410 combo single shot takedown. Like new, used for about 300 rounds as a training gun for kids and smaller adults. Light wear on stock, but other than that, excellent condition. Again, with all my guns, well kept, well oiled, no rust at all.

The wood has a few blemishes here and there, but the metal is perfect, and the action is smooth.  We didn't hunt that much when I was younger, and my father wasn't much of a hunter anyway, so I guarantee that this gun has not had that many rounds through it.  Email me if you have any questions!  I will post photos this evening!  Thanks for looking!"

The Model XR-100 Rangemaster single shot target rifle (RARE - No longer in production), based on the legendary Remington XP-100™ pistol action, delivers match-grade accuracy at half the cost of a traditional custom target rifle. The single-shot, solid-bottom receiver design of the Model XR-100 Rangemaster produces an extremely rigid and stable action that results in tack-driving accuracy. Matched with a 26-inch hammer-forged varmint-contour barrel with concave target crown, the satin blued barreled action is fitted to a black and gray laminated thumbhole stock. The resin-impregnated stock provides exceptional strength and dimensional stability, and includes a rollover cheekpiece and a beavertail fore-end with lightening-vent cuts under the barrel channel for improved heat dissipation. A first for a Remington production gun, the Model XR-100 Rangemaster is equipped with an externally adjustable Model 40-X™ target trigger. The trigger pull weight can be adjusted from 1 1/2 to 3 1/2-pounds. Swivel studs are also included. MSRP $1,057 Rifle Only"
