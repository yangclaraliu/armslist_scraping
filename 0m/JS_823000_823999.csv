These are going to get really hard to come by with the impending ban; 
Here is your chance to have something with no serial number to register

So here it is:
This is a BULGARIAN AK 74 parts kit with all matching numbers. I have two trigger group systems, one regular G2 and the other is a FULL AUTO. The full auto fire control group is 100% legal and will function as a semi auto only, so long as you don't drill the two holes in the receiver. This is a cool legal loophole if you are into the SHTF preparation. The Bulgarian 74s are much much better quality than the Polish and Russian. I have assembled a few of these over the years and they are easy and very forgiving, just a bit time consuming. Expect 5 to 6 hours of labor on your first time. It is an easy build, just time consuming if you do it right. Also this kit has all of the legal US parts and a new barrel. Most kits that you see online do not have these parts (you end up spending 150+ to get), are usually missing the barrel (100+ as well), and don't have the matching numbers. I am not trying to make money off of this deal, just clearing my project list up. But if you do build this, you can easily sell Bulgarian AK74s for 8-900. Check it out on Gunbroker
There are also about 400 rounds of ammo for it included in the deal. The 5.45x39 is much more fun to shoot in my opinion than the 7.62x39 and is a wicked round"

It also has the flip up rear sight/stationary front sight if your not a scope person. Also has MFT BattleLink Aluminum Quad Rail, bipod mount and 6-36"" adjustable bipod. Has the 6 point adjustable stock and shoulder sling. Also included is the hard case, all paperwork and original hand guards that were on it when purchased.

Now if you didnt want the scope, mount or bipod I will sell for $2400.  With the current status of everything that is soon to come I wouldnt wait around or the prices will just keep going up. I understand that the prices for these have increased lately and that is part of why I am selling her. Keep in mind though that I have about $2000 invested in it at wholesale prices with everything thats included. There are some other toys that I want right now is why I have brought myself to part with her. So on that note one of the toys I am looking for and would do partial trade would be a nice Pistol in 40 Caliber. Glock 23, Sig P239, S&W, Ruger, Colt ect...

It was built by Red Jacket on a correct Nodak Krinkov lower receiver (thicker than standard AK). Comes with hard case. Short Yugo Correct flash horn hider and original M92 trigger group (Tapco G2 installed) 2x 30 round Yugo mags, Yugo cleaning kit, Yugo Military Sling, and mag/ammo pouch.
 This is an original Yugoslavian Military factory Short Barreled AK47 with a 10.5 inch barrel with a 5.5inch spot welded hollow horn style flash hider to make it 16inch legal rifle without having to obtain an SBR stamp first. It can be removed and the original short horn flash hider re-enstalled once you obtain your tax stamp for an SBR weapon. This is truely a collectors AK47 and the absolute rarest of the Yugo factory made Short Barreled AK47 and it's NEW. Look around you will not be able to find one like this anywhere! This is not a cheapo Romainian WASR 10/63 AK or Chineese Norinco made AK crap that people here are asking tripple price for...this is the absolute best AK47 made next to an original Russian made AK!! I had two of them...this is my last one!

*Note* The last picture only shows what it would look like as it was originally made from the factory as an SBR (Short Barreled Rilfe) If you were to buy one already as an SBR you would have to wait 8 months for the stamp before you could even take possession of it! with mine you can buy it now, take possession of it, shoot it, enjoy it, and at your leasure get you tax stamp to make it an SBR if you choose to!

I'll consider a few hundred off the price if buyer throws in an EOTech sight in the deal!

Lets flood this Reps inbox with this letter. Just copy and paste into your email, put your name at the bottom and send. This woman has purposed the Colorado Assault Weapons Ban, This is your chance to do something. It has been written for you and You have full editorial rights. Thank you. 
Email: REDACTED

Dear Rep R. Fields,

I have been closely following your statements and bills in regards to our Gun rights (State Constitution Article II sect. 13) here in Colorado. So here is my rebuttal to the gun issue and I would appreciate it if this would be shared with all of your cohorts in the state legislature, including  Diana DeGette and any other affiliations in the state.

Representative Fields, I do not know if you are aware of this but, when the second amendment was written, the “Assault Weapon” gun of the day was smoothbore flintlock musket, of a large caliber, with a .62 to .75 inch bore and virtually every American owned one. The two variants were the Brown Bess (British) and the Charleyville, a French musket used by the Americans. The government had muskets and so did the people.

The musket used undersized tin (lead of the day) and they had to be reloaded after every shot.

The musket of the 21st century happens to be the M16A1 carbine and in similar variations such as the A2, A3 and M4. So WE THE PEOPLE, HAVE, a natural UNALIENABLE right, not a privileged to keep them.

Where do you think America would be if the British would have had M16A1 carbines with 30 round magazines and our forefathers were left to fight with flintlock single shot muskets? You would be under a British occupation right now.

Just as you and your cohorts are sewing to the people of Colorado, the British Government was attempting to interpose fraudulent British law onto the people who had no desire partaking in the British system. People just wanted to govern themselves and be left alone.

Guns, military or a civilian play an important role in any free society. You and your party’s gun grabbing efforts have made it so evident to the people of Colorado that you are partaking into a collective agenda knowingly or unknowingly.  The mere fact that you will go after gun owners vs. criminals who commit these mass shootings, who are on psychotropic drugs says enough. Yet the drug companies continue to hustle there garbage to every Colorado family, maybe even you’re own.

You will not even politicize a staunch stance on gang violence that has struck poverty stricken areas here in Colorado. Most of those crimes involve guns too. You and your cohorts continually expose yourselves and your congruity to an agenda to the extent that it has become so evident to We The People. Yet your arrogance and egotism continually abnegate the facts pertaining to gun violence put out by our own FBI.

Ma'am, what if our military was sent off to fight the coming war with the Muslim world and we were invaded by Russia or China?  Matter of fact we already have a lot of Russian military here in this state. Do you find it odd that RED China is calling for the confiscation of all our firearms?  Sorry for my political incorrectness but China is a communist country, hence the term “Red China”. They have conficated guns and now treat people as subjugated slaves working in sweat shops because they have no means of protection if they say NO.

Rep. Fields, Did you know that before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Japanese naval General Isoroku Yamamoto was quoted, saying the following;

""You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass."" Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy

That is fact, the Japanese Empire was planning to come in and conquer the entire CONUS. But was deterred because of one general that knew, behind every blade of grass, molecule of air, nook and cranny, Japan would find an American armed with a firearm, whether it be a full automatic Thompson, civilian, police pistol or military type assault weapon; Gen. Yamamoto was sure that WE THE PEOPLE would give the Japanese military an absolute blood bath and quick defeat.

So the fact that you are even alive to this very day and hold the office and titles you have acquired is directly contributed to two facts.  #1 WE THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO let you and #2 the “battlefield type rifles” you are now today at war with, owned by us peasants actually deterred one of the most ruthless military’s on the face of the planet from invading this country.   

Whether the weapons are designed for the battlefield or not Ma'am, it does not matter. Besides didn’t the senate and the rest of your criminal cohorts vote for the NDAA 2012 making the entire planet including the United States a battlefield?

Wouldn’t it be appropriate for you to allow us pesants down here on the plantation to own firearms in the battlefield your cohorts have created? Do you see yourself above your wage payers Rep. Fields?   Don’t you think we need weapons to protect ourselves in the utopian “battlefield” the senate has created in this country?

Ma'am, do you know what communist and fascist regimes do after the confiscation of firearms? They Kill, and Kill, and kill and when they get tired of killing innocent people, they kill some more. Innocent people in mass genocides die because they had no way to protect themselves from a tyrannical group of individuals posing as a legitimate government.   

Recently, Senator Mark Udall visited Afghanistan. Yet he was surrounded by the same type of firearms that you and your party are at war with now. I wonder if he felt safe. See, I too have been deployed multiple times, sometimes disarmed by my own government because they didn’t FEEL the need that we should carry M4’s with us. But regardless of where Udall or I went in the AOR, he was assigned a crack team of body guards carrying the same weapons you want to ban. I am sure with your state police forces, you are also protected by these same guns and high capacity magazines when you go certain places here in this state.   

I challenge you to go with no guns, or maybe a 5 round magazine. What’s that? Oh no response to your and your party’s hypocrisy. That’s what I thought.

What do you plan to tell the men and women of The Watchmen of America and US Border Guard here in this state who volunteer to interdict drugs and stop illegal immigration on the border? They are just civilians, not government, not law enforcement just the people who have somehow, in your mind, stopped ruling over you. What do you plan to tell them when your party takes away their right to repel invasions of the United States?

They are doing what the federal and state levels are failing to do. Your party now wants to make them a criminal because they have assault type SEMI AUTOMATIC rifles with evil high capacity mags used to defend this nation and there precious lives. Yet to complement their bravery and service the federal government gives the same drug cartels they fight, FULLY AUTOMATIC machine guns and explosives. Our own government officials died in the line of duty as well because of this anti-gun agenda your party supports. Yet no one goes to jail, no investigation, no nothing.

What are you going to tell them FIELDS? SENATORS, CONGRESSMEN, BARACK OBAMANATION? ANSWER THAT QUESTION………………. HMMMM Silence.

Are you going to tell them that you don’t give two shits about supporting and defending the Document YOU JUST SWORE AN OATH TO A FREAKING WEEK AGO?  That would be the most honest thing I have heard from a politician in a long time.

I know.... I am a racist now because I don't like the Democrat and Republicon parties. But see, that is the mainstream stereotype poison that kills this nation. The first thing I learned in the military is that my brother or sister bleeds red just as I. So it pains me to see a fellow red blooded American, yes you ma'am, crushing our own strength and GOD given unalienable rights of this nation.

I have never seen more narcissism and lies culminate in one place in this state and in such profusion. What is wrong with you people? Have you no honor? Have you no integrity? Have you no honesty? What about a soul? Do you even have one? None of you have a clue of what it means to serve with the above set of values. All that seems to show are three.

1. GET RE-ELECTED
2. COVER UP MY CORRUPT ACTS, IF IN DOUBT LIE
3. GET RE-ELECTED

I served this nation for seven years. You have dishonored my service and the service of other veterans to this nation. You have dishonored the American people and the people of Colorado. You people make me want to puke.

I declare to you this day (9th) of January, 2013 that I will find the time and dedicate my life to destroying, yes destroying your political career. I will see to it that you NEVER get re-elected to any public office on the face of the planet if you dare touch any issue pertaining to or leading to the decline of gun rights of any American Citizen, Colorado Citizen or State National here in Colorado.

Get your heads out of your asses please.

710,http://www.armslist.com/posts/823710,For Sale/Trade:  Rock Island Armory 1911A1 .45 ACP,"New Tampa/Wesley Chapel, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 600,"Listed On: Thursday, January 10, 2013",Handguns,Rock Island Armory                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Original Stock Description:  This Rock Island is a very nice basic 1911.  It features all steel construction with a 5 inch barrel, GI type sights, parkerized finish, spur hammer, short trigger, flat mainspring housing, wood grips, GI guide Rod and plug, rear only vertical cocking serrations, traditional barrel/bushing set up and 70 series firing system (no firing pin safety).  These guns are inexpensive, but are very well made guns.  Includes hard case and 1 ACT 8 round mag.

I have added to it numerous Stainless parts (mainly Ed Brown) such as complete pins and springs, trigger, extended magazine release, Beavertail and thumb safeties, slide stop, hammer and titanium hammer bar.  Trigger is just about 3.5lbs and she fires beautifully with Ball/FMJ ammo.  As with many .45ACP's, she is sometimes termpermental about eating JHP.  1911's were made to eat ball ammo anyways and if you want one who will eat JHP's all day, go buy a Glock.  All gunsmithing was done professionaly.  

The 1911 comes with all stock/spare pieces and the following:  Also included are eight magazines:  four (4) Colt 7rd blued magazines, one (1) 8rd blued magazine, three (3) Stainless 10rd mags with spacers (shown in pictures), Blackhawk SERPA holster (Both Paddle/belt slide attachments) and a Blackhawk double magazine (single stack) belt slide pouch.  Original grips have been replaced by very nice Rosewood and rubber Pachmayr American Legend grips.  Original wood grips not included but rubber checked grips also included.

I've had a guy email, saying this is a $350 gun and how can I justify the price?  For one, try finding one right now for that.  The ones I've seen are at a minimum $450.  I already listed it's been upgraded with Ed Brown, Kimber and other high quality parts.  It's also coming with 8 mags, a holster, ammo pouch not to mention the gunsmithing to fit those upgrades.  If you're not interested in the price, go try to find one with these upgrades for cheaper.  IF, a high cap magazine ban goes into effect, even 10 rd mags will be going for top dollar.  If you don't remember the last time, a Glock high cap ran close to $100 and since you could only buy guns with 10 rd mags, everyone started buying .45's for the greater stopping power and thus the price of .45's was quite high.  This gun was bought to be a build, I have now a very nice ""Safe Queen"" that I don't need to sell.  If I can get what I want for it or I'll sell, if not, in a few years it'll be worth a lot more.  Your not going to get this much gear anywhere for $600.  Thanks for looking."

Couldn't find any of these for sale on this site to guide me in pricing.  This was to be a Christmas gift for my fiance'  but that has not worked out.  I don't know what this rifle is worth so I guessed.  I will consider any reasonable offer and accept the best offer.  This is a business transaction so if you are outbid, it is what it is.  I only know what the salesman told me about it, so you need to do your own research and make your own informed decision.  I bought it at Sport's Authority.  The salesman said the following things,  it has a gas piston system, it's made out of the same materials which were used on the space shuttle. It is extremely versatile and most parts can be switched out for other pieces for personal customization.  I will be making every effort to comply with Federal and State laws for this transaction.  Thank you for your interests.

update  1/10/12 - I currently have a $4500 offer on this rifle."

BIT OF MOSIN NAGANT HISTORY:



Although the Soviet designed Mosin Nagant M91/30 rifle had served with distinction in The Great Patriotic War, the Soviet high command determined there was a need for a shorter and more handy bolt action service rifle for the Red Army. The savage street by street combat in cities such as Stalingrad clearly showed that a carbine length weapon would better satisfy the needs of the Red Army. While the earlier Model 1938 Carbine seemed to fill this demand, the lack of a bayonet was seen as a grave deficiency in Soviet circles. The Soviet Union was winning the war against Hitler with shear numbers of men and machines coupled with mass of attack. While the concept of soldiers with bayonets advancing in gigantic formations seemed antiquated to the militaries of the West, this philosophy was still a key factor in the Soviet order of battle. A new carbine whose bayonet would reflect this doctrine was deemed in order, and the concept behind the Model 1944 Carbine ( M44 Carbine ) was born.

The gun is great shape mechanically, but it does show cosmetic signs of holster wear and use. There are rub marks on the slide, though the black nitron finish is intact, and there is significant rubbing on the exposed portion of the barrel where it makes contact with the slide (as any semi-auto is wont to do). The frame is blued, and has an inky look in the photos, but I find under most lighting conditions the gun is entirely black. This is not the SAS package, nor does the gun have night sights."
