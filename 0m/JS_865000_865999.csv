This Sub2000 is in great condition and has only had 100-150 rounds through it - ran perfectly for me. Comes with standard Glock 17 9mm 10 rd magazine that it came with, along with original box and original polymer forend.  

If you are reading this listing, you probably know that these are very hard to find, let alone in hard chrome and with this great setup. I have seen barebones stock sub2000s on Gunbroker going for over $1000 by themselves without any of the add ons I am offering. Take advantage of this opportunity to grab a great carbine that is in like new condition!

I was having an issue resizing the pictures - so could only include one - let me know if you would like to see more as I took several. The pic I included showed as much detail as possible in a small area so you can get a good look at the add-ons etc.

Feel free to email me for any questions. Thanks!

I will ship for a flat fee of $30. Will take payment via Paypal (add 3% to purchase price).

Beretta Cx4 Storm .40 S&W Carbine/Patrol Rifle
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.

This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.

A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 

This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol.

Don't miss your chance to get an assault rifle and high capacity mags before Obama bans them (he signed executive orders and outlined his plan to ban assault weapons and high cap mags today). There isn't much time left so don't hesitate!

Please call or text Joe at REDACTED

Please note that this may require some modification on some clones and models. I have it installed on a Taurus PT1911 and although it is a tight fit it does work and looks really good. Please don't bid if you are unwilling to modify this if need be. It is a very tight fit.

This is a brand new muzzle brake which will fit colt 1911 model pistols and most 1911 clones. It replaces the barrel bushing and usually installs in less than a minute. This design is contoured to mimic the front of the slide, and give the appearance of having an extended slide.

This is made to work with full size 1911 models. It is a little tight but does work

The short slide 1911 pistols such as the commander series, will require that the comp be modified to fit. This involves trimming down the bushing section of the comp to match the length of the original barrel bushing.

This design will work with a full length guide rod.

These may require some fitting depending on your barrel and slide combination. But should fit right onto a stock configured gun.

Please note before ordering:

The bushing ID. Is .583"" +-.0005"". In general they will fit any 1911 clone pistol that has a barrel OD. between .577""-581"".

Also this comp will not work on Commander short length 1911's unless it is fitted. This involves trimming down the length of the bushing section of the comp, to match the length of the original barrel bushing."

The lower started life as a DMR build, and it has a professionally installed 2lb match trigger that helped it deliver sub-MOA groupings. It is NOT one of the cheaper ""sporter"" lowers, but rather a higher quality one. The upper is a 14.5"" CMMG with a pinned YHM flash hider. Here are the specs on the rifle:

- 2 lb match trigger
- Extended UTG quad rail
- UTG red/green dot optic
- Magpul XTM rail covers on the entire rail
- Magpul AFG
- YHM Phantom flash hider
- Infidel/American Flag dust cover

Here are the items included with the rifle:

- 4 black windowed PMAGs
- 3 FDE PMAGs
- 2 OD PMAGs
- 2 black Gen M3 PMAGs (yes, the newest ones that are impossible to find)
- 1 metal 20 round mag
- 3 additional XTM rail covers
- Extra finger slot for the Magpul AFG
- CMMG double heat shield handguard
- Dust covers for all PMAGs
- Lower parts repair kit

***Included are 650 rounds of .223 ammo (560 rounds of PMC brass cased and 90 rounds Tula steel cased). The mags are loaded, and the remaining rounds are pictured.

A ban of some sort is coming in the near future, so don't miss out on your chance to own an AR-15 complete with mags and ammo!

Feel free to send me a reasonable cash offer. The mags and ammo alone are worth over $1000 in the current market, so bear that in mind--this is quite a deal! The only trades I would consider are a Springfield Armory M1A, a very nice Remington 700 in .308, or a Hammond B3 organ (yes, I know I changed gears quickly there haha). I am willing to ship, but that of course would have to go through an FFL. My email doesn't send properly, so you can reach me at (8six5-7sixsix-7fivefivefive). Text is preferred. If you must email me, please include a contact number so that I can reach you back. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or if you want more pics of the rifle/accessories--I will reply to texts almost instantly. NO bill of sale required! I don't sign them, nor do I expect you to. Thanks for looking and God bless!"

Instead of a firestorm, President Barack Obama’s gun policy executive orders little more than a fizzle among gun advocates.

For days leading up to the announcement, conservative websites and media outlets stoked fears of what Obama was planning to do unilaterally.

This gun was made to imitate the M1 carbine. Sort of like some of the Rugers do (44 carbine and 10-22) except this one's magazine sort of imitates it also plus it has the sling and cleaning kit just like the M1 .30 Carbine does. Mounted is a Tasco 3-7x20 scope. Real neat gun, very accurate and a lot of fun. Very collectible plinker and I have 3 hi-cap magazines. Great condition on the bluing but the wood does have some handling marks and a few light scratches. These sell on gunbroker scopeless for $300 for the gun in similar condition. That is before shipping and transfer fee. The magazines sell for $50 a piece. This is a great price on a great rifle. Made in West Germany, the home of fine engineering.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected.

Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item."

I have quite a few 30 rd PMAGS (non window) black...

I really would like to add some ammo to my collection.

I need .223 .... 7.62 ..... 40 cal....... 9mm

Now, Im willing to be reasonable on values. PMAGS normally go for $12 - $20
Most are asking $40 - $75 now a days!!!!

If you are willing to price your ammo right, I'll price my mags right. I am well versed on ammo prices, both before and after the big O screwed things up 

Here is my reference guide for normal ammo prices. (S) = steel and (B) = brass
.223 = .20/.25 per rd (S) to .35/.40 per rd (B)
7.62 = .20 to .25 per rd (prefer S)
9mm = .20/.22 per rd (S) to .25/.27 per rd (B)
.40cal = .26/.27 per rd (S) to .30/.33 per rd (B)

It has been my winter project and is in great shape. The tires are pretty decent and the battery is from June. The fork seals don't leak, the carbs are clean, and all the lights work. The only issues I'm aware of are that the wires to the horn are severed, and I think it is leaking a little oil from the pan. The exhaust is stock minus the baffles so it is loud and throaty. It also takes a bit longer to warm up when its cold out. It has about 25000 miles and I have the clear title in my name. I'd like to sell or trade or partial trade. I would like a 9mm handgun, .40 handgun, or .357 mag revolver.  I would also like a 12 gauge pump shotgun. Let me know what you have. My price is flexible since I'm trying to sell a bike in the middle of the winter, but NADA values it from 1500-1800 dollars. I also have a medium Icon Carbon Airframe helmet that can go with if it will fit you."
