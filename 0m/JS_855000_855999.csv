If you have USAA we can meet there and you can do a direct transfer for free to my account. I will need to see your Texas Drivers License or CHL. If we are meeting face to face you do not need to email me anything.

Using our own equipment to perfect our techniques, we live by the quality product we offer by using it in our own firearms. We offer something that is made for and produced by the serious shooter.

Nickel Boron has been receiving a lot of positive attention in the firearms community for many reasons. Firstly, it provides your guns parts with a finish that is highly resistant to corrosion. You will no longer have to worry about moisture causing rust on your firearm parts. It is also very resistant to wear, which is extremely important when working with parts that are constantly in motion. Lastly, Nickel Boron plating is self lubricating. You no longer have to worry about adding excessive amounts of oil which collects carbon residue and debris which can cause your firearm to malfunction. This cuts down on maintenance and cleaning requirements.

-----------------------------------

Up for sale is a 5.56mm AR-15 bolt assembly that has been plated in Nickle Boron.  This is a new, never fired bolt.  The ejector and extractor pin have not been plated in Nickel Boron, as this particular bolt served as a sample/T&E piece.

This one has a 20"" medium barrel with compensator for improved accuracy and optimum feet per second of the projectile. I have never shot this gun. When it was sold to me they said they had put around 50 rounds through it. My FFL inspected it and found no wear at all, gun is like NEW! One of the best deals in the area. I'll throw in 10 round magazine and a box of 20 hard to find ammo! My cell REDACTED. Thanks!"

The Good: This is a powerful battle rifle in .308 made by Polytech.  If you do your homework, you will see that most Polytech's are very good with some lemons.  Well this one is rock solid.  It is recently checked out by a gunsmith.  A friend (who is a former Navy guy trained on M14s) and I just sent a bunch of rounds down range with tight groups.  Chrome lined barrel, clean action - this is a great gun.  I hate to sell and will have sellers remorse until I reinvest money in a full auto Class 3 toy I have my eye on.

The Bad: No, you are not going to go to Camp Perry and win the 1000 yard service rifle competition this August with this rifle. You will need a $4,000+ rifle and the time and money for lots of practice for that. 

NOTE:  I do not sell junk.  I have a 3 day policy on returns for cause.  (i.e. not because your wife just said no, but if something is wrong with the rifle that I did not know about I'll refund or make it right - my reputation is more important than any sale.)
About the Seller: I am a licensed attorney and longtime advocate of gun rights. We have a right from God to self-defense. The Constitution of the United States and that of Ohio provides political protection and recognition of these rights. The second amendment has nothing to do with hunting; it is there to protect us from the number 1 mass murderer in all of history - tyrannical government. Thus, every responsible family leader really should have at least one decent military rifle. 

Terms of sale: All transactions will take place face to face in my law office in Delaware, Ohio. You must be a resident of Ohio and not have any prohibition limiting your ability to purchase and own this rifle. Valid driver's license is required, valid Concealed Carry license preferred. I do not make copies of this information as I will respect your privacy. Credit Card transactions are subject to a 3% additional charge (this is a pass along cost)."

More pictures of this gun can be seen here:  

http://imgur.com/a/v7Utc

HISTORY

I bought this AR15 many years ago from a local police officer who stated he was a member of SWAT team in Alabama years before I met him.  It was his ""secondary gun"" as he used his shotgun or handgun as his primary weapon for close quarters combat.  He said this gun was strapped across his back for easy access.  It does have a nylon sling that goes with it that looks like type of sling a person would use to put the gun out of the way across their back.

He stated that his police department in Alabama contracted a military armorer to assemble these guns in the very late 1980's.  He was able to buy this gun for his personal use when he left the department.

This AR15 is compromised of a PWA lower, Olympic Arms upper in 45 ACP, and 3 UZI adapted magazines for an AR15 system. 

LOWER

The PWA ""Commando"" lower has only a 4 digit serial number and original PREBAN.  These low serial number PWA PREBAN lowers have been going for $1,000+ as Gunbroker prices denote. I read somewhere the company that made the lowers for PWA is Lewis Machine & Tool ( LMT ) and are the contact company today. 

UPPER

The 45 ACP Olympic upper is very hard to find as those have not been made in many years. This upper alone goes for over $1,000 with just 1 of these original special plate welded magazines.

MAGAZINES

The 3 special magazines are that of the older UZI brand with the welded plate.  These were discontinued many years ago.  These very rare HEAVY DUTY magazines were designed for AR15's with 45 ACP uppers.  These magazines (if you can even find one) alone were going for $125-$150 EACH a few months ago even before the prices drastically rose.  Again, these are very hard to find even ONE...and I have THREE!

FOREARM

You can see the officer mounted a Weaver rail on top of the forend.  He told me this was so he could attach a red dot scope to it.  And on the left lower side in the front is another Weaver rail.  He also told me that was for an attached flashlight.

MISC NOTES

This setup (The Upper, the Lower, and Magazines) would have went well over 
$1,900 a few months ago even before prices rose.  You just don't see one of these special AR15's show up very often with these same 1994 original PREBAN components.

I have not shot this, it's been sitting in storage for years.  Was getting around to using it, but more pressing bills force me to sell it. 

The trigger feels really nice, but could not tell you what make\model it is, nor do I want to take this apart to find out.

It comes with a very nice case that holds the 3 magazines...and also a sling that does 
not show in the pictures, but can take a picture if needed.

PRICE and TERMS

$1,900 plus shipping.

I live in West Michigan in case you want to do a FTF.

If you live in Michigan and need it shipped, I can mail it to you WITHOUT an FFL transfer.  You just pay shipping and insurance.  And I would be willing to drive within a few hours of say Grand Rapids if you say Paypal me the fuel money in advance...so I don't get stuck with the fuel bill and lost time for a no show...fair?

If you live in another state, I will ONLY mail to your FFL and WILL NOT mail to a state 
that does not accept these components...please know your laws and do not waste 
both our times with erroneous information.  Again, you pay shipping and insurance.

If any questions...please email me.

Thanks!"

These Wiley X goggles feature ballistic, anti-fog lenses that can be changed in seconds when weather or activity dictates. Wiley-X SG-1 Interchangeable Lens Goggles/Sunglasses are one of our top selling combinations of tactical goggles and sunglasses serving tough military duty, but they are also very popular as motorcycle goggles, protecting bikers from coast to coast! Unique Ultra-Foam on these Wiley X sunglasses seals the eye orbits, providing protection from extreme changes in body temperature or weather temperature. Wiley X has built the temples of these tactical goggles to disengage with a push of a button; what's more, the temples can be replaced with a snap loaded elastic headband. WileyX SG-1 UV Goggles combine wind-protected fashion with ballistic-safe function.
Wiley X SG-1 Goggle Interchangeable Lens System easily converts from ballistic eyewear to a pair of tactical goggles with a set of interchangeable lenses, one Clear and one with Smoke finish. Wiley X SG1 Sunglasses' tinted lenses offer 100% UV protection, while the clear lens can be used in conjunction with night vision, weapon sights, and high-speed activities like riding a motorcycle. These WileyX interchangeable eyewear meet and exceed ANSI Z87.1 safety standards, ANSI Z80.3 optical standards, Mil. Spec. MIL-STD-662 for fragmentation, and most other standards and requirements for tactical goggles and ballistic eyewear, so you can be sure you're safe with Wiley X SG 1 Removable Lens Tactical Goggles."
