The SAR series of rifles is well known through the gun community as being one of the only AK-47 rifles imported into the United States on an original military specification receiver. They are known for excellent quality and extreme reliability (unlike the current Romanian WASR rifles) Almost all other AK 47 rifles in the country were either built here using other countries parts or imported as low capacity rifles and then drilled out for full magazines here in the States. Not so with the SAR rifles, they were built as they are in the country that makes them for their military. The SAR-1 is a fantastic weapon, combining the durability and ruggedness of the AK-47 with the lightweight ammo and accuracy of the American 7.62x39 round. Not only do you have a weapon that just won't stop, but you have an ammo supply of one of America's favorite calibers to keep the weapon fed in the event of foreign ammo shortages.

When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The separate bolt carrier/slide has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder; when the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The bolt carrier rides rearward on two rails on either side of the barrel, operating the mechanism. Its rotating bolt strongly resembles that of the M16 series of rifles, while the fixed gas cylinder/moving piston resemble those of the Ruger Mini-14 carbine (the original patent used a captive piston similar to the M14 rifle).The advantage of the gas operation is that it allows the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. Thus it allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by magnum revolvers. Downsides of the gas-operated mechanism are the large size of the Desert Eagle, and the fact that it discourages the use of unjacketed lead bullets, as lead particles sheared off during firing could clog the gas release tap, preventing proper function. Switching a Desert Eagle to another chambering requires only that the correct barrel, bolt assembly, and magazine be installed. Thus, a conversion to fire the other cartridges can be quickly accomplished. The rim diameter of the .50 AE (Action Express) is the same as the .44 Remington Magnum cartridge, consequently only a barrel and magazine change is required to convert a .44 Desert Eagle to the larger, more powerful .50 AE round.The most popular barrel length is 6 in (152 mm), although a 10 in (254 mm) barrel is available. The Mark XIX barrels are machined with integral scope mounting bases, simplifying the process of adding a pistol scope.

The Desert Eagle is fed with a detachable magazine. Magazine capacity is 9 rounds in .357 Magnum, 8 rounds in .44 Magnum, and 7 rounds in .50 Action Express. The Desert Eagle's barrel features polygonal rifling. The pistol is primarily used for hunting, target shooting, and silhouette shooting"

Great for Cowboy action shooting or general home defense. Short and manuverable. Black Maple stock. Beautiful condition

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Good bore and very little usage on the gun it is in excellent shape. It's been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special, I will assume you are a fucking retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

6 shot .22 Long / long rifle, 5 1/2"" Barrel, Excellent bore. Aout 96% Original Blue Showing virtually no wear with only a few cylinder drag marks and a small holster wear spot at the end of the ejection rod tube. Action works excellent (both single and double action) The serial number puts the gun at about a 1959 manufacture. Very shootable and very accurate. Put some CB caps in this and be real quiet, LOL. Come to me and I will even throw in a hard case.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Good bore and very little usage on the gun it is in excellent shape. It's been in the safe for many years only to be pulled for cleaning and inspection.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.
Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special, I will assume you are a fucking retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

The LCR-357 double action only is the latest addition to the LCR family of revolvers, chambering the powerful .357 Magnum in a compact, five shot revolver that weighs only 17 1/4 ounces. Although the same size as the original LCR chambered for .38 Special +P, the LCR-357's new blackened stainless steel frame easily handles full power .357 magnum loads. Its weight effectively tames recoil when coupled withe LCR's patented recoil-absorbing polymer fire control housing and Hogue cushioned Monogrip.

DISINTEGRATOR®
 No one equips you for perfect practice like Remington, which is why we’re the top choice for government agencies everywhere – in the field and on the range. Disintegrator lead free frangible ammunition is a technological breakthrough in bullet construction that offers totally lead free, no-ricochet performance, with point of impact and felt recoil equivalent to standard lead core pistol ammunition. In accuracy performance, it is as good or better than the best duty ammo. Disintegrator frangible bullets feature a high strength compaction formed core, completely sealed in a jacket of electroplated copper. The metal powder core construction creates a bullet that easily withstands the forces and pressures of firing, while providing instant and complete frangibility against hard surfaces. The copper plating on Disintegrator bullets provide a smooth ductile jacket that enhances feed and function in all autoloading pistols, minimizes bore fouling, and virtually eliminates barrel erosion. Only 0.005” thick, it is enough for rifling engraving, but too thin to ricochet. Disintegrator bullets are made of compressed metal particles shaped into standard profile 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP specifications. Disintegrator core is completely protected with hard copper plate. Manufacturing process produces highly concentric core for excellent accuracy."

This is one of the nicest and best quality ARs you can buy. And to get a new, unfired one is very rare. You get to break it in properly and have a weapon you know you can count on because nobody else has ever used it! And it's new in the box so no matter what assault weapons ban comes, this is a true pre-ban original!!

This is the original AR platform - the CAR 15
Here is the full info:

Here is a link to one that sold recently with the long barrel which is much more common:

http://www.gunsamerica.com/921536447/Olympic_CAR_15_pre_ban_Pristine_condition.htm

This is a brand new, never fired classic. When these were being made in the late 80's they were by far one of the best quality AR on the market. They are not made to this quality nowadays. Ive decided there are some other toys I want more than this one so Im selling it. Its been stored now for over 20 years! 
The serial number is V followed by 4 digits. You can confirm the manufacture date on Oly Arms website ""What does my serial number mean"" webpage. 

This has the impossible to find 11.5 barrel with 5.5 permanently attached supressor making it meet the 16"" barrel length requirement. This is an extremely rare rifle!

This has the highly desired SS 1 in 7"" barrel like our soldiers use and chromed bore and chamber for optimum performance and durability. It still all stock with the original box and accessories. 



Im taking cash and trade offers. 
From my research these seem to start at about 2K for a pre-ban 80's model, never fired. And it's almost impossible to find one with the 11.5"" barrel. I'm not looking to get every last dollar on this but I'd take the lower end of what these appear to be bringing. 

I also have about AR mags and I can include as many as you want for the right price. See my other listings. 

Im located basically on the DE/PA/MD border. I prefer FTF sale but can do shipping to FFL.

I have sold several rifles from me personal colection and can email you the previous listings and contact info for the buyers who I have shipped to. 
Beware of the really low prices - if its too good to be true, it probably is.

The serial number is V followed by 4 digits. You can confirm the manufacture date on Oly Arms website ""What does my serial number mean"" webpage. 

This has the impossible to find 12"" barrel! 
This has the highly desired SS 1 in 7"" barrel like our soldiers use and chromed bore and chamber for optimum performance and durability. It still all stock with the original box and accessories. 

This is one of the nicest and best quality ARs you can buy. And to get a new, unfired one is very rare. 

Im taking cash and trade offers. 
From my research on armslist and gunbroker these seem to start at about 2K for a pre-ban 80's model, never fired. And it's almost impossible to find one with the 12"" barrel. I'm not looking to get every last dollar on this but I'd take the lower end of what these appear to be bringing.

The serial number is V followed by 4 digits. You can confirm the manufacture date on Oly Arms website ""What does my serial number mean"" webpage.

This has the highly desired SS 1 in 7"" barrel like our soldiers use and chromed bore and chamber for optimum performance and durability. It still all stock with the original box and accessories. 

This is one of the nicest and best quality ARs you can buy. And to get a new, unfired one is very rare. 

Im taking cash and trade offers. 

From my research on armslist and gunbroker these seem to start at about 2K for a pre-ban 80's model, never fired. And it's almost impossible to find one with the 12"" barrel. I'm not looking to get every last dollar on this but I'd take the lower end of what these appear to be bringing.

Gently used DPMS-LR-308. Recently acquired from State Trooper in KC area. Pictures tell great story below. Gun and accessories in great condition.
Included in this package are:
1.	DPMS .308 LR AR
2.	Acog 5.5 X 50 Scope Dual Illuminated Chevron .308 Ballistic Reticle, Red. This scope is already sighted in at 100, 200 and 300 yard marks. This is the top of the line scope. Gently used with a few slight surface scratches under the front on plastic casing. This scope sells for $1,769 new on Amazon. Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/Scope-Illuminated-Chevron-Ballistic-Reticle/dp/B000ZNDV2G/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=REDACTED&sr=8-2&keywords=trijicon+5.5x50
3.	There are two mounts. A Trijicon mount and a LaRue 4XDOS mount. Both sell for $135 each on Amazon.
4.	Clips: There are two (2) factory 20 round clips and one (1) factory 10 round clip included.
5.	There is the factory rifle cleaning kit
6.	Instruction manual for rifle and scope.
7.              Hard Case for rifle and extra mags and field cleaning kit
8.	AMMO! I am including in this initial package: 
          a.	100 Rounds of Hornady .308 165 grain Hollow Point ammunition (5) Boxes of 20 rounds 
          b.	100 Rounds of American Eagle .308 150 grain Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) ammunition (5) Boxes of 20 rounds 

I have additional magazines, new and used, and more ammo for additional sale. This is a great lot for a rifle that will surely be complicated to get in the future. I am a CCW holder and insist on doing a simple paper of transfer. We can also do formal FFL transfer if you like.

I live in Arnold. I’ll consider partial trades for Walther PPQ or PPS only.

We all know what these items are selling on GunBroker for:
.308 is selling for about $1400 to $1600
Scope is worth easy $1500 to $1800 used (includes both mounts)
Three clips are worth $200 plus
200 rounds of ammo is worth $200 plus
I’m selling for cash. I’m not giving it away. Please don’t low ball me. I’d rather not put on GunBroker and rather offer to local resident of Missouri. This lot is worth approximately $4,000

I’ll entertain any offer in the $3,000 range. Trades considered, if they’re Walther PPQ or PPS type.

I also have additional mags and ammo for this unit that can be negotiated as well or I’ll keep them."

I am thinning the collection down after years of accumulating. If a trade is offered it would have to be something very desirable and I could not live without, as well as in my favor. Not trying to be a horses rear, but downsizing does not mean adding lol. FTF transfers with ccw holders in Mo only. If you do not have a ccw we can meet at a dealer to do the transaction."

I went ahead and listed before complete because it looks like there may be some type of executive bill signed to regulate sales and it will be a lot easier to give you a handguard when it comes in opposed to transferring a rifle. I m also concerned once it is that Armslist may go away too.
I have an expected delivery day of the OD MOE handguard and forearm grip of the 23-25th. I received confirmation they shipped yesterday."

This is a great kit. Lets you shoot for cheap with the same Glock you carry so you build muscle memory. The threaded muzzle lets you put a suppressor on it.  Get it while you can! 

The TSG-22² quickly and easily converts any generation of the Glock models 17, 22, 19, and 23 into a .22LR pistol. Machined from a solid piece of heat treated 4140 steel, the TSG-22² maintains a similar weight and feel to your factory Glock allowing realistic shooting and training.

A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 ²fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

As with our other conversions, the savings on ammunition will make you glad you made the switch. Options such as a threaded barrel make attaching your favorite accessories a snap.

Unmatched performance, design, and usability make the TSG-22² the best gift for the most popular of
pistols.

Heat treated 4140 steel slide with Nitride surface treatment for optimum strength, increased corrosion resistance and increased wear resistance.
The TSG-22² 17/22 easily fits all generations of the following Glock® models: 17, 22, 34, 35, & 37 and the TSG-22² 19/23 easily fits all generations of the following Glock® models: 19, 23, 32& 38 with no gunsmithing required.

Only reason for sale is I have another and purchased a different type of target.  Target has been shot with .22LR.  These are made of AR500 steel and built to last a lifetime.  .22LR will not damage this target.  I've shot it with 9mm, and no damage to target.  This target is not meant for higher caliber rounds as the plates are too light and will shift if hit with greater than .22.  Good to know it can take it, though.  

Anyways, these trees are $185+ shipped to IL if purchased through AT.

Price is $140.  This will last a lifetime, unlike the garbage most stores sell for rimfire practice that lasts maybe one session.  A great target and instant feedback.  If I didn't have a duplicate I wouldn't be selling.  Great to train your kids, or as I do, .22LR practice to mirror my larger caliber guns."

Item Description

A New Perspective on the Automatic Rifle: The B.E.A.R.™ combines design innovation and precision manufacturing built upon the tried and true M4/M16 rifle platform. The Adcor Defense B.E.A.R.™ springs from the M4/M16 rifle platform but offers a completely new twist. Available in many configurations, it offers the operator many significant improvements:

A Revolutionary Gas Piston System (Patent # REDACTED8)

Free-floating barrel and increased accuracy: A gas-driven piston incorporated into the upper half of the forward rail system never touches the barrel.
No carrier tilt: The operating rod is connected to the bolt carrier by hex head bolts reinforced with industrial grade Loctite® 262™ high strength threadlocker. They are then drilled and pinned to prevent loosening under adverse conditions. The operating rod then rides through a machined boss in the receiver rail system interface keeping the bolt carrier in a linear plane as it operates.

No fouling of chamber and action: Hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver. Because heat reaching the upper receiver is diminished, lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified.

Easily detached lower rail system: No special tools needed for quick cleaning and easy maintenance.

Wear on critical parts is minimized: The operator can easily adjust the piston’s cyclical rate for a controlled rate of fire.

No need for piston rings: Extremely close machine tolerances of the piston eliminate the need.

Exclusive Port Dust Wiper with Cover

Prevents entry of dust, sand or debris: The spring-loaded dust shield mounted on the bolt carrier allows the bolt carrier’s return to ready position; the port dust wiper moves into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver.

Withstands temperature extremes: because of the highly durable, self-lubricating polymer shield.

Ambidextrous Forward Placed Charging Handle: Simplicity is Beautiful.

Simple design: allows the operator to keep his or her strong hand on the firearm and use the other hand to clear the rifle.

Ambidextrous handle: detaches easily without special tools and returns to locked position once used. It folds forward, recessed, and easily swings back out in a single motion.

Non-reciprocating handle: only engages when the operator charges or clears.

Rail System ( 7075-T6 )

Innovative, key locked, highly rigid rail system mounts seamlessly to the upper receiver: Design ensures proper alignment of the rail with a redesigned boss, spline and groove system.

Upper and lower rail guards separate with the push of a button: No special tools necessary.

Fully compatible: with optical, image intensification or thermal sights; laser targeting systems; bipods; tactical lights and Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES).

I went ahead and listed before complete because it looks like there may be some type of executive bill signed to regulate sales and it will be a lot easier to give you a handguard when it comes in opposed to transferring a rifle. I m also concerned once it is that Armslist may go away too.
I have an expected delivery day of the OD MOE handguard and forearm grip of the 23-25th. I received confirmation they shipped yesterday."

PA law says this can be sold with license and bill of sale, but I would prefer it went through an FFL for my own peace of mind and the paper trail.  If I get close to my ask price, I'll cover the FFL transfer fee.

Here are pics of the upper.  I'll get pics of the lower when I can.

Notes:
Better hurry! any hi-cap(>10rds) magazine capable pistols are getting scarce due to the possible ban soon. all hi cap mags are gone. pretty soon it will be the hi-cap capable semi-auto pistols that will disappear. Don't wait and be the last to realize what is about to happen in the firearm community. Also, it's hard to find a Sig Sauer 9mm now. this is the best carry weapon IMHO...also read reviews and info stating that P228 is the best pistol ever made by Sig Sauer. the P228 is not ""no longer in production"". it is just produced in limited quantity batches now but not available to civilians which makes this a semi-collectible item. (no calls) text or email first then we'll talk... serious inquiries only pls. Don't waste time before i change my mind and decide to keep this valuable piece of priceless metal. 

TOP 5 REASONS WHY THE SIG SAUER P228/M11 IS THE BEST 9MM AROUND:
1. QUALITY IS BETTER THAN THE P229 AND M11A1 AND POST-2005 P228
2. ITS BASICALLY A SHORTER P226(THE SEALS CHOSE THE P226 FOR A REASON)
3. IT'S NO LONGER IN PRODUCTION(ACTUAL P228)
4. NAVAL AVIATORS AND USAF PILOTS USE THE P228/M11 OVER THE M9
5. HIGH CAP MAG CAPABLE e.g. 13rds, 15rds, 17rds, 18rds, 20rds
