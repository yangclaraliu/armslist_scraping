Accepts Glock 32 round mags. Comes with Blue Force sight w/ rail, laser, and 1 ten round mag.  I realize this is an inflated price tag however this is exactly what I paid for it. I ordered a Mech Tech unit months ago and just recieved it so I don't really need two 9mm carbines. I am not interested in trading for any other rifles as I have plenty. Buyer must be legal to own a firearm and would need to see a Washington ID.  Pick up in Tacoma.

Folds completely in half. The sight rail system is designed for the Kel Tec so that it can fold and lock.  Also comes with a bolt tube cover and nylon carry case. Low round count. You get about 200 or so fps in velocity out of the 9mm with the SUB 2000. + higher stopping power. So with a rifle that you can fit in your backpack, laptop case, and in the front pocket of most suitcases you probably one of the best set ups for a 9mm. Take into account the light weight of 4 lbs and higher accuracy of a rifle this is a great option for a survival pack."

Unmolested but ready to be bubba-ized , tacti-cooled, or just shoot the heck out of it like it was designed for. Has the grenade launcher still attached as well as the bayonet. NO, I have NO grenades to include with this gun, let alone anything for you to stick the bayonet into, LOL . I may be talked into including a box or two of ammo, though. BONUS BONUS BONUS I also found a 30 round mag that I will include. That will get you started on your 922r compliant conversion for the ultimate tactical SKS .

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a little mentally challenged and shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gun-breaker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

I am a collector and this rifle will continue to go up in value for several important reasons. There were only about 200 manufactured, and they will never manufacture more.

Unmolested but ready to be bubba - ized , tacti -cooled, or just shoot the hell out of it like it was designed for. Has the grenade launcher still attached as well as the bayonet. NO, I have NO grenades to include with this gun, let alone anything for you to stick the bayonet into, LOL . I may be talked into including a box or two of ammo, though. BONUS BONUS BONUS I also found a 30 round HI CAP mag that I will include. That will get you started on your 922r compliant conversion for the ultimate tactical SKS .

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

Same as new with all paperwork and accessories. 

==================================================
Here's some information I found online about this gun.

THE P290 SUB-COMPACT 9MM, is our (Sig Sauers') newest polymer pistol. Designed to be the ultimate in conceal carry. This unique 9mm pistol is the perfect small defense handgun that meets the demands of today’s law enforcement professionals as a backup duty gun, and responsible citizens as a conceal carry gun.

FEATURES
- Lightweight sub-compact
- DAO Trigger
- Removable grip plates

Note: This is the newly updated P290 with Re-Strike Feature!  With this added feature, if the round in the chamber does not fire on the first strike pulling the trigger will re-strike the round in attempt to fire it and cycle to the next round.

The new RS trigger does not require slide action to pre-cock it, and thus provides true re-strike capability in the event of a misfire, as well more consistent and smoother operation than the first generation P290's. The result is a gun that is hammer-fired with a consistent DAO pull, spec'd at 9 lbs for safety in the pocket. 

===================================================
Will only sell to KY residents who have a CCDW or are willing to do a transfer at an FFL dealer.

Here’s my promise to you.
• The gun is in like new condition and has never been fired outside the factory.
• All of the items that shipped from the factory are in the case including the gun, all paperwork, magazine, case and anything else described in this listing.

If you are interested, here’s what I need from you.
• That you intend to buy the gun after satisfying yourself that it is as I describe.
• The you are willing to pay to me an amount we agree upon, and
• That if you do not have a CCDW, you are willing to meet me at a licensed FFL gun dealer to do the transfer.
• If you have a CCDW, I will require you to sign a bill of sale that records the information on your CCDW license.

(Yes, I know that I can legally sell to someone from KY without a CCDW or without using an FFL. But, unless I know you, these are my conditions. Please don't ask me to change them.)"

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

 Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt®-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

 Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

 Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine."

Search the net and you will see he a famous for making outstanding firearms. I purchased this gun about 4 months ago but decided to focus on limited this year. So instead of it sitting around in a safe I thought I would give someone else the opportunity to shoot it like it deserves. I had this gun sighted in at 50 yards and “WOW”! Groups where about 1 inch and sometimes less! This was from a bench of course. Its on a STI frame, has an Aftec extractor, and can shoot 38 supper or 38 supper comp. Has an offset optic so it’s closer to the bore and a little faster to pick up the dot. Slide is lightened for less reciprocating mass and faster follow up shots.  Comes with 4 tuned magazines, 3 are 140mm that hold 24 super comps and the other is a 170mm that holds 28. It also has a VS trigger shoe so you can quickly change to whatever trigger you like without making trigger adjustments. Hard Chromed to minimize wear and keep it looking beautiful.
This is not an inflated price. Its legitimately worth at least this much. So if there is no ban it will still be worth at least this much. And maybe a lot more if it does because of the magazines.
