You can't go wrong with either manufacturer. Anyone that tells you otherwise is simply stating a personal opinion/preference. So, if you could even find it, why would you pay the going rate of $500 for a cheap Ruger 10/22?

This rifle has been fired approximately 20 times and is in mint condition. It is EXTREMELY accurate. If you use good quality ammunition, like the CCI AR ammo I will be providing, you will not have any missfires, hangfires, double feeds, or any other problems. 

The only reason I am selling is because I recently acquired the holy grail of semi auto .22s. I found a mint Marlin 7000 with a bull barrel.

I have the original box, and paperwork with which the rifle came with. 

$300 gets the rifle, plus 350 rounds of CCI .22lr

Early British marked Lend/Lease from U.S. Government to England. Adjustable rear  sight  (plus British installed Parker Hale front adjustable sight!!). Ejector rod sleeve, lightened hammer (weight reduction) & very good trigger job, all done by British. Most likely had to be reblued by them after the work was done, so will call it reblued, 70% finish. Very good bore, mechanical condition. Someone installed Pachmayer rubber grips at a much later date & No, I don't have the original grips.  I believe it was used in competition by the British...  Very Accurate.

430,http://www.armslist.com/posts/846430,For Sale/Trade:  For Sale: 30 rds 5.56 NATO .223 AR15 AR-15 M-193 Ammo Lake City Federal 55 gr brass,"Aliante, Las Vegas, Nevada",$ 120,"Listed On: Sunday, January 13, 2013",Ammo,Norinco                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"30 rounds of 5.56x45 XM-193 55 gr. Lake City Federal ammo manufacture date of Oct 2012.
That is exactly one 30 rd magazine worth of the best ammo you could feed an AR15! I have 1000 rds available.
These are the exact same rounds the US ARMY usesI Except, in most cases they use the 62 gr. M-855 which has the steel penetrator. That's because they are in a fight where the enemy might have body armor. But most people aren't looking for something to penetrate armor - they are looking for something that will kill a badguy, or a watermelon. The M-193 is the best round for that task. I just happened to buy a few thousand rounds a couple of months before this whole thing kicked off. But now, there's a whole lot of guys who have new rifles, new magazines, but no ammo. I will sell you some of my stockpile. It's going to be (pre freak out) expensive. But since you can't get any 5.56/.223 ammo anywhere, this is a bargain. I just want to see EVERYONE able to load up now. No sense owning a rifle and not having any ammo. I will not sell my entire stash. BTW, you should have prepared earlier. But then again, isn't that always the case...

Just in case you are new to owning AR15s, check your barrel and make sure it is stamped either 5.56 or 5.56/.223. If all you see is .223 - Then do not buy this ammo. Although it probably won't kill you, you should not shoot 5.56 through a .223 only barrel. LuckyGunner Labs did a story on this. You can Google it.

For everyone who thinks I'm price gouging, I don't think that definition applies. I am offering up some of my personal supplies at a price that makes it worth it to me. If you don't think the price is good, then don't buy it. The price of this ammo has increased across the board. The Gun Store in Las Vegas is selling Korean PMC .223 for $0.90/rd, and some unknown steel-core version for $1.23/rd. Great deal, right? But they only have (as of 12 Jan 2013) 100 rds available!  I can't find anywhere that sells Lake City .556 - at ANY price!

And if $4/rd is too steep, give me an offer. I'm up for trades as well."

- Leatherwood Hi-Lux CMR scope (which is sighted in and deadly accurate up to 600yds),
  Great optic with a illuminated reticle.  
 - Approximately 200rds of 7.62x51 149 grain Salt Lake City ammunition.

On Jan 19th, 2013 at 
12:00PM, there is a call out nationwide for a pro-gun rally at all state capitols
 nationwide. This is to draw attention to our 2nd amendment rights and show 
the politicians that we will not succumb to the relinquishing of our guns. At 
the dinner Saturday night our guest speaker laid it out for the gun owners in 
Colorado. He had spent some time that day with a state rep and was told the 
people in our state congress want your guns. This is separate from the federal 
gun ban they are bringing to us. 
We need everyone to attend that can to show our strength, in numbers. They 
want to ban all AR's, high cap mags, guns that hold high cap mags, bullet 
allowance, and if you are able to buy a gun, you pay 100% of background 
check fees as determined by the state. What happens if you are caught with 
banned items? Of course you will be welcomed into the world of felons and not 
able to own another gun. You can sit on your ass and not get involved but 
don't complain if these laws pass and you did nothing. 
We need five (5) democrat votes to overturn this or they will win, make no 
mistake about it. Right now we don't even have one, the democrats control our 
congress in Colorado and they need to see that we are more than just a couple 
of gun owners. 
I know, we have matches to shoot but if they get what they want you will be 
lucky to shoot a match. Everyone on here, send this out to anyone you can 
think of. This is being organized by several gun groups. If you want a copy of 
the mission statement call or send me an email. This has to be well organized, 
with no violence, name calling, etc, it must be professional.

The Remington 870 I'm looking to trade for one of these is a 18.5"" 870 in 12 gauge with tritium rifle sights as apwell as the barrel that came with it which was only a bead front. All the furniture is black Magpul gear, MOE forearm and SGA shotgun stock. Comes with a B Squared receiver scope mount. 20 rounds of Hornady critical defense ammo included as well as soft case. All original furniture included as well. I can text pics to interested persons. This shotgun used by it self is worth $350 plus the $120 magpul stock, $30 MOE forend and $200 for the Tritium Sight barrel from Remington. Total value over $600 so trade value. So for the majority of what I'm looking for I see it as being a fair even trade with a few exceptions. Picture posted without the rifled sights barrel installed. I can send pics of it Wednesday if needed. They are 3 dot tritium.

I'm looking for something like a Springfield TRP, or possibly a Range Officer.  I would also like a Dan Wesson Valor.  I may consider a Sig 1911 for the right deal.  I'm not locked in to these three names, but they are the ones I'm mostly looking for.  I would prefer the pistol not be stainless but it's not a complete deal breaker.  Pistol cannot have an aluminium frame.  May consider an alloy frame, like the one that came on some Smith and Wessons.

I'm not looking to purchase anything else at this time, only a full sized 1911 in .45.  Please TEXT me for a faster response at REDACTED.

I also have about 170 rounds of factory new .308 I can apply toward a deal if desired.

The AR's range from Spike's Tactical, US Tactical, Bushmaster, etc. All with collapsible stocks, one with slide fire, all have Magpul rear and front sights, and most have aim points, as well. All have bipods and all are sighted in at 100 yards.

So, since I have no worries, I am thinking of maybe getting rid of one (or even two) in TRADE for something really nice and unique!

Also, have 2 Springfield XD Subcompacts (9mm), SKS, AK-47, MKA 1919 (The AR platform 12-gauge semi auto shotgun), FN Police Tactical Shotgun (never fired).  I also have an HK USC with 4-10 round mags.

So, what do you have to trade?

I like the PS90s, FN, Scars, Socom, Kriss Vector, high end sniper Rifles in .308, etc.

Email me some offers for trade!

Keep in mind, I am looking for ""TRADES"" NOT to sell them (as many people still email me for). If I needed money, I probably wouldn't have ALL of this stuff to begin with. ;)"
