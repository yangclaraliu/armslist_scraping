It is not new by any stretch, but it's in great usable shape, the barrel hardly shows any wear inside or out. There is some wear in the finish, but it still looks good, and it's completely ready for its intended use. This is a 3d generation gun, so it has a rail under the barrel, and checkering and finger grooves on the front of the grip. It also has the newer style extractor with a tactile loaded chamber indicator. The sights are visible in the 2d photo -- white outline rear and single dot front.

One of the great things about the model 22 is its versatility: all you need to shoot .357 Sig through this gun is a different barrel, and ammo -- even the magazines work with .357 Sig. There are also good conversion barrels for 9mm, and it'll even shoot .22 with a replacement upper.

Along with the gun are two 15-round magazines and a Kydex-style duty-type holster.

$425 cash and it's yours! I prefer a face-to-face sale somewhere in the greater San Antonio area, and I'd likely travel a little way to meet you if you're serious. For another $5 I'll add in a nice soft case, or $10 for a lockable soft case. I also have a variety of .40 S&W ammo which I'd be happy to work into a deal."

This gun was custom built and used for medium to long range deer and elk. While it is not perfect, it is very accurate, light and easy to tune to your favorite load.

I am asking $325, but paid much more than that to have the rifle built. However, I know it does not have the big names many are acustomed to seeing on guns today, hence the lower price.

Cash only please, no trades.

Thank you."

This gun was my baby, it is no safe queen...it is painted with aervo military grade paint, and has seen its share of use.  Ive dragged it through every type of inclement weather, trained with it, loved every minute of it. Im getting rid of it so I can get a nice optics package for a new build... I will not be selling this weapon to the first person with money, i put my heart into building it, and it has been the best weapon I have ever owned...i do not want your lackluster trade, I do not want to negotiate (much.) I will not be parting it out, for the most part.. I will negotiate with the right buyer, because as I said, it needs to go to someone that knows what they are doing with it, and has a passion for seeing One ragged hole in a target at 600+ yards...so, serious inquiries only please.  Any questions can be directed to REDACTED, and if you are the right person with the right money, it will be yours, and I may even throw in some nice extras...thank you for your proper consideration.

This is the Wilkinson Arms Terry 9mm Carbine.  Based on an original design from J&R Engineering called the M68, this was a limited production run from a Mom & Pop style firearm manufacturer that placed too much emphasis on perfection and quality that subsequently put them out of business.

The Terry carbine is chambered in 9mm and is a pistol caliber carbine.  Although it has the legal barrel length of 16in, several inches of the barrel reside in the receiver to give an extremely compact tactical package.   As you can see from the pictures, the barrel removed from the receiver by simply unscrewing a washer which then breaks the gun down into an extremely small and concealable package.

This gun takes 31 round magazines and feeds in the same manor of an Uzi.  This gun will outshoot an UZI all day long with accuracy and reliability.  Essentially, this is the American Uzi that never made it mainstream.  The upper part of the receiver is formed so that a simple claw scope mount can be mounted and optics utilized.  I can personally attest that of the 3 times I have shot this rifle, I had no problem hitting a man size metal target from 100-150yrds.

Wilkinson Arms also manufactured a much more common variant of this gun in pistol form known as the Linda.  This particular example would rate in the 90-95% condition range and comes with 2 31 round magazines. 
The stock is in BEAUTIFUL shape and the entire rifle looks great and functions fantastically.

I had plans to keep this locked in the safe but a new interest in competition shooting forces me to sell to fund my next project.

These were only imported to the US for 2 years in 1988 and 1989.  This is essentially a double/ single action version of the Beretta 950BS Jetfire.  MUCH smaller than the Beretta Model 21 Bobcat that replaced it.


This TINY .25 ACP holds 8 rounds of .25acp in the magazine and 1 in the chamber.  Features a flip type safety and can fire rounds off as fast as you can pull the trigger.  GREAT gun for a Pocket pistol or just a collector piece for the micro-gun enthusiasts or Beretta Fan.
I would conservatively rate this gun in 90-95% condition.  I have test fired a few clips through it and found it to be extremely accurate and reliable with 0 malfunctions.

These are getting very hard to find so if you are interested or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me below.  Thanks!

Diana DeGette and thoughtfully and politely explain to her why her decision to ban high-capacity magazines is not only an attack against our 2nd Amendment rights, but serves no real purpose.  

I know we all agree here that the actions of James Holmes were absolutely disgusting.  Murder is murder.  There is no question that his actions were those of a deranged person intent on bringing harm to others.

What good does it do to ban high-capacity magazines?  How would this change a situation like the one that occurred in our nation last week?  The simple answer – it will change nothing.

What it does do is cost every American taxpayer more money…  How will this be enforced?  Which agency will receive a major amount of our tax dollars to enforce this law if it comes to pass?  Why do we keep allowing this insanity in Congress???

This is NO solution; it is an attack against our freedom and our rights.  James Holmes deserves what he has coming to him – but WE as a nation do not deserve to have our freedom taken because of James Holmes.  

Please considering writing a message to U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette explaining that WE the PEOPLE are tired of costly, ill-conceived solutions that attack our freedom for the sake of political gain.  This is no solution, it has been proven to be a failure already, and we will not pay more in taxes to restrict our own freedom.  

Who needs high-capacity magazines?  That is a stupid argument.  Who needs many of the things that we Americans who served our country fought (and some of our friends died for)?  Many of us enjoy beer, or wine, but we don’t call for a ban on booze because of a drunk driver kills innocent people – that doesn’t’ make sense.  We do not ask to ban vehicle ownership for SUVs to keep poor drivers from crashing into smaller cars.  Yet U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette and others like her feel the need to protect us from our high-capacity magazines?  

Our Freedom is what we need to protect – enough is enough!

This gun still looks and feels brand new, as it only has 110 rounds fired through it and it has been meticulously cleaned since.  These pistols are outstanding for the money and rival much more expensive Sig's with the same features and quality.  This FNP-40 has been broken in with 155g Lawman ammo and I tested 10 rounds of Federal 165g HST ammo and experienced zero issues.  I really like this gun but I do not have a use for it right now and I am trying to consolidate to 9mm.  The feel of this gun is awesome, and the recoil characteristics are pretty mild for .40 S&W.  

The pistol comes with the hardcase, manual, lock, extra backstrap, and 5 magazines total (three 10 round mags and two 14 round mags).  I will also add a 50 round box of Federal 180g FMJ's to the buyer.  These guns are becoming hard to find since FNH switched to the FNX pistols.

""Paddle boat"" stock.  Just about flawless.  

I thought it would be neat to have a bolt action share ammo with my Saiga so I got this.  I fired less than a box of the steel cased Russian stuff and felt bad using this cheap ammo that it's since just sat in the safe.  It's been to the range 1 time.

I now need the cash and so this is for sale; no trades.

Sale has to be local/FTF in the Nashville area.  Email me.

New for 2010, the Model 92A1 represent Beretta’s evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol. Combining the best elements of the 92FS and the 90-Two, this pistols feature:

A. Higher capacity magazines: 17 rounds in 9mm.  Completely interchangeable with other 92 family magazines. THREE magazines included per pistol.

B. Removable front sight: Allows the user to easily replace a damaged sight or replace it with an accessory sight.

C. Accessory rail: The frame of the A1’s have an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

D. Internal recoil buffer: Increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver created by the more powerful .40 S&W caliber ammunition.

E. Captive recoil spring assembly: The single-piece design simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss.

F. Rounded trigger guard: Updated styling to conform with current pistol gripping practices."

Its a collectable, and I'm not gonna use it, so I'll let someone else have it. The blade is in great shape, with a small ding in the edge, and some sword marks on the spine. Someone must've used it a long time ago. The tang had rusted and is pitted, but again, someone cleaned it up a long time ago. Its in great shape. The sheath is good, but could use a little care.

It has a tube feed magazine, not the rotary magazine. It has been thoroughly cleaned, so that's a 3 hour job you won't have to do upon receipt.

It doesn't appear to have had many rounds through it, as it doesn't show signs of wear, or abuse. Bluing is excellent except where the rear scope mount was, and normal scuffing where the charging handle contacts the receiver. It also has the normal dents in the stock evident in safe queens. Only minor dents, no scratches or gouges.

Numbers seemed to fluctuate between 250 and 500 per year. Known as the Remington Model 700SS 5-R Milspec this rifle is much sought after by those in the know. The premise of the piece is a stainless steel M700 action and barrel set in a newly designed HS Precision varmint stock. From its original format, the rifle has evolved a bit and for 2005 comes in the new HS Precision PSV74 varmint stock, which appears to be a hybrid between the tactically oriented Police stock found on the 700P and the more handy stocks found on the Remington Varmint Synthetic and Sendaro lines. The stock comes with a very nicely shaped palm swell that instantly places the hand in the proper position for solid trigger control. The 3 inch wide forearm has a re-curve in it which makes for very comfortable placement of your fingers in offhand positions. It also provides a very stable rest for bench shooting. The forearm is shorter than that found on the tactical rifles, making for a nice balance between solid feel and portability. Of course the stock comes with HS Precision's full-length aluminum bedding chassis system and it is a true drop in. This also has a adjustable cheek piece added as well as a custom camo paint.

I make very detailed kydex holsters that I can make into a belt/paddle holsters. Can make just plain Kydex Holster or Kydex with leather backing. I have been doing this for a while now, and I am not limited to just handguns. I can make holsters for mags, flashlights, cell phones, handguns, and all are very detailed and professional. In my opinion (and many others) better than what you can buy in stores (and of course cheaper).

This .38 Special version of the Smith 640 was made for only a few years.
S&W then went to making the .357 Mag version of this model. This .38spl 
version is sought after due to it's shorter barrel and lighter weight when
compared to the longer and heavier .357/640 model.

One of the very best snubbies ever for CCW use, and
ready for a lifetime of service.

I purchased a brand new, never shot Smith and Wesson M&P 40C yesterday (7/25/2012). This was to be used as a home defense gun. I love the gun and it feels great, however, it is far more similar to the Shield that I already own then i thought it would be.  I would like to purchase the full size version instead. This comes with everything a new S&W comes with, plus I will throw in the extra $50 magazine I purchased as well. I have yet to register the gun with S&W so the warranty should be valid. I am willing to take a financial loss on the gun and am asking $500 or will entertain a reasonable offer.  If interested please reply. I can provide pics if needed but I think you all know what it looks like.
