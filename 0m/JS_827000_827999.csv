It has seen very little use, and is a versatile & reliable rifle. The rifle has a couple of minor dings to the hardwood stock, and very minor superficial scratches to the matte stainless finish. It comes with the rifle, one factory ruger blued 5 round magazine, two factory ruger blued 20 round magazines, and 6 aftermarket (promag, I believe) chrome plated 40 round magazines. It also comes with the factory ruger scope rings and an after market composite snow camo stock. The aftermarket stock will need to be trimmed to fit, and the aftermarket mags are less reliable than the factory mags.

This rifle features a wood stock and it tube fed rather than a magazine. The tube holds 13 rounds + the one in the chamber. There are a couple areas the finish is nicked, once in the wood, and once on the metal below the scope, but these are very small.

I have had several additions to this including a Bushnell 3-9 scope which costs $100 new and I believe I put Leupold rings on it, but as this was several years ago, not 100% sure. I also had a gunsmith professionally install the sling as the rifle did not come with any way to attach a sling for easy carrying.

Rifle comes with everything pictured. Selling as I rarely shoot anymore and will pass along for the right price. I am the original owner and this rifle has been well cared for with a relatively low round count of around 500."

comes with 1 mag

FEATURES :

Push button mag release, fixed sights, 3.5"" barrel, frame mounted safety, external extractor and a thumb rest on the left side grip panel. 

INCREASED ACCURACY OF FIRE - The barrel guide, fitting the barrel into the receiver, has been lengthened almost equalling that of the Beretta 01ympic target pistol. This definitely increases the accuracy of fire at both short and long ranges.

HIGH SPEED THUMB SAFETY - At last it has been possible to design a completely satisfactory safety lever, blocking both hammer and sear when the pistol is at full cock.
The safety may be applied (UP) or released (DOWN) with lightening speed pushing the lever up or down with the side of the thumb.

It started out as a Rock River Arms complete 20"" upper mated to an Essential Arms lower (with RRA 2-stage trigger/LPK). 

I've since added a YHM quad rail, a Harris bipod, a Nikon scope, and a Magpul PRS stock, MIAD grip, angled foregrip, and rail covers. 

The upper is as it came from RRA aside from the quad rail and the pointy flash hider. It's a 20"" stainless 1:8 twist heavy barrel w/Wylde chamber. 

The scope is a 4-12x40 Nikon Prostaff w/mil-dot. Not top of the line, but more accurate than I am (by a good margin now that I haven't taken this baby shooting for months). The carry handle mount is the most solid I've used - tried a few before settling on the one pictured. 

Pelican case is included - foam is (inexpertly) cut to fit this rifle snugly as pictured. Replacement foam inserts are cheap if you want to do a better job. 

Always been a great shooter, has had between 500 and 1000 rounds through it. 

$1750 OBO for the lot, over $500 less than I put into it.  I might consider selling the Pelican case separately ($150 firm) but keep in mind that one of the inserts is cut for this rifle in this configuration.  Will throw in 1 30rd and 1 20rd Magpul P-mag with dust covers ($15-20 each at normal price, if you can find them anywhere).

Will consider trade offers - I'm interested in a 5.45x39 AK-pattern rifle and in the PSL.

Email questions will be answered quickly."

you cant get these in stores now, in stock that is and these were a much better deal than the USGI mags going for 59.00 there. (insane)

I paid $30 so I dont feel $35 is outrageous. it wont hurt my feelings that you dont want one but I feel I got a decent deal given current circumstances.

The executive order banning sale or transfer for these is coming. once this takes place you have what you have or you take the risk of trying to acquire these through other avenues at a much higher cost and risk.

Specifications Length 12.20 inches Width 1.66 inches Weight Empty 9.6 ounces Weight Loaded 3.3 pounds Description MAG5-100. The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-100 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest. Read more—High-Capacity Magazines in Firefights.

I purchased and used this rifle as my patrol rifle until my Agency issued a patrol carbine to me. It spent most of it;s life in a soft case in the trunk of my cruiser. But, the 3 times I had to pull it out to use it, it was invaluable. This patrol rifle is equipped with:

- Military Industries adjustable vertical grip

I don't have to sell this but based on proposed legislation, I don't want to be stuck with a rifle this expensive that I can't sell or transfer and when I die, I definitely don't want it forfeited to the U.S. Government. I can sell is stock or with the upgrades. Taking cash offers or reasonable trades. NFA items go to the front of the line. If I don't reply that means that your offer wasn't something I was interested in. PLEASE DON'T ASK ME HOW MUCH I WANT FOR IT, BECAUSE I WANT THE BEST OFFER I CAN GET. WHATEVER THAT MAY BE.

These items new would be nearly 700 without shipping cost.  If you are interested we will have to use Paypal for the cash because I live so far that I cannot meet in person.  If you have a decent rifle or tactical shotgun that you would like to trade we will work out the details for +/- cash, whichever direction if need be and we will work out the FFL issues for those interested.  I am open to nearly any bolt action rifle with synthetic stocks.  And primarily Mossberg 500's and Remington 870s.  But if you have an alternative offer go ahead and throw it out there.  Thanks

These are commonly referred to as ""sneak"" rifles, but this one is a GENUINE sneak rifle..........because I had to sneak it into the house past my wife. The M39 is probably the best general Mosin Nagant model of the series. Accurate, rugged. The barrel is a unmarked 1967. The receiver is 1910 Isvhesk. Numbers match. I bought this as it was sold to me, an unissued rifle. Bore is new. This is a Pat Burns rifle. Blue is at about 100%, as it has just been in storage. I will need your full name and address, but otherwise this is a face to face capable transaction. If you are prohibited from buying a firearm, please do not contact me. Otherwise, let me know if interested or have any questions. No trades at this time, need to pay bills. I'll throw in a Mosin 2 chamber oil bottle as well, an ammo pouch, along with 20rds of surplus ammo, and 40rds of low recoil 46 grain training ammo in case you want a petite person to shoot it, or shoot at an indoor range. The training rounds are lower powered hollow bulltes and shoot well.  For those out of state, I cannot ship the rifle with the ammo. The number on the barrel and bolt handle match. No numbers on floorplate or buttplate. All parts appear to be early Isvhesk except I ""think"" the bolt head may be Tula (faint star). The rear sight has a little plum color. The rifle will need to be cleaned prior to shooting, especially the chamber due to cosmoline, so it doesn't cause the bolt to stick. Some cosmo on the rear sight. Bore looks great, nice sharp lands. I have more pics for those interested. Thanks for looking!"

If you have ever thought of starting a HK 416 project, now is the time to get it underway! This upper is a Law Enforcement HK 416 10.4 inch upper which I acquired from Center Mass Firearms within the last year. I have never attached it to a lower receiver or fired it. The only use it has seen was by its original LE owner. This particular model comes with a SureFire flash suppressor (FH556-212A) which can also be used as an adaptor to attach a compatible suppressor. This item comes with (1) the upper receiver (barrel and quad rail), (2) the complete bolt group (HK 416, not MR 556), (3) the tungsten buffer and (4) the buffer spring. It does NOT include any gunsights or anything else not seen in the photos. As can be seen in the photos, the upper does have slight markings from use, but it is in overall good condition. Please ask any questions BEFORE bidding. Make sure it is legal to own this part in your state. It is strictly your responsibility to make sure it is legal for you to buy or possess. All NFA rules apply. Check out your short barrel rifle rules before attaching this part to a lower receiver. I will not ship outside the United States. I will ship this part directly to you upon clearance of payment. Payment is only accepted in USPS money orders or bank certified checks, unless you arrange to pay for the additional fees associated with the use of PayPal. No other forms of payment are accepted. Buyer will add $50 to cover shipping and insurance. I will use my best judgment in selecting the shipping method."

It is a PA-15 Multi, 16"" with a 1:7 twist barrel. THE EOTECH SHOWN IN THE PICTURE WILL NOT BE INCLUDED AT THE LISTED PRICE. It has backup Troy flip-up iron sights and a Troy drop-in battle rail. This rifle will also come with the original PSA 30 round magazine and a Plano hard case. This rifle is absolutely spotless. I am the original owner (purchased about two months ago), and with the exception of the factory test fire, no rounds have ever been through this rifle, and the magazine has never been used or even loaded. I do, however, plan on taking it to the range this weekend if the weather cooperates, so if you prefer a brand new rifle, please contact me before then. I am not one of those guys looking to get rich from the possible upcoming ban, but I do have about $1,200 invested here (receipts in hand), and I would just as soon keep it than take a loss. However, I will offer a $100 discount to any current or former Law Enforcement or Military (must show proof of service at time of sale).

I will consider selling with the Eotech for $1,750

BERGER BULLETS 

Tactical Bullet Line 

Tactical OTM Bullets, 338 Caliber, .338 Diameter, 300 Grain,

The Tactical bullet line bridges the gap between functionality and the highest possible ballistic performance. Each Tactical bullet is designed with a specific cartridge in mind that is used most commonly in tactical competition and against bad guys. These bullets are made with thicker jackets allowing them to perform reliably under the most abusive conditions found in tactical competition, tactical situations and in combat. All of the Tactical bullets are made with our proprietary Hybrid nose shape. Our Hybrid design blends the best of both worlds by incorporating two different shapes within the nose. As the bearing surface ends, a tangent ogive begins. This tangent section of the ogive results in the bullet being much less sensitive to seating depth. As you move forward along the tangent portion, the shape changes into a secant ogive (the shape used on the VLD bullets). This shape is very efficient in the wind. Tactical bullets will be successful at either magazine feedable lengths or loaded long for single shot firing situations which can allow for more powder capacity and higher velocities. These bullets truly give the Tactical user the best possible results for whatever situation in which they find themselves.

The grip is textured as so you can maintain grip with gloves, sweaty hands, wet hands or whatever else you can think of.  It is a fantastic grip that has two small compartments in the grip for anything you can shove in there.  It is designed to hold two CR123A batteries.  I kept a spare pair of 123s in mine but never had to use them as we had ACOGs, but were instead for my Surefire.  Price for the grip is $25 obo.  Will deliver in person if you are near the Lawton, Oklahoma area.  If not, $6 to ship via USPS Priority Mail.  If you have any questions or want more photos please email me.

So now that that's out of the way, I wanna save you some trouble and legal woes.  An M14 is a select fire rifle which means that the ATF and the US government consider it a ""machine gun"" or NFA or Class 3 weapon.  What this means is that if someone were insane enough to trade their rifle transferable machine gun for your semi auto then you'd be forced to pay a $200 tax and be subject to a lengthy transfer process.  What you are probably wanting to trade for is a .308 semi auto rifle known as an M1A.  The reason I'm telling you this is that if you were to find someone willing to make such a trade, it'd likely be for an unregistered rifle and if you want one of those..... It's fine with me, I could care less but don't post it online..... I assure you the door kickers can know who you are with your cell number or your IP address from where you posted your ad.
