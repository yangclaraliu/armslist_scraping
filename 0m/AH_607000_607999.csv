Listed here is a BRAND NEW Yugoslavian M92 Krinkov Pistol in 7.62x39

This is LITERALLY the same gun the current Yugo military and police are using without the full auto and underfolding stock.  NOTE that inside the receiver are the original supports for the underfolder so with your SBR Tax stamp, the addition of the original underfolding stock would be quite easy.  Or you can do what I was planning which is to buy one of the kits from www.USMACHINEGUNS.com to add a TAPCO stock to it ( once your tax stamp comes in of course! )

If you have previously looked at the POS Draco’s from Romania, the M92 far surpasses the Draco in terms of quality, fit and function.

These are brand new to the market and very difficult to find.  I had plans to SBR this bad boy and make it a fire-breathing monster but life changes and I need to free up some cash 

To import these guns, the barrel has a thread protector tac-welded on.  I have already removed this tac weld and it is ready to attach an authentic Krinkov Flash Hider to it.  All that needs to be done is clean up the area that I removed the weld with a little “Simple Blue” and you are back in action.

PISTOL COMES WITH:  Everything that came from the factory.  Factory Box, Manual, cleaning rod + 2 30rnd AK Magazines with the Bolt Hold-Open Feature.

Below are several pictures however I can take more if you like.  Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.  

CONDITIONS:
-	Feel free to make offer.  Trades, Trades + Cash etc.. worst I can say is no.
-	Face to Face only – I am in Charlotte but willing to meet if reasonable
-	This IS a pistol so CCW or Pistol Permit will be required

The person who owned it was a soldier in the USAF in the Security Forces and it's had roughly 500rds put through it.  Other than some minor paint flaking from gripping the pistol and changing the mags, this weapon is in immaculate shape.  Once I obtained it I added a set of Hogue grips and new screws as well as broke the firearm and magazines down and gave them a thorough cleaning.

I'm asking $700 for the weapon, 3 mags, 20rds of SPEER Gold Dot hollow point ammo, 50rds of Remmington range ammo, a cleaning kit w/ Sig Sauer p229 breakdown mat, the factory case/grips/screws/literature, and lastly the medium sized range bag I had purchased.

I'd love to keep this weapon, but with everything that's come up lately and going in to the holidays, I need the extra cash.  Buyer will provide drivers license (which I can make a copy of) and sign a bill of sale."

Business End Customs Full Build Light Weight 9mm. CCO with Golfballing by Chuck Rogers (Without a doubt the best 1911 pistolsmith on the planet). This is by far my favorite gun I have ever owned, and definitely the highest quality firearm I have ever laid my hands on! With that being said, I have a few other types of toys listed on other sites. So if some of them sell, this will probably get taken down.

Price is $2,800.00. I am pretty firm on the price because I have a good amount more than this invested in it, but if you are close, I am sure we can work something out. I accept Pistol Pay, Money Orders, and can take a Credit Card as well for anyone that might want it and isn't local. I am not interested in any trades.

Here are some pics Lou from Business End Customs took when it was done. I have pics of it here, but they aren't as good. Email me if you would like more pics. I have some other good ones he took as well.

The beaver tail is broken, there is a small chunk out of the slide on the very rear bottom (can be seen in pic) and scratches on  it.  

I took it to Freedom First this morning and they told me that it is safe and functional as it sits, but would recommend a beaver tail at least for obvious reasons.

The rifled has a scrubbed receiver and no import mark. All parts numbers match. The bore is shiny with crisp lands and grooves. Bluing overall is in good condition with minor wear. I have completed the rifle with an original black leather sling, cleaning rod and 10 brass 5 round stripper clips from liberty tree collectors. The rifle shoots well, i have no issues with the rifle just trying to trim my collection to focus on eastern bloc/soviet items.

I would like to sell or trade this as a package along with 1000 rounds of surplus 7x57. This ammunition is Dominican Republic Surplus and can be seen in the photos. It came to me loose pack and the cases show some dirt and corrosion. The ammo in the stripper clips in the photos has been rubbed with some gun oil on a brillo pad. The loose ammo demonstrates the condition out of the box. I have shot approximately 250 rounds of this with no failures to fire or other issues, but it is old surplus.

I would like to sell this all as a package. It is located in Madison but would be willing to meet in nearby area. I can ship to C&R holders or to a FFL. If I have interested parties for both the rifle and ammo I would consider splitting it.

I am looking to get $500 plus shipping. Of note the ammo weighs in at 55lbs.

I would consider trade for the following, would seek cash to balance the deal at the above price, would chip in cash if your trade is more valuable.

Will request to see drivers license at time of sale. Permit holders (CC or FFL) get $10 discount if you bring your license.

There are a couple things to note - this barrel & stock are from two different guns, the stock is from a T/C kit gun and the barrel is from a factory assembled rifle. The factory gun came scope mounted from the factory and is not dovetailed for sights so I took the barrel from the kit gun and put in on the stock of the factory gun. The stock was drilled from the factory for a tang mounted peep sight (not included).

Price is $200  or will trade for a .22lr pistol or .22 mag rifle. Located in Indy and will travel a little but I'm not looking to drive all over the state."

The second scope is my fathers older one.  It has been on a Remington model 700 it's whole life and is still a great scope.  It has minor cosmetic damage (small scratches) no dents or mechanical issues at all.  The glass is all still in great condition.  It has a top turret and is very very accurate when sighted in and used properly.  I have witnessed the death of coyotes at 600-700 yds with the proper clicks.

Let me explain my asking price since people keep saying the can get them between 450 and 500.  Yes you can I paid 475 for this one however anyone who actually researches and knows weapons knows that these guns have 2 weak spots a semi hard firing pin and a pot metal charging handle.  I have replaced both with hardened steel pieces to the tune of $150.  Look it up thats what it cost.  The almost 200 rounds of fmj 9mm lugger will run you about $80 now take this $80 and the $150 plus the original $475 price and I have about 700 in this gun.  If you want a and here is the key words non abused FUNCTIONAL AND RELIABLE pre ban tec 9 you can buy this one for $550 or you can buy an abused 450 dollar one buy the ammo and replace the internals after you snap the original firing pin after 200 rounds and spend $700 as I did once all is said and done.  I actually have a life if you are going to contact me with a low ball offer save your time I am not hurting for money just getting ready to move back to Florida where the gun will collect dust and thought someone here might make better use of it.

This Sword is made from the Most Beautiful Damascus Steel produced to date.
The spectacular success of the movie ""300"" has kicked off a renewed Spartan Fervor across the globe. I'd like to celebrate this Wild Spartan Mania with a HAND MADE ONE OF A KIND, Raindrop Damascus Steel Short Sword
This kind of quality Short Sword / Dagger of Damascus Steel is very rare. Forged from 1095 & 15N20 High Carbon Steel folded with 512 layers, enhances this Sword with a beautiful mesmerizing raindrop pattern. The 12 1/4” X 2” wide oak-leaf blade with a 5 3/4” Hilt gives the Overall length of this sword 18”.. The HRC Level (Hardness Rockwell Cone) is 58-60. (Which means this is not just a sword for display; this is a real high Carbon Steel Damascus Battle Sword). Getting away from the Absolutely Gorgeous Blade, the Guard is Handmade from Burl Walnut and Hand Tooled Brass with Carbon Fiber Micarta Spacers. The Grip is made of Naturally Dyed Rams Horn with Hand Filed Brass and Micarta Spacers. The Tang runs the length of the Hilt with a beautifully formed Brass Pommel.  Last But Not Least the Entire Hilt is wrapped with Genuine Leather in the Japanese Tsukamaki Style and very beautiful. This Masterpiece Sword has excellent weight and balance.

The sheath is made of high quality Double Stitched Leather. This sheath has a rivet loop so that can hang on a belt. The sheath is very strong and not easily broken so that it can be used for many years. You will Not see another one like it. 

* The Lakonia, named after the region of Greece ruled by Sparta, was one of the primary weapons of the hoplite. It was second only to the spear and was used when their opponents came in close. These very small short swords featured the oak-leaf blade shape common to most Greek swords. They were not much more than daggers, but in the hands of a trained hoplite, they were unbelievably deadly."

""Raindrop"". You Collectors Know this Kind of Quality Sword is very rare. Forged from 1095 & 15N20 High Carbon Steel folded 512 times. This enhances the Sword with a Beautiful Mesmerizing Raindrop Pattern.

Getting away from the Absolutely Gorgeous Blade, the Guard is Embellished with Burl Walnut and Hand Tooled Solid Brass with Micarta Spacers.

The Sheath is made of High Quality Double Stitched Leather and has a riveted loop to hang on a belt.

*Lakonia, named after the region of Greece ruled by Sparta, was one of the primary weapons of the hoplite. It was second only to the spear and was used when their opponents came in close. These very small short swords featured the oak-leaf blade shape common to most Greek swords. They were not much more than daggers, but in the hands of a trained hoplite, they were unbelievably deadly."

This gun is a tack driver and I love it to death, however I decided the 5.56/.223 precision rifle route is not for me and am currently looking into bolt guns. 

This SPR is built off an Armalite receiver set, BCG, and LPK with Armalite's two stage trigger set at 3.5lbs I believe. At the heart of the rifle is a 1/7 White Oak Armament SS barrel with an AAC blackout MBITER mount  muzzle device. As of right now, this rifle groups at around .3-.5MOA at 100yds with match ammunition and I have pictures to prove this if need be. It also has only 470rounds down the tube. I keep a meticulous record of the rounds I fire and can provide my records to any prospective buyer if need be. Enclosing the barrel is a Daniel Defense 12"" Lite rail with a Harris 6-9"" swivel Bipod. As far as optics are concerned the rifle features a SWFA SS 3-9x FFP scope sitting in a LaRue mount with butler creek caps. For a stock, the rifle has a VLTOR EMOD with the A5 buffer system. There are also other features to this rifle such as an infidel dust cover and BCM gunfighter charging handle that can be discussed if need be when I receive an inquiry. I will also include 50 rounds of Blackhills 77gr ammunition, two FDE 20rnd Pmags, and a locking winchester double rifle case with the rifle.

For inquires, email me at the provided email address and I will respond ASAP. I can ship the rifle if need be, but I prefer a face to face sale in which case I will check the age of the buyer who will also sign a bill of sale. The farthest I am willing to drive is 2 hours for a face to face. If I ship, the rifle will be shipped to an FFL of your choice. Price is negotiable and I am easy to work with. If you have a GAP rifle chambered in .308 or .300 win mag I will be especially interested. More pictures of the rifle are available upon request. Thanks for looking!![img]"

I bought this gun as a barreled action for a prairie dog trip a couple years ago. I ended up only shooting about 100 rounds through it on the trip, and total round count is well below 500. Probably more like 300. It's got a 20"" barrel that's heavy enough for good balance and accuracy, but not heavy enough to make the gun awkward or too heavy to pack around. Would be a great walking varminter, truck gun or ranch gun for someone. Holds 5 rounds in the mag.

I replaced the factory trigger with a sweet Timney trigger that gives it a really nice trigger pull. I put the action in a full bed Hogue stock. This stock has a full aluminum block in it and is not the cheaper pillar bedded stock that some Howas are sold with.

The action retails at $450, the trigger at $100 and the stock at $130. You can see that I'm taking a pretty big hit on this gun but I just never shoot it and I'd like it to go to someone who likes to target shoot, prairie dog hunt or even coyote/predator hunt. The photo you see is of the actual gun, I just took out the background.

As an added bonus I'll give you the opportunity to buy some of my ammo at a great price. I have 40 gr Hornady Vmax ammo loaded in brand new brass. This is premium hunting ammo and I'll sell you as many as you want at 40 cents a round. It's packed in 50-round cardboard boxes. I was consistently getting 3-shot groups well under an inch with this gun and this ammo.

I'd be glad to answer any questions by email, though I probably won't reply to emails that are simply ""you have this?"" or ""call me at..."". I will remove the post when sold or off the market. Thanks for looking!"

If you've never seen one of these, this is Rock Island's 1911 in the 22LR. This is perhaps the most accurate pistol I've ever fired and will not disappoint. The lower is the same as a regular 1911. This pistol is made out of forged steel and will last several lifetimes. The trigger is pure 1911 and as smooth as the Colt Gold Cups I've shot over the years. A beaver tail grip safety keeps that nasty hammer bite away. The skeletonized trigger feels just like a $1200 Colt 1911. 

So, if you've been watching 45 ammo, you know that it wont be long until we won't be able to shoot our 1911's with any frequency unless we're rich. This pistol will allow you to keep all of your fine 1911 skills, especially that combat crucial, Trigger sweep. 

The weight is the same as a 45 1911, the feel is the same, the ergonomics are the same, it will fit perfectly into your 1911 holster.   
. 

Don't miss this one, if you're not sure about this pistol, rest assured you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

I paid $500 for this pistol 3 months ago.  Save big, this pistol is still new."
