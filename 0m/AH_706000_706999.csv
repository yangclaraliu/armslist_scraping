Transfer to be done at a FFL Dealer, buyer assumes fee.

This is a 1 5/8 inch barrel, is 5 3/8 inches in overall length, and weighs 6.2 ounces. It comes with both the 22 Magnum Cylinder and the 22 Long Rifle convertible cylinder. It also comes with a Sherpa lined gun rug and a in the waistband holster. You also get all of my 22 magnum rounds ( a bunch of cci hps and 8 cci shot shells) and I'll throw in a couple hundred Long Rifle rounds.

NAA mini-revolvers are made in the USA of stainless steel with a nicely polished matte finish. All are single action (SA) revolvers with spur triggers. The cylinders hold 5 cartridges, and there are safety notches between the chambers into which the nose of the hammer (which is also the firing pin) can be lowered to allow safe carry with the cylinder fully loaded. The grip frames are of the ""bird's head"" type and most models come with attractive laminated wood grips. The sights on most models are rudimentary, consisting of a rounded front blade and the raised rear edge of the frame.

NAA mini-revolvers are so tiny that they are cute, but they are not toys. They are precisely made and very functional deep concealment pistols. And a mini-revolver can be concealed in the vest pocket of a three piece suit. To me it is the minimum satisfactory concealed carry handgun."

It was originally made for The Finnish Civil Guard and was later transferred to the Finnish Army.

It's in a great looking two tone stock (with lots of honest handeling marks but no splits or cracks, at one point the butt portion was on an M91 or M28(as evidenced by the (SYT) mark in the fingergroove), it was later ""Finn"" spliced to an artic birch forend as can be seen in the pic.s.

It also has the unusual 2 marking that is said to denote bore condition, however it is also prominent on a lot of later made M39's in the 212,000 serial range.

Bluing is a nice arsenal refurbished condition and the crown is nice and tight with no counter-bore however there are some rough spots in barrel as these were often fired with corrosive ammo.

It has the correct HV (jamb free) marked magazine and aluminum barrel sleeve that was added for accuracy.

All in all a nice collectable Finnish 28/30 that you don't have to bid on or pay shipping charges for.  

The sling and sling hangers/swivels are not part of the sale.

Selling this one and a few others to fund another Mosin variant purchase.

$400 FTF (face to face) sale in the Richmond, Mechanicsville, Henrico area.

Had this gun about a year or so. Shoots real nice, just kind of thinning the herd as far as pistols go. It mainly sits in my gun safe. Comes with four colt 7rd magazines. The Colt mags feed o.k. not as good as a Wilson mag. It is missing a small piece of the right side grip on the upper part. Doesn't affect gripping the gun, it's just an older gun and the plastic was cracked when I bought it and has since fallen off with use. Very accurate shooter, I've put about 500rds through it in the time I've had it. I would have put more, but I've got other guns that I actually carry that see more action at the range. It's a Llama .45ACP Spanish made. 

Asking $300 or best offer..

----
I am selling an Arsenal SGL20, you can read more at http://www.tactical-life.com/online/special-weapons/arsenal-sgl20-762x39mm/, but in brief, these are top-shelf AK rifles with Russian-made chrome-lined hammer forged barrel, Russian-made stamped receiver, and chambered in 7.62x39mm. If you are looking for an Izhmash factory-built mil-spec AK, this is about as close as you are going to get in the US.

This particular rifle is in excellent condition (only has the typical AK safety mark) and has all the proper Russian roll marks. I have fired 150 rounds for function check. No problems with function, reliable as expected, as with all well-built AK rifles. Very accurate.

Comes with original accessories: cleaning rod and 5rd magazine.

The SGL20 hasn't been available since 2009, but you can compare to SGL21 rifles (e.g. http://www.k-var.com/shop/SGL21-61_7.62x39mm-CALIBER_AK-47/74_RUSSIAN-RIFLE.html), which have been, until recently, available online.

Asking $950 cash FTF.

 The 270 WSM cartridge achieves its useful purpose as an excellent cartridge for white-tailed deer, mule deer, sheep, elk, moose and bears, 27 caliber is a time proven caliber for deer size animals.

 The 270 WSM cartridge is a well thought out cartridge as Winchester is no stranger in 27 caliber cartridge development. Winchester has now developed 2 cartridges in this caliber; 

 (270 Winchester in 1923), and 
 (270 Winchester Short Magnum in 2001).

 The 270 WSM factory loadings show a velocity of 3,275 feet per second for a 130 grain bullet for deer hunting and this translates to moderate recoil for the shooter with plenty of bullet energy at the 500 yard mark to flatten a white-tailed deer size animal. The 140 grain bullet serves the elk hunter well all the way out to 400 yards and the 150 grain bullet will certainly handle moose size animals all the way out to 300 yards.

 The 270 WSM cartridge, chambered in a short actioned light weight rifle may well be the ultimate combination for a superb mountain rifle in rugged terrain.

270 WSM Barrel Specifications.
Common Barrel Twist Rate - 1 in 10"".
Bore Groove Diameter - .277""

270 WSM Reloading Specifications.
Bullet Diameter - .277""
Maximum Case Length - 2.100""
Trimmed Case Length - 2.090""
Primer Size - Large Rifle

270 WSM Loading Data Hints.
 The 270 WSM cartridge responds well to IMR 4350 & 4831 powder delivering high velocities with excellent accuracy within the 130 - 150 grain bullet weight range."

This is an 8 shot 22lr and it weighs 11oz.  I've got the box and papers.  I've changed the rebound spring (trigger spring) to a 14# and the hammer spring to a 9#.  Besides lightening the trigger it makes it much smoother.    I have the S&W springs and I can put them back in with the help of Arnold Schwarzenegger if you so desired.  I have a set of Barami grips on it.  These are the kind with the lip that you can tuck in your waistband without a holster.  The original grips are in the box.  I've put about 900 rounds through it.  I bought one for my wife and liked it so much that I bought one for myself.  The weapon is so light even when loaded that you forget it’s there.   I belong to a club in Efland so if you wanted to try it out you’d be welcome to.   I do have an NCDL and CCW.

It comes with the sling, the bayonet, the 5 or 10 round factory clip, an after market 30 round clip, and 40 rounds, everything in the pictures below.

We kicked GOD and Prayer out of our schools many years ago, so how could we ask GOD to protect our kids in school? May GOD have Mercy on us and our souls...
A Gun did not Murder those innocent Children and Teachers, an insane, young, GODless man just happened to used a gun to do the Murdering.
If we bring GOD and Prayer back to our Homes, and our schools and our Lives, and we Teach our kids to Honour, Trust and OBEY GOD and HIS Commandments, and Prayer and HIS Love, Mercy and Grace, just maybe GOD will protect us from ourselves and each other...

Even though I'm not a lever action guy,  I kept it with the intent to restore it. For a variety of reasons (the biggest of which is that I'm just not a lever action fan) I never got around to doing anything to it. I did find a replacement top-eject .30-30 barrel for it; there's nothing wrong with the original barrel on it, other than it's in .32 Special (not a problem in itself, but again I'm not a lever action fan; sorry, all my childhood heroes used the M-1 Garand or bolt actions). This would be a great project gun for anyone who is into these old west/cowboy types of weapons. 



The serial number indicates that it was built in 1941. It is mechanically sound (verified by a local gunsmith) although it has a lot of finish wear on the receiver (I understand that this was pretty common with the Winnie 94's). The wood is a little worn in some spots, but seems to be pretty good overall; there are no cracks or splits in it that I can see. There is considerably less bluing worn off the barrel.





What can I say, it's a 71 year old gun. It's older and it was used, but it was also taken care of. 

I'm assigning a trade value of $600 to this. I'm not trying to overestimate it's worth, but they also don't make these anymore.

Trade interests: 

-S&W model 15 with a 4"" heavy barrel .38 Special.

-Bare bones Remington 700, caliber doesn't matter as long as I can rebarrel it to .308.

-Glock 20.
