It has German Sig sticker on box , is made in Germany and box is marked expo for export. Has the Ilaflon finish (shinier/much more durable, like glock tenifer ) that can only be put on the guns in europe, epa wont allow it to be used here. Gun has night sights that are still very bright just as new. Comes with box, 3 factory sig sauer (15rd)mags, night sights, 2 cleaning (bore) brushes, rod , lubricant and lock,manuals. Great gun for the money and has all the quality of the metal sigs for half the price. $515 firm since this is the german made model . You can get a new one (night sights,usa made) for about $500 online after paying an ffl the $25 transfer fee however they only come with 1 mag(mags are $40ea) and aren't near the quality of the german made models, the craftsmanship is much better. Ive seen them on sale for $450 at gander mtn but it is the usa made model ,1 mag and not night sights. This thing is built like a tank and the rails on this gun are thick and meaty and can be replaced. The rails are also steel like the slide unlike the  metal sigs where the steel slide rides on aluminum and must be heavily greased. This gun as made for the french police and made for thousands and thousands of rounds. I owned an HK p30 once and this gun has quality on par with that, no tooling marks on inside of slide etc.  Bruce Gray of gray guns who specializes in  working on sigs etc can carry any gun he wants and he carries an sp2022,that speaks volumes for this pistol. If you are wondering why I would get rid of such a nice pistol , I really don't want to . My only other 9mm is my small carry 9mm and I carry it so I cant sell it.

 This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416's pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

 The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. They're available in either a 30- 20- or 10-round version.

A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from 'On Safe' to 'Fire'."

Below is the details from the website.



http://www.americantactical.us/174/detail.html


The .22lr “Kalashnikov” manufactured by GSG represents much more than a small caliber “knock-off” of a famous rifle. The GSG-AK47 is not only a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate, but it actually bears the name “Kalashnikov.” GSG is currently the only company in the entire world licensed by Mr. Kalashnikov to manufacture real, functioning firearms, and they have not taken this opportunity lightly. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, but not really at the expense of an unfamiliar rifle with awkward controls and an uncertain reliability aspect. Fortunately for those who of us who like military rifles, all these issues were not a factor with the GSG-AK47. The look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection. -Jeff zimba, small arms review magazine

The barrel has a ""*"" stamped in the barrel where is it stamped magnum which indicates a full choke.  The serial number on this shotgun is 2v 44XXX.  This serial number confirms the year and that is was originally a 12ga magnum.  It will shoot either 3"" magnum loads or 2&3/4"" shells.  The recoil system is adjustable between the two loads and is currently set for the 2&3/4 shells.  The shotgun holds 5 in the magazine and one in the pipe.  The 3 round plug is removed but is included.  The brass rings for setting the recoil back to magnum are also included.  The fancy carved butt stock installed on this shotgun is from a 1933 Automatic Five (A-5) (serial number 141641) and is in wonderful condition , especially for it's age (not perfect but very nice).  The original magnum fore-grip is installed on the shotgun now because the magnum has a longer recoil tube that the 1933 Browning shotguns, so the 1933 forgrip could not be installed.  I have the original serial numbered butt stock and it is included as well.  The original wood is in nice very condition but the clear varnish coating has a few chips in it.  The gun also comes with an original Browning soft case.  The shotgun is cleaned, oiled, serviced and ready to shoot.  Please see the pictures for proof marks.

This means all high capacity magizines will be banned, all pistol grips will be banned, ARs, M4s, tactical firearms are all in danger and if some of these government regulators get their way the UN will be confiscating our firearms all together. Obama wants to see all the guns taken from civilians leaving only active military and law enforcement armed. Please contact your Senators and Congressmen and Congresswomen and petition this treaty with a letter or email. The battle has started to keep our rights and it is only us , the American Patriots, We the People, that can prevent the US Constitution from being destroyed and shaped by the very government it was created to protect us from. Do your research. Protect the very ideals that make America the greatest country on the face of this planet. Do not sit around doing nothing while our own leaders walk all over us and abuse the power that We the People have bestowed upon them. This is a dire and urgent matter.

121 hours, that’s right 121 hours !!!!!!! Will go up, we still use it.
Marina kept inside ‘till I acquired it last year.
This boat is WAY above average in condition and way low hours, way low. 
I traded a $14,000.00 Harley for this boat last year and I have put about $3,000.00 in it to make it as near perfect as it can be. It runs PERFECT, has never had a hiccup, the trailer is in perfect running order with cleaned and adjusted brakes and a new coupler on front. 
The cuddy has a sink, single burner stove and porta potty. 
Impeller was new last August. 
Trailer tires new last August.
Chain, anchor, rode all new.
AM/FM CD new.
VHF ship to shore new.
Shakespeare 5225XT new.
Dual batteries, 1 is new and the other 2 years old The list goes on.

Rigged to fish off the swim platform, I didn’t allow fishing from inside the boat, I didn’t want it to smell or get bait dried up laying around, or hook rips in my interior. The interior doesn’t have a rip or anything wrong with it.
I had the camper top front windows replaced last fall and the rest of the windows  I have the material here already.

This 22’ Stingray is small enough to tow to any lake, anywhere, yet big enough to take offshore, the best of both worlds. With the 300 hp Mercruiser it will hit 65 mph in near perfect conditions with 2 people and half tank of fuel, slight chop.

Comes with 2 stainless steel MERCRUISER  props, all safety gear and life jackets, title and such and it’s registered ‘till 2014.

How much am I asking.....$250,000.00, because I know you’ll want to talk me down on price, so let’s start there. I plan to end up with $14,000.00 in my pocket, or guns.
 If your guns aren't worth $14,000.00, you’ll need to add cash, or maybe even a Harley to make up the difference. 


You will not find a nicer, cleaner low hour boat than this for the year. The boat looks near new, no rips, no tears, 121 hours, 350 magnum, bravo 1 drive, new $400.00 cover,  washed after every use,  no oil leaks, oil and fluids changed.
I am anal with keeping this boat clean and perfect and maintained.

I replace parts because they ""might"" go bad, not because they are bad.
This boat is in tip top running condition at all times. 

Will also trade for Leer Jet, will need flying lessons."

Blackhawk 44H125BK-R Level 3 Serpa Duty Holster, RH, S&W MP 9/40, Black Features: 
• Made In: United States
• SERPA Auto Lock System provides a quick, natural draw with immediate security upon reholstering to increase officer safety
• Injection molded carbon fiber composite construction provides incredible strength
• Extremely light weight
• No snaps or hoods to accidentally open, weapon stays secured until you decide to draw
• Ease of training, same drawing technique for undercover, tactical and duty

Level 3 SERPA Auto Lock Duty Holster

Level 3 retention holsters have long been the standard for law enforcement duty use. The problem has been that many holsters that provide this level of protection are clumsy to operate and can prevent the officer from drawing his weapon rapidly under stress. The level 3 SERPA Auto Lock holster uses your natural drawing motion to release the weapon. No unnatural motion or complicated sequences to remember, just grab and draw."

It has been adult operated and only ridden a couple times a year. This isn't your normal sport four wheeler. It has independent rear suspension and is fuel injected. If I had to take a guess, I would say the four wheeler has less than 50 hours on it total. Less than a year ago, I bought all 4 brand new tires for it, not because the others were worn but because I trail ride and the stock tires just weren't cutting it. The tires alone cost me $550 and have only been on 2 rides. Everything else on it is completely stock. I changed the oil after every ride (like a said, it was only rode about 2 times a year). There are absolutely zero malfunctions, dings, or major scratches. Just normal wear on the plastic, which is minimal. The only reason I'm selling it is because I recently purchased a RZR and this has to go. Asking $3500 but will entertain all reasonable offers. I would be interested in trading to some rifles or handguns.  I have more pictures upon request. Call/text me at 502-386-9one0one. -Mike"

Look at everything that is included in this listing.

Remington Sendero SF II W/ Nikon Monarch X (red & green illuminated) Mil-Spec scope

.300 win mag Remington Sendero SF II rifle with stainless fluted barrel and a Nikon Monarch X Illuminated (red / green) MIL DOT Scope:   2.5 - 10x by 44m (see link). 

http://www.opticsplanet.com/nikon-monarch-x-25-10x44-riflescope.html

Everything is Pristine, I have ALL paperwork and boxes for everything, It comes with a pelican hard case and the the BEST solid steel Leupold Mark 4 mounting system available and a GGG telescoping tactical bipod.  You can tell by the bolt and inside I have only put 40rds through it (2 boxes of the below ammo).   

I will include 3 20rd boxes of Winchester Ballistic Silver tip 180gr .300 win mag ammo to go with it ($50/box).  These are the ONLY bullets to ever see the inside of the barrel.  I can include the original 40 silver brass cases that went through for your reloading.  I may be able to get your more through a friend if you're interested.

This setup was made to be a long range nail driver, I shot 200-250 yards at the prone with ALL bullets millimeters from touching, no bs, this setup is VERY accurate, I can prove this statement.   I never had a chance to go shoot any further.

Everything in this setup is in immaculate condition, I pamper my guns and I only buy the highest quality.   

This listing includes:
Remington Sendero SF II :  $1300
Nixon monarch X w/ illuminated mil dot : $1400
GGG tactical telescoping bipod with from picatinny mount : $200
Leupold steel (top if the line) 30moa picatinny rail $125
Leupold steel (top of the line) scope rings : $115
Pelican hard case: $325
3 boxes of the Ballistic Silvertip ammo: $150.

I am asking $2,600 for everything cash which is already a great deal but I will consider an offer but please don't lowball me I won't respond.  I prefer cash, but I'm a sucker for good guns so I'm willing to trade up or down.

The only trades I would consider (plus my cash) is for a true (not home made with mixed parts) Noveske, FN Scar 16 or 17s, POF or other high end AR (not trading for the inflated prices - this ban isn't going through so you can keep these ripoff deals on armslist and gunbroker - spend more effort contacting your state leaders to help the NRA fight this BS off).   

I would also consider trading the following if you add cash on top. QUALITY AR Lower, AR Upper, Barrel, Bolt Carrier Group, Lower Parts Kit, A Saiga 12, Benelli M4, FN SLP Tactical shotgun or a Sig Sauer handgun, FN Herstal 5.7, Glock 9mm, High capaciy mags for any of the guns I like, a high end eotech, aimpoint or trijicon i could use on one if my other rifles.  

I'm sorry to most of you as I have manners but to some of you:
You can keep your home made bushmaster, DPMS, Colt, Palmetto PSA, and other cheap home made rifles - Ive got tons of emails offering me these types of rifles + $1000 for this setup, you have no idea what you're doing, im not giving you double your trade value.

The manufacturer is Edge Brand, and the model is 445. Full tang construction,  genuine stag handle. I understand these can fetch over $100 in excellent condition. I'm asking $50 since the knife shows it's age a bit. Some pitting, nothing too bad, its just the blade is not made of stainless steel. There is a faint etching on the blade that says ""Original Bowie Knife"". It's not really what most folks would consider a full-sized Bowie, I'd guess a bit over 10 inches (no measure handy), kinda slender. A quality old Solingen knife for the Bowie collector!"

Its an original 1986 Russian Tula Krinkov AKS74U rifle chambered in 5.45x39.  It is a numbers matching kit that is built on an armory USA receiver.  It has a side optics rail (which is pretty uncommon on krink builds), as well as the proper pistol grip reinforcement plate.  It has been painted with allumahyde II and a dark satin black. 

It has all of the necessary US 922r compliance parts, which are the receiver, ergo hogue pistol grip, g2 trigger group, and Kvar black hand guards.  It also has a trigger group plate, although it doesn't count as 922r, its a nice addition that makes cleaning and disassembly a breeze. 

The barrel is an original east german chrome lined ak74 barrel that has been turned to a krink profile, and kept at 16"" to meet the minimum 16"" length.  These are one of the few barrels that don't keyhole once they are cut to 8 1/2""  So all you need is to complete your tax stamp for an sbr, and your good to go.  Just chop and recrown your barrel. 

These kits run $800, barrel another $400(if you can find one), machine work to the barrel another $150, compliance parts, receiver etc you can see there is a lot of money wrapped up here not including the build.  I have an original unsanitized Russian Molot RPK74 mag that I will let go with the gun at my price(worth ~$150).  I want to sell for what I have in parts(not including the build) in order to upgrade to a bigger gun safe.  I also have a little russian ball ammo I might include with the rifle as well.



These rifles are all over gun broker for $1800-$3300.  I am selling for $1400 OBO.

It allows the piston to move without moving the handle, while also allowing you to chamber another round all while only using your left hand!

This system works for the following gun gmodels:
Bulgarian AK-74
Saiga .223/5.56
Saiga 7.62x39
Polish Tantal 5.45

Here is the description from the website:

THE NEW 2nd GENERATION!

The Kalashnikov does not get simpler than this! We guarantee you will notice a decreased reloading time due to a more natural manual of arms.

RCS 2nd GENERATION Upper Charging system for Kalashnikov Rifles
Machined on the best CNC machines, this package contains everything necessary to convert a standard Kalashnikov variant rifle into one with a non- reciprocating forward charging system. This item replaces the original gas tube with a new one that contains a new charging handle and slide. The new charging handle protrudes from the left side directly over the forearm of the rifle for easier and less troublesome charging. The pre-existing charging handle on the right side is now unnecessary and can be discarded to eliminate all exterior moving parts. All hardware is included. No gunsmithing required. MADE IN THE USA.

Guaranteed quality, all of our parts pass a fit and function test before they are made available for purchase.  

Advantages when compared to original charging system:
Non-reciprocating handle
Allows for faster reloading due to less hand manipulation
Easier function for a right handed operator
Quicker cooling
Unproblematic reloading when firing from the prone position and or around barriers
Unlike other left sided charging systems, with the Ratchet Charging system you can use your left side optics rail and it does not open up your critical trigger components.
The operator no longer loses sight picture or situational awareness while loading
Easier to clear miss feed or jam
Built to outlast the life of the firearm
Built from the finest metals and long lasting black matte finish
Self cleaning design allows dirt and debris to easily exit the gas tube.
If original charging handle is removed:
Safety can be engaged when chambering a round
Eliminates all exterior moving parts
We make it easy for the operator; installation takes minutes and does not require a gun smith. This part was made to outlast the firearm. We guarantee you will decrease your loading time. The key is giving the operator a charging handle in a natural location (on the forearm) decreasing the amount of hand manipulation.
