As it sits right now, i have 1400 in it, and thats rounding down. Im not really interested in selling it though. I'd just like to trade for a rifle i have listed below. Ok, so if you have a DPMS 'sportical' or a S&W M&P15 'Sport' that you paid 6-700$ for a month ago, it is not now worth 2000$ ok? So, if you want to trade one of these rifles with me, you're gonna have a 700$ void to fill with either cash/mags/ammo or accesories. If you'd like, i can share your way of thinking by saying, ""guess what? My Saiga is now worth 3300$."" Its up to you which void you'd rather fill. I'm not here trying to make a profit, just for an honest deal. In my eyes, those who are selling their 600$ rifles for 1500-2000$, are no better than those scumbag politicians who seek to strip us of our rights. I just don't want lose my ass on my investment, not capitalize on it. I'm being real with you, so be real with me please. *****END EDIT*****Saiga 12 with lots of goodies. Trigger group conversion has been done. Magpul collapsible stock, scorpion grip, tromix monster muzzle brake w/door breacher teeth. Really reduces recoil and eliminates muzzle climb. Utg quad rail w/rail covers, tapco vertical grip, aftermarket gas plug and gas puck. It runs great, I was just wanting to get a rifle after Christmas. And that has obviously went to hell. So I figured I could trade someone for an AR, M1A or an M1Garand. Would be willing to give or accept cash depending on the deal. Comes with one twenty rd drum. Two ten stick mags and the factory five rounder. Face to face transaction to Indiana residents with 2 forms of ID and bill of sale, for both of our records."

Today shotguns are cocked by pressing the action lever to the right, then pressing down on the barrels. When the barrels are pressed down this cocks the internal boxlock action.On the Savage 430 the boxlock action is cocked when you press the action lever to the right,not by pressing the barrels.So what exaclty is my point here?Well, we all know unless you have 26 to 28 inch barrels when you open the action you have to press the barrels.With a short barrell there is insufficient weight to cock the action.With the savage 430 all you have to do is press the action lock to the right and the barrels will fall righ open for you. It's almost like adding the wolff reduced action springs on the Savage 311 for the cowboy action shooters out there that know what I mean.Now that all of this great info is out of the way. The gun functions great,however there are a few tiny cracks in the wood.One on the forearm,one at the back of the tang. and one on the bottom of the stock. All of these are small and repairible.The finish is heavily worn on this 60 year old gun,which could be reblued.The barrel set is 28 inches long and has fixed chokes, which are full and modified.The bore is in decent used shape. It's not a mirror but it doesn't look like a rusty peice of rebar either.I'd say they are in fair to good shape and with a better cleaning solvent,would clean up nicely.Thanks for your interest! Be sure to check out my preban Ruger 10/22 And Italian Carcano listing.Additional pics can be emailed. Here is some legal info concerning transfer of ownership.The flollowing is an excerpt taken directly from the BATF website.
Q: To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA?
A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of his State, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may loan or rent a firearm to a resident of any State for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may sell or transfer a firearm to a licensee in any State. However, a firearm other than a curio or relic may not be transferred interstate to a licensed collector.

 The Good, 
Truck Runs Well, drivetrain all good and body in pretty good condition, never been wrecked, not dented up, interior pretty good too...also due to the trucks weight it does not require emissions inspection...
 The Bad,
 A/C not working..I have a brand new compressor and brand new filter dryer in boxes never installed..All it will take to get A/C working is to buy a A/C coil (cost around $100.00) and install along with the parts i have already bought..the compressor alone was over $500.00
 Windshield has a crack but doesnt interfere with driving and will not get any bigger
 .Paint looks decent and has shine but also has little tiny air bubbles they never bothered me i just kept truck waxed it looks real good from 10-15 feet but on very close inspection you see the little bubbles
 last time i drove it the passenger side rear caliper locked up {probably from just sitting} so it will need to be dealt with..i just don't use the truck much anymore so i'm not going to bother repairing it, and instead just decided to sell it....i had brakes done with premium pads about 4-5 months ago, and truck has only been driven a few times since so brakes are more or less new all around..
 Engine Light on..Had it checked said replace sensor...I did...Came back on said replace a different sensor, I did, along with the oxygen sensors for good measure..Came back on said gas cap leaking or catalytic converter stopped up I replaced both..Light came back on I guessed it must be the light as truck runs perfect and none of these repairs were needed as truck runs exactly the same as it did to begin with...the light will go off after around 75-80 mph highway speeds but comes back on sometimes at lower speeds

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 
This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

About the artist
PETRU BOTEZATU
Born in Bucharest , Romania 1940
         - Grew up in an atmosphere of intense pressure and opposition to the newly imposed Communist regime in Romania, which used to be a monarchy, until 1947.
         - He discovered his interest for creating art at a very early age. When he wasn’t attending school, or played exuberantly on one of the wildest river valleys in Romania, he would spend time in a local artist studio, or on mural painting sites in churches, where, while still a teenager, he received as an “apprentice” his first instruction in drawing, color mixing, and painting, in the technique of fresco (fresh or wet plaster) from the local old masters.
         - In 1959 just before graduating from the high school, Petru is accused of being the leader of a counterrevolutionary movement against the communist regime, and, in a public “exemplary” trial, is sentenced by a military tribunal to a prison term of 12 years .
         - Due to a miraculous intervention, his case is reopened 3 years later, and, though sentenced again, for “illegal association”, his initial conviction is overturned, and a year later, when he was already almost irreversible sick (with tuberculosis ), he is released .
         - The unhuman imprisonment conditions, the extermination techniques and the hard forced labor regime Petru was subject to while in prison, would imprint him, for the rest of his life with a definitive tragic sense that his adolescence and youth have been irremediably stolen away.
         - Though carrying this everlasting “damnation”, following some relaxation of the communist oppression, in 1964 Petru was admitted as a resident scholarship student at the Faculty of Fine Arts of The University of Bucharest."

The gun is chambered in the formidable 9.3x74r cartridge that will take down any animal in North America and almost anything in Africa too. 

The gun comes as new with scope mounts and the original box and green plastic case. It has the regulation load targets and it is well regulated indeed. It has a 1.5"" Silver's Double Rifle pad installed and also the original shorter pad included as well. 

This gun was hand picked out of about 250 guns that were imported into the United States by Sabatti. Most of the Sabattis were pawned off on Cabelas as utter dogs because the person doing the regulation used a dremel on the rifling to fix the point of aim! On others, the color case hardening was screwed up. On others, it was mediocre wood. 

This one is it, excellent regulation, as-new, perfect finish, perfect case coloring, excellent wood. Also includes about $400 worth of safari grade ammunition (3 boxes of Hornady and Norma).

About the artist
PETRU BOTEZATU
Born in Bucharest , Romania 1940
- Grew up in an atmosphere of intense pressure and opposition to the newly imposed Communist regime in Romania, which used to be a monarchy, until 1947.
- He discovered his interest for creating art at a very early age. When he wasn’t attending school, or played exuberantly on one of the wildest river valleys in Romania, he would spend time in a local artist studio, or on mural painting sites in churches, where, while still a teenager, he received as an “apprentice” his first instruction in drawing, color mixing, and painting, in the technique of fresco (fresh or wet plaster) from the local old masters.
- In 1959 just before graduating from the high school, Petru is accused of being the leader of a counterrevolutionary movement against the communist regime, and, in a public “exemplary” trial, is sentenced by a military tribunal to a prison term of 12 years .
- Due to a miraculous intervention, his case is reopened 3 years later, and, though sentenced again, for “illegal association”, his initial conviction is overturned, and a year later, when he was already almost irreversible sick (with tuberculosis ), he is released .
- The unhuman imprisonment conditions, the extermination techniques and the hard forced labor regime Petru was subject to while in prison, would imprint him, for the rest of his life with a definitive tragic sense that his adolescence and youth have been irremediably stolen away.
- Though carrying this everlasting “damnation”, following some relaxation of the communist oppression, in 1964 Petru was admitted as a resident scholarship student at the Faculty of Fine Arts of The University of Bucharest."

When I got
 the boat, it was bare inside, and had about 47 million layers of paint
 on it. A buddy and I stripped the entire boat to bare metal. We added
 1/8"" aluminum angle to the chines up front to serve as ice breakers,
 and they function very well. Broke about 500yds of ice each way on one
 trip last January.

 The bottom of the boat is coated with Super Slick Steel Flex, which is
 an airboat coating. This stuff is super tough, and will stand up to
 banging on logs, rocks, sand and gravel bars, etc. this boat was to
 ultimately be a mud boat, which is why it was coated.

 The front of the boat has storage under the deck also for life jackets, and other items, it hasa marine grade plywood door, that hinges open.

 Inside, the floor is marine grade plywood, with a dark gray indoor/outdoor carpet. with 2 high back swivel seats in marsh camo ( new from bass pro. 
The entire boat has been covered with self etching primer, which is an
 OD green type color. It was the base for a custom camo paint job. the boat, motor and inside are all painted.

 Boat sits on an older trailer that still pulls well. Lil"" Dude
 Trailer , that hinges in the middle if needed. Just pull the pin. It
 has 2 new brand new tires & rims

 On top is an Avery Quick Set duck blind. 3D leafy cut, with wind
 blockers. The blind pretty much totally encloses the boat when up, and
 is very roomy since there is 12' of open space inside,
 . Battery, oars, guns, life vests, anchors, etc store
 completely out the way, with plenty of room for 2-3 hunters ands dog, with decoys.

Will come with a 45lb thrust bass pro trolling motor, battery.
 will also include a 9.9hp Johnson seahorse outboard motor. the motor was serviced in the spring, and will start on the 1 or 2nd pull.. will
 also include a fuel tank with the correct hose line for the motor.

other items that are incuded.
 2 adult life vest USCG approved.
 1 marine fire extinguisher
 1 boat anchor.
 2 oars
 small light ( red green ) for night time use.

this is a VERY stable boat, for duck hunting or fishing.... I can get up and walk around in the boat, with no fear of tipping over..

Price is $2100 or will do a cash / trade deal , or will trade for quality firearms of equal value...
 thanks."

I've shot less than 100 rounds through this rifle. I took it to the range twice. Once to break it in and another to sight it in.  It shoots great and never skipped a beat.

This is a top of the line AR-15 with all top of the line components. This isn't your run of the mill stock Bushmaster, DPMS, Rock River or Armalite.  Polygonal rifling with a 1:7 twist, Magpul UBR stock and Magpul grip, tactical two stage trigger,  anti-rotation pins, spiral fluted barrel just to name a few.  I suggest you do some research for yourself and you'll quickly realize what this rifle is all about.

This AR-15 retailed for $2,300 at Scheels before the $hit hit the fan and that's about what I paid for it around a year ago.  I am asking $2,300, which isn't out of line considering the astronomical prices people are asking for significantly less rifles.

Ok I'm gonna start buy saying I don't know much about this mag I was told its for a tec9 but I'm not 100% sure I did some research and that's what it looks like also notice that it seems like it maybe missing a piece on the top back side of mag once again I'm not sure it also has light surface rust but the follower and spring feels good so for those reasons it's being sold as is and might be best for parts if u have any questions dont hesitate to ask
Thank you

Competition Shooter. In keeping with DCM (Department of
Civilian Marksmanship) High Power Competition Rules, this rifle
looks like a “stock AR-15” type rifle, but includes all the
modifications and upgrades that will give you a competitive
edge. All the features built into this superb competition rifle
result from years of observation and discussions with
competitors at the Camp Perry National High Power Matches.
These special accurizing features include:
• The M16A2 Dual Aperture Rear Sight is specifically modified to
accept interchangeable apertures available in four sizes to suit
the competitor’s vision and preference… .036""; .040""
(Standard); .046"" or .052"" diameter. Additionally, the sight can
be configured for a choice of 1/2"" or 1/4"" Minute of Adjustment
for both Windage Knob and Elevation Drum.
• The Competition Front Sight is specially ground on three sides
for optimum clarity, and is available in the shooter’s choice of
two widths (.052"",or .062""). It is secured within the front sight
base by a set screw to avoid the possibility of any movement
once the rifle has been “zeroed”.
• The 20"" Bushmaster Extra Heavy Competition Barrel is a full 1""
diameter under the free float tube, and is precision button
rifled 1 turn in 8"" – right hand twist – 6 lands and grooves. The
Barrel material is ChromeMoly Vanadium Steel, and the Firing
Chamber is machined to SAAMI specifications. It is lead lapped
and hardened to Rockwell C26 to 32. Unlike many other
Bushmaster Barrels, this barrel is not Chrome lined.
• In the Upper Receiver, the Bolt is carefully matched to the
Barrel Extension Lugs for precise lockup, maximum strength
and optimum accuracy.
• The Lower Receiver houses a finely honed Two Stage Competition
Trigger that is factory set for a 3.5 lb. first stage and a 1 lb.
let-off (second stage). This 4.5 lb. total trigger pull meets
CMP/NRA competition regulations.
• The handguard set looks like government issue parts, but is
actually a Competition “Free Floater” Tube (handguard
tube/barrel nut combination). It does not contact the Barrel
forward of the Receiver. A sling swivel is attached to the
forward end of the tube to avoid any possibility of deflection or
pressure on the barrel that could degrade accuracy.
• The Buttstock has been improved for competition with the
addition of a 3.62 lb. lead “Counterbalance Weight” which
can be trimmed by the competitor to achieve a comfortable
balance and solid feel.

I am interested in a trading for a Handgun, possibly a rifle (really would depend on the make/model, etc.) I would also consider including some cash depending on the handgun, etc.

Here are a list of the Calendars and my opinion on their estimated Condition Grade along with aprox value I am looking for in trade. As a frame of reference I recently sold a Jan 1928 that was in a little better condition than my Feb 1928 on Ebay via Buy it Now for $249.

Feb. 1928 - 22"" x 10"" Good to Very good Condition. ($175-$200)
Jan. 1930 - 22"" x 10"" Fair + to Good Condition. ($100)
*1935 - 36"" x 16""  Fair - to Fair Condition. ($60)
*1937 - 36"" x 16"" Good Condition. ($150)
And a couple half calendars. It's only the artwork portion aka the top half of the calendar.
Oct. 1928 - 11.5"" x 10"" Fair + Condition. ($20)
*1949 - 18"" x 16"" Good to Very Good. ($50)
* means they are rolled, and haven't been folded. they also have a metal edge across the top and bottom.

Let me know if your are interested in trading a handgun for any of these calendars, I also have the ad with the Vintage 1920's T.J. Hilemans photographs of the Blackfoot Indians for trade as well.

* windage and elevation adjusts
* tactical cross dot
1 3x30 magnifier w/ Picatinny mount
1 extra battery for the Red Dot
All the original packaging and paperwork

This is practically brand new. I have fired less than 100 rounds through it before deciding I wanted a holographic site rather than a red dot. It's not a Trijicon or Aimpoint, but it's fun, cheap and good for plinking on your AR, SKS, AK or other range toy. 

Would be excellent also on a 10/22 or other .22 rifle.

Urgent - Chicago Legislators Push to Pass Statewide Firearm Ban This Week!

Call Your State Senator and State Representative NOW!!

Word is out that IL Senate President John Cullerton, of Chicago, plans to push passage of a statewide gun ban during the lame duck session which begins tomorrow, Jan. 2, 2013 at 3 p.m..  Trying to use the tragedy committed in the Connecticut school, Cullerton wants to push Chicago's ban on legal, commonly owned, commonly used firearms and ammunition magazines.  



Chicago legislators have been waiting for a tragedy such as this, to push their failed semi-auto gun ban into the entire state for decades and believe, in the light of the recent tragedy, that this is their opportunity to get it done.  They are totally ignoring the facts that these types of firearms are used in less than 1% of homicides throughout the United States…More people are killed with baseball bats!

We know from experience if they succeed with this ban, they will not stop there.  Comments have already been made about needing to ban ""sniper rifles"" which in reality are only single shot, bolt action hunting rifles.  There is no firearm which is safe from being banned.

We must stand up to the Chicago politicians and let them know we will NOT accept their failed gun ban being pushed onto the rest of the state. 

Call your State Senator and State Representative before 3 pm tomorrow -  politely but firmly tell them to vote against any gun ban and any further infringement on our legal and constitutional right to keep and bear arms.


To find out who your State Senator and State Representative is call the State Board of Elections at 217/782-4141.


When One Mentally Disturbed Man Comments a Horrible Act -Does It Makes Sense For Chicago Legislators to Ban Lawfully Owned Guns and Magazines For Everyone Who DIDN'T Do It?
Disarming innocent victims does NOT make them safer! The only thing that will stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun…

If the ban goes into effect, then semi-auto shotguns with pistol grips like this one will be banned. 

The 930 SPX Blackwater Edition:

Tactical 12 Gauge Shotgun With 18.5″ Barrel, XS Ghost Ring Rear Sight, AR-15 Style Front Sight, 8 Shot Extended Capacity & Full Length Pistol Grip Black Synthetic Stock. Fixed Cylinder Bore Choke. “Blackwater” Logo On Left Side Of The Receiver.  Chamber both 2 3/4 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease—from target loads, to non-toxic magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo.

Basically these were made for Blackwater Security. Same as the 590A1 and the Sig Sauer P226 9MM Handgun. They are no longer in production and hard to come by. Only way to own one now is IF the owners of them now were willing to sell them. 

You can still purchase the standard 930 SPX for around $865-$1000. But the Blackwater Tactical Edition is hard to come by, it's basically wanted because of the name. So it tends to draw more attention and highly sought after.

Honestly I have all the firearms I need. But I won't turn down making a few extra bucks on something I own that others want. The standard model 930 SPX are going for $1000 on Gunbroker now. The MSRP on them new were $865. 

I however will keep your offers in mind, but I will be keeping an eye on gunbroker. It might end up on there. As there are very few Blackwater editions.

From the combined effort of Legion Ltd, the custom shop of the legendary Izhmash Factory in Russia, and FIME Group, Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada comes a new SGL21 (Saiga) rifle in 7.62x39 caliber.  Initially manufactured by Legion Ltd  in Russia and remanufactured by FIME Group, Inc. in the United States, the new SGL21 rifle has everything that collectors and shooter have been looking for.
Hand-select premium components, custom-shop-like attention to details by Legion Ltd, and Arsenal, Inc.’s highest standards of workmanship, give this rifle its superior quality.  FIME Group, Inc. remanufactures the SGL21 rifles in the United States with 922r compliant parts and fills them with features not seen on any other factory Saiga rifles.  Performing the most difficult modifications to achieve, Fime Group,  Inc. has done a substantial work for the customer.  The end result is the highest quality SGL21 rifle with the most desired features which have not been available before.  Every unit is laser sighted and test fired.  Targets are included with most of the rifles. 
To make this rifle the perfect Russian AK available in the market, Fime Group, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to ensure all the components and features are true to its original configuration.  The receiver of SGL21 rifle has the proper markings on both sides without any extra commercial markings, including the legendary Izhmash Factory logo, the upward pointing arrow in triangle.  The markings on both sides of the receiver are done with the correct font type and size and placed in their proper locations.
The receiver of SGL21 features proper magazine dimples on both sides and original “X” and “Y” shaped reinforcement stampings.  On the right side, it has correctly positioned notches for the safety lever, marked with letters “S” and “F” and no additional openings at the bottom forward portion of the receiver.  The components and features on the new SGL21 rifle resemble true Russian AK rifle, including the safety lever with correct shape and properly positioned dimple, the correct trigger guard with magazine catch and the correct bullet guide enabling SGL21 to accept any standard AK magazine, polymer furniture, including the handguards, pistol grip, and the original Warsaw pact length buttstock, the retainer for lower handguard, the correct gas tube, original gas block with the correct vent holes, a guide hole for the cleaning rod and accessory lug, correct AK-74 type front sight block with 24x1.5mm right-hand threads and bayonet lug.

There is one from this same contract, same condition on Gunbroker with a starting price of $600.
