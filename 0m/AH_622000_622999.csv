2 boxes (40 rounds each) of military ammo on stripper clips for $10 each (can't read the writing on these).
 I think all this ammo was made in Russia in the 1950's.
This ammo was bought by me in the 1990's and used BOTH in a CZ52 AND in 2 different Broomhandled Mausers. It always worked fine in all 3 pistols but 15 years after the guns were sold, I was told that the military ammo was for machineguns and was not safe in Broomhandles. So, if you have a CZ52, it's a strong well made pistol and should be fine, but if you have a Tokarev, Broomhandle, or other antique, you should probably skip the military stuff. Shoot often, but shoot safe. I can't do pictures. 
NO TRADES, OFFERS, OR SHIPPING. LOCAL CASH SALE ONLY. If you can use all 3 boxes (130 rounds total) I will take $25.

I have thoroughly enjoyed this firearm, but my heart has always been set on a 1911. I picked this up a few months ago because of how much cheaper it is to shoot 9mm than .45.

All of the classic Model 70 Super Grade features are present – the fancy grade checkered walnut stock with shadowline cheeckpiece and ebony fore-end tip, the engraved crossbolt head and the traditional Super Grade pistol grip cap.  Each of these beautiful rifles is built with the Pre-’64 style action that offers a forged steel receiver, massive external claw extractor, controlled round feeding and reliable blade ejection."

I don't have the gun in hand yet, as I have to pick it up from the dealer.  I will have it most likely by mid week.

Scope is mounted and bore sighted and the gun is ready to run.  Reading a little online about this particular rifle model, I've discovered that it isn't uncommon for this gun to provide 1/2"" groups @ 100 yards.  A great gun for the money (probably one of the best value for the $ guns out there presently), but I just can't justify keeping a gun I have absolutely no use for (I'm not much of a hunter)."

Editorial Review
The Crimson Trace Modular Vertical Foregrip provides fast, accurate target acquisition with a built-in tactical light and laser. The powerful tactical light and laser sit on either side of the robust foregrip. Constructed of hard-anodized 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum with polymer grip panels, the rail mounted foregrip provides a strong and stable platform for shooting. The system provides instinctive activation thanks to the overmolded activation pad on the grips that offer dual side activation in addition to the master on/off switch.

Here's what the website says about it. 

A revolutionary new design that blends the ergonomics of the AR-15 lower with a lightweight, fast-handling upper receiver system chambered in the exciting new 5.7x28mm caliber. This ultrareliable unit is fed by a horizontal, top-mounted 50-round magazine (not included) atop the 16"" E.R. Shaw barrel, and there's no gas system to clog or foul. The upper receiver and rails are precisely milled from a monolithic block of aircraft grade 7075 T6 aluminum. Kit includes a barrel, semiautomatic bolt, carbine buffer and manual.

I'm looking to trade straight to something along the lines of the following:
1. Any high caliber Savage Bolt-Action rifles (.270, .308, 7mm, etc)
2. Any higher caliber Ruger rifles (bolt action preferred, but would also consider a nice Mini14)
3. I would consider some nice Marlin/Remington rifles as well


* MY GUN: *
- Glock 22 Gen 3
- Comes with three 15 round Factory Glock Magazines
- Comes with Glock box (carry case)
- Comes with 541 rounds of ammunition (around 1/2 are hollow points and the others are FMJ, some have never even been opened)
- Has brand new Talon Granulate grips on it (I love these grips and put them on all my handguns...everything underneath is pristine)
- Functions perfectly. I've had around 100 rounds through it and i've cleaned/treated it properly after even 1 round was sent through the barrel.
- Check out the attached pictures to see my Glock22


* MY REQUIREMENTS *
I ask that your gun is in great condition as well (IE: not misused, general wear from shooting is A-Ok in my book), i'd also like if you were able to provide some ammo in the caliber of the gun - that way you're getting a setup you can go shoot the day of our trade and I could do the same.


* TRADES *
If you have anything that you think i'd like, shoot me a message to see if i'm interested. I'm just trying to find that perfect deal (like I have in the past on Armslist, where someone wants what I have and I want what they have). 


* WANNA BUY IT STRAIGHT? *
I'm not desperate to get rid of it and i'd rather trade, but I'd be looking to get around $550 for the gun + ammo, and $450 for just the gun....that'd include everything for the gun and the ammo."

Read more at http://www.k-var.com/shop/SLR107-21.html. If you are looking for a modern, Com Bloc factory-built mil-spec AK, this is it!

This particular rifle is in like-new condition, has 150 rounds fired for function check, folding stock locks up tight, sights are zeroed and straight as an arrow. No problems with function, reliable as expected, as with all well-built AK rifles. Very accurate.

Comes with original box and accessories (manuals, test fire sheet, 5rd magazine, cleaning rod, sling, oil bottle, buttstock cleaning kit).

The SLR 107 rifles had not been imported and out of stock for years until this summer, but looks like the supply is running down again. If you want a real, Bulgarian military AK, don't wait! The AK market is mercurial to say the least. 

Asking $1,000 cash FTF.

     - Less than 400 rounds through it. I am a freak when it comes to a clean gun and this was cleaned every time I fired it. One round or 150, it doesn't matter, I cleaned it. I am looking to liquidate a couple guns and this is the first one to go. I have a big purchase coming up and the extra cash would be nice. It comes with the original case, two 8 round magazines, a thread protector, and a Hogue rubber slip over grip. I also have the original lock and spent round from the factory. I also have the extra O-rings somewhere but cannot find them. I may or may not be able to find them by the time it sells. I also have the original manual. 

     - The price is pretty firm but for the right person, I could bend a little. So add in the Or Best Offer statement. But be reasonable, please.

     - I formerly worked for a gun shop and range and will not transfer this firearm without a valid Minnesota DL and Permit to Purchase or Carry. I'm not looking to sell this to some fool who just got out of prison. There will be a bill of sale and requires us going to get it notarized. If there is a fee, I am willing to knock half of it off the price. I'm not really sure how much that would cost though so I'm not too worried. I will only accept cash or a cashier's check for obvious reasons. If you are out of state it will need to be FFL transferred and all above steps taken to make this a safe and legal transfer. I WILL look into who you are, so don't try to pull a fast one. :)

Comes in it's own Pelican Case & Otis Cleaning kit (never used).

Topped with a NightForce 12x42x56 NSX with custom CH3 reticle w/ Badger 50 rings.  The scope is new and rifle shot one match with it.  I replaced my NightForce 8-32x56 Bench Rest with this new scope.  It's outstanding! Kind of like having a spotting scope on your rifle ;-) 

RCBS dies and lots of Components & loaded ammo.

Please understand; this is not your average AK 47. The receiver on this is machined from a solid block of steel instead of sheetmetal stamped and riveted together like most. I bought three of these still in plastic and smothered in cosmoline. I removed the deteriorated plastic wrapping, wiped down the outside, attached the slings, and stored them away. There is still cosmoline on the interior parts and the wood is very nice with minimal markings. This numbers matching rifle was imported by IDE in Michigan and I believe it to be unfired. The authentic boxes are gone but the original 10 round mag is included and 30 round magazines are still easily available. The milled versions are the most accurate and strong enough to handle modifications for SHTF scenarios. The one piece Monte Carlo stocks are much more durable than pistol grips. The more modern AR15s are nice to have but the AKs are a larger caliber and will operate much better in a more severe environment, sand, mud, cold, and wet. And they gain in value similar to other precious metals.
 I decided to let go of one before the election while it is still legal to sell, who knows what the future will bring? November 6th is right around the corner.  Along with the potential for economic meltdown there are numerous threats of riots and unrest by people who may not get their way, so don't wait until it is too late. Shipping outside of Iowa to your FFL will be actual cost, or I will be happy to do a Face-to-Face with Iowa ID.

For Glock trades, please let me know details about your offer such as: Are you the original owner? How many rounds have been put thru your items (also roughly from the possible other owner)? Are there any issues with your item? Do you have any conversion kits? Any upgrades to your item? Etc.... Hit me up soon. Thanks!

By the way, the Colt's trigger is awesome! The trigger may not look like a custom part, but the crisp smooth pull is a dream regardless!"

I'd be OK with any speed strips - you can never have too many of those! I'm not looking for a collector's piece either so it doesn't have to be in perfect cosmetic condition.
