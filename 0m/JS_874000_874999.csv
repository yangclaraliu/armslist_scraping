Please note that Magpul no longer includes the dust covers with Gen M2 PMAGs. If you really care about the dust covers, they can be purchased separately from various retailers ($1 each MSRP); no chance that dust covers will be banned - that would make it too obvious to the average American that this push for gun control has NOTHING to do with reducing violent crime and is targeted squarely at law abiding gun owners.

Nothing fancy here. Just home defense and good fun shooting.
I have put approximately 300 shells through this shotgun and have NEVER had a problem with her. She is a well built piece and will hold up for a lifetime. The front ball sight has been sheared off clean. Who needs that with such a short shotgun anyway?

Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control.

But I can say from experience (I taught OPFOR - Opposing Forces Weapons for awhile in the military) that this is a very nice clean example and a pretty sweet package deal.
(update- owner confirmed new, never fired)

- 3 FN 20"" barrels with A2 sight post and bayonet lug: 350 each
- RRA complete lower with Colt parts: 650
- SAA complete lower with Colt parts: 650
- 2 Colt, 1 FN flat top uppers with feedramps, stripped: 200 each
- 3 FN A2 uppers without feedramps, stripped: 200 each
- 2 Surefire M951 taclights with pressure switch and IR filter: 400 each
- 2 KAC M5 rail system, new: 250 each
- Several used KAC M5 rail systems: 100 each
- Miscellaneous parts, rail covers, foregrips, etc...just ask

I do not have any charging handles or bolt carrier groups. I am looking for 2 BCGs for a trade. 

I have enough parts to do a couple of complete uppers, minus BCG and CH, if interested.  With the miscellaneous parts needed to do the upper (dust cover, FA, flash suppressor) and the ability and facility to do a proper build, I will sell an upper for 700. Make me an offer. 

I am willing to part the lot for the prices listed above. All of these parts at market value 6 months ago would put the whole lot at 4500, plus or minus a couple of hundred. At current market value, the lot would easily sell for 6000-7000. I am deeply embedded in the industry, and can attest to the fact that nobody can see the end of the current shortage on parts. Lowers, uppers and barrels will be in short supply for the foreseeable future. I had posted previously and listed my original stock of parts at 3500. I have acquired many more parts and am asking for 5000 OBO for the whole lot."

Im selling my LWRC M6A2. This is a gas piston AR-15 and one of the best on the market. Also the serial number is under 1500 which makes it highly collectible. A LWRC M6A2, short stroke gas piston rifle. This is one of the nicest, sweetest shooting rifles there is. I own two of these and I'm looking to trade one for a  LWRC M6A2 Tricon

I own Knights, A Scar H, POF, Larue, LMT, So on and this is one of my favorites next to my POF Rifle. 

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

6 shot .22 Long / long rifle, 5 1/2"" Barrel, Excellent bore. Aout 96% Original Blue Showing virtually no wear with only a few cylinder drag marks and a small holster wear spot at the end of the ejection rod tube. Action works excellent (both single and double action) The serial number puts the gun at about a 1959 manufacture. Very shootable and very accurate. Put some CB caps in this and be real quiet, LOL. Come to me and I will even throw in a hard case.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Good bore and very little usage on the gun it is in excellent shape. It's been in the safe for many years only to be pulled for cleaning and inspection.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special, I will assume you are a fucking retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."
