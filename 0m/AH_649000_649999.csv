Sig Sauer Website Description/ Information:

The SIG SAUER® P220® defines accuracy – and reliability – in a .45ACP. But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target sights, SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset) and black anodize aluminum grips. (NOTE: Grips shown have been discontinued. We have replaced with a similar grip without the white SIG SAUER logo. They have just a stamped logo).

The P220 Match Elite defines the new standard in .45ACP performance."

I am looking for an older beat up lever action rifle that needs some or lots of work. Trying to find a winter project. Looking for a lever action rifle in 30-30, 22, 44mag. Condition is not important. Broken stock, rust, lack of bluing, small parts missing; all issues considered.

Just looking for a cheaper fix it up project / ""truck gun"". Not trying to make a profit and resell it. I just want to fix it up for myself and value the time and effort I put into it. I always though lever actions were rather interesting. Hopefully learn something along the way.

If you have a cheaper lever action rifle (Marlin, Glenfield, Winchester, Ted Williams, etc) that you would like to sell please contact me.

This one is not totally stock...   i mounted a low end rimfire scope, i think its a simmons if i remember correctly.   i took off the irons but still have them of course. I also have a green dot laser that mounts nicely on the factory rail but i never fired the gun with it on.  It comes with an extra mag for a total of two.
I also have a black hard case for it all if interested....  If u know these rifles they are extremely accurate and reliable...  will fire any ammo..

so 225 for the bersa
i want  550 for the smith which will include the accessories
dont piss me off with lowball offers    I am being fair and expect the same... if ur nice to me ill throw in some ammo since these are my last 22s and i wont need it

Built from a Vulcan Arms (check them out online) CA legal lower that I sold the upper from and replaced with a DPMS Panther, Stainless Steel, fully fluted, 1:9 twist rate, .223 chambered, bull barrelled upper with a picatinny rail equipped front gas block, an aluminum free float forend, flattop receiver, and DPMS fully coated bolt carrier group. Included in the sale are 2 10-round metal box magazines, a Center Point scope, 6-9"" bipod with quick close feature, Adjustable Ergo grip with palmswell and base plate, barrel vibration reducer, Magpul aluminum extended trigger guard, CalRad Bullet button, and the Badger Ordinance Extended Charging Handle #2 to clear the scope.

The optic pictured is a Center Point, Green/Red lit Mil dot reticle equipped, 4-16x50mm scope with high turrets for ease of adjustment plus 5 levels of brightness adjustment in each color. It comes with dust covers, front and rear.

The Ergo grip adds a ton of control for long range/accurate target shooting and the baseplate is perfect for a sandsock to finely adjust elevation of the buttstock in the prone position. 

The rubber ring on the barrel is there to reduce/eliminate the vibrations associated with  long barrels. The shock of the round igniting may catch up to the bullet by way of vibration through the barrel before the round has left it. I did notice a slight improvement when I added this.

This rifle has impressed me a great deal and the ONLY reason for sale is a necessity of funds. It runs smooth as can be and has been cleaned fully and properly after every outting. Maybe 5-600 rounds through this barrel, if that, and several trips out.

The New DPX Scope Saver (patent pending) found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, this new addition aces the optics mounted on your long guns inside the space in the door. The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe.

AXIS Adjustable Shelving — The Most Versatile Safe Interior Ever Designed. Period.
Browning ProSteel safes lead the industry when it comes to managing safe interior storage. Nowhere is our expertise more evident than with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving (patent pending). Unlike shelves in other safes that are either fixed in position or only offer vertical adjustment, Axis shelves can be adjusted, both vertically and horizontally, to accommodate items over a broad range of sizes while working around long guns. All premium Browning ProSteel safes feature the Axis Adjustable Shelving system. Platinum Plus and Gold Series safes come fully loaded with an all shelf interior that can be customized to meet your needs. Additional Axis shelves can be purchased to convert your Medallion or Silver Series safe to an all-shelf interior as well. Check out a Browning ProSteel safe with Axis Adjustable Shelving and imagine the treasures you could fill one with.

I haven't put a single round through the gun or modified it in anyway because I have too many projects going right now. Its definitely seen some use but appears to be in decent condition for its age. I dated it to be roughly a 1952 model year by its serial number.

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16"" barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

Also are 50rds of Speer Gold Dot +Ps designed for use in snub nosed revolvers, each box of 20 is worth 27$.
I also have everything that came with the gun, the box, papers, test shells, manual ect.
The gun is less than a year old, I have fired 100rds of Sellier & Bellot FMJ ammo and 10rds of the Speer Gold Dots. 
The gun is about 15oz, smooth with a crisp trigger. Great carry gun. 
There is also a small red stripe on the front sight.

This is a Colt Match Target Tactical Elite rifle. The barrel and forstock have been changed to more of a long distance configuration, with a  free floating Wilson barrel. The previous owner had some trigger work done and the trigger is very nice. He told me he shot a praire dog in Montanna at 680 yards, and I believe it. I have only put a few rounds through this gun in the year that I've owned it. I don't dislike the gun, just want to buy a new shotgun for deer season.  Even if you don't like the configuration, you can easily change it. Send me a text or give me a call if you are interested. Evenings are best for me. The gun is used, but in great working order.

I do more upland hunting and wanted something else. I bought it brand new around $1600 but I'm only asking $980. It comes with 5 original crio choke tubes. 

Also if interested, I will add three aftermarket Kicks High Flyer choke: Mod, Full, X-Full for a total $1050. Each choke cost me about $60 so this is a killer deal. Its a must need for duck hunting in my opinion."
