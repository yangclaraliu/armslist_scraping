Its in good condition overall but there a couple scratches in the receiver and some considerable wear to the blueing on left side of the barrel. The gun functions flawlessly, would be great for turkey, HD or take out the choke and shoot some skeet.

This is an original sniper, HIGHLY collectable and VALUABLE Vs. the new production 91/30 snipers. This one went through a pretty extensive selection process back at the Izzy factory to be put into service. Only 5 - 10% of all 91/30s were made into snipers

Every part has the Izzy proof, and all the serials are matching on the : receiver, bolt, buttplate, floor plate. The receiver has all the stampings typical of a very early sniper. The Scope is a repro, but the mount is original, manufactured at the Izzy factory as well.

Local pickup only since i dont want it damaged by UPS.  This unit works flawlessly.  Although its 20+ years in age, PW's engineers design built this this like a tank.  It puts other progressive reloaders to shame.

If it looks new, it's because it practically is.  The unit was stripped down, and every part was stripped, cleaned, hand sanded, painted/polished, relubed, and reassembled.  The star gear is being shipped to me since the one that is in it has a crack in one of its teeth.  Should have it installed by mid next week (8/22).  I also have a new wad finger, 1 1/8 shot bushing in it, and will throw in some powder bushings as well.  It is set up to reload when u pick it up.  All of the stations have been adjusted to load the perfect shell.  The pictures I posted dont show it, but there also shot (24"") and powder (12"") tubes that come with it.

I already have 2 addt PW's, making this one expendable.  It was a fun project, but its time to move on. I will send addt pics upon request.   Will consider trades (shotguns, handguns, or rifles) and it can be worked out accordingly with what you have.  Thanks for looking  Mike REDACTED"

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip.

Tannerite is a binary explosive used primarily as a target for firearms practice. Tannerite is unique in that it is exceptionally stable when subjected to less severe forces such as a hammer blow or being dropped. It is more than 1000 times safer than ordinary black powder since it is not flammable and can not be initiated by any kind of flame or electricity. It is supplied as two powders which are combined to produce the explosive. Tannerite is a trademarked name, and binary exploding targets are a patented invention by Daniel J. Tanner/Oregon.
Tannerite Company recommends using 0.5-pound (0.23 kg) preparations of the substance, which should detonate when shot by a high-powered rifle. Small caliber rim-fire or slow moving pistol ammunition will not initiate a detonation.
Tannerite detonations occur at a very high velocity, producing a large explosion and cloud of water vapor. It may be useful for persons who are firing at long ranges; in this scenario, a long-range rifle shooter places targets downrange, retreats to his firing position, and fires. The shooter does not have to walk down range to see if he has a hit, the Tannerite will detonate and serve as an indicator.
Since the two components are not explosive until mixed, they can legally be purchased in the USA without a license. They can be legally used for sporting purposes in conjunction with small arms, just like black powder and other exempt sporting powder.
The federal government, not the state, governs the manufacture of explosives. They specifically exempt the need for an explosives manufacturing license in five separate statutes. In the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Publication 5400. Q&A section, question #48 expressly addresses that a license that a license is not needed for personal, non-commercial manufacture and use of binary explosives. (Click here for link)
Got Questions? Tannerite offers an array of Frequent Questions (and Answers) in response to inquiries about our products and the policies that surround them. Feel free to bookmark the following list for future reference and watch for updates:
Can you make Tannerite charges smaller or larger?
Yes you can. To make smaller targets, you can simply mix a 1/2 pound target and pour the contents into a container of your choice. It’s best if the container is not brittle, but just about any container will work. Marksmen have good luck using Chew/snuff cans as target canisters. A really good idea when shooting either small targets, or when shooting at very long ranges, is to wrap the target in Duck-Tape. This prevents a spill or leak if the bullet strikes a little low and ricochets into the charge, or is a fringe hit, or hits the lid on the target. To make larger targets, simply tape one on top of the other and by hitting one, it will initiate them both…thus making a much louder target. Common sense and local noise regulations dictate how much you can use without getting cited for disturbing the peace.
How many spoons of catalyst do I mix into a target?
1 LEVEL teaspoon/5cc (one scoop) per 1/2 pound target. If you use too much catalyst, it will be “Fuel-rich”, not unlike a carburetor that is oxygen-lean, and you will get a sluggish explosion or none at all. For one pound targets, you have two options. You can simply double the amount of catalyst (two scoops/teaspoons per pound). Just don’t more catalyst than is recommended.
What if I am approached by an authority and questioned about my targets?
Be honest. Show them your Tannerite, explain what you are doing, and if they have further questions, offer them our phone number and website. We have been educating LEOs on Tannerite for many years. If you are doing something stupid though (like strapping targets to trees or otherwise destroying property on public lands) we will not support you. Tannerite is sold as a shot-indicator for long range shooting. If you get nailed for blowing up a computer and leaving trash on public property like so many idiots on You-tube, you are on your own. If you are told to stop shooting because others are complaining about the noise, then stop. Do not be as ass and taunt the bull.
How could something so fun, be legal everywhere?
Answer: Because Tannerite falls under the same laws as black powder and all other explosives that are exempt for sporting use. Refer to the link in the previous paragraph for more hard information on all binary explosives manufacture and use. Remember though, just because it’s a legal product if used as prescribed, does not mean that you can use it in any manner you wish. Not unlike firearms, you can legally shoot them, but there are places where it is forbidden. It is up to the end-user to obtain local authority permission before using our product unless it’s on private property. Even then, if you live close to others it’s best to contact them and explain what you are doing…the same as you should do if you set out to cap off your bowling ball cannon or shoot your 5o caliber rifle."

(.32 ACP) semi-automatic produced by Ceska Zbrojovka , A.S. (Czech Arms Co., Inc.), Prague, Czechoslovakia. German markings (Bohmische Waffenfabrik A.G. is equivalent to Czech Arms Co., Inc.) indicate manufacture when the CZ firm was under German administration shortly before and during World War II. German officers and police used this pistol extensively, and it was brought to this country in large numbers by returning soldiers.

Many Model 27 pistols are marked with a German World War II code (fnh) to denote place of manufacture.

The Model 27 is a blowback-operated pistol with exposed hammer. It has a magazine safety which prevents firing with the magazine removed. The grip on the pistol is almost at a right angle with the barrel, and this is not good for natural pointing. It is a relatively simple and rugged pistol, and compares favorably with other semi-automatics in functioning reliability.

This pistol is adapted to the .32 Automatic cartridge, one of the most popular semi-automatic pocket pistol cartridges in the world and produced in many countries. In most places outside this country it is known as the 7.65 mm Browning. It was introduced about 1900 in Belgium for the early model FN Browning pistol, and made its appearance in this country in 1903 with the Colt pocket pistol.

In most countries this cartridge is considered of adequate power for personal defense. This is particularly true in Europe where it is not only the most popular pocket pistol cartridge, but is also employed in many nations by military services and police. In the U.S. it is considered of inadequate power for personal protection, and the .380 Automatic cartridge is more generally favored for semi-automatic pocket pistols.

Field disassembly of the Model 27 is as follows:

(1)    Pull slide to rear until held up by magazine follower. Then depress spring-loaded pin on the right side of receiver, and slide disassembly locking piece on left side of receiver downward.
(2)    Remove disassembly locking piece with attached pin from left side.
(3)    While holding slide to prevent its springing forward, remove magazine and ease slide forward off receiver. Remove barrel locking piece, recoil spring, and recoil spring guide from barrel.
(4)    Rotate barrel bushing until mark on it aligns with mark on slide. Remove barrel bushing from slide.
(5)    Pull barrel partly forward so that its lugs align with clearance cut in slide, then rotate barrel a half-turn, and remove from slide.

""Czechoslovakian Model 1927 is not a rare pistol, but I consider an example with German markings to be an essential part of any German WWII handgun collection. The CZ Mod. 1927 pistol was adopted by Czechoslovakian armed forces in 1927 and remained in production under the German occupation until 1945, then after the war into the 1950s. Pistols manufactured under German occupation after June 1941 are marked ""fnh"" (not ""fnk"") ""Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7.65"". ""fnh"" was the WW-II German ordnance code assigned to Bohmische Waffenfabrik, Strkonitz plant, Prague, Czechoslovakia in June, 1941. It is reported that serial numbers under German occupation were re-started at 1 and went up to over 475,000. Your serial number should be located on the top of the slide just forward of the rear sight and beneath the barrel one inch from the muzzle. It may or may not be located on the upper left side of the frame above the safety lever.

Mossberg International brings an AR-style platform to you for under $300. Shooting has never been more fun and affordable.
Mossberg International’s new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today’s AR-style platforms with Mossberg International’s reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18” barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13” length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.

This is the youth model that has a length of pull of about 13 inches.  The stock is short enough for a youthful shooter, but long enough for an adult to shoot comfortably.  I am 5'10"" tall and can shoot with no problem.

The 20 gauge shotgun barrel is 22 inches long with a fixed modified choke and 3 inch chamber.  The gun is 35 inches long as a shotgun.  The 20 gauge is a much better beginner gun than the .410, because you have greater range and a greater volume of shot which means greater success.

The 22lr barrel is 18.5 inches long and has tru-glo type of sights.  It is also drilled and taped for a scope base...here is a secret...it will use the ""Thompson Center Contender Base"" which is easily available if you want to mount a scope.  The gun is 31.5 inches long as a rifle.

This is a very safe shotgun/rifle, it has a manual safety, a trans-bar safety system and it has the ""Taurus Security System"" that uses a key to lock the hammer from being cocked.  The key is pictured in the plastic bag on top of the box on the right side.  It has rings for a sling and the whole thing easily comes apart and fits into a carry case for compact transportation.

The gun is in great shape, I used it for small game hunting and not for range or overall plinking.  I have fired about 25 rounds thru each of the barrels.  I tried to explain the package in detail, but please send a message with any questions,...etc...thanks!"

The load of the shells in each box is 2-1/2 drams, 1 oz. , #8 shot – a favorite for dove & quail hunters.  These were inherited by me upon the recent death of a relative who was an avid bird hunter.  They were purchased several years ago as a full case of shells and placed in dry storage in west Texas - so they still look virtually new.  If you own a 16 ga. shotgun, you know that ammo is becoming harder to find locally.  Here’s a chance to stock up.  Also, because these are now considered “vintage” ammo, they’re even getting valuable to collectors – I’ve seen some of the empty boxes with clean art/printing selling on Ebay for more than I’m asking for the shells!  I hunt, but no longer have a 16 ga. shotgun.  So, if you’re a 16 ga. shooter and enjoy dove hunting or just breaking a few clays, this may be just the deal you’ve been waiting for.

It has had approximately 400 rounds fired through it, and is in excellent condition. It was upgraded by STI with an ambidextrous safety, and a Dawson front sight was also installed. This one is also finished in Chrome, which is a $300 option at the factory. The Trojan has an undercut trigger guard not found in their less expensive models. 

In addition, it has the Dawson ""ICE"" competition magwell, and it comes with SEVEN magazines (two of which are brand new) which work with the magwell. It also comes with the original factory magazine (which does not work with the magwell). The pistol also has some very nice micarta grips which add a great feel to the gun, and the original rosewood grips are also included. Lastly, it comes with a competition style kydex holster. 

This gun has performed flawlessly without one single malfunction of any kind. This is without a doubt the best quality 1911 I have ever owned, or even handled. The slide feels as if it is riding on ball bearings, and the trigger is so smooth and crisp you'd swear you were shooting a match bolt gun.

Here is a breakdown of what you get:

STI Trojan 9mm in Chrome - $1400

Dawson ICE Magwell - $100

Dawson Front Sight - $30

Dawson 10 round Magazines x 7 at $40 apiece - $280

Micarta Grips - $70

Kydex Holster - $60

Total: $1940

The gun comes in it's original case, and includes the manual and takedown tool as well.

I am willing to part with the entire package for $1500. If you have any questions, please call Brian at 920-two-one-six-9182 or email. Thanks!"

I work for one of the largest Global IT Corporations and am only doing this on the side to help us both out.  I am not only Microsoft Certified and CompTIA Certified, I have my BS in Information Technology as well.  The work I will do for you is what I do for much larger corporations on a daily basis, only much cheaper.

I can be contacted by replying to this email.  A typical onsite visit by me runs $80.00/hr, but I am very flexible and will work on whatever issues you have, regardless of the amount of units you have.  I do offer warranties on everything I do except for viruses.  When it comes to viruses, I will remove them and make recomendations on how to prevent them in the future, but since it is ultimately up to you whether your computer gets infected again I can only guarantee I will fix it, not stay clean...thats up to you.

I would prefer to help you out without the need for money to be involved.  If you have an issue and you have some old firearms laying around, then we can work out a deal...if not, cash still works..

I can provide links to the rates of the box stores if you want, but most charge around $125.00 for a diagnosis ( try to see if they take trade as payment...lol ), then an additional fee per hour/per computer to fix it and then it may take a week -/+.  I can come to you...

If you want the cheapest technician, then I am not your guy.  If you want someone who is very reputable, has tons of references from local and global companines that i support ( and I can provide some local for you to verify ), then I am your guy.
