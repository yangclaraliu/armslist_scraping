This is a lever action rifle.  The takedown means you can separate it into 2 smaller pieces ... allowing you to put into a backpack for instance.  Also allows cleaning of the barrel to be much easier.   

Has a removable magazine.  I find that to be very nice.  holds 4 rounds. 

This shoots very well, even with just iron sights.  Very comfortable, though I do have to move my ear protection headset up a little when I hold the rifle butt to my cheek, when shooting.  To me, it seems like very little recoil. 

This is by far the nicest rifle I have... nice wood stock, the barrel is painted.  Considering how clumsy I am, I hate to even take it into the woods with me!   

The lever has a nice embossed Browning graphic with a brass color fill. 

Why would I sell this?  I don't want to, but I don't really need it.  I have 2 other 270 win rifles (Remington 700)... and they seem to me to be much better hunting rifles; synthetic stock, bolt action, unbreakable ... :)  .. 

I bought this at Specialty Sports in January.  I paid $900 and change. It has had maybe 150  rounds shot through it.  It is in excellent shape. 

Included is a soft carrying case and a hard plastic case. 

I also need to pay some bills.  I got behind while getting my Jeep engine rebuilt.

It's tough to see it go, because these are so hard to find in this price range, but it's time to push this toy aside for something else.

It comes with the factory GI style sling, heatshield, and an aftermarket 30-round magazine. 70 rounds of Federal and Remington brass-cased ammunition are included. More pics are availible if you email me. 

The price is high because I don't want to sell it. I would rather trade it. Sale value is $550, no negotiation. Why? Because I have to take $500 to the gunshop and buy a $350 gun that's been marked up $150 to $200. Then I added $50 in for the ammo, sling, and magazine.

The trade value is $400. I would prefer a trade. Currently away for the summer but will be back in Greensboro at the beginning of next week."

Not a big deal. Cheap to replace. Works fine with plyers. 
Thanks for looking.

I also have around 10 extra Remington Golden Sabre self defense rounds - bonded jacketed hollow point - bad puppies. The revolver is small but it is also a +P rated gun so you can fire higher pressure rounds. Some of the rounds I will include are +P self defense rounds. The pistol is quite accurate at 7 yards which is more than enough for self defense or home defense. I can create 2 to 3 inch groups at 7 yards fairly regularly. SA/DA. Quite devastating and easy to hide. Price is firm considering additional ammo.

I could also just pull the hammer back and fire all 8 rounds in SA. Of course, you could also rack the slide extremely easy and have 8 SA shots. This gun is particularly nice for ladies as the slide is very easy to rack. Has a nice trigger reset for very fast follow up shots. Includes 3 mags (expensive) and they hold 8 rounds each. I also have a laser that’s built specifically for the gun. Other than that, I have a Pachymer grip on it which is really nice as well. Great little gun especially for carry, just trying to raise some money as we need it for bills. I paid over $425.00 for the gun with the laser. It has around 500 rounds fired. It is very easy with ammo. I haven’t found a brand it doesn’t like. I have been using Armscor with very good results. For $565, I will include  350 FMJ rounds, about 20 rounds of JHPs plus a partial box of Hornady Zombie Max rounds which are the same as the Hornady Critical Defense rounds except with an zombie green polymer tip instead of orange (about $240.00 worth of ammo total). The Zombie Max are very serious home/self-defense rounds. I will also include a few Magsafe .380 rounds which are also very powerful home/self-defense rounds. I take very good care of my guns. I clean them EVERY time I go to the range no matter how many rounds fired. You'll find the barrel of this gun to be mirror clean and the rest of the gun is also very clean. There are some minor surface scratches on the slide but they are not deep. Just light scratches on the finish. The gun is is great shape all the way around. Price is firm considering the ammo and extra mags.

Ask me about my Crossbreed leather IWB holster I had made for the gun as well as a number of other holsters I bought to try out. I will give you a good deal on all the holsters so you can decide which one is best for you."

Its a 45acp commander (uses full siz mags) in all stainless with trijicon nights sights. The fit and tolerances of this gun are amazing and it is crazy accurate! There is a slight idiot mark from the guy I bought it from and there are some light marks on the back of the mainspring housing, but there is no damage or any gouges. Id call it a 98% gun and it has been well cared for.

It comes with the original case and mags. This thing is definitely top quality with all tool steel parts that are hand fit from the factory. If you're looking at this add then you know what this is.

I would be interested in partial trades with some cash, or a trade of equal or greater value. I wouldn't mind another 1911 as long as its not a bobtail. I also need some good glass for a rifle (uso, nightforce, PR, S&B, etc). Drop me a line with any questions. Thanks!

I am trying to sell some of my wife's jewelry that she does not use any more. Most of the ""scam central"" gold stores in the upstate offer way less (25% less) than what 14Kt scrap gold is worth. 

It weighs 13.6 grams with a few diamonds incrusted in one of the pendant (not sure what is worth for diamonds). At today's gold price, a gram of 14 Kt gold is worth $29.75/gram.

The jewelry is not damaged and it is all 14Kt white or yellow gold chains with pendants (diamond pendant, cross, etc).

I offered it to my son, and he has bigger hands than me and it didn't work for him, either.  This gun has had under 50 rounds through it.  Even with the limitted shooting I did with it, I was impressed that it shot well.  The gun was thoroughly cleaned out of the box as well as after the one time it went to the range.

This 9mm pocket pistol includes two 7 round clips, a good after-market carry case, a very nice unused pocket holster, original box and paperwork and a 50 round box of ammo.

July 26, 2012 
Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) and TALO Distributors, Inc. have teamed up to create a limited edition USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ rifle. This special run is limited to just 5,000 rifles, with serial numbers GOLD-0001 through GOLD-5000. A $20.00 donation will be made to the USA Shooting Team for every rifle sold. This is a historic opportunity to own a collectible Ruger® firearm and support the USA Shooting Team at the 2012 Olympic games. 

""We are proud to team up with TALO to support the USA Shooting Team,"" said Ruger Vice President of Sales & Marketing Chris Killoy. ""Every person that buys this rifle will be part of a team contributing $100,000 to support USA Olympic Shooters, and we're excited that Ruger and our popular 10/22 Takedown™ rifle are part of this patriotic fundraising effort,"" he concluded.

The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is a stainless steel rifle with a distinct blue stock. Like all 10/22 Takedown™ rifles, the barrel and forend are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction-fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but rarely needs re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is also shipped in a special red ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features the USA Shooting Team logo. The bag features internal sleeves, which hold the two subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

“NEW for 2011 - Introducing the OUTBACK-IID: The same great OUTBACK-II size and performance is now user-serviceable. It can be disassembled for cleaning. The OUTBACK-IID is a highly advanced thread mounting .22LR caliber suppressor adaptable to almost all .22LR rifles and pistols. For its tiny size, the OUTBACK-IID has premium level sound reduction dry with some of the lowest first round in the industry, outperforming many significantly larger units. While a true bargain, Gemtech doesn't skimp on quality: 7075 high tensile strength aluminum is used (not cheaper, weaker grades), and a non-galling titanium thread mount area instead of cheap steels. It is finished in an attractive and durable matte hardcoat finish in black anodizing. Everything that makes up this silencer is premium, except the price. It mates well with virtually any .22LR firearm which can have the barrel externally threaded. It is usable on pistols as well as a wide variety of .22 rimfire rifles. Since mounting to the firearm is accomplished by attachment to muzzle threads, the suppressor can be quickly removed for cleaning, compact carry, or storage. IN SHORT: the best .22LR suppressor at the best price; a true ""Sweet Spot"" between sonic performance, price, size, and weight. The Outback-II is America's most popular suppressor for many good reasons, all backed by Gemtech's proven decades of the best customer service in the business!” –gem-tech.com

These start as standard marlin lever guns but are then cut down to 16 1/4"" and re-crowned and this does NOT hurt accuracy. Cutting eliminates a secondary barrel harmonic causing a more stable barrel during firing. All of these Brush Hogs are then media blasted and refinished in a two tone parkerized finish. The sights are then replaced with a ghost ring set and the lever is then replaced with a larger loop. Stocks are replaced as well. Before assembly we then perform our own trigger job to the rifle bringing it to 4 pounds while also re-hand fitting and deburring your bolt group to your lever and action for smoother more reliable operation. These are very nice refined rifles. We are a licensed FFL and perform all work in house and can perform the same work on your rifle.  If you have any questions contact me at 1-REDACTED or email me.

With all due respect to Sir Newton, the KRISS engineers have been able to use his law to the shooter’s advantage. Unlike any other firearm ever invented, instead of having all the recoil force slam back into the shooter’s shoulder, causing massive amounts of felt recoil and resultant muzzle climb, the Kriss-USA System absorbs and redirects these forces downward and away from the operator thus enabling him to better control and keep the KRISS firearm on-target. More control equals more rounds on-target, more of the time. 

Kriss-USA Super V SBR/SO Features:

* Ambidextrous bolt release lever, fire controls, and magazine release 
* Closed Bolt, Delyaed Blowback, Semi-auto Patented Super V System

This is an original Norinco NHM 90 rifle in 7.62x39 that has been converted to the originally intended AKM format. It is built on a stamped receiver and has laminated wood furniture with a tapco slant muzzle brake. This weapon is the very definition of reliability and has functioned flawlessly every time it was taken to the range. The round count is still under 2000 and even though its an AK platform rifle, it has been maintained as meticulously as any AR could hope to be.

Also included is 300 rounds of steel cased ammo (which has always shot like a dream in the firearm) and two steel 30 round magazines.

Yugo Capture Kar98k:
First off is a prime example of a Yugo capture Kar98k. I picked up two last week and would like to see if I can trade this one for something else. Anyway, the bore is in one word, pristine. Mirror shiny, not a spec of dirt, rifling is perfect. Bluing on the entire rifle is outstanding, 99% overall, the 1% comes from a tiny little streak about 1/2"" long near the muzzle that is ""blemished"" if you will. All matching numbers and has sight hood. Yugo crest is crisp. Has a sling.

Czech 98/22:
The other is a Czech 98/22, bore is great with shine and sharp rifling, bluing is very nice as well (faded on the receiver from honest wear). Numbers on the stock, receiver and barrel match. Has a sling. 

Trades:
- Arisaka Type 99 or 38
- complete AR upper, in .223, 7.62x39 or 6.5 Grendel, barrel length at least 18"". Quad rails would be nice as well. 
- Yugo M48 ""sniper"" (just an M48 that has been D/T'd for scope)
- Swedish M96 ""sniper"" (no, not expecting an M41b, just an M96 D/T'd for scope)
- Any scoped mosin variant

The silhouette has a system of hinges on the back, which enables individual movement of silhouette limbs, torso target plate or head target plate. The impacted target plate automatically resets. Our standard model is 3/8"" thick AR500 which we've tested with shotgun slugs, .223 AR and 7.62x39mm AK rifle rounds from 35 yards, as well as 30-06 rifle rounds from 100 yards. We also have a 1/2"" thick silhouette model for larger caliber rifle use, such as 300 win mag.

Our AR500 steel is certified for ballistic-resistance. THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR ALL AR500. Every batch of AR500 plate we buy is tested, and we reject the material that does not measure-up.

Our HITman is easy to setup and take apart for transporting to your shooting spot or moving around your range, taking only about 10 minutes to assemble. Yes it is heavy, but breaksdown to 25 to 40 lbs pieces. Grab a buddy and it is easier than you think.
