We use case-law examples to show not just how the laws are written, but the spirit of the law, how they have been interpreted, and how jurors may view a case. 

Sadly, the majority of law-abiding citizens who have been charged with a crime after using self-defense may not have been charged at all had they understood the laws. 

While acting in ""self-defense"" many CCH Permit holders have been convicted because their actions were based on incorrect information about the laws. 

Don't take chances. Insist on learning the laws from the best.

Great condition.
This one is truly a jewel and fine momento from history.The Radom is widely considered to be one of the finest handguns ever made, and ahead of its time sharing only the look of a 1911.  My grandfather took this from a German officer in Battle of the Bulge (so my father tells me.) He brought it back and had it Nickel plated (oops.) The later grades of Radoms were known for inferior finish, however, I beleive my grandfather refinished it because he had access to the plating shop and he loved things that were chrome or shiny (cars, jewlry, etc.)
This has the shoulder stock slot and all the levers. That tells me it is at least a Grade II. There is no Letter(alpha) prefix to the serial number, which hints that it was one of the very first german issues. Germans used alpha prefixes. Also, it was common for the later grades to have mis-matched S/N's. This one has ALL MATCHING S/N's. There are several german proof stamps as well as SS and Maltese cross stamps. 
I beleive this could be a pre-invasion polish made unit which was later simply stamped and issued by the germans. 
I have quite a few pics but can only upload a couple here. If you are interested I can certainly send more pics and try to answer any questions.

Sportsman in the Sage Green.  Bought two of them new in July 2011.  One gets ridden a lot and the other one not so much.  So I'm deciding to sell the one that doesn't get used much (It still has the stickers on the rims).  

It has 83 miles and 20.7 hours which gives the average speed of 2.5 mph.  Selectable 4x2 – 4x4 automatic with 498cc single cylinder 4 stroke motor.  Basically bone stock except I added a Kolpin double rifle rack.  Got $6000 in it and would like to get $5500 out of it.  

Might consider a 357 caliber lever action for partial trade in or a Darton crossbow.  Other than that it will be cash only for title.  

Scammers, spammers, tire kickers or offers to help me sell it please don't waste my time or yours.  Trailer shown in the pictures isn't included."

No cracks or problem areas, the topstrap is in good shape, cylinder locks up tight with no play. I have fired this gun (18 rounds of .38, never .357) and it functions flawlessly. Never dry fired, and the hammer/pin are in fine shape.  Original grips with wear.  Due to the lack of bluing, I keep this gun clean and covered in a light layer of machine oil at all times.

This particular knife is Custom Fixed Blade 048. It is made from O1 high carbon tool steel, and has a cold blue stonewashed finish. The handles are burnished copper, and are overlayed with black linen micarta. The holes in the handle are lined with nickel silver tubes. The blade is RAZOR sharp, and the tool steel has excellent edge retention while still being easy to sharpen, making this an extremely beautiful and extremely practical knife.

I will be selling this gorgeous blade for $350 or best offer. I am also open to trade for AR-15 parts plus cash. The price is firm and non-negotiable, this knife is worth every penny and I like it enough to keep it if the price isn't met. The knife comes with two sheaths. The first is a tight fitting, custom molded Kydex sheath that is equipped with a Mini Tek-lok. The second is a custom leather sheath, also hand-made by Todd Szczechowski. The knife's exact measurements are as follows:

Overall Length: 8 and 3/4""
Blade Thickness: 1/8""
Cutting Edge: 4""
Blade Depth: 3/4""
Hardness: 59-60 HRC

Smith & Wesson® M&P Shield Semiautomatic Pistol


•A compact, lightweight pistol that’s ideal for concealed carry
•Less than 1"" thick and 6"" in overall length
•Packed with M&P features for superior performance and reliability
•Two magazines included

Smith & Wesson’s M&P pistols are the handguns of choice for many law-enforcement units, and for good reason. Rugged reliability and accuracy combine with solid construction to make the M&P line stand out in a highly competitive field.  Now Smith & Wesson offers the lightest, slimmest and most compact semiautomatic in the M&P family – the Shield™. Less than 1"" thick, 6"" overall length and weighing just 19 oz., the Shield is perfect for concealed carry or a law-enforcement backup gun. Striker fired with a low bore axis and an 18° grip angle, the Shield delivers a natural sight picture and points instinctively. The consistent trigger pull and short trigger reset enhance accuracy and make for fast follow-up shots. Unlike some compact semiautomatics, the Shield is outfitted with a thumb safety for added peace of mind. Chambered in 9mm with a 3.1"" barrel, accuracy is outstanding for a compact semiautomatic. Maintenance is easy with the patented M&P No Tool Takedown System. A steel recoil-spring rod adds durability and the captured spring speeds the takedown and cleaning process. The Shield comes with two magazines, a seven-round version that fits flush with the base of the grip and an eight-round version with an extended finger rest.

I recently purchased this rifle with the intention of building a long-distance rig, but I'm short on tuition for the Fall semester and need to sell.

This is an FN SPR A2 in .308 Win with a 24"" cold hammer forged, chrome lined, fully floated, heavy profile barrel.  This rifle is based on the pre-'64 Winchester Model 70 action.  It comes set up with a detachable box magazine system which includes one 4 round magazine.  The rifle is equipped with a fully adjustable McMillan A4 stock.  This is the very same stock the USMC uses on its M40 series sniper rifles.  The stock has a height-adjustable comb and is adjustable for length of pull via spacers.  The rifle is also equipped with a Badger Ordnance 20 MOA scope base.  The stock has been glass-bedded with Marine Tex.

I have not fired this rifle.  I have only removed it from the box to function test it.  The rifle comes in the original box with the manual, gun lock, the factory test target showing a 3-shot group of 0.64"" at 100 yards, and the factory logbook which details the only 8 rounds that have ever been fired through this rifle (at the factory).  If you've been planning on building something like a Rem 700 for long range shooting, consider this rifle as a pre-built, tried and true alternative.

In addition to its high quality components from well-known manufacturers, this rifle comes with a lifetime service policy from FN.  If you are interested or have any more questions, feel free to email me.  I have added a stock photo as I only have a crappy camera phone, but you're more than welcome to read what people have to say about these rifles here:

http://www.snipershide.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=2540582#Post2540582

Note that my price on this rifle is FIRM.  I purchased the rifle for almost $1600, and I'm selling it in the same condition I received it in.  If you are familiar with TAC-CORD on Sniper's Hide or ARFCOM, this is one of the very rifles you will receive from him, but for a couple hundred dollars less.

Low round count- Under 200 rounds through it.  Modified the grip area for better trigger reach and more natural grip, and added a knurled extension to the mag release for easier mag drops.  

The finish is scratched up on the left side of the receiver where the scope mount used to be (the area around the 3 bright screws in the pic- that's off now) nothing to cry about really- you can get it re-blued or duracoated if it's that big of a deal... Ak hunters make nice galil clones with a little work. 

  Shoots 1-3 moa depending on the ammo. Likes the heavier rounds more. Probably could get 1-2 moa all the time if you mount a scope on it- the receiver is tapped for it from the factory-   

I'm looking for a pistol in trade, I'd prefer either a Springfield XD tactical (5 inch), XD 9mm ported,  or 1911 pistol in 9mm or 45ACP, a revolver in .357 mag or larger, an HK pistol in 9mm or 45ACP, but will consider other offers.      Thanks"

I have a new Rossi 357 That was bought new in May2012 by my brother. I bought this gun from him in early June 2012 because he was needing money. I do not have any use for another pistol so I am selling. It was never shot until I got it and I put 6 rounds though it. I do not have the box, but this gun is 100% perfect condition. I have a nice holster that comes with it.

I live in Richmond but I work in Greenfield and can be in either location depending on the time of day. 

The only thing I will trade for is a 50hp outboard or higher. I may consider any other boat type stuff you might have. 
I am firm on the price this is a $400 gun I am asking $300

This isnt the dime a dozen bolt-action 70's or the tube-fed semi 60's. 
This is the rarer 70 clip-fed semi-auto and its a squirrel edition stock. 
I've only seen 3 for sale and they are asking between $180-215. 
They are not like mine. 2 are older versions, and 1 early 80's all plain stock. 
Mine has the original factory glenfield 4x15 scope. 
Its in excellent shape, only a couple light scratchs on stock, blueing is excellent with 2 scratchs on barrel near front sight. 
Has 1-7 round clip, and 1-25 round ramline. 

THE PICTURES DO NOT DO THE RIFLE JUSTICE!!!!!!!

I'm asking $210 for it. 

Earlier in the week a Glenfield/Marlin squirrel edition, tube-fed, same scope and same conditon went for $190 so my harder to find CLIP-FED 70 is a good price at $210.

These older Marlins are super accurate and reliable especially with bullet extraction cause the bolt has 2 extractors not 1 like most!!!!!!

I will entertain trades also. Looking for something for home defense or pocket carry, I can throw a few $'s on top and a custom made fixed-blade knife thats worth an easy $80+.

Its easier to get hold of me through this ad and if you want to talk to me I'll send you my phone#.

It's a miniature 1911 - there's no cooler everyday carry gun!

This is the HD version that is stronger and harder to find.  Has tritium night sights.
Comes with one factory 6rd mag just as from factory.  I also have 3 extra 7rd mags and 2 Colt 6rd mags for an additional $100 (I paid 150 for these a month ago).

This gun is perfect for daily concealed carry, and I can even carry it in mesh athletic shorts without noticing it.  Very small and light.  I just have too many guns and need to get rid of some, since I have my first child on the way.  This one is worth more than most that I have, so I'd like to sell it first.

It was purchased from a friend of my parents whose father brought it back from Germany after WWII. Aside from occasional firings it has been kept in it's hard shell holster in a lock box. According to the serial number it was made in late 1943 or 1944. The gun is marked on both the left and right sides with the Nazi 359 stamp. The serial number is 192 d ac 44. The only issue with the gun is that it needs a firing pin cover which came off the last time it was fired. The absence of this part does not prevent the gun from firing and the part sells on various sites for no more than $30. It is a sweet shooting gun that is deadly accurate. It's even more accurate than my Luger. The price includes the hard shell holster and two clips. I have lots of detailed pictures of the gun that I can send you if you want a closer look at it. To see those and if you have any questions feel free to email me. Thanks for looking.

Varnish on the walnut pistol grip stock is chipped and scratched and the metal is mostly plum brown. No dents, cracks, or damage. The TAKE DOWN action is as tight and crisp as can be. It ain't pretty, but can do anything the new one can and with the 32"" barrel, it can reach right out there! A good working tool for farm or hunting that's also an ANTIQUE. Why buy a stamped tin model from Brazil, China, or Russia that may last a couple of years if you're lucky? Those used CHEAPOS that are listed as ""shot only twicet and worked perfuct"" are on the market for a reason. I've owned this Marlin for 16+ years, shot trap and varmints out by the barn and it's a turkey shoot sleeper. It does kick however. Don't want a long barrel? Cut it off to any length you want down to 18 1/2""!!! It's machined STEEL not stamped tin like Mossberg.
