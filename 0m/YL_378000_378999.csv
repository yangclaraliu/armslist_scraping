Not interested in .40 or .45s unless they are full size. Looking for reliable brands such as Springfield, Beretta, Glock, Ruger, Taurus, S&w etc. 

1 Rifle and 2 Shotguns 

1969 Belgium made Browning Safari 7mm mag - w/ sako bolt-action. Nice new Redfield scope and Leopold rings/mounts. Has waterproof flip-up covers and nice sling/case. 

New - Never fired in perfect condition Browning BPS pump 20 gauge w/ 3 chokes/wrench. Orig. paperwork is included.

Used - Good condition Belgium made Browning Gold Hunter Auto-loader 12 gauge w/ 3 chokes/wrench. Orig. paperwork not included. 

First shotgun that goes gets a new soft case, the other one does not. I have  4 boxes (100 shells) of 12 gauge ammo and a full box of 7mm Remington mag. 

If your handgun is worth more retail i will offer cash to compensate. As i expect on your end as well. A very low offer will probably get a rude response back, were talking ''Browning'' they hold value and you get what you pay for.

I already have a few conceal carry guns  so i would prefer to add to my full size collection, but don't let that stop you. Worst i can say is no so don't be afraid to shoot me an offer.  (No Hi-points Please)"

I fired a box of ammo through it and it's too small for my liking (I have large hands). I had no FTFs or any problems with it at the range using Federal ammo from Wal Mart.

I'll also throw in 92 extra rounds ($28 value) since this is the only 9mm that I own. I bought it for $258 and that price did not include the mag extender which you will be getting with it along with the extra ammo. 

This is the parkerized version so it will never rust. There are no dings or scratches on it, it is basically still new. Give me a call or text at REDACTED (Martin). I work odd hours so if I don't answer, leave a message. 

Make sure you have your driver's license and I will either accept cash or I also have PayPal. $230 firm, I think that is more than fair. Thanks."

Key Features

2.5-inch Turbohead

Precision micro-textured reflector

Can temporarily blind and disorient an aggressor

Special shock isolation to protect lamp

The M6 is an ultra high-output incandescent flashlight featuring a 2.5-inch Turbohead that produces a tight beam for long-range illumination, and special shock isolation to reduce the chance of failure of its lamp from impact or vibration. It uses a precision micro-textured reflector and a SureFire incandescent lamp to produce a smooth, brilliant beam with more than enough power to temporarily blind and disorient an aggressor by impairing his night-adapted vision, or to reach out and illuminate distant areas. Output is either 250 or 500 lumens, depending on which easily installed lamp you use - high-output or ultra high-output. The tactically-correct push button tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on. High-strength aerospace aluminum body. Mil-Spec hard-anodized for extreme durability. Weatherproof O-ring and gasket sealing. Includes high-energy 123A batteries with 10-year shelf"

All the engineering, precision manufacturing, and hand-fitting the Brown family is famous for is included, and we've added to that a new severe use coating for improved wear resistance and rust protection. A unique and highly durable Chainlink pattern provides a secure grip for severe applications.
The Special Forces features the following:
* 5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy.
* Weight: approximately 38 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.
* Exclusive Chainlink treatment on forestrap and mainspring housing for the ultimate in durability, secure grip, and extreme use.
* Slide coated with Gen III for low glare, superior rust protection, and improved wear resistance, with traditional ""square cut"" serrations on rear of slide only.
* Fixed dovetail 3-dot night sights with high visibility white outlines.

This gun is in great condition and includes two magazines the bag and paperwork, it includes the factory grips and there are aftermarket grips on the gun. I am the original owner of this firearm. Safety is single side. There is a small area where the finish came off due to a loose plunger tube - it is not very noticeable and pluger tube was properly re-staked (see pictures). This gun has less than 700 rounds through the gun and is an excellent shooter.  Check out the pictures - this gun in beautiful.  I can email more pictures to you as well showing the gun from just about every angle.

Price is $1700.00 cash for face to face or add $40 for shipping to your FFL.

Comes with box, papers, 2 mags, spent shell casing from the factory, factory night sights. Would be 99.9% (as it has very low round count, under 100 rounds, I think I am at 75) minus some wear in the bead blasted area at the front of the trigger guard and below the barrel from being carried on 2 occassions. Every DW cbob that has been carried will have this (at least every one I have seen). Again it is not a scratch / you cannot feel it, just wear and can be fixed by re-bead blasting if the buyer would want to. Other than that the gun has no scratches or wear to speak of.

This single action revolver proves to be extremely adequate for cowboy fun, target practice, and self defense if need be.
In my opinion the original model is more efficient than the new model vaquero (2005-present) because of it's distinct advantage of being built like a tank. The older Vaquero can take on more heavily pressurized and formidable loads due to its thicker chamber walls. I always clean barrels and guns after switching from shooting cowboy loads to shooting jacketed hollowpoints; Tim Sundles from buffalo bore recommends this.

Ive had this gun for about a year now and I love it, its a nice piece of my collection, but its simply taking up to much room, and Im trying to down size my collection.  Wish it didnt have to go!  It has always shot without any issues or problems.  Ive put about 150 rounds through it, the previous owner said he only put 50 through it,  so i dont think its been fired much really.  Its a nice shooter and very fun to own.  A very nice looking gun.  I also have ammo to go with it.  If you buy the ammo and gun I am willing to cut you a deal (no need for the ammo without the gun).  I have in total 735 rounds for it, about 100 or which are hollow point.  All rounds non corrosive, and are silver bear, or brown bear.

I have a 1916 Guardia Civil mauser in .308/ 7.62 caliber nato.  It is in very good condition,  the wood is nice, especially for the age, and bluing is very good too, and so is the bore.  Its the nicest one I've seen, and you won't come across these often!  This round is very fun and packs a good punch.  This gun has shot very nicely and has never given me a problem.  This is an amazing piece of history to own, I hate to see it go but I need to start down sizing my collection, just not enough room. So my loss is your gain!  You wont find a nicer one of these guns, especially at the price!

  I also am selling a 1938 8mm german mauser, the reciever has turkish markings though that date 1940, which from what i understand by asking around is that the turks often reused guns from other countries, so its built with german quality, but has a turk marking on the reciever. The barrel says germany on it. Not sure if I should call it, a german or a turk gun, but it is under 1938 8mm german mauser in the rifles section.  But in all a very nice gun and a great shooter. It also comes with 286 rounds,  $250 obo for both the gun and the ammo!!

1969 Belgium made Browning Safari 7mm mag - w/ sako bolt-action. Nice new Redfield scope and Leopold rings/mounts. Has waterproof flip-up covers and nice sling/case. 

New - Never fired in perfect condition Browning BPS pump 20 gauge w/ 3 chokes/wrench. Orig. paperwork is included.

Used - Good condition Belgium made Browning Gold Hunter Auto-loader 12 gauge w/ 3 chokes/wrench. Orig. paperwork not included. 

First shotgun that goes gets a new soft case, the other one does not. I have  4 boxes (100 shells) of 12 gauge ammo and a full box of 7mm Remington mag. 

If your handgun is worth more retail i will offer cash to compensate. As i expect on your end as well. A very low offer will probably get a rude response back, were talking ''Browning'' they hold value and you get what you pay for.

I already have a few conceal carry guns  so i would prefer to add to my full size collection, but don't let that stop you. Worst i can say is no so don't be afraid to shoot me an offer.  (No Hi-points Please)"

I have a 1938 8mm german mauser in good condition.  Some wear, but it is to be expected for the age of the rifle.  The wood is still in good condition. The reciever has turkish markings however, dated in 1940, but the barrel says 1938 germany right on it.  From what I could find out by asking around and finding people who knew a lot on this sort of stuff, they all said that turks reused a lot of rifles from other countries, and that is probably what happened since it shows both german and turkish markings. Meaning it was built with german quality originally since it was originally a german rifle. Not sure what to properly call it, german or turk, so i put german for the adds sake.  But in all a very nice gun and a great shooter.  8mm is a very fun round that packs a punch. I have owned this gun for awhile now and it made a good piece of my collection, but its time to let it go.  Im going to be moving soon and I dont want to move my whole collection with me which is why I am  also in the process of down sizing my collection a little bit.  It has always shot nice with no problems. The gun is $170.  It will come with 286 rounds for another $50 making it a very good deal at $220 for both gun and ammo.  I am losing money on this deal, 286 rounds of ammo alone is worth $100 by itself, but Im moving soon and can't take this with me.  Make me an offer, I am a little flexible on price

Manufactures Number: 21860

The FN Patrol Bolt Rifle XP (PBR XP) is a direct descendant of the SPR long-range precision rifle family, utilizing many of its features and built with unmatched craftsmanship. The specially designed FN/Hogue synthetic stock features an aluminum pillar full-length bedding block. Pillar bedding utilizes aluminum bosses embedded in the stock insert at the critical action mounting bolt locations. The aluminum pillar bedding enhances accuracy by providing rock-solid stability over the full length of the stock, thus minimizing shifts in point of impact due to external environmental factors like temperature or humidity. The PBR XP is available in both 20""and 24"" barrel lengths. All XP models are chambered in .308 Win. / 7.62x51mm NATO caliber, with the new 300 WSM chambering also available in a 24"" FLP model. All PBR XPs feature a cold rotary hammer-forged medium heavy fluted barrel with a four-groove, right-hand, 1 in 12"" twist rate and recessed target-style muzzle crown. The PBR XP is available with either a four-round removable box magazine or with a hinged floorplate magazine. The PBR XP is built on a Pre-'64 style bolt-action featuring Controlled Round Feeding, a massive external claw extractor, proven three position safety and a one-piece MIL-STD M1913 steel optics rail utilizing oversize 8-40 mounting screws.
