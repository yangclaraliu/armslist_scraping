DO NOT contact me unless you are serious in purchasing.  Now gawkers or tire kickers.  

HK MP5 SD .22LR. This is a licenced HK product.  Has HK stampings, worlds ahead of the GSG5 that is regularly seen.  Comes chambered in .22LR, cheap fun plinker with full size rifle feel, weight and controls. Steel upper, polymer lower, faux intregal suppressor, 16"" barrel. In very good condition.  Only wear marks are from rail mount that was on the rifle.  Extremely reliable and accurate.  Will eat any cheap ammo you can put through it.  It is not ammo sensitive like the GSG copy. Comes with 1 original magazine, instruction manual and tool for adjusting ammo velocity, though I've never had to use it.  I've run 1200fps and 1650fps ammo through it fine.  I'd expect sub sonic to run fine too, but never tried it.  Break down is super easy with 2 push pins.  Don't deal with tons of screws like the GSG.  

If you are reading this ad, it is still available.

DO NOT ask me to meet you half way somewhere in a parking lot.  YOU MUST come to me to pick up. Bring a rifle bag with you, or I can throw in a basic hunting rifle bag for $10 extra.  No carrying it openly to your car. 

Valid FOID Card required. No exceptions. I will ask to see it.  No trades, only for sale for cash.

This is a series I Pro Carry. If you don't know what that means, then you probably think this gun is overpriced.
Short version: The series II added the California-legal firing pin block safety system, which adds complexity and makes teardown more complicated, among other issues.
Google searches for ""Kimber series I vs Series II"" will tell you all you need to know.

Otherwise, this is a nearly-new condition Kimber, ready to go into service.
I comes in the original hard case, and includes 1 Wilson Combat 8-round mag.
Also included is a set of bronze (Silver installed) medallions for the Pachmayr grips, and some extra screws for the grips.

The gun has also been thoroughly cleaned and lubed with Slipstream Weapon Lube, oil and grease. This is some seriously slick stuff, and smooths up the action even over what it was before, which was pretty sweet.

Trades for other guns considered. Pistols and AR platforms preferred.
Feel free to make an offer, but please don't be upset if I decline.
More photos available for serious inquiries only.

IMPORTANT: I greatly prefer that this be a FTF or in-state (NC) deal.
Shipping is available, but you'll pay for whatever service you want me to use, and I'll have to send it to your FFL dealer of choice. Dealer fees (if any) are the buyer's responsibility.

NOTE: To the person who asked about ammo, your email address was rejected. Check it and try again. To answer your question, I have a few rounds of ball ammo, but not enough to really consider a plus. Maybe 10-15 rounds."

I've had this post up a few weeks now and it is clear to me that I need to alter my description due to the number of offers I get that want my gun for nothing.

This may sound harsh but I don't need to sell my gun. I just figured someone needs one like it and I could either trade it or sell it and get more hunting stuff.

The gun is a Marlin XL7 in 30-06 caliber. It is near mint, has only been fired 40 times (two boxes of shells) and is camo colored. It has a Luepold Rifleman 3x9x40 scope in near mint condition as well. The current street price for this gun is over $650.00. 

I am asking $550.00 for mine. It is worth every penny. Great shooting gun. I am selling it because I have the same gun in .270 and it doesn't kick me to pieces.

I am also willing to trade for $550 worth of hunting stuff (or as close as I can get. Hunting stuff I need includes deer feeders, game cams, a 30-30 lever action, hang on stands, climbing stands, shooting house, good 3d targets, archery stuff, a Scott arrow release, a pink camo bow for my 8 year old daughter, and any other stuff you might want to trade.

I would rather trade than have the money to be truthful, but that doesn't mean I want to lose money. We have to be close before I'll want to trade. 

Make me an offer and let's see what happens. TEXT REDACTED or email me.

I will drive any reasonable distance if required.

I have included some pics below.

Thank you."

 Used - I would say anywhere between 75-85% condition. 

The wood is in great shape, the bluing is good with the exception of just a few areas. The blueing at the end of the barrel (including the boss exterior) is worn. There are small surface scratches on the receiver but not bad. Without the thin blueing on the end of the barrel, is a very nice gun. I have tried my best to get a good picture of it, but my phone camera isn't the best.   The Boss system is designed to reduce recoil, accurize the ammo, and serve as a flash hider.  Research it online if you aren't sure what it is, there are all kinds of good reviews on it.

Looking to keep the scope, but will sell it with the gun for the right offer.   It is a Leupold Vari-X III 3.5x10x50 EFR with Leupold rings. Scope is in similar condition to the rifle. The exterior has scratches/scuffs, but it is very clear and the internals are in perfect working condition to my knowledge. Please message me and I can try to get some better pictures if needed.

Looking to sell or trade up or down.  Let me know what you have, I'm open to all sorts of things... I will not trade for new prices on guns because I'm not looking to get new prices for mine.

The barrel is a dedicated 16"" 22 LR (WASP) barrel by CMMG with a 1:16 twist, the action and collar are all stainless steel (the nicest action sold by CMMG), charging hande is made by CMMG for dedicated 22 uppers. It has the regular m4 sight base, a magpul moe carbine handguard, and an A2 flash hider (which can be unscrewed by hand to attach your suppressor should you have one. The upper receiver is a Tactical Innovations AR-15 receiver. And comes with 2 - 25 round magazines.

This is a cream-of-the-crop build, it is nothing like these cheesy, toy-like dedicated 22 AR's that S&W and Mossberg are putting out, this upper has the look and feel of a real 5.56 upper, it is sturdy, feels great, looks great, shoots fantastic (both accurate and reliable - still yet to jam in the first 300 rounds with the cheap Federal Value pack ammo), yet still in a lightweight package.

This upper is a fantastic training tool for your AR (you can practice at 3-4 cents a round, compared to 25-50 cents a round for 223/556, this adds up very quickly! You could dump a mag of 22 for the cost of a couple rounds of 223!). It is accurate enough to be a hunting rifle. Install on your AR lower takes maybe 10 seconds. Spare mags can be purchased for $20.

I have exactly $632.31 into this upper, not including the rear sight (Rock River Arms Dominator [$150] and sightmark red dot [$75] which are not included in the $550 price. I am not looking to make any money on this upper, I am just wanting to start another project. If you want the rear sights (which are Co-Witness) I would do a package deal at $700.

So, it is $550 for the upper with no rear sight, or $700 with the Iron & Red Dot. OR BEST OFFER - But please be reasonable!

Before contacting me please be serious in purchasing.  Now gawkers or tire kickers.  

HK MP5 SD .22LR. This is a licenced HK product.  Has HK stampings, worlds ahead of the GSG5 that is regularly seen.  Comes chambered in .22LR, cheap fun plinker with full size rifle feel, weight and controls. Steel upper, polymer lower, faux intregal suppressor, 16"" barrel. 

In very good condition.  Only wear marks are from rail mount that was on the rifle.  Extremely reliable and accurate.  Will eat any cheap ammo you can put through it.  It is not ammo sensitive like the GSG copy. Comes with 1 original magazine, instruction manual and tool for adjusting ammo velocity, though I've never had to use it.  I've run 1200fps and 1650fps ammo through it fine.  I'd expect subsonic to run fine too, but never tried it.  Break down is super easy with 2 push pins.  Don't deal with tons of screws like the GSG.  

If you are reading this ad, it is still available.

DO NOT ask me to meet you half way somewhere in a parking lot.  YOU MUST come to me to pick up. Bring a rifle bag with you, or I can throw in a basic hunting rifle bag for $10 extra.  No carrying it openly to your car. 

Valid FOID Card required. No trades please.

It is very similar to the K-31. This rifle has a gorgeous Walnut stock and a bright shiny bore. It is a very accurate rifle. It has been cut down a couple inches and re-crowned (long before it came to me.) It may have been one of the military conversions when they changed the rifles to carbines. This is a very accurate rifle. 

Like all of the rifles in the Schmidt-Rubin family, it is a straight pull design and demonstrates the exceptional quality the Swiss are famous for. 

These rifles are known for being very accurate, ammo is readily available online at a reasonable price and, unlike most military surplus rifles, it is non corrosive which is why the Swiss Rifles look so good after all these years.

This rifle was built in the WW1/WW2 timeframe. There is an interesting piece of history around these rifles. The Swiss managed to stay neutral by being militarily well prepared (and playing both side.) The swiss were such good marksmen that one time a visiting German general came for a Diplomatic visit and a Swiss commander bragged that he could mobilize 1million men at a monets notice. The German responded by asking what he would do if Switzerland was invaded by 3million men. The Swiss commander said, each of my men will take 3 shots and go home."

Model: 1894 Saddle Ring Carbine

Year of Manufacture: 1897

Caliber: .30wcf

Barrel: 20"" Nickel Steel

Finish: Blued worn down to a nice silver with strong bluing still in protected areas. Firebluing on the loading gate is still visible.

Bore: is in outstanding condition. An easy 8-9 out of 10.

Sights: 
Rear: Earliest style flip up ladder sight(One just like mine, but in far worse condition just sold on eBay for $182.49 for the sight alone!) 
Front: Blade bead with ivory bead insert

Wood: Forend is in good condition overall. Stock has some shrinkage and someone put a recoil pad on it before I got it.

Metal: overall the metal is in really good shape with no real pitting or major handling marks aside from:
The saddle ring stud broke off. This is an easy fix. $18 in parts and $20 in labor.
The upper tang has a very old repair on it. This does not affect the function at all. 

Overall this is a beauty of an old Winchester levergun and an addition to anyone's collection.

It has a magpul prs 308 stock, miad grip, and a daniel defense rifle length lite rail. I installed an ARgold .308 trigger as well as a slash heavy buffer for the ar10. The bolt carrier is a chrome plated dpms one to match the barrel. All lower parts were from rock river, but the safety selector is the bad ass ambi safety selector. I also have 4 pmag 20lr.

$2400 without the bolt carrier or 2700 with it. No I won't take less, the parts alone will run you 2.8k...and that doesn't include the assembly. I also have no interest in parting it out. Email if interested.

They are good because they are much cheaper to use, just as effective, and a lot better for shooting indoors (which is mainly what i did at ranges).  Another great fact about them is they can be converted to shoot .40s and .45s if you want to get off the ranges or a little more fire power.  I also attached a red dot site, nothing too fancy, probably $70-80 but it helps.  It is in almost mint condition.  I have shot it once, and did a little under a hundred rounds.  Everything fired well.  Its a great gun, just not for me.  If interested e-mail me with questions or offers.  Happy to provide pictures upon reply.

Anyone interested in getting a great bike for a great price, I've got a 99 HD Road King that needs to make room for a new baby.  My proposition is simple, I'll do a partial trade on the bike for SASS type rifles, Fals, or others in .308 plus cash.  That way someone gets a Great bike on the cheap, and I can further my shooting collection.  Ill let the bike go for 7k cash, or 6k cash and trade, ie a 2k rifle and 4k in cash.

It is serial # EK9318. Low use. One of my favorite side arms due to its accuracy, power, and trigger, lack of use has brought me to a point where I feel it’s best to find it a new home.

It is my understanding that the “ Enhanced “ version of the Colt King Cobra came during the latter portion of its manufacture. The enhancements by COLT included factory drilled scope mounts, a recessed crown, and a larger cylinder latch ( borrowed from the python ). The enhanced version is denoted by the serial number beginning with “ E “, in this case EK9318. 

Please email me to request additional pictures. The price on this item is FIRM. I am in no big hurry to sell and compared to what I am seeing at gunbroker and in the market, the price is fair and equitable. This King Cobra is in excellent overall condition and has been well cared for by the documented original owner. It comes with the original Colt hard case ( pictured with my original receipt ). Note: I also have 3 boxes ( 150 rounds ) of Sellier & Bellot 158 grain FMJ ammo for sale for $ 65.00 ( no tax, no shipping charges ). PRICING IS FIRM.
