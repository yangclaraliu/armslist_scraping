3,http://www.armslist.com/posts/267003,For Sale:  89 IROC Z28 convertible Tune Port 5 speed - all new! BEST OFFER OR TRADE,"Lake County, Cleveland, Ohio","$ 4,250","Listed On: Tuesday, January 3, 2012",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Car is an 89 IROC Z28 with Tune port, 5 speed and 3.43 gear ratio - Convertible.

The previous owner bought the car for his daughter - Brand New in 89. she kept the car forever but ran it out of oil or something and blew the motor. They took it to the dealership and (got raped) had the engine replaced - obviously stock crate motor from GM. at that time the dealership also replaced all the fuel lines, fuel rail, injectors, plugs, wires, and a whole bunch of other stuff I’m forgetting. Basically they got him for over $7,000! 

After they had it all fixed up she decided that she did not want the car anymore so Daddy put in the garage where it sat for a couple years. Then the guys son decided he wanted it. The interior was faded from having the top down all the time so he had the top replaced and stopped there because he lost interest. 
That’s when I got it. I proceeded to replace all the brakes, put in a new performance clutch, throw-out bearing, slave cylinder, starter, etc etc. 
Then I went to work on the interior - I have well over 2K in the interior - all it needs is carpet and horn button (i was planning on a new grant steering wheel). I had the door panels and seats covered in Black Leather (real leather) With the tan Ulta-Sued inserts and re piping around the outside. (Looks much better in person - pics don’t do it justice). 
I also have new door pulls and $500 worth of Dyna-mat to lay down before the carpet and in the door panels, etc.  
I have all new seam sealer and Under coating from Eastwood (over $300 worth)- was planning on painting everything inside so it will NEVER rust! 

The driveshaft and a few other components were already coated when I was doing the clutch.

After all that, it was time to paint the car - *the car never had any rust. The paint was fading and starting to check up on the trunk lid and hood.
I paid for all the materials and a deposit to a local painter that does good work, he took over 3times the amount of time we agreed on and asked for more money, after paying him more money and waiting another month I got fed up and pulled the car. He did manage to paint everything and wet sand it, all that needs done is to buff it all out.! 

Please do not try to low ball me, the car is 90% and with a little work she will be almost perfect - I even have a buyer that is willing to pay $7,000 or more depending on how well its finished! I could arrange an agreement with a possible deposit if you plan is to finish it and re-sell! I just do not have the time and due to some more unfortunate circumstances I need another vehicle asap! 

I think the car just turned 100K miles but the motor is new - the clutch, tires and a lot of other parts have maybe 50 - 60 miles on them! 



OK now that you know what I got - I am looking for a nice 4X4 truck or big SUV. I WILL consider all autos. If you have a nice truck I can add cash on my end if it really worth it. If you have a bike, quad, etc. I may consider trade with cash on your end!.... Let me know what you got. - I also like guns - willing to consider any trade involving firearms.

For best response just respond to this email - if you leave a name and number i will call you or text you if thats what you want.
Thanks and happy new year."

http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=TA01NSN

This is a Trijicon ACOG I purchased in 2008 and used for several months on my M16 in the Diyala province of Iraq. It has been well
maintained and is in approximately 90% condition with a little wear showing on the turret covers and integrated iron 
sights. This model is the NSN full line red illumination which has the entire reticle glowing red with tritium at night 
instead of just the very center.

It comes with the original Pelican case, Lens-Pen, carry handle mounting hardware and all the documentation including warranty card 
and receipt. It also comes with a Kill-Flash that has minor damage to the honeycomb but it is not visible through the optic and is not noticeable
from the front unless you inspect it very closely.

The Pelican case has some wear from being shipped to Iraq and then back to the US but it is not cracked or damaged.

This scope has the markings JN8:12 for John 8:12, Trijicon no longer marks their scopes with this anymore, kind a collectors piece or just 
an interesting bit of history since there were a few people throwing fits about it.

I will ship this scope at the buyers expense if they wish, with tracking and delivery confirmation."

Kimber Ultra CDP II
Kimber link: http://www.kimberamerica.com/1911/cdp-ii

This is an officer sized 1911 - it requires officer grips and officer magazines.

In addition to the stock as-built parts, this pistol will come with:
- Stag smooth grips (as pictured)
- Original Kimber grips
- 6 Wilson Magazines (2 w/ small pads, 4 w/ standard pads) - Officer Sized
- 3 Kimber magazines - Officer Sized

I have put approximately 1100 rounds through this handgun - it has been immaculately maintained. I have had no major issues with this handgun after the break-in period (first 400 - 500 rounds). There is some minor holster wear - it was carried exclusively in leather, no Kydex. This was my primary carry weapon for several months before I switched to a commander sized Kimber and then later to a Springfield TRP.

I also have a Milt Sparks VM-2 (Black) holster - this is quite possibly the best concealment holster you can find. I'm the original owner of this holster, it was purchased directly from Milt Sparks. There is currently a 6-8 month backlog for a VM-2 holster.

Rifle is very accurate and in much better shape than it’s age. Only problem is that she jambs after every other round. Shoots great as a single shot, but will stove pipe the next round. I completely striped her down and did not see any obvious issues. Called a gunsmith who told me their minimum charge is $100.00 plus what ever parts. If there is any one out there familiar with this model or a better gunsmith than I am; $75.00 is a great deal. If she doesn’t sell, I’ll part her out and make a few $$$’s; but just don’t have the time now.  Based on no serial number on this rifle, I would guess her age is 50’s or very early 60’s.

Mine is the second run bar10 modified bushmaster .308. It has NO issues with bolt and chamber. 
***THIS IS ACTUAL GUN IN PHOTOS***
This series is a highly sought after model that is hard to find!  
Someone asked the other day why is this gun hard to find? Because everyone that owns this model keeps it, due to it reliability and accuracy.

The BAR-10 was meant to compete in the .308 market against Armalite's AR-10 series rifles and Springfield Armory's M1A Rifle by offering a .308 rifle that could accept the relatively inexpensive metric and inch pattern FN FAL magazines.

**Due to funding and lack of demand this complete model was sold to Rock River Arms in the 2006 year range**  
Now that the demand has increased for this caliber- Bushmaster has came out with an OCR model. The OCR gun is a nice model but was not built to the standards of the original BAR10. 

A2- Bar10 308 - With factory upgraded Skeleton stock and Izzy Muzzle Brake

ONE OF THE MOST ACCURATE 308s ON THE MARKET

It is in perfect working order, with minimal signs of ever being used.

The Bushmaster .308 series was manufactured in late2004-2005

THIS IS NOT THE O.R.C.- This is the first edition that was built better than all the rest to beat the competition. was the only ambidextrous 308 on the market! Perfect for Righties or Lefties!!! 
These guns sold for around $1,800 stock.

Heres what Bushmaster has to say about this gun:
The magazine controls are ingenious, both in how they have been adapted to the FAL magazine and in how their ergonomics offer the shooter improved control. The magazine catch is a spring-loaded latch that engages the locking lug on the FAL magazine’s upper rear face. The release is fully ambidextrous. When the release is pressed from either side, a lever retracts the latch and the magazine drops free.

Like the magazine catch, the bolt release is a departure. It consists of a one-piece bar that extends across the bottom of the rifle just forward of the trigger guard behind the magazine well. Pressing down on either side releases the bolt. The optional ambidextrous safety transforms the Bushmaster .308 into the only fully ambidextrous AR-type rifle available. Bushmaster also eliminated the sometimes inconvenient charging handle latch, replacing it with a hidden spring-loaded detent in the center of the charging handle that engages a recess in the upper receiver.

The upper and lower receivers are made of forged 7075-T6 aluminum. About half of the .308’s components interchange with those of .223-Rem. caliber rifles, but none are stressed, so reliability is unaffected. Two versions of the Bushmaster .308 are available—an A2 type with fixed carry handle and sights and an A3 variant with a flat top upper receiver and a three-rail gas block. Barrels are rifled with four lands and grooves in a 1:10"" right-hand twist.

The Bushmaster rifle came with an optional Ace Ltd. “ARFX” skeleton stock. This stock replaces the “A2” type fiberglass stock with one of hard anodized aluminum that is both lighter and stronger than the original. The stock has a closed-cell foam cover over the buffer tube. This provides a much improved cheek weld, and dampens vibration and noise. The stock comes with a 1/2"" thick recoil pad that has a “tacky” feel that helps hold the stock in position."

I am looking for a long shot here. I am looking to trade my customized 2008 Epiphone Les Paul Standard in Heritage Cherry Sunburst for a .300 WINMAG or .300 Remington Ultra Mag rifle. Would prefer the .300 WINMAG. Not entirely picky on the brand although a Model 700 is my ideal ""dream"" rifle. 

The guitar is in great shape. The only flaw is a little peck that didn't even go through the clear coat. You can only see it if you reflect light on it. 

The guitar has many upgraded parts. I paid $500 for the guitar brand new, and have sine added $500+ in parts.

-Gibson pickups (the same you would find on the 2009 Gibson Les Paul Standard) - $140 each {2}.

-Gibson chrome tailpiece - $65.
-Chrome Tune - o' - Matic bridge - $74.
-Gibson tone/volume ""pots"" (the tone and volume controls) - $15 each {4}.
-Gibson Amber Top Hat knobs that they don't sell anymore (originaly had those bulky black knobs) - $21.
-Gibson tone control switch with the tip that matches the ""binding"".
Brand new input jack and the plate that holds it in was swapped to match the ""binding"" (original had a chrome plate that just didnt look right).

Will sell for 175.00 cash as well.

These kits are generally not available to the public and are very rare and hard to find to the average citizen.

For those who do not know what this is, it is a very popular, widely used training aid for Law Enforcement and Military units, giving them the ability to train with non-lethal, low energy ammunition in their actual weapon without using live ammo or blanks. It provides the actual feel of recoil and will cycle the slide as it would with actual ammo.

This easy to use, drop-in barrel and firing pin accepts the Simunition FX paint marker ammunition, and the CQT polymer (plastic) bullet ammunition. I will provide an ammo source to the buyer, if they are not in law enforcement or military. 

THIS KIT WILL FIT THE GEN 1-3 GLOCK 17 ONLY! WILL NOT FIT GEN 4!

These kits sell for up to 450 depending on the type of weapon you need it for. I am asking 175.00 for it, with free Priority Shipping with tracking.

This is an excellent opportunity to own an excellent training aid.

I will accept PayPal payment for this and ship anywhere in the lower 48 for free with tracking number.

It is an easy shooter with very little kick.  It was purchased for my wife who has decided she likes a different firearm instead so it has become a safe queen and there is no reason for me to keep it around.  Not really interested in trades but if thats what you can do I do like new toys so I would consider the offer if its something I like.  No junk though such as Jennings, Lorcin,Cobra, or  High point.  This is a decent quality fire arm so offer should be of similar quality

The small, pocket-sized Vz.50 was developed during late 1940s for police use and it was chambered for the marginally powerful 7.65x17 Browning ammunition. Apparently influenced by the Walther PP in design, the Vz.50 had several differences in safety and disassembly. In the early 1970s the basic design went through minor face-lift, and the ""new"" design received the designation of Vz.70. Many Vz.50 pistols were refurbished to Vz.70 standard, with different finish, grip panels and a slightly different safety lever. New Vz.70 pistols were also manufactured between 1970 and 1983. After the replacement in service of the older Vz.50 and Vz.70 by more modern 9mm Vz.82 pistol, most were sold as surplus, as Cz-50 and Cz-70, respectively.

The Vz.50 (commercially sold as Cz-50) is a compact pistol of all-steel construction, firing the relatively weak 7.65mm ammunition. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed. Magazines are single stack. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. Vz.70 (Cz-70) pistols are similar, with minor differences in the finish, shape of the safety lever and grips. Manual safety is a lever at left side of the frame, behind the trigger guard. To set on safe: pull the lever down; if the hammer was cocked, it will be automatically brought down to rest. To disengage safety: push the lever up; a red dot will appear on the frame.

I have installed a Hennings Custom fiber optic front sight (currently a green light pipe - I have several red, green, and yellow pipes). Also replaced the stock recoil spring with a much heavier one, to allow use of +P+ ammo.
