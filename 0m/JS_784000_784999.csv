The gas-piston system of this rifle is similar to the AK-47, it uses a gas port forward in the barrel to force a long piston op-rod backwards; discharging the casing and loading a new round. The gas system has two settings, both of them appear to be of the same port size (providing a dirty-port alternative; in case of a gas system failure)

It’s chambered in .223/5.56mm and has a 1 in 7″ twist rate barrel. It’s capable of using AR-15 type magazines that are widely available in a range of capacities. The rifle has an “HK-Style” sight system (rotary distance adjustable rear, post-in-ring up front) with an additional rear sight integrated into the rail system (emergency backup only; it’s a very flimsy piece of hinged steel). The rifle has ambidextrous safety selectors, and an AR-15 style magazine release.

The grip angle is a bit more swept back, and a longer reach to the safety selector, than the AR-15. The reciprocating charging handle is located on the right side of the weapon, directly attached to the bolt. The trigger is a two-stage of pull, that breaks cleanly and evenly with repeatable first stage take-up every time. The Stock is a plastic Swiss-Style side folder, similar to that of the Sig SG 550 rifles. The bold hold/release is in a similar location to the AR-15, but operates on an extended pivot system comparatively.

Comes with:

1 -Sig 556 Rifle
1 -Box
1 -Paperwork
1 -30rd Metal Sig Sauer Mag
1 -30rd Lancer Smoke colored mag (in picture)
1 -Extended safety lever (factory safety lever included as well)
1 -Swiss Bayonet with scabbard and Lug (installed)

The description below is from the T/C website.

SIMPLICITY IS ELEGANCE Its sleek profile and “sealed pivoting breech” lever action design make this muzzleloader one of the simplest on the market. Simple to operate, simple to clean.

SEALED PIVOTING BREECH DESIGN The Z5’s unique action operates by using the forward motion of the trigger guard lever to pivot the breech block downward, allowing easy access to the 209 primer pocket. This closed breech design seals the 209 primer away from rain, snow or sleet.

SUPER RELIABLE The Z5 is a closed breech muzzleloader, which protects the 209 primer from foul weather. Its sealed breech plug is specifically designed to avoid the problem of crushing Pyrodex® Pellets, which could cause a misfire.

MAGNUM CAPABILITIES FOR LONG RANGE SHOOTING The Z5 can handle 150 grains of Black Powder or Pyrodex equivalent, or three 50 grain Pyrodex® pellets. The Z5 offers flatter trajectories and increased down range energy."

I have a 2007 Suzuki GSX-R 600 for sale. 12,400 Miles (Near mint Condition) I can no longer ride due to my Disability, hate to see her go. 

Its the most desirable color combination, Near mint Condition, Has a few, very very small blemishes here and there from normal use. She runs very strong never had any problems with her at all. Always garaged and stored properly, This bike runs amazing, looks amazing and handles amazing.

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

Anyone can have them there, this just happens to be one of mine. I will be selling WITHOUT RESERVE a home defense shotgun, several knives, a collection of silver money, some watches and other things mantique related. This type of auction was developed and has matured in our facebook group ""Shoals Gun Enthusiasts"" and we run them there all the time. The way it works is We post an item for sale and the people reply to the post with bids. The item is only offered for a couple of minutes so the bidding is live and it is similar to having a live auction with absentee bidders bidding on the internet at it. 

YOU MUST be registered on the site (which is free) to be able to post and bid. The payment is typically done in person since it is mostly local but if you are out of the area, I can take paypal and ship to you, that is fine. I am not worried about what the items bring, but you be SURE if you bid and win, you complete the transaction with me. It is your responsibility to get up with me and get your merchandise or pay me for the shipping...

If you are the winner of the shotgun (which is my personal weapon), you need to be certain you are legally able to buy one. While I am not taking it to someplace to transfer through an FFL unless you live out of state, I will be writing a bill of sale and we will sign it to cover my tooter :-)

It is a lot of fun and the members we have on the FB group (1450 of them) love doing these. The website was just setup this past weekend so there isn't a lot of competition for you on the stuff yet, its a good time to get in on some bidding. There is also several discussion forums, a timed auction there and classifieds so you can post your for sale or wanted items."

Circa 1964-1972 

Left over from my sale of my AR-15 awhile back are the following mags. 

All mags are in excellent condition.

20 round mags are really the most practical because they allow prone position shooting. The longer mags stick out too far IMHO. 

I don't have to tell you that high capacity mags of any kind will be a distant memory after new gun legislation in new year. 

Pre-banned ""COLT"" mags are always at a premium, so during this craziness, they are even more in demand. 

""Get Them While You Can"" Manufacturers will be slow to reproduce because they will be afraid that new laws will prohibit the sale and manufacture of any high capacity mag."

Rifle has never been fired.   9-shot Tubular Magazine, American Black Walnut stock, Micro grove JM stamped barrel plus I still have the original box it came in.  Rifle has a few superficial scratches since it has not always been in the box, but it is in like new condition.  I am sorry I can not locate the original literature that came with it … too many moves I guess.

I purchased this new in July of 2012

10+1 capacity with standard white dot sights.  

3.5"" barrel 

It comes with all original documents, case and equipment.  

Three mags included. One has a pinky extension. 

It also has two extra interchangeable palm grip panels ( not shown in photo...forgot them in the safe ) 

Also included is a black DeSantis holster - Right handed. 

This gun has the ambidextrous safety but does NOT have the mag safety, meaning it can be fired without a mag inserted in the gun. 

Slide is black finished stainless steel. 

Approximately 150 rounds through the gun between two trips to the range. It functions perfectly with FMJ and hollow point rounds. Never have had a failure of any sort. 

Always cleaned and well oiled and stored in my safe.

Trades
-Quality AR-15 optics as a partial trade. Not looking for a scope more along the lines of an Aimpoint M2 or similar.
-Ammo- 5.56/.223, 9mm, and .308 
-Would also consider a few handguns as partial trade. If trading  for a handgun I would prefer to do face to face. Might be interested in XD/XDM 9 compact, M&P 9mm, Taurus Judge, possibly a couple other compacts. 
If shipped you are responsible for knowing all state and federal laws. If face to face valid DL to prove your age is required if I question it and you must be legal to own a firearm. I wont sell to anyone who I think might misuse the firearm.

Gun is located in Durango,CO would maybe travel a little bit for a serious buyer or trade."

Accuracy is equivalent but comfort and usability are the same.
The HS precision Kevlar stock is much better fitting and functional.
Better trigger a little lighter and handles / shoulders way better. This is the first weatherby I've owned and am really a remington 700 guy. If I were buying another new I'd likely go with the Sendero but just because of the price difference and again the accuracy is parallel.
I have (2) 7mm mags and am wanting some a little more economical to shoot. Comes with bushnell elite 3200 3-9x40 scope mounted and zeroed.

Gun is wrapped with a non tape camo wrap to protect and camo the gun(no residue on the wood) I have 20 ends of Hornady SST custom 150gr, 20 rnds of hornady match grade BTHP, 40 rnds of tulammo, the 203g brown bear soft point is what I have been hunting with so I think I have 10 or so left and I have 10 or so of the cheap Russian surplus ammo, bore sight (7.62x54r casing type), tool kit, scope is a Tasco pronghorn (not bad glass and its got a lifetime warranty). Love the gun but now that deer season is over I want to sell this and get a left handed gun seeing as I shoot left handed. Price is non negotiable as the work done to put on the mount and get a bent bolt  is not cheap, do the math on scoping a Mosin and you will see this is a very fair price. $300 for everything. Email for more pics  I have pics of everything. Will trade for an SKS (will add cash or a shotgun to the deal) or nice pump shotgun with interchangeable chokes or just tell me what u have to trade."
