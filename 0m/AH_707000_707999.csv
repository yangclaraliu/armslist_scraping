All of the parts are Springfield Armory, and they were all produced around the same time as the rifle, in 1943. Has the not so common lock bar rear sight on it as well. The main feature of this rifle is that it may have the Army Corp of Engineers insignia on the stock. I've had a few guys at my local gunshop agree on that. Condition wise, for a rifle, produced in 1943, it's in great shape. Only cosmetic issue is a scratch on the stock. It's nothing deep or damaging to the rifle, purely cosmetic. She shoots beautifully. This rifle is definitely one of a kind in my book and quite a historical piece. There's no telling what this old rifle has seen... Open to negotiation."

The Rossi Matched Pair has set the standard for 2-barrel guns. This combination long gun package is unequalled, having been recognized as the best 'youth-size' gun and a top notch 'full-size' backpack take-along. We start with one of our popular single shot rifles, then hand fit a shotgun barrel to create the Matched Pair. The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range. Available combinations are listed below. Change Barrels Faster Than You Can Change Your Mind To change barrels, make sure the firearm is unloaded. Loosen the front swivel and remove the forend and swivel. Open the action and insert the barrel, replace forend, tighten the swivel and you are done and ready to shoot. One screw, one minute, no tool, no kidding!"

[3] 30 round mags 
[1] 5 round mag 
[460] rounds of Wolf 7.62x39 jacketed hollow point ammo.


Best offer takes the lot. For context check out item 320767915 or 320267733 on Gunbroker. This is an out of production SBR-ready rifle by Arsenal I haven't seen one actually sell for less than this in over 2 years. I don't feel like sitting on mine so I'm willing to give a deal and the mags n' ammo to go with it.

I've had this rifle for about 2 years and put MAYBE 200 rounds through it the whole time I've had it. Literally- the ammo you get in this deal is the remainder of the half-crate that I bought for the gun when I first got it. It's a slick little gun but it just doesn't get that much love from me because my range time is usually dedicated to my build projects or handgun work. 

This gun is actually appreciating in value at a pretty steady rate, but I'm a project guy. I'd rather have some guns to tinker with than a pretty one that just sits in the safe, and really a fine machine like this should go to somebody who will actually fire it. Has some light finish marks from getting moved around in the safe but overall is in like-new condition.

This is a very lightly used and very well taken care of Glock 17 Gen 4 that has professionally installed and Loctited TruGlo TFO fiber optic/night sights installed as well as a "".25 cent trigger job"".  This is where all of the stock trigger parts are used but they are lightly polished at all of the engagement points to just smooth out the trigger pull.  It really makes a nice improvement to the stock trigger but does nothing to affect the reliability of anything.  The feed ramp was also polished to ensure reliable feeding of all types of bullets.  It has approximately 650 rounds of all brass cased ammo through it and has been very well cared for and cleaned.  It shows almost no wear and is in mint condition and has been 110% reliable.  I will also include 2 brand new Glock factory 17 round Gen 4 mags and the gun sits in the factory box with all original paperwork and accessories.  It has also just been completely cleaned and is sighted in and ready to hit the range.  The Truglo sights are around 90.00 alone and work great both day and night.  I can meet for a face-to-face at the Henderson PD substation on Green Valley Pkwy to do the transfer and get your new blue card issued...no exceptions to this...the transfer must take place and you must bring your ID and get the blue card issued in your name.

Slide is marked ""Model of U.S. Army"". The magazine is a Risdon contract magazine from the WWII era and was most likely replaced at the arsenal refurbishment.

This gun is 100% functional with no repairs or damage. Finish (Parkerization) is 98%. This is a fantastic arsenal rebuild of the classic 1911 by Colt.

I have the papers assigning ownership to my Father in 1961, from the arsenal. This gun has fired less than 100 rounds since the arsenal refurbishment.

Recently appraised at Peterson's Firearms in Albuquerque for up to $1000.00 retail.

This is the full steel model, not the polymer framed version. The extractor spring is worn out so the spent casings don't eject all the way 90% of the time. I have a new Wolff extra power extractor spring, I just don't want to beat up or otherwise break the gun trying to replace it.

 It has a little bit of holster wear on the front of the slide and on the front edge of the frame, along with very light scratches/handling marks; it's been used but not abused. Overall I'd give the finish a 7/10. I don't have an exact round count as there have been 2 previous owners, but I've put maybe 100 rounds through it. The rifling looks excellent and there is no rust or pitting anywhere on the gun. Shoots great, other than the extractor issue. Comes with two 16 round magazines (one is a stock mag, the other is aftermarket, although I'm not sure of the brand).

It has a new firing pin, buffer assembly and charging handle.  I haven't shot it since rebuilding it.  Comes with an original 20 round and 32 round magazine.  I do know that I never had a single problem with the 20 round magazine, but the 32 would give me a failure to feed a couple times per magazine.  I just never used it after the initial attempt.  Loading the 20 round was tiring enough.   I know the original owner as well and this was a full automatic gun for a little while in its life.  He had Peterson's convert it back to semi-auto.  Also includes the UTG carrying bag and a parts list and teardown instructions in the envelope.  I'll throw in the old parts incase you want them.  Whoever said these guns were not accurate never shot one.  This thing with very basic sights is on the money.  It goes bang every time too.  It had a bent firing pin and still went bang.  Didn't know it until I decided to rebuilt it.  I'm thinning out the collection and don't really need this one.  I hate to get rid of it though.  Email me for contact info.

VLTOR Mil-Spec Receiver Extension:
Receiver extension tube has the correct, 1.146"" outside diameter for mounting collapsible buttstocks designed for the smaller, mil-spec tube. Allows fast, easy repeatability of buttstock position with five notches on underside to accept the stock’s locking pin and corresponding white position numbers on top visible through the witness hole on many stocks.

KNS Precision Non-Rotating Pin Set:
Redesigned hammer pin and anti-rotation links provide the strongest possible system to eliminate pin rotation. Helps prevent wear to receiver holes, which is especially important for increasingly-valuable M16 and pre-ban receivers. Notched hammer pin locks into slots in the anti-rotation links; trigger is secured with locking screws, and includes lube ports so adequate lubrication reaches the trigger. Anti-rotation links fit on the outside of the receiver to prevent all movement.

Battle Comp 2.0:
Multi-purpose compensator reduces muzzle climb, so you stay on target between shots during rapid fire engagements. Reduces flash signature and produces less concussion than the standard A2 flash hider for a smaller dust signature when shooting prone.

I am selling my AR-15. I am not trying to buy one. Please resist the urge to bombard me with emails telling me where you can find one cheaper. If you can in fact find such good deals, then you should stock up on them. Nothing personal but I have done my homework and know this is a fair and very reasonable price for this particular gun if you compare apples to apples. If you disagree please shop elsewhere.

Yes there are brand new ARs for less. They are not marked the same.

I do not need a history lesson on AR-15s or what makes one item a collectible over another. A 1965 Mustang is worth more than a new one. It is supply and demand. The bottom line is, Colt stopped manufacturing AR-15s with the ""Restricted"" rollmarks thus those that are marked with such are collectors items. Like it or leave it. If you are looking for a new AR for zombie slaying I recommend Buds Guns or Buds Police Supply if you qualify. (Great prices and service,)

If you are still with me here are a few details. It comes with on 20-round Colt magazine, a Magpul ASAP sling adapter, and a new with tags Colt rifle case.

I will subtract $50 if you do not want the case and sling adapter; and yes my price is firm.

Not looking for any trades unless you want to bring a LWRC to the table (I didn't think so).

Finally, buyer must have NC ID and be able to legally purchase/posses a firearm. (i.e. show Concealed Carry Permit or Pistol Permit or background check) No convicted felons need apply. If this listing is up, I still have the firearm. I will remove the listing as soon as it sells."

2 Jimenez JA-22 pistols for sale. Each pistol has had between 100 and 200 rounds or so through it, we did not keep an exact count. Each pistol includes 2 factory magazines, trigger lock, 2 trigger lock keys, the original box, and all paperwork. I am pretty firm on $125 each or $225 for both. We bought these on an impulse a little while ago, and while fun little pistols, they are just not something we need, though I am also not in a desperate need to sell them. Will need to see a SC CWP, and will sign bill of sale.

Glock pistols are the perfect combination of reliability and accuracy.
Their high-tech engineering and construction create a handgun that can
stand up to more punishment than even the most unforgiving conditions can
generate. When you investigate the individual advantages of a Glock, you'll
see that it will out perform whatever you're shooting now. The unique Glock
barrel features hammer forged rifling for increased velocity and even
greater accuracy. With a consistent trigger pull and excellent
pointability, there's a very good chance you'll be hitting your targets for
a long, long time.

This one has a few interesting features: first, It is non-import marked, that right no cheesy ugly bill board type import mark that takes away from the originality of the weapon. Second, while it was saved from being refurbished by being in Finnish possesion, the barreled action has no visible ""Finn"" markings and it has it's original bluing.

The rifle is in a Finnish built two piece fingerspliced stock that has one of the much rarer early copper tipped hand guards. 

It has a clearly marked matching bolt and a good clean counterbored barrel. 

A well traveled battle veteran that would make a fine addition to any ""Finn"" or Mosin collection.

The M3 uses the same inertia recoil semi-automatic system as the earlier Benelli M1, but adds another Benelli-patented feature, which allows the shooter to lock the semi-automatic action and switch to the manually operated pump-action mode and back in the matter of seconds. The action type switch is located at the forward end of the forearm, and is formed as an annular knurled ring. Rotation of this ring either engages the action rods of the pump system and locks the semi-automatic recoil system, or disengages the action bars, locks the forearm and allows the inertia recoil system to operate the action automatically. This greatly improves the versatility of the shotgun, allowing it to fire low-powered ammunition (mostly of special purpose, such as less-lethal rubber or tear-gas projectiles) in the manually operated pump action mode, and to fire full power combat loads with slugs or buckshot in rapid semi-automatic mode.

Rifle is in excellent condition
She has held 2- 2.5 inch groups at 100 yards with the right ammo.
I can also confirm she can hit minute of head at 200yards pretty regular with a decent marksman, a 4x scope and decent ammo. She feed anything I give her without a hiccup. She is sitting at approx 750 round count so her break in is complete and she has her whole service life ahead. Rifle ergonomics enhanced with a SAW stock and SAW grips.
She sports a quad rail hand guard with vertical and an upgraded compensator. She also has a TWS 1st Gen Dog leg rail with peep sight that STILL allows for Quick AK break down. 1 30 round mag and tapsco red dot included, the sling is not included. 

She is a great rifle and a fantastic example of an AK done right, Wouldnt sell her but I have a new AK and just bought another toy so I need to make room . 

Just a thought from a Jarhead:

I love my ARs but when the SHTF I WANT an AK. 
If you ever have to use this in defense of your life, real world experience has taught me and the statistics back me up that range is not generally the deciding factor, neither is accuracy as you'll likely be bobbing and weaving as will the bad guy. Minute of man is just fine. It comes down to speed of deployment, reliability and the ability to defeat cover. The 7.62 x39 can engage past 300 yards but Ill call it a 300 yard round. That is more than generous in any likely scenario. What it does better than its contemporaries is destroy cover and run where few other systems can. Neither the 5.56 nor the 5.45 can hope to match the original AK's ability to deny the enemy cover and that's where the fight is won. Pick the right tool for the job.

It is model #6421 in matte black.

Along with the scope comes new Warne Maxima 1"" medium height steel rings.  I believe these are model #305.

I bought this for a project rifle, and lost interest shortly thereafter.

The scope has never been mounted on a rifle, and was out of the box only to test-fit the rings.

The retail sticker on the scope box is ""$249.99"".  I bought the rings from Gander Mountain - I think they were $50.  I checked online, and it looks like the scopes are selling for $179.99 on sale, and the rings are selling for ~$30.  

I will sell all you see in the picture for $200 cash, or trade for GI 1911 parts (slide, frame, barrel, etc).  If you have something else for trade, I'm open to offers - as the saying goes, all I can say is ""no"".  

Would prefer to sell locally versus shipping, but if you're willing to pay shipping, I'll ship it to you.

With all due respect, I will not take less than $200, so will not respond to offers of any cash amount less.  I've priced it $10 less than the cheapest internet prices, and you don't have to pay sales tax.

One of the most popular systems ever, and for good reason. Current U.S. military issue, the versatile 2nd Generation starlight AN/PVS-4 is a workhorse! It's the choice of agencies and teams requiring state-of-the-art, high resolution vision capability at night. The AN/PVS-4 mounts on virtually any assault or sporting firearm, as well as to both video and photographic cameras for unmatched cost-effectiveness. You can use our Photo Adapter to connect it to a 35mm SLR's step-up ring, so there is no need for a costly relay lens assembly for 35mm photography. 

You can use the AN/PVS-4 with an optional relay lens unit on any C-mount video camera, using the optional Bi-Ocular eyepiece for extended visual surveillance. Take the same ""modular"" system with a Weapon Mount adapter, choose Reticle cell patterns for either .308 cal., .223 cal., or just plain cross hairs and mount it on the weapon of your choice for tactical needs. 

The AN/PVS-4's are designed to recover rapidly enough from muzzle flash to allow the user to see the round hit the target and maintain uniform image illumination during changing light levels. The projection-type Reticle is internally adjustable for Windage, Elevation, and Reticle Brightness. 


With a wide field of view, the AN/PVS-4 can detect traces of light normally unseen by the naked eye and electronically reproduces the near infrared image onto the eyepiece, with an adjustable illuminated reticle to take accurate aim. This rugged, and portable battery-powered Night Vision Device can be tripod mounted for surveillance & scanning"

One of the most popular trends has been the rise of lower wattage micro stacks and Krank Amps has lead the way with the Rev Jr., the 20W version of the monster Rev Series 1 head and cabs and the first in the line of the Jr. Series of small amps. The Rev Jr. boasts an all tube dual channel head (two 5881′s, three 12AX7′s) with boost switch and tube-driven active effects loop that gives even the most discerning tube amp enthusiasts an array of tones ranging from clean to high gain.
Two channel 20W head
Preamp three 12AX7 tubes, power section two Sovtek 5881 tubes
Volume, gain, 3 band eq, sweep control, push button ""boost"", push button channel switch
Tube-driven active effects loop,
KRANK 1x12 cab
The Rev Jr. cabinet is one versatile little cab! It was originally designed as a studio cab prototype at the Krank factory and was used a lot during the development of the Rev Jr. heads. We liked the look and sound so much what was going to be a combo became a stack!
It features a 13 ply baltic birch shell and is loaded with the same premium Eminence Legend V12 speakers as the Rev 4×12. Because the Legend is rated at 120W this cab easily handles full size heads as well and is ideal for home rehearsal, studio use, club gigs, or personal onstage monitoring.
