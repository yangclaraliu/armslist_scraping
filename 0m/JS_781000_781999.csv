If you would like to own the finest gas piston system AR rifle on the market, this is it. Purchased this from an uncle who never fired the weapon, and I have fired approx. 150 rounds through it without a single jam/malfunction. The rifle should be considered USED/Like New, absolutely excellent condition. Must say the original Sig HOLO reflex sight that came with it was not highest quality. Sold it and replaced with Tru-Glo Red Dot, much better quality. Rifle will come with one 30rd., and one 20rd. metal mag. The SIG556® HOLO features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by Swiss Arms and marries it to a CNC machined from 7075-T6 grade aluminum forged trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle’s weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines. The SIG556 HOLO features a 16” military grade COLD HAMMER FORGED BARREL, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The SIG556 HOLO has a proven two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system joined to a lightweight alloy trigger housing that accepts standard AR magazines. The vented non-slip polymer forearm has three Picatinny rails for accessory mounting. Sight options include front combat sight, flip-up rear sight, and a red dot style holographic sighting system that allows for quick target acquisition, with four illuminated reticle patterns with adjustable intensities. The SIG556 buttstock is collapsible and has a rubber butt pad and a number of sling attachment points. Select versions feature a folding stock with the ability to collapse, providing the best of both worlds. Rifle will be shipped in a cardboard box, with the Sig padded hard plastic case it originally came in. I could not locate owners manual, but copy of disassembly/assembly is included. Full owners manual is available at www.sigsauer.com. Shipping fee of $35.00 will be paid by winner of auction, signature by receiving FFL will be required on either USPS Priority, or UPS ground. Rifle ships when funds clear. No shipping to, or purchase by residents of CA, NY, or MA. My FFL that will ship is Jeremy Zdzinicki of LWZ Firearms, LLC. He is listed at Gunbroker, just search Illinois zip code 60468, and advise your FFL for contact info. Illinois residents need only provide valid F.O.I.D. Card, along with one more picture I.D. for verification. Price is O.B.O."

Barrel is cryo treated for better patterning, and it also has the nice accu-stock on it for reducing recoil, and the gun comes with two cryo-chokes I have purchased (ic, mod) and the wrench to swap them. I have over $600 in this gun alone and that does not include the $50 each choke cost me and the wrench as well and I have only taken it out a couple times so I believe $550 is more then fair, it has been shot so little that it still looks like your looking down a mirror when you look down the barrel. I can also include a couple boxes of 3.5"" magnum shells as well which will save you around $50 (mixed blindside and remington ultra-steel) Thanks for looking. ALSO, PLEASE ONLY CONTACT ME IF YOU ARE SERIOUS!! I am getting sick of taking my post down and then having to re-post because somebody flakes out last minute.

Specs and info:

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon.

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling.

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters.

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs.

The Bushmaster A2/A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are shipped complete with 30 round magazine, safety and operational manual, and carry sling.

CAA is proud to introduce the new Clear Action Magazine. This unique magazine provides both a clear window on the side showing the number of rounds rem aining in the magazine and a full magazine indicator button on the bottom. The clear window on the magazine side allows the user to easily view the number of rounds remaining, corresponding to the numbers stamped into the body. In addition a white full magazine indicator on the bottom pops out of the magazine base, providing a tactile indicator of a fully loaded magazine during low light or night operations. The full mag indicator can be preset to pop out at either 29 or 30 rounds by removing the follower extention.

To make a 100% reliable polymer magazine, we start with a magazine body made from a high impact polymer strong enough to be run over by a truck and still function. The interior of the magazine body is formed with contours in the shape of the round to prevent jams and misfeeds. A non-tilting follower and stainless steel spring produces a magazine you can count on for 100% reliability. With the clear window showing you the remaining rounds at a glance, and the full magazine indicator, you now have a superior design, executed flawlessly, resulting in your tactical advantage."

On to the watch, it's a Rolex GMT II, model 16710 serial #656xxxx, produced 1980.  This watch is very good to excellent, band has minimal sag/deflection.

Keep this real, you don't want me to low ball you on your AR so don't low ball me on my watch. A piece of crap GMT II is $3K+, nice ones in the $4-5.5K range and one thing is for sure the values are stable.

I'm willing to trade for several basic AR's, might even consider some uppers and lower's, parts stock someone has, or, put the whole nut in a single gun.

This is a ""Boer War"" model that saw service in South Africa in the wars that followed the Zulu war.  This has the rare ""birds head"" grip, and proof marks from when it was issued and re-issued to different regiments.  Very cool historical piece.

Has ALL MATCHING SERIALS.
has NO IMPORT MARKINGS

It is complete, locks up reasonably well.  It HAS unfortunately been shaved from the original .455 eley caliber so that it can work with 45acp and 45ar cases.  This was typical of surplus webley revolvers after wwii.  If it hadn't been shaved, it would likely be worth 2x.  This really is more of an antique collectible, but is certainly shootable.  It has some pits and some wear in the barrel from being 110 years old.  It looks like it was refinished at some point, as the current blueing is strong, and was obviously done over some of the cleaned up pits.  Overall, very nice condition for its age.

Why am I selling?  I'm downsizing my collection and this one doesn't ever go to the range.  It was(is) a hard decision to let this go, as I've never seen another like it in my life.

488,http://www.armslist.com/posts/781488,"For Sale/Trade:  Shelby Cobra collector electric guitar custom by Jarrett, signed by Carroll Shelby","Union & Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 1, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I also am looking to pay ca$h for a couple of AR's to keep up at my place in the mountains, I won't waste your time and won't low ball you, I'll buy at a fair price.  If you are testing the market or trying to sell $999.00 Walmart AR's for $1200+ don't bother, they will be $999.00 again once the idiot's get out of the game and I will wait it out, makes no difference to me.  But, if you have bills to pay and don't want to deal with lookie loo's, then email me and we can make an easy painless deal...  

Also, click on ""Listings by this user"" for my Rolex I am looking to trade also...  ON TO THE GUTAR

This is an extremely rare opportunity to own an unique item. First off, the electric guitar was made by Jarrett Guitars, 50 guitars were scheduled to be built in the limited ""Commemorative Series"" and this is guitar number #19 in the series, serial number CSX2002-34, but only 40 ended up making the production run from what I have found out.  The Guitar comes with certificate of authenticity from JARRETT GUITARS, CONNECTICUT USA, authenticated by Jack Camarda.  All of this can be verified by contacting Mr. Camarda at Jarrett, he was the program's director, he actually returned my call when I was researching the Guitar almost 10 years ago when I bought it.  (You can google his name & Shelby Guitar, and get the history of the project).  

Anyways, it's a rare piece both for collectors and players, and an extremely unique piece for Shelby Cobra fans. 22 frets, humbuckers, 3 way selector switch. Volume and tone controls push/pull to split the coils in the humbuckers. Set neck with pearl inlays, and custom Shelby Cobra graphics. If you Google this guitar and read the Harmony Central reviews, you will discover just how amazing this guitar really is. This guitar has lived it's life in it's case which is included. The guitars originally sold in the 4k-8k range due to the limited number made and have never seen one that was autographed, period.

As for the autograph, being a Shelby Cobra owner I have attended several events at Boulder, Colorado's ""Shelby American Collection"" museum.  Mr. Shelby signed this at one of the annual Christmas benefits (December, 2007) and all monies collected from the benefits were donated to help operate the museum and to the Carroll Shelby Foundation (http://www.cscf.org/). As such it comes with a certificate of authenticity from them. I had Mr. Shelby inscribe it to me and my name can easily be removed if you want me to remove it.  Just takes some rubbing alcohol because the inscribed signature was done with a Sharpie and since the guitars finish has several layers of clear coat built up on it, the Sharpie couldn't have penetrated through the finish. I am the original owner of the guitar and have owned it for almost 10 years. I have rarely come across these guitars and have never seen one that has been autographed. As you know Mr. Shelby has passed away and therefore I wouldn't anticipate a signed example making it to the market..

To get an idea of value's you can check out these current auctions for similar guitars, first ones aren't autographed, second one is signed but a different style of Shelby Guitar. It's just to give an idea, I don't need any insulting low ball offers, I paid a lot of money just for the guitar...

Why? ...... because we live in a REAL World that is Very UnPredictable ...... with REAL Evil people who are becoming more wicked by the day ...... Controlled by a REAL Government that is becoming More Powerful/ More Liberal/ MORE CONTROLLING/ and MORE SOCIALISTIC!!!!!!! by the day

    The main point being proposed by the Blissfully Ignorant Crybabies is that things will go back to ""Normal"" in a few months ....... Really? ...... Now let's analyze this ...... This country is blind and stupid enough to elect Barack Hussein Obama for a 2nd term ........ Now hold up your hand and count .... One .... Two .... Three .... FOUR!!!! ....... That's right class ...... 4 MORE YEARS OF BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA ...... What would make any Conservative with more than 2 active brain cells think that ANYTHING is going to go back to ""Normal,"" especially the AR Gun Market

    The Blissfully Ignorant Crybabies have a valid point that once the most recent frenzy settles back down then the prices of AR's will drop alllllll the way back to ""Normal"" ....... HOWEVER, there is 1 major factor they forgot to calculate in and add to their dreamy and enchanted equation for low AR prices of the bygone past...... that is the next shooting. We all know about the high profile shootings over the last year or two and how the Obama Regime and his trained monkeys(the liberally dominated media/press) just love to start talking gun control. The barrels haven't even cooled off from the last tragedy before the liberal personalities, on all the major networks, were just peeing all over themselves at the opportunity to start babbling about gun issues/ discussions and reevaluating current laws(that's code for ""gun control"") and spinning the facts to serve their agenda. In case you didn't know, high capacity clips are in the process of being outlawed as a result of the last tragedy.

     Just 1 or 2 more shootings/tragedies is all the Obama Regime and his band of trained monkeys(the liberal media) will need to ""sell"" more ""gun control"" to the mass population of ""useful idiots"" and ""system suckers"", who now outnumber us. Note: in current times, any shooting involving an AR(even if it's only in the trunk and not even used) will be spun into high profile hysteria by the liberal media  

     If we never have any more shootings, never never never, then the Blissfully Ignorant Crybabies will be proven right along with their accusations of price gouging, and the prices of AR's will fall allllll the way back down to ""normal"" and we can all skip happily through the candy cane forest of lolli-pops and gum drops and relish in the sweet/low low prices of AR's, as we laugh at those who paid double.

These rifles are made in the Izmash factory in Russia, where the original Kalishnakov AK47s were manufactured.  They ""sporter-ize"" these Saigas in order to import them legally into the USA, but they can be converted back to their original battle configuration as long as you use American made parts. I had Tony completely rebuild and relocate the trigger system, and add a pistol grip. He modified the Tang to accept his custom stock with adjustable cheek weld. He welded up all holes left over, welded up the custom trigger guard, and repainted the whole thing.  He also added the front sight block and permanently attached the custom muzzle break. 

It comes with a Russian POSP scope, 3 SGM 25 round Mags, and  a rifle bag.  It also has a tri-rail foreend, with a detachable  front grip with push button bipod

I am just passing on to the armslist community, a copy of a letter I saw on a web site I view frequently
 (freerepublic.com ). 

This Marine said what I know all of us gun owners & freedom lovers think, in a very clear unambiguous way to the people who live under the freedom REAL men have fought to provide for them. Then, people like FiendStein TAX & REGULATE us to death, while she & her husband get rich on our dime!!

I served in the US Air Force (1967-71) when NO HOMOS or Nancy boys were alowed in ANY branch of service and guns were NOT the so called problem!

*********************************************************************

""Senator Dianne Feinstein,
 I will not register my weapons should this bill be passed, as I do not believe it is the government’s right to know what I own. Nor do I think it prudent to tell you what I own so that it may be taken from me by a group of people who enjoy armed protection yet decry me having the same a crime. You ma’am have overstepped a line that is not your domain. I am a Marine Corps Veteran of 8 years, and I will not have some woman who proclaims the evil of an inanimate object, yet carries one, tell me I may not have one.

 I am not your subject. I am the man who keeps you free. I am not your servant. I am the person whom you serve. I am not your peasant. I am the flesh and blood of America.

 I am the man who fought for my country. I am the man who learned. I am an American. You will not tell me that I must register my semi-automatic AR-15 because of the actions of some evil man.

 I will not be disarmed to suit the fear that has been established by the media and your misinformation campaign against the American public.

 We, the people, deserve better than you.

New, never shot, never even had a round chambered.

Specs and info:

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon.

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling.

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters.

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs.

The Bushmaster A2/A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are shipped complete with 30 round magazine, safety and operational manual, and carry sling.

 Review: 
I recently puchased a nano after reading extensively about it, and 2 trips to the range and 275 rounds later I couldn't be more pleased. Swapping the mag release over for a left hander is very simple, the lack of an external slide stop or safety are pluses to me, it makes the gun truly ambi and is one less thing to think about in a bad situation. I put 6 different types of ammo in 3 weights thru it and it cycled flawlessly

DISINTEGRATOR®
No one equips you for perfect practice like Remington, which is why we’re the top choice for government agencies everywhere – in the field and on the range. Disintegrator lead free frangible ammunition is a technological breakthrough in bullet construction that offers totally lead free, no-ricochet performance, with point of impact and felt recoil equivalent to standard lead core pistol ammunition. In accuracy performance, it is as good or better than the best duty ammo. Disintegrator frangible bullets feature a high strength compaction formed core, completely sealed in a jacket of electroplated copper. The metal powder core construction creates a bullet that easily withstands the forces and pressures of firing, while providing instant and complete frangibility against hard surfaces. The copper plating on Disintegrator bullets provide a smooth ductile jacket that enhances feed and function in all autoloading pistols, minimizes bore fouling, and virtually eliminates barrel erosion. Only 0.005” thick, it is enough for rifling engraving, but too thin to ricochet. Disintegrator bullets are made of compressed metal particles shaped into standard profile 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP specifications. Disintegrator core is completely protected with hard copper plate. Manufacturing process produces highly concentric core for excellent accuracy."
