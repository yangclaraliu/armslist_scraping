IN OVER A YEAR, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANOTHER LIKE THE FULL SIZED ONE ON ANY SITE AND A PAWN SHOP OFFERED ME AN AMAZING AMOUNT.  IT'S EXTREMELY CLOSE TO WHAT WE HAD IN VIETNAM WITH A COLOR DIFFERENCE AND NO US PROPERTY PRESENT.

PICTURED ABOVE THAT IS MY TINY, NEVER FIRED COLT GOVERNMENT POCKETLITE IN 380 FLAVOR.  PROBABLY THE MOST CONCEALABLE AND LIGHTEST 380 EVER MADE OF ALL STEEL.  IT'S LARGER, LONGER AND HOLDS ONE EXTRA ROUND MORE THEN THE COLT MUSTANG AND COMES WITH THE ORIGINAL BLUE COLT BOX AND 7 $32.00 MAGAZINES.
THIS PISTOL IS LONG SINCE DISCONTINUED ONE YEAR AFTER PURCHASING IT FOR $389.00, AN EXTRA FFL FEE AND TAXES. THEY HAD TO BE SPECIAL ORDERED. I HAVE TWO AND WILL ONLY ENTERTAIN SELLING ONE.

NO INTERESTS IN ANY SORT OF TRADES WHATSOEVER AND THE PRICE TO OWN IT IS $950.00 AND NOT OBO.

CONDITION IS NIB, NEVER FIRED BUT MISPLACED THE BOOKLET AND THE ""STOP"" TAG ON THE TRIGGER WELL.

I WILL NOT SHIP AND DOUBT YOU'LL SEE ANOTHER ON ARMSLIST.  THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ""MUST HAVE"" FOR A COLT AUTO COLLECTOR.  THEY STILL MAKE THE MUSTANG BUT NOT THIS LARGER TINY MODEL FOR DECADES.

EMAIL ME IF INTERESTED AND I DO NOT MIND KEEPING IT ANOTHER 32 YEARS OR ACTUALLY I'LL PROBABLY JUST GIVE IT TO MY SON FOR X-MAS, WHO IS A POLICE OFFICER FOR HIS 3rd BACK-UP PIECE.  IT'S SO LIGHT, YOU CAN'T FEEL IT AND BELIEVE THAT STATEMENT, IF MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY, IT WILL HOLD 8+1 BLACK TALON BUT I PREFER, WERE I TO USE IT,  EXTREME DUTY, POLICE ISSUE, SEMI-BALL AMMO.

This is a .62 British Heavy Dragoon flint pistol, made by the late William Kennedy of PA in 1994. It is NOT an Indian import, nor is it a Kennedy kit gun. It is a direct copy of an example in the Tower Of London Museum in true Brit military issue style, no bogus engraving, inlays or other such add-ons that would make it incorrect for the period.  It sparks and shoots very well, ibuilt with quality components, and has a nice patina developing. My name and title is engraved on the barrel, but not overly deeply, so it could be polished out, or left as-is. This is as fine a flint pistol as one could hope to own, Mr. Kennedy researched his weapons well and was a great craftsman. I am posting this for sale due to financial needs, if I generate the funds from another source, it will go back in the safe. The price is rock solid firm at $1200, which will include proper packaging, shipping and insurance to the lower 48 states. Please PM with any questions."

RIFLE : UPDATE- New Pictures added with Camo Wrap Removed

Ruger M77 Mark II Target rifle in .308 WIN
this rifle is the Stainless Steel model.
Rifle manfactured by Ruger in 1996,  I purchased the rifle new in 2000

The rifle features a matte stainless steel finish that resists corrosion.
Has a heavy contour, hammer-forged barrel with target crown provides long-range accuracy shot after shot. 

The wide, target fore end gives stability on sandbags or other support surfaces.

With a one-piece bolt that has proven to be one of the strongest on the market, integral scope bases which can never shoot loose, 
and a diagonally angled forend screw that adds accuracy by securely pulling the barreled action down 
into the handsome dark brown laminate stock

It is in overall beautiful condition with only couple small minor scratches and couple
dings mostly on the left side of the stock below receiver and scratch on very flat bottom
of the stock, not seen unless rifle is turned over see the pictures

The CAMO Gun Wrap is easily removed and leaves no sticky residue and if care is taken
can be used again and again. Its much like the new type self sticking medical wraps you
get now at the Dr's or Hospital. Beautiful Bore, Lands & Grooves
I have currently removed the camo wrap to show the beautiful black/brown laminate stock
and I am leaving the camo wrap off, but it will be included with the rifle should new owner
want to use it.

Gun is in good condition it just has one very small crack on the right side of the butt of the gun. Gun comes with a Tasco 3x9x40 scope, a carrying case, half a box of Hornady bullets (some of the best you can buy for this gun) and a full box of Remington Core Lokt. The gun is sighted in at around 75 yards and shoots great! This is a Golden Trigger so it is a little more than a regular 336 so keep that in mind. They plated the trigger with gold due to the fact that gold does not rust or corrode where steal does. Your finger is one of the most oil prone parts of the body and since it touches the trigger more often than any part of the gun the trigger will never rust or corrode. I am asking $375 for the rifle, I would also consider trades for a Ruger SR40 or an SR40c or a Glock 23 aswell.  $375 is the lowest I will go please dont ask.

This provides a very tight slide-to-frame fit, very good barrel lock-up and contributes to good accuracy. This gun was made in Italy, and like a fine Italian automobile, it really shows in the style, comfort, and craftsmanship. Trigger has a safe, heavy pull in double action and a smooth release in single action. And when you pick the gun up, you have to drop the mag. You don't hear it, you don't feel it, it just disappears. An excellent weapon. Visit www.floridatacticalarmory.com for more infor. $409"

Synthetic stock, stainless steel all-weather construction. Has a Picatinny EGW rail on it so you can use any Pic or Weaver mounts. 

Comes with a 5 round and 3 round detachable magazine.

$500 for the rifle alone with 2 mags. If you wish, I can add in the fast-release Harris bipod, SWFA SuperSniper 3-9x42 30mm mil/mil scope (nicer than most $1200 scopes I've used), TRS rings, and a sling for a good price.

I also have about 1000 rounds of loaded various ammo (Hornady TAP, softpoints, Winchester) that I can sell along with the rifle.

Honestly, I hate letting this rifle go, but since the wife doesn't need it anymore it is sitting in my safe unused.

In excellent condition - hard to find anymore since Tikka started making the T3 rifles.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fl eet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the offi cial sidearm of the SEALs.

Credit Cards / Checks Accepted

(Must register in advance, payment accepted the day of the class)

Instructor Qualifications:

CCH Instructor since 2007
Full Time Police Officer
Police Firearms Instructor (Certified by the Kansas Law Enforcement Training Center, 92 hour course)
NRA Pistol Instructor
30 years Firearms Experience



I have real-world experience and teach from that perspective. I add to the basic curriculum to help better prepare students for the challenges of concealed carry and the
potential use of deadly force.

We cover CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Armed Response / Self Defense, Interaction with Law Enforcement and much more.

This is an excellent class taught by a knowledgeable instructor with a bit more than the AG CCH Instructor certification. (My 60 Round PPC Qualificaiton score was 95.69% - timed course of fire, most from 25 yards, 10"" scoring area)

Many instructors base there classes on things learned in books and pseudo tactical as seen on TV
My instruction is based on proven and experienced technique and instruction.

I have the opportunity to interact with many Concealed Carry Permit holders and have found that many times the information they received was inaccurate and sometimes dangerous.

I believe in Concealed Carry and the right to self defense and that is why I teach. If you are wanting to carry a firearm, just be sure you ask questions of your instructor; their philosophy and true credentials. It is easy to become concealed carry instructor, but it takes experience in armed conflict and full knowledge of the law to offer what is really required.

It is possible that your life, or in the case of a wrong decision your liberty, will depend on the quality and accuracy of the instruction you receive. No matter what class you take, check the credentials of the instructor. Please! For Your Sake.

I have a Nikon Inline scope that can go with the gun or come off.  Shot just enough rounds to get the gun sighted in.  I have over $1200 invested but am willing to trade to get a better price for the gun.  I have the box and all documents.

I am interested in any O/U or side by side shotguns, assault rifle or fnh5.7.  I am in not hurry to get rid of this gun so please do not send me any crazy offers.
