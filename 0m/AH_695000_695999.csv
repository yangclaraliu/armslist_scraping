This cabinet is currently on sale at Gander Mountain for $120(+tax) and that is the cheapest I’ve seen it for sale online and that’s what I paid for it originally, so I’m asking $90 firm. The details are as follows:

-Dimensions: 21” Wide, 55” tall, 10” deep
-Key-coded double-bitted locks
-Three-point locking system
-Green epoxy baked on finish
-8 gun capacity (3 of those have the standoff extensions for scoped rifles)
-Barrel rests already installed
-Padded bottom
-Comes with a Plastic shelf that can install in the top to hold your ammo/handguns (mounts a little too low for some of my longer shotguns so it probably wouldn’t work for you if you have any long guns longer than 45” give or take a bit

The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. Trigger pull, like all of DW 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.

Box, case, take-down pin key, ect.  I originally paid 460.00 for the gun.  I love how it shoots along with the nicely predictable break on the trigger.  I would trust my life with this gun any day of the year.  This thing is practically flawless except for the one slight little wear mark on the right side of the grip from my ring.  I have only put 204 of the 250 round box of Remignton UMC ammo that I originally bought with the gun.  As you can see in the pictures it does come with the magazine step that gives a little more grip for those with larger hands.  This would be a great gun to carry, especially with the loaded chamber indicator that elevates above the slide.  The rounded nose and light weight also add to its ""carry-ability"".  I've never had any problems with the gun what so ever.  I just have 3 other 45s and reloading for another pistol caliber seems kinda silly with how little spare time I have right now.  I figured that when I ran out of the UMC bullets, I would just buy some dies.  Oh well, my loss, your gain.  I accept paypal (my favorite) and money orders.  Will consider a trade for a 1911 in 45acp of course.  Will ship to FFL only."

He left on vacation and left it with me to sell..

I'm not too sure on the pricing for it, i can piece together all of the extras such as ACOG, bipods, ammo, magazines, etc...

whats hard for me to price is the a.k itself as i can not find to much infomation on itl, and him being awesome left me with minimal information.

He said something about parts all pretty much being upgraded and not stock, just not sure..

I will post pictures of a.k itself, but as i can only post three i will have to describe in words.

I will list all markings found and where they are found, so you can get an idea of the rifle and what its worth.

 * The bolt of the VZ 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.

 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 58.
 * The VZ 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 58 is easier to field strip.

It's black, it's Russian, it's funky, and it's a lot of fun! Its great for hauling around kids, dogs, or if you have lots of stuff. It has about 7K Kms on it, 1K of them since the engine rebuild. New odometer says only ~30kms.

I bought it with a bad timing gear and completely rebuilt the engine to better than it comes from the factory with all new high-quality bearings, seals, and Herzog gear sets. It has new rings, plugs, and fresh top ends. I put on a late model Nippon Denso alternator, stainless steel exhaust system, and speedometer (its bigger and includes a trip-meter). Drives strong, handles great.

Essentially what you're getting is a current generation Ural ""Retro"" with forks, the old school drum brakes (interchangeable wheels yeah!), and all the bugs sorted out.

Also includes a custom rollover bar designed for attaching a child's car seat.
You can read my rebuild thread on Soviet Steeds to see the quality of the work I put into it here: http://www.sovietsteeds.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=17222


The rig comes with original exhaust system, original speedometer (ebay it or made an ornament out of it), set of 5 OEM oil filters, rocker arm shim kit (uninstalled, for reducing valve clatter), Ural tool roll with a partial original tool kit, Ural first aid kit, Ural ""tractor seat"" with gel pad, a copy of ""Driving a Sidecar Outfit"" book, Ural owner's manual, ""Medium"" child's 3/4 DOT helmet, and various seals, parts and odds and ends.

Price is $7K. Cash only. I will deliver it within a 50 mile radius of Columbus and I'll be more than happy to give an orientation of the controls and instruction on how to drive the rig to the buyer."

I am very firm at $500.  That is for a brand new in the box gun.  If used but like new, the price is $450 firm.  Prices for additional accessories that may come with it are as follows: additional magazines are $20 for 7 round, $25 for 8 round with extension, holsters vary depending on what it may or may not be (I may not even want it), ammo $10/box of 50 range stuff and $.50/round if good defense ammo (all ammo price depends on quantity), Crimson Trace laser $150.  If there's anything else then inform me what it is, details help, and it may or may not be worth something to me.  So all said, what's listed is what I am willing to pay.  

Honestly, I am looking for just a plain from the factory gun that's brand new in the box with the paper work and the factory 7 and 8 round magazines it comes with...which means regardless of what you might have, I may only be interested in the gun only or nothing at all even.

I am willing to meet face to face in a public location, like a Wal-Mart or Home Depot parking lot.  The location should be in the vicinity of Southwest-Southeast 270, Circleville, Lancaster, Grove City, Georgesville, Hillard, or Renoyldsburg.  Thought much outside of Grove City to Circleville area and the price starts falling (I work a lot and paid hourly, also get 10mpg...both add up fast). I think that's pretty much it. 

Offer what you want to me, the worst I can say is no...but I think I have it pretty well listed.  Thanks!"

Scheels Outfitters Deluxe Tactical Gun Case 

The versatile MSR needs a case as rough and ready as itself.

It's simple ecology. When the number of predators is reduced, there's more deer reaching adulthood, and thus more deer hunting. So I'm doing my part by getting into the coyote hunting action. But in order to transport and store my MSR safely, I've picked up the Scheels Outfitters deluxe tactical gun case. It's not a remake of other cases, but was designed specifically for the needs of the predator hunter.
 Features: •41"" x 12.5"" fully padded case holds scoped guns up to XX"" barrel length plus most customized MSRs with pistol grips, lights and other accessories
 •Zip-open side pocket has four magazine pockets plus a handgun holster
 •Interior has soft liner and adjustable strap system to hold your gun secure
 •Rustproof 2-way heavy-duty zipper
 •Sturdy web handles
