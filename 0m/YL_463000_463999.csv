 Rather than a safety, the P90DC offers a slide mounted decocking lever, 
allowing the shooter to change the trigger from the light, 
single-action pull to the heavier double-action without dropping the 
hammer on a live round.

The gun is constructed with a stainless steel slide and a heavy-duty aluminum alloy frame. 
According to Ruger, this frame is strong enough to endure even the punishment of +P loads without cracking.

Of all the features on this gun, one of the most notable is the grips. 
Made of high-impact polymer, these are some of the most comfortable factory grips 
on the market. They fit quite nicely in the shooter's hand and, 
with the moderate recoil of the gun, make target reacquisition very quick."

Its a pretty cool gun its built like a 357.magnum.
Because back in brasil in the 80's the gun laws
Were so strick you had to fill out a number of paper
Work explaining why you needed one so most people didnt bother getting them legaly . Also they could have anything bigger than a 38. For civilian use so taurus used the 357. Magnum frame & cylinder and stamped 38.spl on it. So they could sell the 357.models they made before the law changed. Its heavy as hell like 36ounces. Its huge for a 38. Has a 4inch barrel , clean scratch free wood grips. Nickle plated with out any rust or discoloring.  Looks like its fresh out the box. 
Long cylinder , pictures don't do it justice . 
ONLY PROBLEM IS IT NEEDS A NEW TRIGER PIN
Theres one in it now, its just to small It was put in to hold on triger, 
Really really cheap to fix, i just rather not waste the time because i have a 38.snub already and dont need two revolvers . Bought it from a guy just yesterday , after i saw him buy it from some one eles lol. I just had to have it. 
Its huge , with a great story to go with why its so big.
Good sights too. TOOK TO POLICE STATION AND RAN THE S# its NOT stolen , clean clear and ready to go.   

I think its a 80 or 82 model

This Kahr CW 45 has an April 2012 manufacture date and has only 50 rounds fired.  It is in stock configuration with the one exception.  I have applied removable adhesive grip skin called AGrip.  It is much like the Talon Grip material in its adhesive qualities.  If you don’t want the grip skin, it easily peels off and will leave no sticky residue.

The firearm has functioned flawless in the box of 50 rounds - FMJ 230 grain ammo that I put through it.   In this summer heat, I carry its twin as my EDC.   With its slim profile, potent cartridge and thin but not too short grip make it the ideal concealed carry firearm.    

The firearm is in flawless condition.  The package comes complete with 3 magazines, a hard case and its original box, lock, and paperwork.   Yes, I added 2 extra magazines and a Kahr hard case.  I have also added a box of 50 - .45 ACP 230gr FMJ Blazer Brass Ammo.   That is $100 in added value to this pistol package.  New price for this handgun with one magazine at budsgunshop.com

Unfortunately, Sig also started having quality control(QC) problems in their US plant around that time. The Sig 556 ER model remains the finest example of the Americanized Sig 55X platform: famous Kalashnikov-action reliability fused with the ergonomics of the M4 platform, chambered in .223/5.56mm and feeding smoothly from any af the many highly available standard M16-type magazines. This rifle has fired around 500rds flawlessly since I bought it new. The precision of this rifle is best brought out with a top-teir optic such as an ACOG, but it has factory flip-up emergency iron sights that work very well.

From the Manufacturer's site:
( http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/sig556-er.aspx )

SIG556® ER features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The flash suppressor uses a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The forearm housing the gas operating system is a vented non-slip polymer featuring the SIG TriRail design with three integrated Picatinny rails for mounting accessories. The optional flip up front combat sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. The Picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® finish. The Picatinny rail features an optional flip up rear sight that works in concert with the optional front combat sight, providing iron sight performance and a back up sight option for optics. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines. A 30-round magazine is supplied with each rifle. The collapsible buttstock features a rubber butt pad, multiple sling attachment points, and a waterproof battery compartment. The ergonomically designed pistol grip features an integrated storage compartment. Select versions feature a folding stock with the ability to collapse, providing the best of both worlds."

Unique Technical Features
The outer tubes & internal components are extremely robust.
The adjustment system is:
- repeatable
- steel on steel
- with audible clicks
Double internal spring force. Every Burris scope has it.



Posi-Lock
• Posi-Lock is a coil-spring assisted retractable steel post that firmly and & securely locks accuracy into place. 
• Once the reticle is zeroed, the covering tube (red) replaces the internal spring (green) & locks the inner tube in place. 
• All scopes have one spring that allows the adjustment of the reticle. 
Some of the competition competitors offer a double spring whereas the double spring is the STANDARD for all Burris products. 
• As an optional, it’s possible to have the special Posi-Lock system. 
Posi-Lock scopes remain perfectly zeroed year after year even during transportation.

In the closed position, the force of the spring is substituted by the force of the steel post on the internal tube of the scope.



On all rifle scopes:
• Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope
• Every scope is individually recoil, water and fogproof tested 
• Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage



Recoil Test
Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests
An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration.
This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Waterproof Test
All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof.
Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C.
The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. 


Fog Test
The nitrogen contained in the scope is:
• of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen)
• ultra pure
• ultra clean
To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of 
• pressurizing the scope
• subjecting it to a vacuum
The tests are both cost & time intensive

 The scope and scope mount are like new condition without packaging or paperwork. I do have the tool for the scope.

Retail the scope is $300.00
Retail the mount is $100.00


I want $350.00 firm.

The M600C Scout Light® attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. Its small size increases weapon maneuverability, increases rail space available for other accessories, and minimizes added weight. It uses a high-efficiency LED emitter, virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break, and a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to create a beam with good reach and significant peripheral light for close- to medium-range applications. Maximum output is 200 lumens, and it produces tactical-level light—more than enough to temporarily overwhelm the night-adapted vision of an aggressor—for over two hours per set of batteries. The M600C has two switch options: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600C is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-tested, built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black

414,http://www.armslist.com/posts/463414,For Sale:  USMC Rifle Scope for M16A4 - Trijicon ACOG TA31RCO-A4,"North Green Bay/Howard, Green Bay, Wisconsin","$ 1,000","Listed On: Friday, August 3, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"THIS IS NOT A NIGHT VISION SCOPE, OR A SURPLUS ITEM. This is the world's finest combat scope for a .223/5.56mm rifle, purchased new, and MSRP's around $1,500. Built to USMC requirements to allow Marines to accurately shoot at close range and long distance without making any adjustments to the scope. Scope reticle has a Bullet Drop Compensator(BDC - see pic 3) that allows you to range a target while also offsetting for the bullet's trajectory at that range. Once you zero the scope on your rifle, you never change any settings, or change batteries, or even turn it on or off. The tritium and fiber-optic pick-up illuminate the reticle in any environment and automaticly adjust it's briteness. At close range, using the Bindon Aiming Concept(BAC), you shoot with both eyes open, and the reticle will be seen as a red dot. At long range, by placing the cross bars on a target's chest, you both estimate range and hold-over.

After very successful testing of a limited number of these ACOG's early in the Iraq War, the Marine Corps bought an ACOG for every rifle and carbine in their inventory. This is no small matter, since they pay more for each ACOG than they do for the M16's and M4's they put them on! I bought this scope new through civilian channels after I left the Marine Corps and added a GG&G throwlever mount to mate it to the 1913 rail on my son's Sig 556. It sat in my rifle safe after being zero'ed to the weapon.

Manufacturer page for product:
 http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=TA31RCO-A4CP

From that site:

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the M16A4 Weapon system (20” barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator."

About the Redfield 2x-7x scope:

The Widefield 2-7x variable power scope also had a front objective lens measuring 30x22mm.
It was 11.5"" long and weighs 13.7 ounces.
The horizontal field of view at 100 yards was an outstanding 57.78' at 2x and 18.34' at 7x.
The optimum eye relief was 3.75-2.88"". The compact 2-7x variable was the alternative to the fixed 4x scope for all-around use and was, I feel, superior to the more popular 3-9x scope for the purpose.
Its magnification and excellent field of view made it a good match for the trajectories of woods and all-around big game cartridges on the order of the 6.5x55, .270 Winchester, 7-30 Waters, 7x57, .280 Remington, .30-30, .300 Savage, .308 Winchester, .30-06 and 8x57JS."

Mounted to the slide is a BLACKHAWK! vertical rail mount grip that can convert from stubby to full sized, and is removable. Receiver is drilled and tapped to accept aftermarket picatinny rails, or scope mounts. It comes from the factory with ghost ring sights, and flourescent orange front blade sight. I purchased this gun to be a combination zombie/end of days/hunting/home defense gun and planned on adding a receiver mounted shell carrier and maybe a red dot sight....but....I need money for more important things at this point, so it's time to part ways. Stock is designed to dissipate most of the felt recoil, which it does, and adding the vertical foregrip makes the gun handle more like a battle rifle than a shotgun.

Have also ran a few boxes (30 rounds) of 1oz. rifled slugs through the  barrel, as well. All were done at an indoor range, then gun was cleaned and oiled properly after every trip (about 3).

The .454 casull versions are becoming rare since Ruger has not been producing them for at least a year or more and has no production date in the pipeline. Also the revolver was the primary weapon in the movie ""Faster"" which has also increased its popularity. It has been fired a few dozen rounds, I have the original box and owners manual. I believe to be the 2nd owner of this revolver. This one is a 2005 model, the first year they were made. Looking for Cash, I would consider trading if the trade is in my favor. Thanks Chris"

1942 Mosin Nagant. I'm thinking its an M91/30 Izhevsk. Not 100% sure. Numbers on the bolt, magazine, and barrel all match. Bayonet has a different number on it. 

Stock is in good condition. It looks a lot better than a lot of Mosins I've seen. Comes with a bayonet and sling. Also has a rail installed with an NCStar 2-7x32E scope mounted. Looks like someone was setting it up as a scout rifle. 

I haven't even had a chance to fire it yet. I would love to keep it and chop the barrel down, recrown it, thread the barrel for an AK74 style muzzle brake and put a Monte Carlo stock on it, but I'd rather have a 9mm striker fired pistol for IDPA.

GSG-5  (1st Generation) this is the original model that German Sports put out before H&K placed a law suit
against them, because of the closeresemblancee to the MP-5.  Since the law suit,  German Sports had to change
the model some, front sights, rear sights for starters and renamed it GSG-522

This rifle comes with a nice BSA Red Dot scope with fresh batteries installed Rifle is beautiful condition. It is imported by ATI, all metal construction.

It has a couple of rails added to it for laser, flashlight or whatever you might like to add. One rail is mounted on rgt side of the foregrip and the second can be mounted on the bottom of the foregrip, both are included.

This GSG 5 has had the two major upgrades added to it:

1.  H&K MP-5 Push Pin for quick take down, 
     Butt Stock, Trigger Assembly and Fore Grip

2.  All the screws, nuts and torque screws have been replaced with US         grade
     allen screws and torque nuts. Fair better quality then what it originally had
     Thus you wont need the GSG tool to remove them
     wrench'sAllen wrenchs will work.  
     I will included all the original nuts, screws and torques so if ever needed     
     you will have them.  

3.  Nice BSA Red Dot Scope with fresh batteries installed
