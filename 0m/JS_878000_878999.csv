This is a very clean unit, used very little. There's nothing wrong, and it works great. We just don't use enough to keep it, and would rather make better use of the floor space.

It is a complete unit. All you need is a 110v plug-in, hot/cold water, and a drain (and of course materials to mount it).

https://www.apexgunparts.com/product_info.php/cPath/107/products_id/1937

These are great spare replacement parts to keep on hand if you own a AK or AKM, because this is a part for AK's that is not being made inside of the USA and can only be obtained from overseas. The Bolt carrier takes the constant shock from the gas piston forcing it open and closed, and this causes the carrier to fracture occasionally. I have sold off my AK and no longer need the spares. Without a functioning bolt carrier, your rifle will be a decoration.

I will sell each carrier for $40 each,

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip.

Heres what it has...

Melonite coated 5r barrel 1/7 twist with mid length gas system. This barrel was 300.00 and worh it. 
Bolt Carrier Group - Spike's Nickel Boron HPT/MPI M16 BCG (5.56)

Arms INC front and rear sights 
Yankee hill free float rail. 
very rare spikes tactical zombie edition lower. 
tunned trigger breaks like class at about 3.4 pounds. Very crisp with no creep. 
Magpul CTR Mil spec stock. 
spikes H2 buffer with 45 coil buffer spring. 
magpul sling MS3 
magpul sling adaptor rear for tactical solutions and drills. 
LWRC winter trigger guard. 
ZOMBIE LOWER AND UPPER PINS AND EJECTOR DOOR...LOOKS VERY COOL. 
tactical coyote tan DURA COAT AND ZOMBIe IMAGE FIL ON ALL LETTERS...LOOKS GREAT. 
The rifle has 400 rounds though it without a hicup. It will shoot all and any ammo very well. My rule of thunb is if your going to have a battle rifle it should shoot anything you put in it from wolf, PMC Tac, Hornady boat tail ..ETC

THIS IS A GREAT RIFLE AND IS WORTH 2200.00 BEFORE THE TALK OF THE GUN BANDS. $3000.00 IS A GREAT DEAL ESPECIALLY WITH THE RARE LOWER AND BCG. 
THERE IS NOT ONE PART THAT IS NOT HIGH END OR THE BEST PART FOR AN AR15.

You can pick up two guns for one price or I will entertain trades for the deal. Just let me know what you have and we can talk about it.  The price listed is for both guns and I am selling them together.

First gun is a Mossberg 195-KA 12ga., bolt action and mag fed shotgun. All original except for the Pachmayr Grind-to-Fit recoil pad. In decent shape and shoots great. Has functioning Mossberg Accu-Choke system that allows the shooter to change the choke by turning the attachment at the muzzle. You can shoot birdshot and slugs through the same barrel by using this system. Comes with the original 2 round mag to make this a 2+1 gun.  

Second gun is a Westernfield Model 40 that has been completely restored. All metal work has been professionally re-blued by Jerry at East Coast Bluing and the furniture was refinished by me. Needs slight adjustment to the mag-tube feed angle to get it perfect. I just am too busy with projects that pay and do not have time right now. This gun does fire and eject perfectly outside of the feeding issue. 15 round capacity.

I will ship after payment cleared to your FFL or C&R for additional fee of $40.  Any questions, just ask. IL sales require bill of sale and valid FOID card."

It doesn't have any brand on it that I can find, but it did work fine. I'd LIKE $100 for it, since I paid $120, but I'll take $80.
Only plus side to this for you is they are bothersome to string and set up, but mine has already been so.

I'm open to trades, but I am willing to pay for any decent firearms, minus the $80 for the crossbow. Ammo would also be accepted in 9mm, .357, .45 Colt, 7.62x54R, .22, and .375 H&H magnum.  Along with some decent knives, if you're able to send pictures.

Sorry for the long winded post, but I have very little need for this. It's quiet and fun, but not my thing. 

Note, bolts for it are fairly cheap, and more likely to be in stock right now than most ammunition.

Thank you for your time."

You can pick up two guns for one price or I will entertain trades for the deal. Just let me know what you have and we can talk about it.  The price listed is for both guns and I am selling them together.

First gun is a Mossberg 195-KA 12ga., bolt action and mag fed shotgun. All original except for the Pachmayr Grind-to-Fit recoil pad. In decent shape and shoots great. Has functioning Mossberg Accu-Choke system that allows the shooter to change the choke by turning the attachment at the muzzle. You can shoot birdshot and slugs through the same barrel by using this system. Comes with the original 2 round mag to make this a 2+1 gun.  

Second gun is a Westernfield Model 40 that has been completely restored. All metal work has been professionally re-blued by Jerry at East Coast Bluing and the furniture was refinished by me. Needs slight adjustment to the mag-tube feed angle to get it perfect. I just am too busy with projects that pay and do not have time right now. This gun does fire and eject perfectly outside of the feeding issue. 15 round capacity.

I will ship after payment cleared to your FFL or C&R for additional fee of $40.  Any questions, just ask. IL sales require bill of sale and valid FOID card."

This  is a high capacity magazine gun that takes the Browning Hi-power magazine (since it is a licensed clone). It comes with three  high-capacity 13 round magazines and a extra set of Ergo grips installed. (Originals are in the bag) I will include the soft case unless you want a hard case and then you can have that.

The Browning Hi-Power is a single-action , 9 mm semi-automatic hand gun . It is based on a design by American firearms inventor John Browning , and completed by Dieudonné Saive at Fabrique Nationale (FN) of Herstal , Belgium . Browning died in 1926, several years before the design was finalized. The Hi-Power is one of the most widely used military pistols of all time, having been used by the armed forces of over 50 countries.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

 Sales Order: 

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere but ike all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

 I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a litttle retarded and shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

New in box and never fired. I just bought this rifle but want something else now. This is a nice affordable ""fun"" gun and also makes for an excellent home defense weapon due to its ease of use and dependability. It shoots common regular .45 acp. This gun comes with original box, hard case, 100 rounds of fmj ammo, 4 magazines, muzzle flash suppressor, beamshot 1000 pressure switch laser, factory trigger lock, 3 position fore grip and a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer. Has rails to mount scopes, flashlights or whatever other accessories you could want. 

Sorry buyer must take the whole package as i am not interested in seperating. I had a Hi Point .45 pistol that I shot 1000+ rounds through with 0 issues so I didn't hesitate to buy this one. I will trade for a .308 / 12 gauge over under or similar O/U in great to excellent condition. This is no AR-15 but a very powerful and dependable all purpose weapon.

The Huldra 5.56 Carbine TU-C Upper (Tactical Upper – Carbine) 16"" is a M4 profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms Piston technology and a tactical extended free floating forearm. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10” rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you more rail space for whatever your tactical needs may be. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler and longer than any other AR upper you own.

BACKGROUND: check it out at http://www.grandpower.eu/
The K100 was developed by Jaroslav Kuracina, a former weapons officer in the Slovak Army. Kuracina sketched drawings of the K100 as early as 1992, but manufacturing activities were highly restricted during the early post-Communist era. Kuracina would be forced to wait until 1996 to continue development of his design. In 2007 Grand Power announced a deal to produce 100,000 units for the U.S. market in partnership with Texas-based handgun manufacturer STI International Inc. The first pistols were exported in 2008. They were K100 Mk6 pistols under the commercial name GP 6. These same pistols were sold from $600.00 to $800.00 each. Now Century Internations Arms (CIA) has stuck a import deal with Grand Power to start bring one of the most popular competition handguns back to the US, AND FOR  $475.00!

BACKGROUND:  check it out at http://www.grandpower.eu/
The P1 (virtually the same as the K100 except with a slightly more compact design and 3.66"" barrel instead of the 4.25"" on the K100) was developed by Jaroslav Kuracina, a former weapons officer in the Slovak Army. Kuracina sketched drawings of the K100 as early as 1992, but manufacturing activities were highly restricted during the early post-Communist era. Kuracina would be forced to wait until 1996 to continue development of his design. In 2007 Grand Power announced a deal to produce 100,000 units for the U.S. market in partnership with Texas-based handgun manufacturer STI International Inc. The first pistols were exported in 2008. They were K100 Mk6 pistols under the commercial name GP 6. These same pistols were sold from $600.00 to $800.00 each. Now Century International Arms (CIA) has stuck a import deal with Grand Power to start bring one of the most popular competition handguns back to the US, AND FOR UNDER $500.00!

I'm reluctantly putting my beretta neos carbine kit up for sale. This will convert any beretta neos handgun into a fun, accurate little carbine. 

Initially, the handle's indentation was too small for the magazine release, so I had to file it down a bit. This made grip look a bit rough on the inside. You can probably fix it with some sandpaper, but when everything is put together all that stuff is invisible, so I never bothered. Aside from that, the kit is in excellent condition, and I'm only letting it go because I traded my Neos away. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!"
