Smith & Wesson has expanded its Military & Police (M&P) Rifle Series with the introduction of a new tactical rifle chambered in .22 LR – the M&P15-22. The dedicated .22 LR platform offers the fit and feel of the company’s popular M&P15 rifl...e, while being chambered in the more economical ammunition.

Engineered on a high strength polymer upper and lower receiver, the M&P15-22 benefits from reduced weight while retaining the looks and operating features of the standard M&P15 rifle. The new semi-automatic rifle features a 16-inch barrel with a twist of 1 in 15 inches. The M&P15-22 is standard with a six-position collapsible stock to accommodate a variety of shooters and shooting positions, an A3 style flat top upper receiver with a quad-rail handguard for easily mounting optional accessories and an A2 pistol grip for improved firearm control.

The new tactical rifle also features a fully functional charging handle, an AR-15 style magazine release, bolt catch and a two-position receiver mounted safety. The M&P15-22 is complete with a removable 25 round magazine along with a removable A2-style front post sight, an adjustable A2-style rear sight and a single stage trigger. An optional barrel shroud is also available.

“In designing the new M&P15-22, our engineers pulled out all of the stops to develop the ultimate .22LR platform,” said Tom Kelly, Vice President of Marketing for Smith & Wesson. “The rifle’s operating features, functionality and durability are exactly what you would expect from any of Smith & Wesson’s tactical rifles.

(Now known as ATI I believe...) This is a great stock with a cheek rest for right handed shooters and a 1"" rubber recoil pad that improves the length of pull along with absorbing some recoil. Metal is 90% or better and the weapon is in perfect functioning order. Receiver is milled, not stamped. In fact, this has one of the cleaner receivers I've seen on an SKS. I bought the rifle to clean up and take out to the range but I found a great deal on a parts kit I want to build up so I need to sell this to fund that project. 

I field stripped the weapon today and disassembled the bolt so I could clean up any residual cosmoline. If you're new to SKS's you'll quickly learn that this is one of the most important things you can do to ensure safe firing. All metal was just cleaned/lubed with CLP and this one is ready for the range. Save yourself the hassle of buying one you need to clean up and get one that's ready to go!

If you're into a more traditional look on the SKS I did find a place to purchase a wood stock and a bayonet with all hardware for around $40 (easily funded by selling this stock if you swap)."

This comes with hard case with manual and factory spent casing. Also has two 10 round walther mags. I shot this gun before any modifications were done and it was very reliable with GOOD ammo. I have since polished and rounded hammer face, polished feed ramp, polished and chamfered the barrel mouth, polished and rounded the trigger bar ears and polished the firing pin housing. This was all done to make this pistols action much more smooth and able to fire ANY type of ammo. These mods are known as ""the bible"" mods. If you know about the p22 bible, you will notice I didn't change trigger or ejector. That's because I simply felt there was no reason to. Since mods were done, I have fired 100 cci stingers and 500 winchester wildcats, all with no malfunction of any kind. I am only selling this to fund a .22 conversion kit from advantage arms for my gen4 g23 to become more proficient with my primary carry gun. If you have one of these kits in like new condition, I will trade straight up even though I will be on the losing end of the deal financially. The walther is a very fun pistol and you can shoot all day for a fraction of the price of larger calibers. And the carbon fiber lower looks awesome! Ftf in southern Indiana with bill of sale. If this ad is still up, the pistol is still available. Email goes straight to my phone so I respond quickly. $350 obo. Thanks for looking!"

The 34 is a competition handgun, 5.32 inch barrel, adjustable factory sights, extended slide/mag release and a 4.5lb trigger from the factory. 

It has had about 400rds run through it, I just haven't been using like I had planned (not shooting competitively anymore) and it sits in my safe quite a bit more than a glock should. 

I'm the original owner, I'm very particular about my firearms and the condition they're kept in. I've performed some modifications to it to make it a little bit better than it left the factory. 

3.5lb trigger 
competition trigger spring
extended length Stainless steel guide rod
and probably a couple other odds and ends...

BTW: This is a 3rd gen glock - so no issues that are affiliated with the 4th Generation models. 

Comes with 2 magazines.

for those of you that don't know, the 23 is in glock's mid-sized pistol class- so it works for concealed carry, but is meaty enough to be used practically, with ease, as opposed to the 27s etc.

comes with 4 mags, including a 15-rounder (standard is 13), a cleaning brush/tool, lock, the original hard case, and possibly some ammo.

what's REALLY special about the 23c is the c- it's compensated. the ported barrel and slide reduce recoil to pretty much less than that of my old 9x18. which is pretty amazing, considering that i can put 2 hollow-points through a milk jug from 18 yds. in less than half a second. it increases the ease of accuracy in fast follow-up shots immensely, you could never convince me to carry a .40 that didn't have a ported barrel after owning this gun. 

anyway, if you're interested please give me a call or text @ 54l . 4lO . 79 84. asking $625, but make your offers! ready... set... go!"

The Saiga-12 is a 12-gauge combat shotgun available in a wide range of configurations, visually patterned after the Kalashnikov series of assault rifles. Like the Kalashnikov rifle variants, it is a rotating bolt, gas-operated gun that feeds from a box magazine. All Saiga-12 configurations are recognizable as Kalashnikov-pattern guns by the large lever-safety on the right side of the receiver, the optic mounting rail on the left side of the receiver and the large top-mounted dust cover held in place by the rear of the recoil spring assembly.The looser clearances offered in an AK style design result in high reliability—an enormous boon on a semi-automatic shotgun

Everything included from stock parts to aftermarket parts."

This NGA is brand new, factory test fired only. Built with top tier parts in house, in Oregon. It does have collector potential, as NGA didn't make very many of these and it appears they recently closed their doors. No more ceramic ARs unless they sell the recipe. Collection value aside, it would make a near perfect truck gun as it will never rust, is ultra reliable and the bare bones layout weighs nothing at all. 

I prefer to sell it but will consider various trades for/towards a TNN/Cimarron/EMF 12ga coach gun, MK262 ammo, tan EOTech XPS 3-0, Seecamp .32, or JP VTAC upper.

I'm selling a very nice Norinco SKS that has been put into a Weapons Exchange branded Monte Carlo stock. That company has since been renamed ATI so you're probably more familiar with that brand name but the stock is the same from what I can tell. 

In any case, the rifle is in excellent condition with the metal being 90%+ and having probably the nicest bolt/receiver (receiver is milled, not a stamped one!) I've seen lately on a Norinco. I purchased it to take to the range but ended up stumbling across a great deal on a parts kit and to fund the build I'm letting this one go. Today I field stripped the rifle, disassembled the bolt, and did all the cleaning the original owner appears to have neglected and it's now in perfect functioning order. You do not want to take a chance on shooting one that hasn't had the cosmoline cleaned out the firing pin area! This gun is ready to shoot and has been cleaned/lubed inside and out.

The stock has a cheek rest for right handed shooters as well as a 1"" butt pad built in that really improves the length of pull and should absorb recoil nicely as well. As it stands there is no bayonet but I found a supplier that can get a wood stock + bayonet + hardware for $40 if you want to convert it back to original stock with the folding bayonet. You'll recoup that easily by selling the existing stock if you swap it out."

Classic rifle and caliber with rare makers provenance. There are many of these rifles around in 30-06 but the .257 is hard to find.  Here is more info on the maker from Bowens Classic Arms:

""R. F. Sedgley was one of the most prolific American gunmakers and exerted a great deal of influence in the trade, particularly between the two World Wars. Best known for his Springfield and Mauser sporting rifles, he also dabbled in handguns. Many of the famous revolvers conceived and owned by Elmer Keith, including the No. 5 gun, reflect his handiwork.

Among his least known designs are the lift-out cylinder single-actions. Known examples are based upon Colt SAA guns suitably modified to contain what is essentially a double-action cylinder with an extractor and extractor rod for simultaneous ejection. The rod is pulled forward freeing the bolts so that the cylinder can be removed through the loading gate.""

It has an unknown brand 3 prong style flash hider as well. If you want, it'll come with an old tasco 4x32 on quick dismount rings that I had sitting around, but show obvious wear, but the scope is still completely functional. 2 factory 7 round mags and 1 aftermarket 11 or 12 rounder. I was told by the previous owner it had less than 500 rounds through, and I've only personally put about 30 or so through it with no problems function wise, but the factory wood stock cracked, hence the new choate. the cracked stock and original buffer and spring are yours if you want them for whatever reason. These things are a blast to shoot and an awesome plinker for those who want a bit more pop than a 22.

The stock is a top of the line Bell & Carlson Mark 2. The Mark AR comes with turrets calibrated for the ballistics of the most popular 55 grain .223 ammunition (at 3240 fps), so you simply dial to the yardage you're target is and pull the trigger, without referencing complex ballistics charts. This is a great urban sniper setup with the 20"" long and .820"" thick heavy barrel in 1-9"" twist. It is also a stellar varmint rifle. If you choose to reload handloads or want a turret for a specific round other than the standard 55 grain round, Leupold will make a custom turret for this scope for your particular load for less than $100 shipped. The gun is one year old and has less than 400 rounds through it. The gun is simply a tack driver, balancing the right amount of weight to make recoild a non issue while staying light enough to carry in the field. Whether you want it to shoot coyotes or prairie dogs or for a post apocalypse zombie kit, you will smile after you pull the trigger."

Nosler Custom Brass was developed to complement their line of custom bullets. Each lot is weight-sorted to provide consistent measurements and capacities for accurate loads and features a Nosler head-stamp. Before shipment, Nosler chamfers and deburrs the case mouths and deburrs the flash hole. Fully prepped and ready to load upon receipt, each piece of brass offers consistency in trimmed length and neck wall thickness. This brass is new and unprimed. This is not loaded ammunition.

Also included is a Galco leather shoot-through wallet holster. All springs were just replaced a month ago (both in the gun and magazine) with Wolff Gunsprings. It's in good condition with a few marks, but it's far from being brand new. Probably one of the safest little pocket guns you can buy since it has two safety mechanisms (thumb safety and grip safety). It's light enough to carry comfortably and heavy enough to absorb most of the recoil. Only selling/trading because I need a more simple handgun like a revolver for my wife. Asking $275 OBO."

**Price drop to $1000 Cash FIRM.  Bill of sale and KS ID/DL.  This is the last agreed price before two different buyers chickened out (who didn't even get to look at the rifle.)

Overview off the internet remington site:

Remington brought the hunting-rifle prowess, and a leading manufacturer of modular repeating rifles introduced us to the 308 Win platform. What emerged is a masterwork of game-dropping performance and hunt-specific features that will load any camp’s meat pole with unrivaled efficiency – the new Model R-25. An advanced, highly lethal blend of accuracy, fast followups and light recoil chambered for three of today’s most popular short-action hunting cartridges – 243 Win, 7mm-08 Remington and 308 Win. This rifle is everything varmint and predator hunters love about our R-15 in a beefed-up design that easily handles cartridges suitable for big-game hunting.
For peak accuracy, its precision-crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is freefloated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation. The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight. When it’s time to make the shot, the R-25’s ergonomic pistol-grip gives you unmatched control and rock-steady aim. As a whole, this rifle has a balanced, stable design that makes it deadly from the offhand position. True to our hunting market, the traditional two-stage trigger found on AR-platform rifles has been exchanged for a crisp, single-stage version that comes from the factory set at 4 1/2 to 5 lbs.
Its carefully tuned upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings. The entire gun is dressed in tan dura coat™ camo that makes it virtually invisible in the field. We included a 20-round magazine, and the R-25 is compatible with DPMS 308 Win-type magazines and accessories. front and rear sling swivel studs are installed.
Key Features:

    Semi-automatic AR-10-style rifle developed in conjunction with an industry leader in the category
    Free-floated button-rifled 0.680"" Muzzle OD ChroMoly barrels with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy
    Fluted barrel design reduces weight and promotes rapid barrel cooling
    Clean-breaking single-stage hunting trigger (factory set to 4.5-5lbs)
    Receiver-length Picatinny rail for adding optics and accessories
    Ergonomic pistol grip for rock solid aiming and control
    Front and rear sling swivel studs
    Legal for hunting in most states
    Compatible with aftermarket DPMS 308 Win Magazine Boxes

This is an awesome rifle and is a real show stopper. I have fired 25 trouble free rounds thru it (5 FMJ's to roughly get sighted & then Hornady A-max match only from that point), but just do not get the oppurtunity to shoot it very often. The rifle looks like new and needs nothing. Recoil is manageable w/ the muzzle brake & feels like a 3"" 12ga shot out of a light shotgun. The pics show the rifle with the bolt removed as I store in my safe with it out to save some room, but is in like new condition and obviously included just not shown in the pics. I will throw in some armor piercing ammo to get you started also. Scope and rings NOT included....just the rifle as it sits w/ bipod. $2200 obo cash only.....
