Hello, I am selling my Sig Sauer P238 in .380 ACP. It has approx 200 rounds through it. I bought it to carry because it was much easier to shoot than my LCP, but carried it very seldom and I don’t want it to be left unused.

It came from the factory as a basic model, but I sent it in and had SIG add night sights and I added a set of Larry Davidson G10 grips.

This package will come with 
The P238 (with new Night Sights and G10 grips)
One 6 round magazine
Original Box
Original Manual
Gun Lock

I do require a bill of sale to be written and you must be a MO resident (who is allowed to own a handgun) with the ID to prove it. IL residents - If you want to purchase, I will bring the gun to a dealer in your state and transfer it to them and you can have it transfered to you. I will not break federal law to sell this to you.

Feel free to price check where ever you want, but factor in any transfer fees, taxes and hassle that you can avoid by purchasing this from me face to face.

Not sure if it is officially an antique (or even a 'firearm') and there was no 'curio/relic' category.*

Had this listed on eBay, and even though similar ones were listed and sold, eBay removed my listing because I ""listed a cap gun that does not contain the required markings to indicate that it is a replica. Replica firearms, even toys, must have clear markings (commonly a blaze orange plug) -permanently- affixed to the end of the barrel""

It is in fine shape, and all parts seem to function alright. The pin used to lock the barrel in place or release the barrel to open at the breach is stiff. There are dings etc on the wood stock and barrel. There is an empty 2mm cap in place. I have removed it and replaced it to make sure it wasn't stuck.

Product Description:

The DCM Competition Model combines all the features we've seen as ""modifications"" by High Power Competitors - to create a rifle that can help you win ""right out of the box""! Bushmaster has designed a rifle for the serious DCM Competition Shooter. In keeping with DCM (Department of Civilian Marksmanship) High Power Competition Rules, this rifle looks like a ""stock AR-15"" type rifle, but includes all the modifications and upgrades that will give you a competitive edge. All the features built into this superb competition rifle result from years of observation and discussions with competitors at the Camp Perry National High Power Matches. These special accurizing features include:

    The M16A2 Dual Aperture Rear Sight is specifically modified to accept interchangeable apertures available in four sizes to suit the competitor's vision and preference... .036""; .040"" (Standard); .046"" or .052"" diameter. Additionally, the sight can be configured for a choice of 1/2"" or 1/4"" Minute of Adjustment for both Windage Knob and Elevation Drum.

    The Competition Front Sight is specially ground on three sides for optimum clarity, and is available in the shooter's choice of two widths (.052"",or .062""). It is secured within the front sight base by a set screw to avoid the possibility of any movement once the rifle has been ""zeroed"".

    The 20"" Bushmaster Extra Heavy Competition Barrel is a full 1"" diameter under the free float tube, and is precision button rifled 1 turn in 8"" - right hand twist - 6 lands and grooves. The Barrel material is ChromeMoly Vanadium Steel, and the Firing Chamber is machined to SAAMI specifications. It is lead lapped and hardened to Rockwell C26 to 32. Unlike many other Bushmaster Barrels, this barrel is not Chrome lined.

    In the Upper Receiver, the Bolt is carefully matched to the Barrel Extension Lugs for precise lockup, maximum strength and optimum accuracy.

    The Lower Receiver houses a finely honed Two Stage Competition Trigger that is factory set for a 3.5 lb. first stage and a 1 lb. let-off (second stage). This 4.5 lb. total trigger pull meets CMP/NRA competition regulations.

    The handguard set looks like government issue parts, but is actually a Competition ""Free Floater"" Tube (handguard tube/barrel nut combination). It does not contact the Barrel forward of the Receiver. A sling swivel is attached to the forward end of the tube to avoid any possibility of deflection or pressure on the barrel that could degrade accuracy.

    The Buttstock has been improved for competition with the addition of a 3.62 lb. lead ""Counterbalance Weight"" which can be trimmed by the competitor to achieve a comfortable balance and solid feel."

I took this on trade so I don't know to much about it. The local gun dealer valued it at around $115-$130 Range. This is the part I don't understand. You Do Not need a NYS Pistol Permit to own this gun unless you have the powder, caps, and lead balls to load it. I checked with both the Erie County Pistol department and my local gun dealer and both confirmed it.

This is a Colt ""Super .38"" that was manufactured back in 1951. As the model name would imply, this pistol is chambered for the .38 Super cartridge.

This cartridge was developed for the 1911 platform to produce higher velocity ballistics capable of penetrating automobile bodies, something the blunt .45 ACP had trouble doing. Sales were somewhat limited in the U.S. while the caliber became quite popular south of the border where military caliber handguns were prohibited.

The pistol comes with the original box which is numbered to the gun and includes the original instruction sheet, Overall condition is excellent, The original blue finish rates 97-98% overall with only light wear and handlijng marks.

The Beretta 21A .22 LR is a highly reliable defense weapon, compact enough for easy concealed carry yet powerful enough for self-defense. This double action pistol comes with a 7-round mag. The tip-up barrel of this pocket pistol allows rounds to be loaded directly into the chamber without slide retraction, and the barrel is high strength stainless steel. 

Jamming and stove-piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design. The Beretta 21A by itself weighs only 11.5 ounces (325 grams). It features a lightweight, alloy frame, blued steel slide, tip-up barrel, and double/single action. 

This sharp little pocket pistol is impressive enough by itself, but when it’s combined with the AWC Titan 3 Suppressor you’ve got a suppressed 22LR pistol that’s second to none! The Titanium Titan 3 is only 3.75” long, and it weighs an extremely light 3.4 ounces. THE BERETTA 21A WITH THE TITAN 3 WEIGH JUST 14.9 OUNCES COMBINED – THAT’S A SUPPRESSED 22 LR THAT WEIGHTS UNDER 1 POUND!

Here we have a like new CIA (Century Arms) Ultra 87 12 gauge shotgun. It is designed just like the Remington 870 (Rem 870 parts and accessories swap right out) but with the Mossberg 500 style saftey on top. Has an 18in smoothbore barrel, red fiber optic sights, black synthetic stock with recoil absorbing buttpad,  5+1 capacity, factory manual, custom tactical sling with removeable sections so you can change up how you want to carry it and a very nice like new soft case with an outside shotshell/document pocket. Has had only 15 or so rounds through it. The factory cosmoline was professionally removed and the gun oiled by a gunsmith prior to testing the function/firing. It was cleaned/oiled right after testing and then put up. It doesn't miss a beat! This is a great gun at a great price!

$200 cash price without sling and case / $260 with sling and case but would rather trade. Need a .22-.40 compact or subcompact for my CCW. Would like a .380.
