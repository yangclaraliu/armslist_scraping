The firearm is in pretty rough shape. The barrels have rust spots and a section of the rib has come off both barrels and is rusted. throughout this area. The stock is missing a lot of its original finish and exhibits the usual nicks and dings associated with a shotgun this old. The good news is that there is still some of the original color case hardening, the gun locks up tight, and the hammers are still very tight. Not sure if it matter or not, but this shotgun is a take-down model. Make an offer, im not even going to begin to guess what its worth in this shape. I will also take any trades, especially if you have any black powder firearms."

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels.
 The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.
 The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.”
 When you want the best AR-15 you can get, go with LWRC."

The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

I have a 2002 HD Sportster 1200 Custom that I want to trade for a high end carbine/battle rifle. You will not see another sportster like this any where! It has a rare factory custom paint job. Pretty much everything that can be chromed is chromed. Custom HD pegs and mirrors and grips. Custom HD badlander seat. Medium size ape hanger which are very managable. Turn signal relocation on front and back. Custom turn signal bullet smoke out kit. Custom S&S carb cover. Sampson straight pipes, this bike has a great sound! HD Forks bag. This bike has every thing. You will not have to add a thing to show it off. Reminds me of a new age bobber. All the accessesories were put on by a HD dealer. The bike has always been garage kept and has never seen a drop of rain.

The bike has not been rode in 2 years due to me relocating and not being able to take the bike with me. The bike needs servicing and oil change and etc. The 2002 Harley Davidson was the last year they had carbuerated engines, so with that being said you will need to get the bike serviced since it has been in storage the last two years. I am willing to allow, since the bike has been in storage in my garage, a price break so you will come out ahead in a trade. The bike has 13200 miles on it, which is low for it's age. The bike has been taken care of!  The bike is worth $4700 per the blue book. So I am willing to trade it for a rifle/carbine/package that will make both of us happy.  

***Disclaimer: I believe in honest and open transactions. You can look at this bike pretty much any time and you will see you are getting a good deal. I am willing to take a little bit of a hit on this trade because I would rather the bike go to someone that will enjoy it and ride it instead of it just sitting in my garage not getting rode(and in turn I get a rifle I can enjoy). I HAVE THE TITLE IN HAND. BIKE HAS NEVER BEEN WRECKED OR LAID DOWN. I WILL GIVE YOU VIN NUMBER TO DO A CHECK ON IT IF YOU WANT! 

Please email me via this website with your offer and I will give you my cell so we can text or talk. If you could please send pictures. I am available and ready to do a deal. Thank you and have a good un!

THE MR556A1
A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.

The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.

The M600C Scout Light® attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. Its small size increases weapon maneuverability, increases rail space available for other accessories, and minimizes added weight. It uses a high-efficiency LED emitter, virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break, and a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to create a beam with good reach and significant peripheral light for close- to medium-range applications. Maximum output is 200 lumens, and it produces tactical-level light—more than enough to temporarily overwhelm the night-adapted vision of an aggressor—for over two hours per set of batteries. The M600C has a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600C is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-tested, built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black"

I am looking to trade my STG-58. It is a Century build on a Hesse receiver. It functions fine, shoots good, and I have had no issues with it. Has a little wear here and there but nothing is out of shape.

I have put at most 4 mags through it total in the past two years. 

Two mags, 200 rounds of West German ammo unopened in it's battle pack, plus some random Winchester rounds (not sure on the exact count) will come with it.

What I have listed for trades is what I am after. However, I may ponder on other offers. So, let me know! Trader must be an Ohio resident and willing to sign a bill of sale. Would prefer to deal with someone with a CHL, but not required."

I know they make special trailers for 'em, but that would be too ""inside"" that box. While a used canoe trailer is certainly acceptable, I think there might be other types that would work just as well or better. If you have a cheapie trailer that would at least hold the darn thing, let me know. Let's chat and see what we can come up with. Thanks

Oh yeah, I'm also going to be looking for a small motor (5 hp or less) maybe a small electric trolling motor to stick on this thing for when I just can't bring myself to paddle anymore. A small gas motor would work too.

I have an idea for a transom (the side mounted type $50 from LL Bean), but if you're a canoeing/boating aficionado, maybe you have an ingenious idea to mount the motor."

There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new. Bore is in fantastic shape. Shoots brass or steel case ammo.
This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47. The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section. This rifle has a chromed gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented. The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design. Chrome lined barrel. The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights. There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the night sights can be replaced by new mepro sights from Optics Planet for about $80.
The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic. There are (12) 35 round magazines. There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).
