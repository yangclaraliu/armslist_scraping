The Daniel Defense v7 6.8 is one of our latest additions to our M4 rifle family.  The v7 6.8SPC gives shooters the stopping power of a 6.8 cartridge with the accuracy of the Daniel Defense Cold Hammer Forged barrel.  With the incorporation of our new Modular Float Rail (MFR) 12.0, this rifle provides each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability.  Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube.  In addition, the 3” Modular Picatinny Rail sections allow the shooter to customize the rail set up.

The v7 6.8 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

MARS (Multipurpose Aiming Reflex Sight)
This is the model with the integrated visible laser. It has multiple brightness settings, and then detects ambient light and adjusts the brightness automatically. Also the laser is calibrated with the red dot. Move the red dot, and the laser automatically zeroes with it. It is very robust, and are built to withstand the rigors of war. Having owned just about everything, I far prefer this to the EoTech and Aimpoint line, the dot is easy to acquire and the laser works perfectly for when you can't get your head in a position to see an optic. They come with an integrated QD mount and pressure switch for the laser. This one is in near mint condition. One of the decal stickers fell off, but other than that looks nearly new. Serial # is 04030104. It comes with the original box, and pressure switch strap, and an extra battery. I had it on my YHM M4 for a few hundred rounds, and it has sat in the box when not in use. These retail for around $1,200 when you can find them, and seldom show up on the used market.

Official Product Description:

Night Vision: ITT Night Quest 260 Generation III Binocular

ITT has been the world leader in night vision equipment development since their inception in 1959 and are now the sole supplier to the U.S. Military. Proven by U.S. and Allied Forces in Operation Desert Storm, ITT's Generation 3 night vision products are light years ahead of the surplus Russian equipment being pawned at army surplus stores. 404 precision engineered processes go into the assembly and manufacturing of each viewer. Several features set ITT's products apart from anything else on the market. These are: a state-of-the-art image intensifier tube with their unique MCP (microchannel plate) which contains over 6,000,000 microchannels. Each channel is 20 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Covering the microchannel plate is a thin protective film that's less than 100 atoms thick. The phosphor screen has a resolution 20 times higher than the typical television set, and all night vision products are sealed under clean-room conditions in such an ultra-high vacuum state that no other manufacturer can compare. The end result is clarity and resolution unmatched by others.
Night Quest 250/260

Compact, lightweight and weather resistant, the 250/260 binocular is a vital visual aid for peace of mind. These units were tested to rigid military specifications and were used in Desert Storm. Ideal for search and rescue, security and recreation, the Night Quest comes in both G2 and G3 Models. Superior clarity and resolution even in extremely low-light conditions allows the Model 250/260 to capture even the slightest speck of starlight to provide excellent night-time viewing. Ruggedly constructed, water resistant and lightweight (26 ounces), the Model 250/260 is easy to handle and has automatic gain control and electronic focus. The units feature F/1.4 optics and a 40° field of view. Runs on a 6V lithium camera battery.

187,http://www.armslist.com/posts/491187,For Sale/Trade:  15 ft duck hunting / fishing boat..,"Dayton, Dayton, Ohio","$ 2,300","Listed On: Thursday, August 2, 2012",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1970's model #1542 Ouachita boat, with foam filled sides. When I got
 the boat, it was bare inside,.
 I stripped the entire boat to bare metal. We added
 1/8"" aluminum angle to the chines up front to serve as ice breakers,
 and they function very well. Broke about 200yds of ice each way on one
 trip last January.

 The bottom of the boat is coated with Super Slick Steel Flex, which is
 an airboat coating. This stuff is super tough, and will stand up to
 banging on logs, rocks, sand and gravel bars, etc. this boat was to
 ultimately be a mud boat, which is why it was coated.

 The front of the boat has two 130 watt off road lights mounted to the
 small deck. There is storage under the deck also.

 Inside, two 6' truck bed rail tool boxes have been made into bench
 seats, running along each side. Makes it easier to hunt either side of
 the blind that way. On the rear of the right bench, there is a
 weatherproof 12v plug (there is also one at the front deck) and three
 toggle switches. One toggle works the front lights, one makes the 12v
 plugs hot, and the third is not yet hooked up. It was to be used for
 interior lighting, but I never got that far. All wires run under the
 ribs on the floor of the boat.

 marine grade plywood floor added , along with black/gray indoor outdoor carpet. plus 2 camo swivel seats from bass pro were also added ...... 1 front and 1 rear

 It has 9.9 johnson sea horse motor, will start on the 1st pull.. motor was recently serviced , and is ready to go. .. plus a 45lb thrust trolling motor ( bass pro brand, brand new , only used 1 time.

 The entire boat has been covered with self etching primer, which is an
 OD green type color. custom camo paint job done to the entire boat , including the motor

 Boat sits on an older trailer that still pulls well. Lil"" Dude
 Trailer , that hinges in the middle if needed. Just pull the pin. and the boat will tilt and slide into the water It
 has 2 new brand new tires & rims with bearing buddys installed.

 On top is an Avery Quick Set duck blind. 3D leafy cut, with wind
 blockers. The blind pretty much totally encloses the boat when up, and
 is very roomy since there is 12' of open space inside, minus the
 benches. Battery, oars, guns, life vests, anchors, etc store
 completely out of the way inside the benches.

 will include the anchor PFD'S, 4 fishing rod holders, 2 gas tanks, and correct line for the motor.


this is a VERY stable boat, for duck hunting or fishing....

asking $2300 for the package.... have clean Ohio title for the boat, watercraft registration is good till 2013, registration for the trailer. no title needed for hte motor, since it is a 9.9hp motor."

This gun has been rebuilt from the ground up, using pretty much just the barreled action from a 1943 Mosin.
This rifle was setup for predator (coyote) hunting at 50-150 yards. It would also be great for Deer, Boar or pretty much anything on 4 legs out to ~200 yards.

Highlights of the build:
- Barrel cut and target crowned to 22"" by professional smith, no backyard hack job.
- Boyds Thumbhole stock, Pepper Laminate, with recoil pad
- Barrel recontoured on a lathe to remove mill marks
- Moly Resin coating on barrel and receiver, Flat Black
- Tactical length Bipod, Harris-style (very solid)
- Scout mount and 2-7x32 long eye relief scout scope
- Action polished and Slipstreamed (Hi-tech weapon lube treatment)
- Trigger polished and shimmed, ~5lbs, no slop, smooth pull

Lots more done between the stock rifle and the finished gun, I just can't remember it all right now. :)
Comes with ~50 rounds of very clean Russian FMJ copper-washed ammo.

The gun has had valuable  gun-smithing done to it, with the addition of a a very nice pronged flash suppressor. The front sight was moved back somewhat to accommodate the flash suppressor.The suppressor was not merely slipped on, but the barrel was threaded and re-crowned. so that the suppressor could be replaced with a brake if someone wanted. But I believe the current configuration is very desirable. (And way cool, besides being very practical.)

The stock is complete with the exception of a small chip of wood near the muzzle end. This is NOT a sporterized or synthetic stock rifle. It's in the original configuration. 

I restored the aviation rear sights. Most of the time these are missing because the Japanese soldiers removed them. The monopod wire is not on the rifle. 

The sling mounts are in tact. There is the common split in the rear of the buttstock. This doesn't affect the strength and can be wax filled and buffed if desired, but most of the time it is just left alone.

The chrysanthemum , the emporers symbol , is fully in tact with a faint x scratched on it, but the mum is in excellent shape. This is rare too. Most are filed off.

This also has a somewhat rare bent bolt.

For pictures via email or text just let me know where to send them.

Slam fire means you fire it by sliding the rear pistol grip forwards. It comes with 8 ultra strong nylon reloadable hulls, a 37mm super breaker explosive mortar round (completely legal, purchased at local discount guns), a 37mm-26.5mm adapter for firing cheaper 26.5 flares, and for $50 more I will throw in a 26.5mm-.45 long colt/.410 adapter. I purchased the adapter with the intent to send the launcher back to the manufacturer to get a serial number which would make this a registered destructive device enabling me to use antipersonnel ammunition, such as the .45/.410 adapter. It is not legal to use that adapter in the launcher until you get it engraved and registered. The launcher is completely legal in it's current state, because it is a 37mm signaling device. The entire launcher is constructed of solid steel, and is guaranteed to be more durable than any other 37mm launcher on the market! You can load you own 37mm shells easily with the nylon hulls, a #209 shotgun primer (I can throw in a hundred), some FFFG black powder, and some pyrotechnical knowledge :) .  This is a great launcher, I just need to move on to other things.  I also have a 12 gauge semi automatic, and a ruger 10/22 quad rail custom setup for sale."

I'm just not in love with Beretta.  I'm looking for trades for comparable 9mm's from Glock, Sig, FNP, HK USP, S&W MP.  45 caliber can work too.  Maybe optics like long eye relief stuff.

These are definitely NOT a mass produced “assembly line” rifle! We simply use the finest, GUN-KOTE™ premium metal coating & finish, for maximum protection of the rifle’s metal surfaces. It was first specified by the U.S. Military for use on SOCOM Special Sniper Weapons (SPR’s) in 2003. GUN-KOTE™ is superior to parkerized, blued, or air dry finishes in both durability and performance. GUN-KOTE™ satin matte black finish protects metal parts from rustcorrosion, & scratches and will not break down, peel or dissolve. In fact, once applied and heat-cured, the only way to remove it is through abrasive blasting. GUN-KOTE™ is resistant to all known gun solvents, oils, and thinners. GUN-KOTE™ is a highly specialized, hard, abrasion resistant coating that meets all military specifications for protective coatings. GUN-KOTE™ is formulated to provide excellent impact resistance, lubricity (meets military dry firing specs), heat dissipation, chemical resistance, corrosion protection, durability, and scratch resistance. It is specially formulated for salt corrosion protection and meets US Military requirements for ""Resistant to Chemicals"". GUN-KOTE™ has outstanding heat dissipating qualities, outstanding temperature variation durability  (+800 degrees F to -300 degrees F), and outstanding lubrication qualities. The M4 six-position collapsible stock is manufactured in the USA with military grade polymer and a super strong machined aluminum tube. We include a custom machined steel side-rail installed on the left side of the receiver to provide you the option to mount variable power scopes. The double hook USA mfg. G2 trigger group delivers a crisp 3-4 lb. trigger pull. The original CHROME LINED barrel has a bayonet lug and includes mil-spec 14:1 left hand metric threads to attach any muzzle device. The slotted RPK style muzzle break has both slots and ports to help control the muzzle during rapid fire. The UTG® PRO quad-rail system is made in the USA from aircraft grade aluminum. The four mil-spec picatinny rails have integrated QD-swivel housings on left/right rails for accessories. Protective snap on black rubber rail guards are included. The Israeli pistol grip has ergonomic finger groves with a hinged bottom plate and a battery storage tube
 that holds two CR123A batteries. The TST vertical foregrip is ultra-light- weighs less than 4 ounces, and folds flat under the bottom rail to allow all mags and drums to be easily inserted and removed. PACKAGE INCLUDES a brand new South Korean 75 round rear load drum magazine (just like the original Chinese drums!), six  THERMOLD USA mfg. 30rd polymer mags, and two (2) original Bulgarian military magazines with steel lined feed lips.thanksYou can mail me on kellysmith1477@gmail.com or text me on 6464815282 for more detail"

VERY stout pistol, easy to shoot and an excellent CCW piece. I wanted the biggest ""small"" revolver I could find and this fit the bill. This is an older piece, which is good as it doesn't have the stupid integrated lock that the newer guns have. Old school Smith revolver quality. I've owned this gun for almost 20 years. Trigger pull is smooth and lock up is tight. Will include two speedloaders. I have and will include the original huge Houge rubber grips, but I replaced them with the low profile Pachmyr grips to aid in concealment.

Asking $525.00 or best offer. I'd also be willing to trade evenly for a Beretta 92FS or similar 9mm semi auto. Please feel free to email any questions you might have or picture requests."

Three notes:
The custom coating is called Rhinohide and as far as I know, it cannot come off, but it can be painted over. The coating does have a few scatches on it.

I have not staked down the retaining nut on the stock. This will allow you to swap out stocks if you see fit.

The rifle is set up with the intention of being used with some form of optics. The CTR stock is fitted with a riser that brings your line of sight just above the iron sights. The riser is removeable if you do not want to go that way.

I can be contacted at REDACTED if there are any questions. In state purchases do not require an FFL, but out of state will. Any fees for FFL and shipping will fall on the buyer. At this time I am not accepting any trades."

Taurus PT-900 Series

Notes: This is a ""Commander-sized"" Taurus pistol. It has fixed sights, a decocking lever, a firing pin safety, and an indicator that lets the firer know whether the chamber has a round in it, even if the slide is closed and there is no magazine in the weapon. The finish may be blued or stainless steel and the grips are checkered rubber. Production of the PT-911 ceased in 2001, but the other members of the PT-900 series are still being built. The PT-940 and PT-945 are especially popular among this series; they are in fact still acquiring modifications according to customer demand. The PT-940 picked up 3-dot-type combat sights along the way; the PT-945 has a number of variants, including the PT-945C, with compensator ports near the muzzle to reduce muzzle flip, and PT-945S, which chambers the more powerful .45 Super cartridge. Most of the PT-900 series was originally exported to the US only with 10-round magazines, but with the sunset of the Assault Weapons Ban, larger magazines have been designed for most of this series. Most of this series have 4-inch barrels, but the three PT-945s use 4.25-inch barrels, and the PT-938 uses a 3.7-inch barrel.

Twilight 2000 Notes: The PT-945C, PT-945S, and PT-957 do not exist in the Twilight 2000 timeline. The PT-945 is rather rare, and with the exception of the PT-911, the rest of the members of this family are very rare."

The Gen 3 GLOCK 19 is a compact 9mm that can double as a duty or concealed carry pistol.  Many who carry a pistol everyday will tell you that  if they can only have one, it would be a G19.  The compact size GLOCK pistols really hit the sweet spot of being easy to shoot while being quite concealable with the proper holster and apparel.  If you are looking to concentrate on one platform to train with and carry, the G19 is hard to beat.

GLOCK revolutionized the handgun market with the debut of their polymer frame safe action semi-auto pistols in 1982.  To this day, GLOCK is the brand that all other polymer pistols are judged by.  For most of GLOCK's product life you could have it any way you wanted as long as it was black.  There were some OD Green frame Gen 3 guns produced for several years, but they have been discontinued since mid 2010.  Now you have a choice of having your GLOCK with a Flat Dark Earth frame exclusively through Lipsey's.  Flat Dark Earth has been the popular color to have for AR-15 parts and accessories, holsters, and all sorts of tactical gear.

Very hard to find, and not currently produced or available. Increasing in value and scarcity every day.  Includes clam shell factory case, cable lock, loading tool, (3) factory Glock 15-round magazines, and all original paperwork.  Brand new, un-fired.

Guitar has been played a handful of times in my smoke free home only, then wiped down and put back into its hardshell case when not in use. They only made these for 1 year so they are not easy to come by. 

Specs from Musicians Friend Website:

The PRS Special is a hum-single-hum guitar delivers the beauty and brightness of a maple top with a wide array of tonal possibilities due to the push/pull control and 5-way blade switch. It's loaded with covered sweet sounding vintage style-245 humbucking pickups. These pickups and their placement under the strings give the Special a voice that is classic, eminently recordable and gig ready. Throw the Lindy Fralin single-coil into the mix and you've got a treasure trove of pickup tones at your fingertips.

Features
Maple body
Figured maple top
Mahogany neck
Wide/thin neck carve
East Indian rosewood fingerboard
22 frets
PRS Tremolo
Bird inlays
Nickel hardware
PRS 245 neck humbucker
Lindy Fralin single-coil middle pickup
PRS 245 bridge humbucker
5-way blade pickup switching


Guitar is absolutely pristine, dose not show any use and has been extremely well cared for. (Case and Guitar still appear brand new) Guitar will come with all of the case candy, tremolo bar, elixir strings, strap with strap locks, unfilled out warranty card, etc.

Price I am asking for the guitar is very reasonable considering if you did buy one new new your looking at almost $2700 most places when you can find them, and if they are still selling it at that price. (MSRP for this guitar is $4485)

So, what you have laying around you'd be willing to trade for it. Like I said looking for $2100 in trade min. I will not add cash on my end so whatever you are looking to trade must be at least $2100 in value or more if you want.

Will not accept low ball offers, will not reply to emails asking if the item is still available. If the ad is still up I still have the guitar for trade.

It is the typical black parkerized finish with a very sharp double edged blade and black composite scabbard. This bayonet is designed for a short-barreled Uzi and works best with either a dummy display barrel, Full-sized Vector Uzi pistol (short barrel but no stock) or a registered UZI SBR. It will fit an UZI carbine, however the 16"" long carbine barrel basically defeats the purpose of having a bayonet fixed as the barrel is as long as the blade, (though it does provide a cutting edge along the bottom of the barrel.)

The bayonet works as an awesome stand-alone special ops edged weapon, even if you don't have an Uzi. It is very sturdy yet sleek, light, sharp and deadly.
