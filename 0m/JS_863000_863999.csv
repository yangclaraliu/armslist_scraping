I purchased it last week and am selling it because I was able to find the 9mm version.  Comes with factory packaging.  Never used.  Price is firm.  Will ship to a FFL dealer if buyer is out of state.  Local buyers will need proof of MN residency (MN drivers license) and must have a permit to purchase.

It uses a monolithic upper which is machined from a large single aluminum block instead of most AR15s which have extruded rails bolted on. The advantages are:

    Improved accuracy - the rails don't contact the barrel throwing off accuracy. Also because the rail is continuous, you don't have to use cantilevered mounts when mounting long scopes, making for a more rigid optics platform. Also when mounting lasers, they stay truer to the bore axis.
    A more rigid platform with fewer parts to break, work loose, or lose.

In addition to being the top of the line commercially made AR15, this is the most desirable LE6940 in terms of collectibility. This is a rare LE6940 and it is 100% NEW IN BOX. It has never been fired or even had a magazine inserted into it. I bought it, put it in a corrosion inhibiting bag, and locked it away in my safe. This is as pristine of an LE6940 as you will find.

Comes COMPLETE with all original accessories including:

    Flip up rear and front sights
    Original box

I will take $1000 OBO and that means ill take the highest offer wether that is below or above my asking price. REDACTED  please no calls or text after 11:00 PM thanks for looking."

MSRP:  $620

What a name! It's based on the fact that many judges are now carrying it into the courtroom with them-and for good reason. I know of no better self-defense firearm. Whether loading all 45s-all .410s or alternating them in the cylinder, the Judge is the ultimate shotgun/revolver duo, offering devastating firepower in a small package. You'll be amazed how light this gun is and how easy it is to tote around

The results are in: the Judge is one of, if not the number one, hottest-selling revolvers in the United States right now. I have received a lot of positive feedback on this revolver. People like the concept of a revolver that can shoot both .45 Colt ammo, and also be loaded with .410 shotshells for packing around.

The compact revolver weighs in at one and three-quarters pounds, which is lighter than the full-sized Judge, and only a couple of ounces heaver than the UltraLite, but more compact than either. The Public defender is a much more concealable revolver than its full-sized brethren, hiding well in a belt or shoulder holster. The sights consist of a square notch in the frame for the rear, and a fiber optic front dovetailed into the barrel rib. The new Public Defender also features a reduced profile hammer that won't catch when it needs to come out quickly. 

The cylinder holds five shots, and can be loaded with any standard .45 Colt or 2 ½ inch .410 shotshell load.  The barrel/cylinder gap measures five one-thousandths (.005) of an inch, and the single action and double action trigger pull weights measured four pounds, ten ounces and ten pounds, eight ounces, respectively.  The single action pull is very crisp, and the double action is smooth and even throughout its travel.

The Public Defender wears the Taurus Ribber synthetic rubber grips, which are very comfortable, and remove any pain from the gun’s recoil. Firing the Public Defender at ranges from arm’s length out to twenty-five yards results in predictable hits upon the standard human silhouette targets. At across-the-room distances, buckshot pellets all stay on target. I fired the revolver from the bench at twenty-five yards using .45 Colt ammunition, and keeping the hits inside a four inch circle was easy to do, even with the short sight radius. This is not target grade accuracy, but this is not a weapon that you will see on the line at the Olympics. This revolver is built for a much more serious job, and in that role of defending one’s life from the predators of this world, the Public Defender excels.

I am a fan of the Judge series of revolvers. I think that the weapon fills a niche that needed filling. The Public Defender is, in my opinion, the best version of the Judge yet, filling the same role, in a more compact, more concealable package.

Features:

Extended Ejector Rod
For positive extraction of fired cases.

Rubber Grip 
Exclusive Taurus orgonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under 
virtually all shooting conditions.

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. 

Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Fiber Optic Sight
Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic.

I’ve had it for 4 years, as a gift from my father, and it has never misfired or FTF. It comes with a leather wallet holster and a box of hi-velocity .22 short ammo. 

If you are not familiar with this gun, it is a single/double action with a thumb safety. It is very safe to carry loaded in that you can half-cock the hammer and put on the thumb safety. It holds 6 in the magazine and one in the pipe, and is slightly larger that palm-size. It carries easily in a pocket. It is a terrific concealed carry gun for both men and women. At 5-7 yds, I have found it to be very accurate in spite of it’s small size.  You must use high velocity ammo (greater than 1000 fps) for 100% reliability.
