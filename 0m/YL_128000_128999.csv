Pulled off of the Garand I bought last year from the CMP. I put all new wood on it so I don't need this stock. Not the greatest condition, but it does have one nice feature, it has the old band on the top hand guard. See picture below. I was told when I bought the rifle that that band is very desirable/collectible, hence the higher price for the stock set. Stock has the P mark, but it is very worn. Also has the number 288 stamped on the bottom
Price $80/B.O.

Don't really want to ship right now, because it's a big hassle, but if I do it will be extra.

I'm looking for a S&W PPKS for my wife. I've got a CZ 75B in .40 S&W with a satin nickel finish that I'd be willing to trade for a similar condition PPKS. SS preferable, otherwise 98% plus finish.

I have all the original stuff that came with the CZ- including the bore brush and rod not pictured - plus a pair of Hogue grips. Your PPKS should be complete also.

I'll swap ammo 2 of yours for one of mine. 

Not really interested in any other weapons at this time.

Yeah I know. I'm like the fat girl who's only looking for athletic 6 foot tall blonde professionals, but you got to wish first or it will never happen.

I reckon this is actually a pretty square to good trade in terms of value. In addition, you can trade me that cute little pistola that your wife won't touch for a fantastic classic that sets the mark for buttery triggers.

With the satin nickel finish, not only is it purty, it's durable and weather resistant. Plus it's got near 45 knockdown power with almost 9mm capacity.

Now I'm not looking for any collectible and I don't care how many you sent or didn't send down the pipe as long as it's been taken care of. My CZ built in 2001 has at least 500 rounds through, but it's clean and well lubed and in excellent firing condition. It's also a solid 98% per the Gun Digest rating system.

Face to face trades only, let's swap dl's and bill of sale."

Ruger Security Six
.357 Magnum
4 Inch Barrel
Blued Finish
Adj rear sight

1976 Year Model - Says ""Made in the 200th Year of American Liberty"" in small letters on the left side above the trigger.

Does NOT have ""Read Instruction Manual"" stamped on the barrel like the new ones have these days. (A nice thought, but I think the stamp detracts from the look)

Blued finish is slightly worn on the muzzle, holster wear. If you look closely, you can see it in the pics.

Gun is in excellent working order. Have 300 rounds through it, never a single problem. SA Trigger pull is crisp. Cylinder locks up tight. Selling because I got a stainless steel model, don't need 2. Search for ""Ruger Security Six"" on Google and you'll see how good these firearms are.

LC Smith Grade 00, it's exactly that. A 12 Gauge side-by-side with functioning auto-ejectors, made in 1912. It's seen better years, but given it's almost 100 years old and still fires, you can't be too mad at it. 

FN Browning Model 1900 in .32ACP. First semi-automatic pistol, hammerless. Pretty nifty to look at. Someone etched ""Safe"" and ""Off"" for the safety (Not sure why, jagaloon.), and it's missing a magazine. Magazines are on the internet, panhandlegunslingers.com has them.

I used one pin to replace one i had lost in a different motor...Very cheap to replace! I belive $3 through jegs for the lock.

The finish is near perfect, the only ""flaw"" I could find was on the barrel just below the serial number, it looks like some of the finish may have worn a little, not too sure from what though. It's calibered in .45ACP... It comes with all the original paperwork and still sealed in the package the first round fired from H&K. I'm selling because I need to finance the next project, that and it has been the least shot firearm I own. It comes with 2x 8 round magazines, but will also take the 10 round magazines of the full size H&K 45. It has a barrel length of 3.9"" with a railed frame along with the safety/decocker. This one is the V1 model and comes with 4 additional new barrel o-rings H&K tool, H&K lock and additional backstrap. The sights are fixed and still glow bright after being in the light for a second.

The Makarov is in great condition, showing only minor wear to the side of the safety and little to no holster wear.  It was likely never carried.  It has red commie grips with lanyard loop and comes with 2 magazines, original Cold War duty holster, 2 IWB holsters, 5 snap caps (when they finally come in the mail), 25 rounds of Hornady hollow point, 50 rounds of American Eagle FMJ, and 50 rounds of Privi Partisan FMJ.  Ridiculously accurate.

Would make an incredibly stout hunting rifle.

This was my ""go to"" hunting rifle up until recently, it is dead on accurate and 100% reliable

The stock has a couple lite scratches from being in the deep woods/ thickets but nothing to cause major concern

I put an old cheapo 3x9x40 scope on it since my scope doesn't go with it (believe it is actually an old Remington scope, it does not reflect any value to me, it is just there so it is simply not naked) Said scope is sighted for 100yds w/ 180Gr and is still deal on, even with the cheapo.

Walnut stock, Blued Metal

Round count - Approx 20

Comes w/ rings (unsure of type, most likely package rings) - the scope on it is garbage but it came with the firearm when I bought it (in fact I may take it off to make it look better - the scope pictured is not the one that is on the firearm)

I got this one from another member here, and I have shot it about 10 times myself w/ Core-Lokt ammo and she is a tack driver with a decent scope.

I have the box, all the papers, Accutrigger adjustment tool etc

This gun is in great shape, however since I am not as lucky as some to have a gun that remains brand new after being fired, It IS USED. This gun has been to the range only, never in the woods.

VALUE: 400 - Primarily interested in trades but will consider an outright cash sale @ $400 FIRM - I don't have to get rid of it (If I need it for a build before it sells it will come down obviously)

It's also got some three dot night sights by MMC - the tactical type with the adjustment cam. The 4"" slide and small officer's frame make for a nice CCW 1911, and the holster is comfy and perfect for AZ use.

It's a very clean much loved 1911 pistol, with less than 50 rounds down the barrel. The matte stainless finish is hard to photograph - but it's not grungy, nor are the roll marks marred - it's just difficult getting the finish to light correct (and I am no pro photographer).

NOTE: The series 1 pistols do NOT have a Schwartz safety, and it is not an alloy frame - the stainless steel frame gobbles up recoil from hot loads - so these are in higher demand now.

Included is a Vintage El Paso Saddlery holster - nice thick leather, natural color, with a suede lining and piped edges. They don't make them like this anymore - and it's designed for a Colt officer's 1911, so it's a perfect fit.

The Mosin-Nagant is a popular Russian-surplus military bolt action rifle which sells for $70 to $150 depending upon where you live and the condition it's in.

The biggest downfall of these rifles, in many people's opinions, is the lack of elevation-adjustable sights. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the Russians sighted these to hit 6"" to 8"" high at 100 meters, when on the 100 meter setting!

This sight was created by me after finding that the only other adjustable sight out there for the Mosin-Nagant costs almost as much as another rifle!

The sight post is .020"" thinner on top than stock for a finer sight picture.  Included are an adjustment tool and two shims.  Though you should not need the shims, there's always that odd dovetail out there that's been given somewhat generous dimensions.

Unfortunately, due to government restrictions, I cannot accept orders on this service outside the United States.

Thank you very much for looking!

 This rifle is in 97% condition, has a Remington barrel dated 8-44, Remington bolt, sling , and looks to have been fired very little. The stock is in very nice shape as well. I'm looking to get $450.00 or will consider trades, especially a k98 Mauser, a handgun in 9mm or 45, a small caliber centerfire bolt action, or other vintage military rifles. Please see photos for details, and feel free to email me with trade offers. Watcha got? Face to face in Tulsa or surrounding area only. Thanks for looking!"
