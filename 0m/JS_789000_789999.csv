THE BORE IS BRIGHT AND SHINY WITH LOTS OF RIFLING REMAINING. Email only. Emails with phone number given priority. Sorry about the lack of a texting number or a phone number but that seems to go nowhere and irritates my wife. If you're going to make a trade offer include some detail so that I know what you have. Pictures are a real plus.  Please see the list of exclusions on the trade list, I'm sorry but I've been offered all of these items on previous listings and I'm not interested."

Not interested in trades.

 For sale is my DPMS LR-308 24"" Stainless Bull barrel complete upper assembly, with bolt carrier group. I bought it from Brownells in February of 2011. I recently added a Troy TRX 13.8"" free-float handguard and had the barrel threaded and installed a JP .936 compensator. The original non-vented aluminum free-float tube and BSA 3-12X scope are also included. I have original boxes for everything.
 About 84 rounds have been fired through it and the DPMS break-in procedure has been followed. Cleaned with Mil-Comm cleaner and lube.

Pending Sale: Lower may still be available. It has a Vltor stock, Ergo grip, and a Timney trigger. Bill of sale required, meet to pick up only.

 I prefer face to face but shipping may be worked out. No FFL or bill of sale needed for the upper.

The Noveske 300 AAC BLACKOUT is designed to run optimally firing both subsonic suppressed and supersonic unsuppressed. This barrel is tuned to lock back on the last round using subsonic 220 and 208 grain ammunition with a sound suppressor. The firearm may not lock back with subsonic 220 and 208 grain ammunition without a sound suppressor. Also, the subsonic 300 BLK ammunition is more susceptible to a malfunction due to carbon fouling and adverse conditions than supersonic ammunition. The barrel is tuned to operate correctly with the back pressure provided by the AAC 762-SDN-6 using an H2 buffer, or a Surefire 762K suppressor and an H buffer. In the development of this barrel, we found evidence that the suppressor may require a symmetrical baffle stack as found in the AAC Cyclone K, 762-SDN6, and Surefire 762K suppressor. Suppressors which cause off axis turbulence, such as those with K type baffles, may cause baffle strikes and/or point of impact shift, and may damage your suppressor. Noveske Rifleworks LLC will not be responsible for damage or injury under ANY circumstances. Consult you suppressor manufacturer to determine if your suppressor is suitable for this application."

These, with the FOP engraving on the side, were available to members of the Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, DC in 1989 when the department converted from revolvers to the Glocks. These were not issued by the government, they were offered thru the FOP lodge from Glock.

Departmental communication in those days was by ""Teletype"" machines. I have an original teletype, dated May 30, 1989, announcing the arrival of the Glocks ordered prior to March 1, 1989. I cannot imagine that there is another nut out there that has this message from 1989...my bet is that this is the only one that exists and it links this gun historically.

This pistol was made in April 1989 and after I first picked it up on June 1, 1989, I fired 20 rounds thru it. I put it away after that and never fired it. So it is in truly new condition.

Included, with the gun (which has regular white sights, not the glow type) and teletype message, is the original box, manual, two 15 round magazines, a magazine loading assist tool, a Glock #45 holster, original unused bore brush and cleaning rod. I also have the original invoice from Glock for the original purchase dated May 1989.

I am not a FFL holder, so $50 shipping from my local FFL holder to yours, or face to face with no charge to a fellow resident of Virginia

Here is a complete document list:

Original Manual, dated March 1988
Original Invoice from Glock for pistol, dated May 12, 1989
Original Invoice from Glock for holster, dated November 29, 1989
Original White Warranty Card (Owner half, completed – it appears half was returned to Glock)

It is mounted to a Blackhawk KnoxxII reduced recoil stock system with a tactical 3 point forend and a monster barrel breach with sling.

Early hunting conversion. Easily takes down deer and Elk.  Great gun for collectors to.   Also comes with 60 brass shells for reloading also 11 live rounds.  Works great i have put around 80 rds the last  10 years.  Don't know a lot about gun doesn't fit my collection.  I Think it was converted in 50's or 60's and looks professionally done not sure could be earlier. The internals are in great shape and always kept clean and oiled. Guns were originally Used in Spanish American war. Was the first non black powder rifle adopted by US military.  Hold 6 rounds and was revolutionary for its time. Reload is easy with the flip down action that allows you to poor in 5 rounds at once. Some scratches and a piece of stock glued back on near bolt can see in pic was this way when i got the gun 10 years ago a little work would blend in better just cosmetic shoots great and very smooth action.

12 Gauge. Double Slide Bars - Pump-Action System.   3"" Magnum Chamber. Factory Blue Finish.   Excellent - Almost New - condition Browning Arms BPS 12ga. Magnum. Perfect factory Blue finish. Buy this Nearly NEW gun now, without the new gun price!

I don't know much about this shotgun beyond what I am listing here.. A relative I received it from said a fair price would be $450 - $600 easy. If you know anything about this shotgun and can show me comparable (lower) prices from an almost mint condition browning invector shotgun and with the Single/Repeat feature, I will adjust the asking price accordingly.

It has a ring at the rear of the magazine which can be turned from side to side. ""S"" for Single shot and ""R"" for Repeat. The mag lock can be set to hold all rounds in the magazine while the shooter can load in one round at a time... allows the action to be open while the magazine is still closed... either for ""picking"" the type of round or for shooting clays. Very convenient and it means that the BPS could even be reasonably competitive for clays... They do not make this feature anymore. -  has a 28 inch, vent rib barrel. Takes 2-3/4"" and 3"" Magnum shells.  Top tang safety, bottom ejection = ambidextrous. Perfect Bore, Action and Blue. Excellent checkered, deep walnut forearm and stock has only VERY minor handling marks. (Has one very small nick' in the underside of the stock. *see pictures, barely noticeable!) Factory recoil-absorbing stock pad. Also comes with 2 additional INVECTOR SYSTEM Choke tubes (still in the original tubes w/ paperwork) Imp. Cyl. 51204 & Mod. 51203.

No Box or papers with this shotgun, manual is available from Browning at no charge. Functions perfectly. If you want a top quality PUMP action Like-NEW shotgun - but at a used price, this is your gun. 

I am asking $400.00 Firm. Cash sale in the Killeen/Temple/Waco/Belton/Fort Hood/Gatesville/Copperas Cove Basic area. I will consider a sale outside of this area and for $10 extra delivery. (within reason)

Here's what I'm offering as a package deal. The complete rifle upper/lower receiver. Upper is built by AR and the lower is made by Doublestar. Factory Magpul flip up sights and a railmounted Sig Sauer multi funtional tactical grip that has the laser sighting, and flashlight that also doubles as a strobe. Stock is 5 way adjustable.  4/50 round ps90 magazines will be included. One is an AR that came with the rifle and the other 3 are made by FN Herstal. Also included is the real sweet Plano gun guard case. This rifle has little to non existent recoil!  A great feature on this rifle is that spent casings get dropped through the mag chamber as opposed to the side like your standard AR! No need to pick up spent shell casings any more.  Any questions? Just shoot me an e mail. I'd be happy to answer. Im by no means a gun expert but I will try to answer your questions to the best of my knowledge."

This rifle has seen extensive use with the Israeli Commando forces and is favored by many other elite forces.

Dont want to wait 100 hours for a CBI check?
Have a zombie infestation?
Afraid of a Tyrannical Government?
Just don't want to be one of 'those guys' with another AR platform toy?
Can't find Ammo?
OWN A PRACTICAL PIECE OF HISTORY!

Here is a Tactical SKS in nice shape..make no mistake, its a shooter...
Weapon has the original 3 sided bayonett, early ATI collapsible stock, cheap walmart sling.

BUT WAIT! THERES MORE!!!

Also included is this rediculous banana magazine, which holds about 70 rounds, but jams up if you put more than 40 rounds in it. lets just call it a 40 rounder.. 40 and under it works flawlessly. also two tapco magazines, which are almost brand new.

in addition, im including the stock reciever cover, plus THREE MORE to mount various tacti-cool stuff to the SKS... a hi-rise, a tri rail, a ring mount cover.

ALSO, a 7.62x39 LASER BORE SIGHT!! HOW COOL IS THAT?!

AND, i have an AK magazine conversion kit, which requires a gunsmith to install, but once installed you can use normal AK mags, which are MUCH easier to find that SKS mags, and dont have that stupid duck bill on them. it includes one AK mag..

ALSO INCLUDING about 500 rounds of AMMO!! cant find .223 right now? dont like the high cost of shooting? this thing is MADE TO SHOOT CHEAP RUSSIAN STEEL CASED AMMO ALL DAY LONG AND LAUGH WHILE DOING IT!!!!! Tula ammo runs $5 for 20 rounds and is usually available at WALMART... since its not right now, 500 rounds should get you by until its back in stock.

the 4x20 scope is included, but your gonna want to use the iron sights, this thing is extremely accurate at short and medium ranges. probably long range also, but I cant see that far to tell. 

anyway, its a COMPLETE PACKAGE, ready to shoot, with lots of cool extras. YOU CANT BEAT THAT! buy an assault rifle TODAY, and shoot it on the way home!"

It was chronographed over 4,000 f.p.s and grouped better than 1/2 m.o.a.. The trigger on the rifle is very light/crisp. The metal is a satin stainless steel, and the wood a black laminate on a thumbhole stock. For a flat out trade on a good AR I will include a Burris 6x18 scope. The muzzle has a trophy crown for improved accuracy, and the forend is vented to allow the heavy bull barrel to cool quicker when you're in the thick of it. Also, this gun has an operable floor plate which makes it nice to unload after you've cleared the farm of critters.
Along with this rifle comes RCBS dies and approximate 150 pcs of once-fired brass. I have about 20 rds of loaded ammo still as well. Original box and paperwork comes with it too.
I love this gun and would like to hang on to it, but like everyone else in the country right now, I need an AR-15 and money is tight after Christmas.
I would trade this rifle and the extras for an AR 15 (.223/5.56). I would also consider a trade for the right 1911. 
If you're interested in this rifle and have asomething along these lines as trade I would love to hear from you at REDACTED (text or call).

This is the rare model that has the 14.5 inch barrel with fixed muzzle break.  The Muzzel break is a true muzzle break bringing the recoil down close to 22 cal recoil.  This is my person gun that I am selling as I have 2 and only need one.  I took it to the range 2 times only firing roughly 300 rounds through it total.  That is actually a nice thing as these usually take roughly 300 round to break in.  The rilfe hardly shows a sign of use as pictured and functions perfectly.  We have other assult type rifles in stock so just come by and see if we have what you need or want.
