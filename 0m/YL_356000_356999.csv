This pistol has a low round count and is in fairly decent condition. THE SLIDE SHOWS SOME WEAR ON THE LOWER RIGHT FRONT PORTION. This pistol came from the factory like this.

It is a full size 45 with the ergo grip, variant 1 with safety/decocker lever, it comes with 3 10 round magazines, extra backstrap and rechargeable glow in the dark night sights.

I would consider trading for a high end AR 15 or 1911.

Round count is about 300-400 rounds, this gun was purchased new in 2011 at fin feather fur.  Still has sticker on the bottom of the case, it was $1029.

CCW holders preferred, you must be an IOH resident with ID to buy this pistol from me.

The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics:
•Integral MIL STD 1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories 
•Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
•HK45 grip-to-slide angle matches Model 1911’s profile
•Common high-capacity metal magazines with a capacity of 10 rounds (for both HK45 and HK45 Compact models). 
•Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
•Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
•O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup
•Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and better accuracy
•Improved ergonomic control levers (safety and/or decocking)
•Low profile drift adjustable 3-dot sights
•Contoured and radiused slide with forward slide (grasping) grooves and anti-glare longitudinal ribs

Suggested Retail Price: $1,193 (DA/SA with control lever), $1,260 (LEM enhanced DAO model without control lever)."

This is is 5.56, so it will shoot both 223 and 5.56.
It is a SA Grimm Reaper lower and DPMS LPK.
It has a Magpul trigger guard and a Magpul UBR stock. Yes! Magpuls best stock.

The upper has a BHW Stainless Steel 1:8 twist barrel which means you can shoot both heavy and light rounds with no problem.
It has the Magpul guard with lower rail and handle. Plus it has the the BCM medium charging handle and Magpul sling attachment.
I am throwing in the 9-16 illuminated scTope and a red dot sight.
It comes with 3 Magpul 30rnd magazines, 1 of which is a window mag.
I will also throw in 100 rounds, 40 which are the Federal Penetrator rounds, and 20 of them are tracers.
Plus you get a Voodoo soft case that has room for an extra weapon, magazines and tools.

Buying all this separately would cost easily over $1600, but I am selling for $1200 firm.
Why am I selling. I have another rifle I use and I dont shoot this one often enough. I have only shot it 3 times.
So, you can spend a grand for a AR and add $$$ of extras on it, or you can pay $1600+ tax and have Uncle Sam come and take it away in a year or less.
Or, you can buy this, which has everything you need, except maybe a two stage trigger depending on how you want to shoot it, and Uncle Sam will have no clue you own it, so you dont have to worry about Obama come and taking it away from you when we go communist. (Sorry, rant is over)

Again, $1200 firm. First come, first served.
Let me know.

I am selling because I have too many guns, and could use the money for other projects. 

This gun will come with three magazines. This is an important consideration, as the gun only comes with 1 magazine from factory. They are not cheap or easy to find. You will also get a custom leather/kydex hybrid inside the waistband holster that was custom molded for this gun by Old Faithful Holsters. It is in great condition and it holds this gun very securely and comfortably. 

You will get everything pictured, including the factory case, the manual, the lock, the larger backstrap that you can change out, the holster, the three magazines, and anything else that the gun came with when I bought it.

Though I would love to keep this rifle, I simply can't due to financial circumstances and buying a new home and the cost of renovations. This H&K started it's life as a SL8-1 and was converted to a G36 (semi auto of course). This rifle has the folding stock, pistol grip, G36 handguards, and will accept AR-15 magazines. I have read and been advised by many folks that the conversion alone will cost around $2,000. This is not with the addition of a SL8 which will set you back a pretty penny itself. The gun looks great. I have not fired it since purchasing it and the round count is said to be low. There are very few blemishes on this gun. There is one slight blemish along the handguards that looks as if it was moved around in a gun safe. It also has a slight mark on the mag release. I will post a link to photobucket so everyone can view photos. If you would like to see more photos, please pm me. I am asking $3,300 cash for this rifle. This is a steal compared to what I have researched. I will consider partial trades for this rifle but the deal must include $2500 in cash due to our financial needs at the moment. This rifle will come with one Lancer Clear magazine. Here is the link to see the photos

I can also send photos via email if you would like. 

Partial trades that will be considered: AKM's (7.62x39 or 5.45x39), slug guns, cetme, FAL, Saiga's, Home Defense Shotguns, Glocks, and many others. Bulk Ammo is also considered as well as ak mags. 

If you have any questions, feel free to pm me. Thanks for looking. 

This sale will take place face to face in Rowan County, NC. I will consider shipping the rifle at the cost of the buyer though I would prefer a face to face deal. 

The price has been reduced to $3000 cash or $2500 cash and $3000 in trade. I really need to move this rifle."

The pistol has also been to a gunsmith to have Wolff Extra Power springs installed to replace the mainsprings,and the action slicked up a bit.
It has seen no more then 300 rounds of use.

Included is 2,20 round Hi-Power magazines (magazines are interchangeable with the Hi-Power),the 2 original 13 round mags,3 sets of grips including the original rubberized grips,a set of Walnut grips made in Budapest by Marshall Grips,and on the gun right now is a pair of Pachmayr Signature Series wrap around grips.
Also included is 175 rounds of ammunition: 2,50 round boxes of Fiocchi 124 grain FMJ Truncated; 1,25 round box of 124 grain +P Remington Golden Sabre,and a 50 round box of British 124 Gr L7A1,which is relatively rare.
I'll also throw in a shoulder holster that I modified to hold the 2 20 round magazines.

No,its not a Glock or Springfeild,but it is a Hi-Power clone,and Arcus pistols -if you can find them- usually retail for around 325-350 bucks by themselves.

With all these extras- this is a steal,and trust me,I wouldn't be selling it at all if I wasn't behind on bills.

So I'm at $400 firm,but MIGHT consider a little cash along with a trade,preferably a .38 snubnose or other light,easily concealed weapon for my old lady.

This is a Tennessee local face to face offer only,and I'd prefer to do business at my home."
