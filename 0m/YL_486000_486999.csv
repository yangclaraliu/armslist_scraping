The Standard Rifle model came with a 24” round barrel and plain walnut stock. This rifle has seen some use but is in fairly nice condition. It retains probably 96%+ original factory bluing and while the wood does show some handling, which one would expect of a gun which is probably 60+ years of age, it is quite solid and not all beat up. The stock does retain the original steel butt plate and sling swivel studs. According to my research Winchester began production of the Model 43 in 1949 and ceased production in 1957 reaching serial number 62,617. This particular piece is a 5XXX range so my hunch is it is a first year production piece but am unable to authenticate that date. The barrel is quite shiny with strong and pronounced rifling. As this rifle comes equipped with a 2.5 Weaver the front sight has been removed and the rear sight notch has been correctly filled with a Marble’s dove tail plug. The scope is an old style tube with standard cross hair reticule and is mounted on a Weaver detachable base. Please ask any questions you might have and I will respond as best I am able. thanks"

I am definitely not a gun expert, so when I bought the gun and the man said it would not shoot a regular 22 shell I thought he didn't know what he was talking about.  Well it will not, as you probably know.  The blueing is worn off about half and the wood looks pretty good.  The barrel rifling looks great.  I haven't shot the gun but did take it apart to clean it and it was clean and seems to work just fine.  Since I do not know what to list about the gun I am listing my phone number, but PLEASE do not call me unless you are satisfied with the price and are still interested because the price is very FIRM.  I also have 5 boxes of Old Western Scrounger .22 Winchester Automatic for model 1903, 45 grain in the original 50 count boxes and the carton.  All boxes look great. I will take $100.00 for all 5 boxes with the purchase of the rifle.  Will not sell the ammo  separately.   If this gun is still listed it is still for sale.

You won't see this data on the US evening news, or hear politicians
disseminating this information.

Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes,
gun-control laws adversely affect only the law-abiding citizens.

Take note my fellow Americans, before it's too late!

The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, please remind them
of this history lesson.

With guns, we are 'citizens'. Without them, we are 'subjects'.

During WW II the Japanese decided not to invade America because they
knew most Americans were ARMED!

If you value your freedom, please spread this anti gun-control message
to all of your friends.

The purpose of fighting is to win.
There is no possible victory in defense.
The sword is more important than the shield, and skill is more important
than either.
The final weapon is the brain.
All else is supplemental.

A. Chassis System
Chassis is precision machined from a solid billet of high strength aircraft grade aluminum. Standard M14 and M1A 
actions are easily installed using existing M14 tools, making the conversion a true “drop-in”. Rigidity of the chassis 
increases accuracy and reliability.

B. Operating Rod Block
Precision machined from ordnance grade steel and designed to interface in close tolerance with the aluminum 
stock chassis. Additional stock bedding is eliminated by the op-rod block being joined to the chassis by three 1/4” 
screws and the standard trigger mechanism. Increases reliability and tighter groups. (Please specify light or 
medium barrel)  Will not fit Heavy barrel

C. Collapsible Stock
Straight line recoil decreases muzzle jump and felt recoil. Adjustable length of pull facilitates the use of body 
armor and stock “fit” for all shooters. Full size soft recoil pad. 1913 Picitanny rail above the pistol grip is 
engineered to provide close eye relief for night vision modules. Thumb release facilitates fast and easy opening.

D. Sling Mount Point
All sling mounting points are steel. Three ambidextrous 1-1/4” sling slot locations:
• Movable front plate.
• Ambidextrous sling position located between the chassis
and the collapsible stock, above pistol grip.
• Rear ambidextrous sling mount at the butt end of the
collapsible stock under the cheek rest.

E. Adjustable Cheek Rest
Robust glass filled polymer full contour cheek rest. 2” vertical adjustment in 1/4” increments. The cheek rest is 
field adjustable, using the tip of a 7.62mm bullet. Convenient self stowing tensioning wrench releases cheek rest 
for adjustment and eliminates cheek rest movement when in its stowed position.

F. Sighting and Optical Mounting Surfaces
All mounting surfaces are Mil-Spec 1913 Picitanny Rail.
Forward mounting surfaces:
- 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock rail.
- 6 o’clock rail.
- 12 o’clock one piece machined top with integral rail.
Collapsible stock main body-1.75” 1913 rail.

G. Detachable Forearm
Formed KYDEX® construction. Easily removed from stock chassis. Built in palm swell. Minimizes heat transfer 
generated by high firing rates. Accepts Sage International, Ltd. vertical foregrip when the detachable forearm is 
mounted."

The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. It's longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

It is matching numbers, and has been very well kept and cleaned. I bought it new for $300 last fall and purchased the tapco mag for $20 along with it. I have fired exactly 100 rounds through it since I bought it. The tapco mag works well with it, I just had to dissasemble the mag and sand down all the burrs in the plastic to get it to feed properly, and give it a small shot of oil. Despite some reviews you may have read, the Tapco mag works well with one exeption, you should only load 18 rounds in, because with 20, it doesent want to feed the first 2 rounds. I recomend getting a metal 30 round mag if you want high capacity, or just hate using stripper clips like me. The blueing is in great shape, as I picked through several SKS rifles before choosing this one. The gas tube is super tight, which was of course another consideration of mine when I hand picked this rifle. I will offer a bill of sale at time of sale and require a signature from myself and the buyer, and will furnish a copy to both parties. I will also include a nifty gun sock for transport.

The reason i want to get rid of it is because i cant shoot the damn thing to save my own life, its grip is too large for my hands. So id like to trade it for a nice 1911 (no RIA's or Llama's), a 4"" ruger gp100 .357mag, or maybe some other .40 or .45 caliber handgun with a medium or small sized grip. I would definetely be interested in a SIg SP2022 .40s&w or a .40 CZ pistol. I love this glock with all my heart but whats the point in having a defensive handgun if you cant hit the broad side of a barn with it? If you are interested in buying it i am asking 475 but that is negotiable, i figure if i can get at least 425 for it that will leave me a small enough gap to buy a new 1911 or gp100. i can email or text pictures on request. Comes with all original stuff (.40cal bore brush, cleaning rod, 2 15rd magazines, mag loader, 2 test fired cases from the factory, owners manual, and glock box)

the 10mm auto is in my eyes the worlds finest handgun cartridge, with more energy and power than a .357magnum, in most states hunting with a 10mm handgun is legal and results in quick humane kills."
