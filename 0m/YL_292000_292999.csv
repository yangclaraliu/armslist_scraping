I used it a couple of years during deer season and made some nice shots with it. Hangs on the shoulder well for long walks in or out. The rifle has been sitting unused in my heated safe for probably 10+ years now. It has no problems. Probably less than 100 rounds through this rifle total.

Great article on the 7mm in this month's American Rifleman. Developed to deliver more at longer distances while maintaining the comfort level of the 06. I say hogwash; it kicks like a mule. Good thing it drops them with the first shot. 

Hunting season will be here before you know it.

 totaly stock m44 carbine with bayonet. it seems this one has been sighted with the bayonet in the closed position. im unsure if this was factory or someone elses handy work. i had no problem plinking at 60ish yards. the finish is slightly worn on the bottom of the mag ant atop the receiver. im led to belive that the bolt handle is off another gun, but she functions well non the less. i havent done any mods to the rifle (trigger job, ring cocker, cut springs) so the action is a little stiff, but better than most mosins give or take.

looking for 175,  i could be tempted to trade for other guns let me know if your interested. thanks for reading

This is Steyr Scout Tactical, not Jeff Cooper package or standard Steyr Scout. The differences are:
1. the stock/gun is finished in matte black finish(caveat: some sellers are selling light, gray Jeff Cooper version as Tactical version, those guns are NOT Steyr Scout Tactical version)
2. the receiver is marked ""TACTICAL SCOUT""
3. smoother action compared to standard Scout/Jeff Cooper package guns since tactical version uses an improved, slicker, black finished bolt body with rounded knob, making the action faster to operate, compared to standard bolt on Steyr Scout/Jeff Cooper package guns

I believe these are rarer than either standard Steyr Scout or Jeff Cooper package guns. 

Terms of payment: $2,450 + $50 S&H in USPS MO.

Out of all the rifles I've owned and/or handled, this one mounts the FASTEST and has the most perfect balance with the best trigger I've ever seen on a production rifle.

Along with the firearm, I have 2 nine (9) round magazines plus a third Glock 23 thirteen (13) round magazine. As well as that I have a tuckable in the waistband leather holster and roughly 350 rounds of .40S&W ammunition (~150 jacketed hollow points and ~200 full metal jacket).

I have had this gun for a while now and used it for concealed carry. It does have slight wear from regular carry but nothing out of the ordinary you would not expect. The only reason I am looking to sell or trade is it is just a little to large for me and I am looking for something just a bit smaller. Specifically I am looking for a Kel-Tec PF-9 or a Walther PPS. If you wish to trade your PF-9 I would be looking for $200-$250 depending what you have as well as the gun, please remember that a new PF-9 can easily be had for ~$230. 

I am currently in Athens, OH attending school and the firearm is in my safe at home in Cincinnati, OH. I often travel back and forth and can do so on any given weekend given enough notice. However, I would not likely be able to meet outside of either Cincinnati or Athens or along the route to and from on Rt. 32. Also for that reason I am unable to share pictures of the gun. Please email me with any questions or text me at REDACTED, please no phone calls as I often cannot immediately answer. 

I have gotten a lot of offers to split this package up. I am only looking to sell or trade as a whole as I do not own another .40 caliber or even another Glock.

Thanks for looking and have a great day,

Chambered in 7.62x45 with about 28 rounds and two magazines.  Had it inspected by Lock, Stock and Barrel in Franklin. It's corrosion free and mechanically sound. Just needs to be cleaned and have its stock repaired.

I'm looking to break into the semi-auto rifle market so I'm interested in any equitable trades.  I can also trade this and cash for a higher end rifle.  The VZ-52 would make a great collector's piece, fun project for a reloading enthusiast, cool memento for history buffs and veterans, or good shooter for someone with the time and money to get the stock repaired and acquire enough ammo.  I hate to see the thing go because it feels great in the hands but it's not on my investment priority list.

From the Powder River Precision website about the trigger kit (plus I am including the stock trigger):
""This Drop in Trigger Kit fits all XDM pistols including the new XDM5.25"". The kit contains our famous striker safety lever, to remove the long trigger pre-travel on the XDM trigger. Reduced power: trigger spring, sear spring, striker safety spring and striker spring, to lower the pull weight. Our trigger is made of tough light weight polymer that helps speed up the reset. It also has an integral over travel stop on the back of the trigger. Using this method of over travel stop removes added stress on the trigger bar that are present with any of the other over travel stop methods. This trigger is a Springfield Armory OEM part available on production XD and XDM pistols from the factory (see APPENDIX D4 — 21.6 Production Division Rules). When installed correctly, the kit will give you a short crisp trigger pull (about 3.5-4.5lbs) with a fast reset and shorten the total trigger pull length. Fits all XDMs.""  [url]http://shop.powderriverprecision.net/product.sc?productId=73&categoryId=3[/url]

From the Pistol Gear website about the Patriot Magwell:
""PistolGear is proud to offer the first IDPA legal magwell to the XDm marketplace. Tweaking our design for the benefit of an affective product that will fit the IDPA box, this magwell will make your ESP machine rock! The PistolGear ""Operator"" magwell for the XDm doubles the width of the frame funnel for the benefit of smoother tactical reloads. The magwells locks onto the frame in two locations making it rigid. The magwell is held in place by a threaded pin that replaces the factory grip insert pin, making installation easy and non-permanent. YOU DO NOT EPOXY THIS PRODUCT TO YOUR FRAME. 

This set up new would cost you as follows:
Springfield XDm 5.25 out the door price from SSP (pistol, shipping, sales tax) - $754
PRP Drop in Trigger Kit - $125
Patriot Magwell - $85
Total Out The Door would be $954 if buying new, I don't expect that at all.

As for what I am looking for, I would like to trade a nice stainless (would consider other than stainless) 1911 in the ""Commander"" size.  i.e. Colt Commander, Kimber Pro, Springfield Champion, Sig Sauer, etc... I would also be interested if somebody just happens to have an upper chambered in 300 AAC Blackout but I doubt that will happen. See list below.  I might consider other offers so just let me know what you have.

I would ask for $700 cash if you don't have a trade.

It was developed during WWI as an interim sidearm when the Army could not produce enough 1911s. They contracted with S&W and then Colt to produce a .45 ACP caliber handgun to use as a fill in until there were enough 1911s to go around.
What resulted was the Model 1917. It proved so popular that it continued production after the war and exported to many different countries.
This particular Model 1917 was produced in 1937 in Springfield, Mass. to fulfill a contract with Brazil.
Many of these Brazilian Contract 1917/1937 revolvers were reimported after Brazil changed to the 9MM.
I purchased this one in 1991 and have treasured it for its history and great shooting ability.
The finish shows a lot of holster wear, it was carried a lot and shot little. The interior workings are in very good shape and the bore is bright.
I have fired it and it is accurate and easy to shoot. It has a light, smooth trigger pull and hits where you point it.
It uses full moon clips and there are 6 included.
There is also a set of Pachmyer Presentation grips included. These make it a joy to shoot.
Since I retired I have been selling my stuff and this is the last of it. I held onto it as long as I could. It is time for it to have a new home.

Story of this gun, purchased and used at a few games by a comrade until he joined the army, then it sat on his shelf for about a year until I became the owner. It is the deluxe version, meaning it has a unique serial number and.... that's it. These aren't made anymore and retailed at $475.00
The gun also has a very unique grip that is no longer made as well... It is strange at first but when you realize not to hold it like a normal vertical grip you love 

Price $250 (Comes with 1 midcap, but I warn it is awful, I'm in the process of replacing all my warn out mags.) Can ship, meet in Pinellas area or Amerika2


Internal work. Sitting so long weakened the spring and dried the piston seal. Replaced the spring with a pretty pink one to return it's power and give it some class. Replaced the aluminum piston head with a Systema aluminum piston head, corrected VFC's awful shim job, replaced spring guide with a ball bearing spring guide, put aluminum cylinder head and nozzle on for shits and giggles. The gun shoots consistently around 350 FPS with a .20 BB, recommend 9.6v stick battery.

Externals only 2 things to mention as damage, one would be the weld marks on the stock from when it was reinforced, my previous VFC had the stock break on the factory welds, so we reinforced this one right away. Also there are scratch marks on the flash hider as it was on there quite tight.

This gun is incredibly durable, my [u]other[/u] VFC AKS74U has survived 5-6 years of being dropped, thrown, submerged in water, tossed through windows, used as a battering ram... and many other acts of civil disobedience.

The PLR-22 pistol is chambered for the popular and economical .22 Long Rifle cartridge (.22LR). It is based on the 5.56mm NATO chambered PLR-16 pistol and shares many parts including the grip and front and rear sights. The PLR-22 is not a simple conversion kit, it is a standalone firearm chambered for the .22LR and is designed for target shooting, plinking, or small game hunting. The PLR-22 and SU-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.

 I have a Brand New in the Box Benchmade Bedlam 860 Automatic 1st production #31 of 500.  These rare 1st production Automatics are prized. These appreciate in value especially the Bedlam Auto's 1st production numbered under fifty. I paid $799.00 at a knife show from a retired Benchmade employee who needed money. The Bedlam860 Knife initially was only made in automatic which was Awesome but! Some states consider large automatics knives illegal without military or police exception.

Once imported, it was converted to take 30 round mags thus NOT compromising the integrity of the foreign (and better built) rifle.  I have a ton (count them) of ten round stripper clips of High End American ammo as well as some Russian ammo (in the mags, each half full so they won't fully compress the springs in the mags).  All in all the rifle is worth $500 to $600, the front rail (a way to securely attach fore grips and various optics) is worth $100, the fore grip is worth $40.  I'll sell for $600 FIRM.

This glock was upgraded and carried by my brother who works for Blackwater, a private military contractor in Iraq, as one of his backup weapons. He carried it underneath his shirt in a shoulder holster. 

It is in excellent condition, and was only fired in practice, and has only had around 400 rds fired through it. The barrel has very little as far as wear marks on it, and the lands and grooves are excellent. 

If you are going to value this like a regular glock, dont offer. It is a more specialized pistol, and is valued that way. All of the add-ons would cost you over 800.00.  Regular used glocks in this condition go for 450+. I will value this one at 550. Only 100 dollars more than the average Glock, with all the add-ons.

I will not strip it down, as I do not have any glock parts. It is what it is.

The upgrades include:

Custom Duracoat Desert Tan coating.
Stainless steel guide rod.
Tijicon Tritium night sights- 4 years old, guaranteed for 12+.
Ghost Inc. Extended magazine release.
Glock extended slide release.
Glock extended takedown lever.
Grip force beavertail adapter.
JB Gun Grips wraparound grip. These give the most controllable firmest grip I have ever felt on a pistol.
Low Profile laser attachment that mounts to the rail (bottom picture)

It Comes with 3 15rd magazines, box, paperwork, loader, etc.


I am looking for a good .22 semi auto pistol ONLY, like GSG 1911, Sig Mosquito, Walther P22, Ruger MK series or SR22, 1911 .22cal conversion kit, or similar, with cash.

Feel free to make an offer, I DO NOT want to sell this pistol outright, just looking for a trade, or I will keep it.

Offers for anyting other than a .22 semi auto trade will not get a reponse."

""kid look here, you can take that gun and your stuttering ass and go fuck off. working for the city government we get tired of family members throwing our names around saying they know someone who is a cop. noone says leo you fucking idiot, you watch too many movies. i just got all of your emails, it is not a felony to accidentally type the wrong number or not answer your phone because you are WORKING!!!! it is a felony to give a wrong name and social security etc. know your shit so you dont sound like an fucking idiot to someone who knows what they are talking about. nice email, dykecrusher, brian donell move out of your parents basement, stop watching gay porn and get a real girl. good luck getting rid of your stolen gun. i have reported you on the website and the coweta county sheriff's department for fraud and being in possesion of a law enforcement issued gun and not being P.O.S.T. certified. Enjoy the investigation. It is a felony to publish you have a law enforcement gun, LE edition, and not be a sworn officer.

I have for sale a Phoenix Arms HP22A in good condition. The finish is satin nickel and comes with 7 - 10 round factory mags, two new slides (with completely new internals as provided by Phienix), 5 inch barrel, 3 inch barrel, 4 extra factory recoil springs (famous for becoming lost during field striping), box, manual and unused warranty card. Case in picture isn’t included. The extra slide and mags are easily another $100 new. Want $160 for all and will consider trades.

The history on the gun is that my brother purchase it new and I ended up with it in a trade. It has approximately 700 rounds though it. As mentioned, the slides in picture are brand new along with all the slide internals. The slide on gun has about 200 rounds through it and the other is unfired. The safety mag release mod has been done on the gun allowing the mag to be removed with safety on. If you don't want this mod the part is easily replaced via Phoenix Arms part #208 at a cost of about $4.50 via their website. Anyone familiar with this will likely tell you that they prefer the mod. The gun functions 100%.

Prefer FTF in SW Indiana. Bill of sale and ID required. I'm located in Evansville.
