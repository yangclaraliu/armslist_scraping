It's an almost new S&W 500, with a 6.5"" barrel. I bought it new from a gun store in Grafton, Ohio, and since put exactly 45 rounds through it. It shoots wonderfully, and the looks you get from others at the range are priceless. Comes with 5 red ""snap caps"" dummy rounds, the original blue hard case, and paperwork.

I chose the 6.5 barrel for balance, sits very nice in the hand, not muzzle heavy like the 8 or 10"". Recoil is very manageable for a round this size, but you don't want a hard wood grip on this, it needs the special synthetic grip to save your hands from the awesome power. This will stop anything walking or crawling on land. I was going to handload it down and use it for deer, sadly my situation forces me to part with it. There is a company online that makes 700 grain hardcast ammo that you could probably take whaling

can't take any trades because I need the cash, otherwise I'd be keeping it as it's a truly awesome firearm. I'm firm at 900 bucks, I've lowered the price 3 times already so don't lowball me please."

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force. Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun. A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot. a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

The small size and single stack mag makes this a very nice gun for concealed carry. Fits easily in a pocket and there are various holsters available.

306,http://www.armslist.com/posts/348306,For Sale:  Zombie Blood Custom Gun Oil,"Mokena, Chicago, Illinois",$ 10,"Listed On: Sunday, September 9, 2012",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Zombie Blood Gun Products is a new custom gun company that specializes in high quality firearm products. Zombie Blood Gun Oil is our first product being put out to the general public! Made up of the highest quality blend, our product is the most versatile gun oil you can buy. It prevents large amounts of dirt and grime from building on exposed metal surfaces while displacing moisture from metal pores. Our product also protects internal and external metal parts from rust and corrosion. This exclusive formula provides a thin, long-lasting film that keeps actions working smoothly by reducing metal-to-metal wear.

When you apply Zombie Blood Gun Oil to your fire arm the first thing you will notice is the absence of friction. All you feel is spring tensions in the weapon. It works in incredible extremes, from desert warfare to sub-arctic temps. It also does not attract grime or dust. You will not find a better firearm lubricant bar-none. When Zombie Blood is used it is even easier to clean the weapon after long hard use. 

Zombie Blood Oil reduces wear and extends the life of firearms. It adheres well and is safe for use on all varieties of metal-to-polymer and metal -to-metal firearms. 

Great for use on your bolt, rails on semi-automatic weapons, inside the locking lug area, and inside the bolt carrier areas where carbon builds. Most of the time you will simply wipe the areas clean (mostly we at Zombie Blood use Q-tips).

High viscosity oil refined to perfection for use in firearms, fishing reels and other precision mechanisms. Does not harden gum. Gives extra-long service. 

Technical Information:
**We at Zombie Blood have tested our product using most semi-automatic weapons, revolvers, semi-automatic riffles (AR-15 etc…) with excellent results.**

Material: Liquid Lubricant

Notes: Zombie Blood gun oil requires an extremely small about to be effective

This Glock frame has been professionally Duracoated with US Army Foliage Green, and the slide has been Duracoated with black and Cerakoted on top of that.

I purchased this new 2 years ago. It has factory Glock tritium night sights, that are only 2 years old and glow great, as seen below. Also has factory extended magazine release. Barrel and feed ramp were professionally polished. 

Have not fired this one much, I am a 1911 man. Bought it just to have a Glock in the herd. It has a low round count. Less than 150. There is little to no wear on barrel or internals, lands and grooves are strong and distinct. It is NOT a worn out police trade-in. Very smooth shooter.

Comes with box, 2 15 rd magazines, test shells, paperwork, etc.

Will sell for 450.

Looking for Walther P22, Ruger SR22 pistol, GSG 1911 .22, or other 1911 .22 (Chiappa, etc.) plus some cash as necessary.

I am NOT looking for target type .22's. Buckmarks, MK II, III, S&W 22A's, etc. they are too bulky and long for him.

I also prefer to do local face to face sale. I don't have experience selling a gun so I don't want to ship it or receive money in the mail etc. I'd be happy to answer questions or talk.

SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards 

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.

The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select
 one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change
 everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.

I am thinking about selling my AK-47 made by Inter-Ordnance. The model is: I.O. Inc. 10K-47C. This rifle is NOT a WASR, not by a million miles. This thing was quality built, I compared it to a WASR that I bought new (and got rid of because it wasn't up to par with this one). This rifle was 100% American built, not some cheap thrown together rifle. The rifle was made in 2008, I confirmed it by calling the manufacturer and looking up my serial number. The gun was recently DuraCoated in the color of Parker. Because this is a quality AK-47 variant, and I know the pricing this thing was originally priced at, I will not let this go for under $700. So if you are going to try and offer $699 or below, don't bother wasting our time.

The rifle will come with the following:

- 1 Brand-New, never used TapCo magazine (in plastic still)
- TapCo infusion hand guard with a tri-rail system and heat shield (top one screws on but I took it off for a better iron sight picture.)
- TapCo AK-47 style buttstock with metal buttplate.
- Un-installed scope mount bracket.
- Two 30 round magazines (steel)

***MAGPUL FORWARD ANGLE GRIP WILL NOT BE INCLUDED.

Asking for $700 for all of this. If you look up the price of the rifle as well as all of the stuff included, you'll see it's valued a few hundred less.

I can send pictures of the rest of the stuff, but if you look it up, it's going to be the same as in those pictures. I WILL NOT TRAVEL MORE THAN 20 minutes from Fayetteville and I will NOT accept a bullshit offer. Thanks for your interest."

* * * everything matching * * *
 Great Shooter, always cleaned and non-corrosive ammo used. pictures show a butt pad installed, however, it is been removed now (buttpad is part of the package). This is a ex-DDR, meaning East Germany got it from Communist Russia in the 50s ( Has the stock and hand guard marks and the /1\). pre-94 import. half a dozen of stripper clips will be included, also there is a cleaning kit in a butt stock.
last few (just the SKS) on gunbroker in this condition and vintage fetch close to 500-$600 plus shipping plus ffl fee. 

with this sale you will be getting exactly 950 rounds of WOLF 154gr SP ammo (kind you can't get anymore) which I removed from the boxes a while back and separated into ziplocks and into a box.

bandoleer will be included, 14 stripper clips come all together with this package and found two loose 7.62x39 rounds (one Silver Bear SP another WPA HP) which are going in this package as well.

As far as  ammo, if you can find it (black box Wolf, Non-corrosive, non-re-loadable), it goes now for about 40c a round (as it is the best hunting weight), before it disappeared it was $469MSRP for 1000rounds; so I think this is a fair price for a quick sale(give or take $420 rifle and $380 ammo, or whatever way you want to swing it :) )
and yes, that pouch with cleaning bottle and a sling are all part of the deal :).
 so, a package deal for the rifle, accessories and ammo.

I'll sell it for $400 without the scope, but this scope is worth a lot more than $50! This is a link to budsgunshop.com that shows this rifle with an inferior scope to the one that is on it. I'm basically giving this away!
