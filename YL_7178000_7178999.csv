Bought a couple of months ago and its just been sitting around, kind of lost interest. Info from the siteRR22B6 - Small Bore Revolver 6.5 Blue 22 Long Rifle OnlyBorn of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

Surprisingly enough it is fully operational - although there are some issues.The safety is missing and one of the grips is a little beaten up. The worst part is that some bonehead butchered the magazine and jerry-rigged a grip extension to the base. On the bright side it'll let me hold it with 2 fingers instead of one.

These have been discontinued by Colt and are hard to find, what makes this one a little more unique is that the slide does not have the typical rollmark on the ejection port side. From what research I have done, this design change only happened in 2012. This makes for a nice clean look which is one of the things that drew me to this particular pistol. I do not have a round count, but it doesn't look to be shot much, there is some holster wear and the usual honest wear and tear of being used and handled, but it is in otherwise very nice condition. I will let the pictures do the talking. Please see the link below to have access to over 40 pictures including detailed pictures with the gun field stripped and from different varying angles which is difficult to that shiny stainless glare. I have upgraded the pistol with the following: Trijicon HD Front Night Sight .185 Height Trijicon HD Rear Night Sight Wilson Combat Bullet Proof Stainless Tactical Magazine Release Wilson Combat Stainless Steel Grip Bushings Hogue Stainless Slotted Grip Screws Magpul TSP Grips Ed Brown Flat Mainspring Housing, Stainless Chainlink II Quantity of 2 Wilson Combat 47DA 8 Round Magazine with Aluminum Floorplate Includes the original matching case, manual, original mainspring housing, grip screws, and magazine release."

It was imported from Romania by Century. It is all numbers matching, with a scope mount and chrome lined barrel. It was manufactured by ROMARM / Cugir, which is a state owned defense company that is one of the oldest defense companies of Romania, with history dating back to the year 1799, long before the Russians invented the AK. The rifle is in good condition, with some scratches and wear to the original Romanian factory finish. This is NOT a Century US made weapon, and NOT a WASR, the more common Romanian import. This weapon is more rare, and features magazine dimples on the receiver, indicative of the fact that this was designed for real double stack mags and not carved out and modified for them like a WASR. It functions flawlessly and everything looks straight. The only issue I had was some trigger slap, which I fixed by having an upgraded Texas AK trigger professionally installed by Kilo Guns.This rifle will be solid as pictured, cleaned up and good to go right out of the box, with the following included:Authentic collectable Romanian military sling, magazine pouch, oil bottle and cleaning kitOriginal Romanian steel magazineThree Tapco polymer magazinesI bought this item new from a dealer / collector, and put less than a few hundred rounds through it, which for an AK is miniscule. It has been well taken care of.Contact via email is preferred, from which we can exchange phone numbers and arrange a place to complete the sale, preferably public like a sporting goods store.

Like new with a low round count (less than 200) and very light holster wear. I also installed Talon grips over the stipple for a more confortable concealed carry (I don't wear a t-shirt underneath and move around a lot) but that can easily be taken off if you prefer. I personally think that it gives it more character plus the stipple/talon combo has a very nice feel to it. I can add 1000rds (700 brass, 300 steel) of factory ammo for only $200 more.

It works perfectly. It also has been shortened like the paratrooper model with a muzzle brake installed and all of the bayonet junk has been neatly removed. This makes it a fairly light and handy rifle. Everything works perfectly. Note - You loose the last-round hold-open function when you do this but most AKs notoriously do not have last round hold open either.  The stock has a cheek riser and butt pad installed. There is nothing remarkable about the stock -- it does have the serial number under the cheek pad and there is a sling mount with screws that i will include so if you want to put it back you can. The butt pad installs right over the existing butt plate using the same screws that hold the butt plate. It extends the stock 1 inch and that just feels a little better to me as these chicomm stocks can be a little bit short. I am asking $550. I check email often. This will be available thru Saturday Aug 12th only. This will be FTF and green cash only probably in a parking lot around the 1200 N. Walton in Bentonville.  It is pictured with a 20 rd. magazine but will take 30s too of course. I prefer 20s for going to the range. I am including 3 more 20s for a total of 4 20s plus i will also include a new in package 5rd magazine. These are useful and often cost as much as full magazines. I am pretty much getting out of 7.62x39 and for the purchaser only I will sell a 1000rd mixed case (500rds Tula HP mil surplus + 500rds Brown Bear soft point) for $190. I will not sell the ammo separately. Thanks
