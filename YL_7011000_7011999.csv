Model # is 48AL. Capacity is 3 + 1 26"" plain barrel with modified choke.  2 3/4 in chamber. Runs like a sewing machine. Would be a great upland bird gun, especially for youths or petite ladies. Very light weight. I'm guessing about 5 1/2 lbs. Also at home in the tree rat woods or kicking out some winter cottontails from the brush piles. Condition: It has definitely seen some use. The receiver is almost like new with only a couple of very small marks. The wood has several use marks on the stock and fore arm, but no chips. The is an approximate 10"" section on the left side or the barrel where the bluing is thin or gone. I suspect someone has allowed it to surface rust  and later cleaned it off. There is no rust now at all on this gun. Bore is shiny and like new. Pachmayr white line pad added. If your wanting a collector condition scattergun of this type...just keep moving, I can't help you. If your wanting a light, sweet little 20 semi auto to use without worrying about making a small mark on it, you may want to consider this one. How about $225.00 FTF cash? A super nice one like this would easily cost you double that. Not really looking to trade, but would look at offers, if you got something in mind.

So if you have a 16"" AR rifle, the day you shoot a shorter AR15 pistol, will be the day you will be hooked and never want to switch back.  Problem is all the stripped rifle or pistol setups for sale range from $800 to $1,500 and you will be lost in which accessories to outfit it with. Worse, if you buy one decked out like this one the seller will charge you upwards of $1,500 to $3,000 for it!  I have had so many friends call me and say I bought an AR, what the heck accessories should I outfit it with? And more important, what's legal?  So I have assembled what I believe are the best of the best without breaking the bank on over-priced parts that cost more than the whole rifle. The AR pistol is LEGAL in all states, but your state my require a bullet button instead of a standard mag release. We can add this for you if needed.

A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” model.
The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.
Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.
With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 – 8.5 pounds (27.5 – 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7N).
The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.
Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.
A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.
Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.
A limited edition P2000 German Police Model features a “closed” accessory mounting rail system and a tapered trigger guard."

Besides the one match, the rifle was shot four times, once to get sighted in, and three break-in/practice sessions. There are just over 300 rounds through the gun. JP's break in process was followed. The rifle has a, like new (purchased at same time as rifle), Vortex Razor HD Gen II 1-6 with JM-1 BDC reticle, with vortex throw lever, mounted in the Vortex Precision Extended Canitlever Mount.

He does the color case work for Henry rifles and other high end guns. You really need to see it in person to appreciate the work Mr. Tyler did. If you google color case hardened Shopkeeper you will find a great article about him and these shopkeepers by ammoland blog. That article is the reason I bought it,kinda on a whim. Look up Tyler gun works and you can see some better pictures of them or I will be glad to e-mail more to you as each one is a little different. This thing is very pretty and that's really the reason I'm selling it- I feel like it's too pretty to shoot a lot. I have put exactly 24 rounds of cci ammo through it and it's just sitting in my safe. The gun sold for $600 but with shipping,sales tax and FFL transfer fee I have exactly $686 in it. I'll sell it for $650 firm,you will probably never have another chance to buy one of these!  I'm open to trade offers,but it needs to be something of quality and of equal value.for sale face to face only at my shop in Dixie Manor.
