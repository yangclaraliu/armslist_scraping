     The Winchester Model 1200 was first offered to the public in 1964. It was used by US Marines and US Army soldiers in Vietnam. It was a successful design and was also adopted in a police riot model for many departments across the United States. Though the shotgun was well received, Winchester wanted to develop a 'cheaper' shotgun that would cut into the market of Remington & Mossberg. The Winchester Model 1200 was one of the models to be phased out. This model was very well made and with its shorter barrel, it would make an excellent home defense shotgun.

The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack turns Springfield Armory®’s single stack XD-S® platform into a mid-sized pistol. The sub-compact frame extends to full-size length when you insert an X-Tension™ magazine, adding capacity and controllability for your time at the range. Use a flush fitting magazine for concealed carry, and you’ll forget it’s there.

Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. The .45 ACP is a cartridge that compromises nothing in the power department, and the XD-S® is a concealed carry pistol without compromise. Put an XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

Don't let the 'squire' Label fool you on this beautiful MINT condition Fender, this was made before Fender started making shitty cheap low end squires and has some super high end features. For those who know about these gems it is a highly collectable piece of the Fender lineage.
These models were discontinued before they started making the cheap $100 squires to tap the beginner market.

The reverse headstocks on the Stagemasters allow for completely straight string pull. Another nice feature is the inclusion of a brass bridge sustain block on the licensed Floyd Rose bridge and rear-mounted electronics allowing for a guitar with no pickguard.

Action is great, sound is also amazing, a beautiful guitar all around.
Comes with a Hard Case, and a Peavey Rage 158 TransTube Amp and a fresh new set of #9 Strings

This ammo sold out across the country almost immediately following the sanctions against Russia last year. According to one of their largest importers, SG Ammo, whether or not we will receive any more is questionable, and the factory may be producing for the Russian Gov't rather than US sales because the sale price is double in Russia vs. the U.S. 

If you own a weapon chambered in 7.62x39mm, you want to have some of this in your emergency stash. The bullets are sealed at the case neck and the primers are sealed as well. The bullets are boat tails and they have an air pocket at the tip that makes them tumble and fragment effectively. This ammo is remarkably accurate our of my SBR. Huge difference between Golden Tiger and Wolf when it comes to consistency and accuracy. Don't take my word for it, do some research and see for yourself.

The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack turns Springfield Armory®’s single stack XD-S® platform into a mid-sized pistol. The sub-compact frame extends to full-size length when you insert an X-Tension™ magazine, adding capacity and controllability for your time at the range. Use a flush fitting magazine for concealed carry, and you’ll forget it’s there.

Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. The .45 ACP is a cartridge that compromises nothing in the power department, and the XD-S® is a concealed carry pistol without compromise. Put an XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack turns Springfield Armory®’s single stack XD-S® platform into a mid-sized pistol. The sub-compact frame extends to full-size length when you insert an X-Tension™ magazine, adding capacity and controllability for your time at the range. Use a flush fitting magazine for concealed carry, and you’ll forget it’s there.

Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. The .45 ACP is a cartridge that compromises nothing in the power department, and the XD-S® is a concealed carry pistol without compromise. Put an XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

For sale is a Laser Devices Inc DBAL-i2 Class 1 infrared, green visible laser, in FDE (tan) housing. It was manufactured in February 2014, I purchased it from TNVC.com in February 2014 (invoice included). It has never been outside the house.

Never used the IR laser, green laser has probably 2 hours tops on it from terrorizing my cat around the house. This is the latest revision model that corrected battery drain and heat issues. (This is the good one) Battery was always removed when not in use.

Includes the DBAL-i2, case, remote toggle switch (unused), Velcro backing for remote switch (unused), original invoice, and product manual.

Shows minor handling marks and nicks in the chassis, but overall excellent condition in my opinion.

Current retail on these units at TNVC is $885"

I really like it and I had plans to turn it into a short barreled rifle, but I have been moving into different directions so I figured I would put it up for sale to see if anyone would be interested in buying an AR pistol with the best parts I could find.  

The build is:
10.5” Daniel Defense Barrel
Midwest Industries 12” Gen2 handguard
Noveske copy KX5 flash hider (Noveske never had them in stock)
VLTOR MUR-1S Upper receiver (No Forward Assist)

BCM MOD1 Pistol Grip
LaRue low profile gas block
Wilson combat gas tube
AIM BCG  

Complete and ready to run. 

This is in wonderful shape, shoots as well as my 16” AR’s and is reliable.  I actually hate to see it go as I built it slowly over months and loved it one it was put together.  

I will need to see your carry permit or permit to purchase and a matching driver's license."

 The ""Taurus Judge"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances-where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

This .45/ .410 (2.5"") revolver also fires the popular .45 Colt. It has a specially designed frame with an elongated cyclinder to accommodate all these various shells. So grab a case of .410's and head for the Clay Bird Range. You'll find yourself hitting aerial targets like a pro.

A French MAS MLE 1949-56 rifle in original 7.5 mm.  It includes many of the accessories that most others for sale don't include and are pricey as well as quite hard to come by.  It has the original 'night sight' tube that slides over the end of the barrel, original sling with original cleaning kit and fully functional, adjustable sights as well as the flip up grenade launcher sights.

The predecessor rifle was the French MAS-49; it was formally adopted by the French Army in July 1949. 

An improved version of the MAS-49 was the MAS-49/56; it was introduced in 1957 and incorporated lessons learned from service in Algeria, Indochina, and the Suez Crisis. The rifle was shortened and lightened to improve mobility for mechanized and airborne troops, and a knife bayonet was added. The MAS-49 built-in rifle grenade launcher was replaced by a combination compensator/rifle grenade launcher that fired NATO-standard 22mm rifle grenades. The rifle also incorporates an integral grenade launching sight that is attached to the front sight block and a gas cutoff that prevents gas from entering the gas tube from the gas port when firing grenade launching blank ammunition.

This rifle is chambered in the original 7.5 mm; many were re-chambered at import into .308 and are considered less desirable.  Even though this is a very collectable rifle, it's a very fun weapon to shoot and will surprise you with how modern and well made it is. 

This rifle is in excellent overall condition. Tight action, clean barrel, and nice rifling. The stock in very good condition (see pictures). 

Again, weapon is in original 7.5 X 54 (French) or 7.5 mm, and also has the original barrel length at approximately 20.7"".  

3 original 10 round magazines included. 

This is a unique opportunity to own a fairly rare rifle in excellent condition and all the accessories included. 

Here's a little info about this very capable, but often overlooked caliber:

The 7.5x54mm French rifle round was originally adopted for the French infantry to replace the aging 8mm Lebel. The French learned many lessons from World War I, and realized the need to adopt a more modern cartridge. In 1929 the 7.5x54 ammo cartridge was adopted by the French military along with the Mas 36 rifle.

The 7.5 French cartridge served during World War II in various bullet configurations including ball, tracer, and incendiary. The bullet weight varies from 139 grain to 181 grain with velocities generally ranging from 2,700 feet per second to 2,600 feet per second. Although this round is older is design, it does features some impressive ballistics, especially when considering the round is not typically a shoulder bruiser.

The round is capable of being an effective hunting cartridge at intermediate ranges, and is quite capable against medium to medium large North American game. The cartridge is particularly popular with military surplus enthusiasts, but not for the MAS 36 rifle, but for the MAS 49. The Mas 49 is an interesting semi-automatic, post-war rifle. In short, the 7.5mm French cartridge is an excellent cartridge that was an excellent wartime round that often gets overlooked.


Feel free to ask any questions and offer any trades or cash + trade offers.  I own an extensive collection of fine weapons and have worked at a gun shop before so please don't bother me by asking a ridiculous amount in trade for what you have.  I'll only consider quality weapons, no Cobras or the like.

Included in the package are: rifle, 3 original 10 round magazines, original 'night sight' tube and canvas storage bag, 2 original magazine pouches (each hold 2 magazines), original sling with original cleaning kit attached and about 25 rounds of ammo (10 rounds of quality 'FOM' non corrosive + about 15 rounds of Turkish corrosive ammo).  Ammo is available for this rifle and I can offer you my cost for more rounds if desired.

Thank you

Two in Black and two in Stainless. Walther (CCP). $465.00 CCP 9mm 3.54"" 8rd Description: The CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably. The Walther Soft Coil ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. The CCP’s Soft Coil™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide. Specifications: - Operation: Gas Delayed Blowback - Caliber: 9mm - Finish Color: Cerakote® Black - Barrel Length: 3.54"" - Trigger Pull: SA 5.5 lbs - Trigger Travel: 0.27"" - Capacity: 8 rounds - Overall Length: 6.41"" - Height: 5.12"" - Width: 1.18"" - Weight(mag empty): 1.39 lbs If you have any questions please let us know.

At only 18mm wide, the Pico is the thinnest .380 semi auto handgun on the market, making it a best in class for concealed carry and home defense. Comfortable to Conceal and Carry Weighing only 11.5oz unloaded, this double-action-only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter your preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts. The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollow point designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta.

SAA Lower and CMMG Lower Parts Kit with A2 Stock for increased accuracy.  The SAA lower is one of the best I have used.  All of my guns have them.  My Class III dealer tells me they are run on the same line as Spikes.  My experience is they are definitely on par with Spike and much superior to AR57 and a few others I have tried.  All the AR's in my vault are now SAA.  They are the best bang for the buck. It is a great product with less cost. This one has a 5# CMMG trigger pull.  A2 stock has storage compartment for field gear.  Free floated Yankee Hill Machining tube for more increased accuracy.  Ability to add rails on free float hand rail.  I have kept the rails to a minimum to lower the weight.  There is a rail on the bottom for a bipod, laser, or light, and full rails across the flat top.  I have a scope and flip up iron sights on it.  These are not included in the price, but for another $150, I will include the scope and flip up sights.  I paid over $200 for them.  Upper is SAA with custom 20"" Wilson Combat Bull Barrel that is 1 in 9"" twist.  This barrel was originally a 26"" varmint barrel that was re-cut and re-crowned by a Class III dealer.  I have added a custom Don't Tread On Me Charging handle and Dust cover.  There is also a Yankee Hill flash hider that is wicked cool looking. I built this gun for me to shoot anything threatening my homestead.  The only reason I am selling it is I have 2 other 5.56 guns and have added a .308.  My other 5.56 rifles are lighter but with a shorter range.  The .308 will take care of what this AR was meant to cover and then some.  This AR is easily a 500 yd + gun."

I have a brand new Springfield Armory XD9 9mm Essential package with 4"" barrel.

The XD® 4"" Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD® 4"" Full Size has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD® 4” Full Size is the original XD® offering from Springfield Armory®, and the most basic XD®. This is the XD® that started it all.
The XD® 4″ Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4″ Full Size. Where you point is where you shoot.

The shotgun has a 28"" barrel, choke is MOD, it chambers 2 ¾” shells, and length of pull is 14”, the bore is crisp and trigger pull is smooth. The model 1100 holds the record for the most shells fired out of an semi auto shotgun without malfunction or cleaning, set in 1978 with a record of over 24,000 rounds fired.
With a title like that, what is not to love about Remington's 1100?  This may explain why it has remained popular among bird hunters, Skeet shooters, and Trap Shooters since its introduction in 1963 through today."

The sight functions perfectly and I have been very pleased with its performance. I am trying to cut weight on my rifle wherever I can though, so I am probably going to move to an Aimpoint H-1 or T-1 Micro.

I have only taken the Aimpoint to the range three times and used it for approximately four hours. The sight has been turned off in between range days, so there is plenty of battery life left. I believe Aimpoint estimates 30,000 hours of continuous usage on a single battery.

There are no scratches or scuffs on the sight. It includes the original sight mount and the original box with all of its contents.

Selling for $350 firm, cash only. No shipping. Text me at REDACTED if interested. Thanks for looking."
