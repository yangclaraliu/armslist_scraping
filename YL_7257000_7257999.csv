The famous Borchardt design and the Mauser C96 pistol are both examples of this interest at the turn of the century. The German Army ultimately settled on the Borchardt-based Luger design for its armed forces.Initial military production of the Luger pistol, in 9mm Parabellum caliber, was limited to the Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM). The first German military organization to adopt the new Luger design was the German Navy, which approved the Model of 1906 pistol on May 12, 1905. Although the German Army tested the Luger design as early as 1901, it did not officially adopt the Luger as the standard Army sidearm until August 1908, which gave the weapon the designation Model of 1908. Initial Model of 1908 Lugers did not have chamber markings but the year of manufacture began to be marked on the chamber in 1910.To augment DWM production, the German military ordered the establishment of Luger production at Royal Arsenal at Erfurt in January 1909. The Erfurt Arsenal was a Prussian government-owned arms factory that manufactured ammunition and rifles at Erfurt in Thuringen. Funds for production was allocated on January 16, 1909 and tooling up for Luger production began. The first Model 1908 Lugers were manufactured in early 1911 and Luger production continued through November 1918, when the last Erfurt-manufactured Lugers were produced. Erfurt only manufactured Lugers for the German military."

The Nickle on the Hammer, Trigger, Safety, and cylinder latching mechanism are beautiful and in excess of 85% in my estimation. The hand checkered grips are near perfect, no cracks or chips. I'm afraid to disassemble it for fear of losing a spring...but I shined a bright light down the bore from the muzzle end and it looks perfect. The action is strong both in single and double action but IN NO WAY is this thing warrented to shoot safely!! This is a conversation piece/wall hanger. Don't know much about this gun except it appears to be completely hand made...just looking at the bore..it seems as if the barrel/bore is hand cut/hand forged over a mandrel?? Other parts of the gun seem to be hand filed....such a wonderful neat little thing. My wife loves this gun and says it looks like it was made to be carried between your boobs. I'm placing a starting bid of $650.00 because I saw a gun exactly like this one at the last gun show but it was in WAY worse condition"

I purchased this Ruger New Vaquero new and sent the it to Turnbull Restoration & Manufacturing Co. for a charcoal bluing the complete gun, extra polishing, nitre bluing in screws and pins and 75% engraving beautifully done by Mr. Tom McArdle, Turnbull in house engraver. The extra polishing give this gun an incredible look. It was expensive and took quite some time but the results were honestly out of this world in my opinion and well worth it. The gun look pretty in the pictures but you need to see this thing in person to appreciate it. The gun came out so beautiful that it featured in the 2016 Turnbull Calendar in November (my picture). After, I sent the gun to Joe Perkins at ""Classic Single Action"" for the hand made stunning Macassar Ebony wood grips. As always, John's work is spectacular, he even nitre blued the grips screw to match the gun. After 4 months suffering I received the gun from John and this is the final product. Look at the pictures carefully, this gun is new, unfired, doesn't have a single scratch or blemish, anything visible in the pics is just dust or fingerprints. This revolver has been custom finished using traditional Original style charcoal bluing on the frame, loading gate, barrel, ejector rod and cylinder. Original box and papers included as well as the original Turnbull Invoice. Note: the grips included are the Macassar Ebony grips (no medallion), the walnut grips with medallions in a couple of pics are not included. I will be happy to answer any questions/inquiries.

As expected of Glock pistols, it performed flawlessly.  Otherwise, it’s almost new and has never been carried so it has no wear marks or scratches.  It’s the ""sf"" version (small frame) that uses a slightly reduced grip-size (front-to back only) to accommodate folks like me with just normal sized hands. It's a slim double stack and it’s ideal for concealed carry.  You’ll especially like the Glock trigger...it’s a sweet shooter and very accurate.  This gun comes in its original factory box with all paperwork and all other items from the factory including speed-loader, factory night sights, five factory mags (four with Pearce Grip extensions and one G-21 mag with X-grip for 13+1 rounds), nice leather IWB holster, Texas slide plate cover (original black Glock cover also included), childproof lock w/two keys, plus the Glock cleaning brush & rod. I'll also throw in a nearly-full box of hollow-points (17 rounds) and a Talon grip (not yet installed).I prefer face-to-face transfer without shipping.  I’m in College Station so anywhere inside the Houston, Austin, DFW triangle is OK.  Maybe we can meet half-way to minimize driving.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with a valid TX driver’s license or permit.  If I don’t respond to your email immediately, that just means I’m still at work and I’ll reply as soon as I get home.  Cash preferred so I can go buy something else, or will trade for a Glock 26 or Glock 19, Gen 4's only.  Price is firm; low-ball offers will be ignored. If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.  Thanks!"
