This rifle in 35 Rem has several advantages over a 44 mag lever action. With a 100 yard zero it has about half as much drop at 200 yards, has more energy,and is more accurate at longer range due to using a rifle bullet rather then a pistol bullet. It is legal this year if brass is trimmed to 1.8 and it will function fine with the shorter brass. Also if center fires are made legal for next year, this will still make a fine rifle and you can shoot ti with full length brass and have more energy then a 30-30. An excellent value. I also have trimmed and processed brass and loading information available. Also I have any needed accesoories like scope mount,recoil pad, sling swivels, etc. Not a dealer, just an old Marine rifle instructor who likes to piddle with rifles and has too much junk.  **** PRICE $ 525 CASH******You pick up*****I am not free to travel at this time. *******MONTEZUMA, IN *****TEXT, CALL OR EMAIL OK ***** CELL REDACTED"

This model 835 has a beautiful camo paint-job. I'm the 2nd owner as first owner never shot it. I've only shot it about 10 times, just not a rifle person. This Mossberg 12 gauge is chambered for 2 - 3/4, 3, and 3 1/2 inch shells with reduced recoil. Mossberg did this by overboring the barrel to the inner dimensions of a 10 gauge, and adding 8 ports to each side at the end of the barrel. So it not only reduces recoil but also minimizes muzzle jump. What you see, is what you get. Sorry, no sling, thanks for looking!

It is a lightly used, recently built AR in great condition, less than 200 rounds through it. 
-Anderson Arms lower
-BCM Upper
-18 inch fluted .223 Wylde Barrel (Allows you to shoot .223 and 5.56 equally well if you arent familiar with the .223 Wylde chambering)
-Tri Delta Tactical muzzle brake, same size as an A2 birdcage style brake and legal for three gun competition, reduces muzzle rise dramatically
-ATI Strikeforce stock with Scorpion recoil system and adjustable cheek riser for optics
-Low profile gas block with a 12 inch free float quad rail with T Marks
-MPI/HPT inspected BCG with properly staked gas key
-Magpul BUIS

Will also come with a couple of Magpul P Mags and 20 rounds of M193 5.56 depending on trade. Have around $900 invested in it. Shoots exceptionally well and with the longer barrel, muzzle brake, and cheek riser stock it would make an excellent long range rifle with a good scope, however I'm more interested in a .30 caliber rifle right now. Primarily interested in a .308/7.62 battle rifle like a PTR 91 or FAL, possibly a Cetme+Cash. Would also be interested in a nice AK47 in 7.62X39mm (NO WASR'S). Not interested in SKS's, I already have one.

While I'm primarily interested in these rifles, I'm also looking for an HD/Tactical style 12 gauge shotgun, no more than a 20 inch barrel with a cylinder bore such as a Mossberg 500, Remington 870, Benelli Nova Tactical, just about any of the new Turkish import pump guns, etc.. I already have a nice field gun, so not looking for a hunting shotgun. Would be interested in a two gun trade for one along with a semi auto .223/5.56 or 7.62X39mm rifle such as a basic AR (M&P Sport, similar) or AK (would allow WASR's if including a shotgun), or maybe even a Kel Tec SU-16.

Feel free to let me know what you have though, but I'm not interested in hunting style weapons or bolt actions of any kind, I already have my share of those.
I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers. texts preferred.

I bought this back in May and have only been able to sneak away from the wifey to go shootin once and then, just long enough to break the barrel in before she realized I was out having fun without her! After squeezing the trigger for the first time, you'll chew through ammo stockpiles and catch yourself looking for loose rounds on the ground like a squirrel trying to find his nuts! The diamond shaped peep sights hold their accuracy better than I and the top and bottom picatinny rails will allow for optics and accessories to enhance that accuracy further. I will say this, it can score fair to good groups at 100 yards with a consistency that is only variabled by the shooter. The recoil is minimal with Kriss' patented recoil mechanism that enhances follow-up speed and target acquisition. I would encourage you to take a look at their website for more detailed information about it and the firearm  http://kriss-usa.com/

-The 5.56 Midlength Evo Ultra Lite 16"" Upper is a .625"" lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston systemparts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.With the combination of the .625"" ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution rail, amd the new ultra lite .625"" gas block, we not have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Chambered in 9x18mm Makarov, which is similar to 380 acp but ballistically superior. This is a solid milled steel, military grade firearm with a chrome lined barrel. Cosmetically similar to the Walther PPK, it will fit in holsters designed for the PPK. DA/SA with a decocker and loaded chamber indicator.
This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. This was done about a month ago, and the weapon looks like it is in brand-new never issued condition now. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.
With the gun, refinishing service, and grips, I have just over $500 into this pistol and that is the basis I will use for any trades.
Looking to trade for a Sig P938 plus cash on my end. Offering an additional $100 for a basic model, more for a higher end model (SAS, Blackwood, Equinox) and/or additional mags.
Though not my first choice, would also consider a straight trade for a Sig p238.
Would also consider a quality J-frame size revolver or Ruger LC9/LC9S +cash.
I will consider other trades for CCW style pistols but these are the ones I'm primarily interested in.
Otherwise will sell for 400, or 350 with the original grips and without the wood grips.
Best way to reach me is by text to 316-619-9eight5four.

This pistol appears to be an all original Remington. The finish looks original with about 90% remaining.  There is some finish wear on both the front and back of the grip.  Overall, slight holster wear on the surfaces.  Absolutely NO RUST.  The barrel is clean and shiny.   

The slide is marked UNITED STATES PROPERTY/M1911A1 U.S. ARMY.  Serial number is 192XXXX.  It is also marked with an ordnance inspection stamp, the letters FJA and a P proof firing mark.  No rebuild marks on it.

It will be sold with 2 WW2 magazines

Asking $2000 in an Ohio FTF.  I will meet half way if a reasonable distance.  If you want it shipped I will need an FFL or C&R license and shipping should be about $40 dollars

I only installed the safety plunger.  But the pistol is in perfect condition.  The manufacture date on the test cartridge is July 5th, 2014, so she's right off the  assembly line.  Shoots incredible, but I'm moving back to a 40 cal.  Pd $569 for it, plus the extra mags ( 4 mags total ) and modifications put me at another $160.00 spent on the pistol.  Looking to get $ 490 for it.  Hell of a deal, in my opinion.  It also has the box, locks, speed loader, paperwork, holster, etc.  Pictures will be sent by request.

The Walther PPQ is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The PPQ has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ.[9] When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It should however be noted that the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state.

This rifle is the full length model with the bayonet lug but never had a bayonet mounted. I added a 2"" butt pad to make it fit my taller frame better (it helps) and I added rear Tech sights which improves the accuracy quite a bit. The original sights didn't fit my vision well and were too close together to be very accurate but these peep sights are an improvement. 

I've had it a couple of years and put about 150 rounds through it and it had never been shot before I got it (had trouble chambering a round as they fit a little too tight). It took a dozen rounds to break in and now it cycles well.

It comes as you see it which includes the stock mag but will fit a duck bill detachable mag as I shaved the wood stock inside the mag well so this work is done. It has some scratches and dings but nothing major and it never shot corrosive ammo.

It is the ultra rare ""Beast Mode"" edition with a serial # of 000024 ; )

All modifications were done years ago by origional owner's gunsmith. Origional owner used gun in competition. This gun has seen a lot of use that is evident by blueing wear and rough edges on the grips (see pics). There is a small amount of rust spots on the aftermarket underlug, not on the gun itself.  Back in the day there was a voluntary recall on the no dash and dash 1s.  That was for the hammer nose bushing shifting while shooting some hotter 357 mag loads causing the cylinder to bind up. This gun has not had the recall work done nor has it had any issues. S&W will still do the "" repair "" for free.  All that said this gun shoots like a champ! The trigger is nice and crisp in SA and smooth as butter in DA.  The extended underlug not only looks cool but makes  hot 357 loads feel like cheap 38 specials while cheap 38s feel like a hot 22lr. This is a very accurate gun and absolutely a blast to shoot."

719,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3514719,For Sale:  Buffalo Bore Ammo - 380 Auto Standard Pressure Ammo 90 gr. JHP (1025 fps/M.E. 210 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 21,"Listed On: Friday, September 19, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=218

The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, insane, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 380 auto frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks serious penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face with modern frangible 380 ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek and send a few teeth down my throat, I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the shock and pain as that frangible bullet would have stopped some where inside my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible 380 ammo and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and wont know that half his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So whatever 380 ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 380 is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down spontaneously. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your family is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed a few 380 auto standard pressure loads to keep you and your loved ones alive under the worst of scenarios.

Item 27G/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is traveling over 1,050 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel.  We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto standard pressure loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle. Note my ""real world"" velocities from my personal ""real world"" pistols.

Although I never had a problem with mine, from what I hear, their customer service is beyond belief.    They literally R the best bang for the buck.  I recently bought a bunch of guns in a package deal, and am selling off those that I have no need for.  After all, how many C9's does one need?  In my case, the answer is 1, but not 3.   Two of them are for sale at  $135.00 each  (firm).    All look good, and seem to work great (only had chance to take 1 to the range, the others cycle well w/snap caps).  This will be a private sale. Comes w/8rd mag.  10 round mag also available for additional $20.

I have never fired the gun so it is practically new. The low price is because I just want to move it quickly. You will not find one for a lower price anywhere. I have looked! Now a little about the gun. 

Kimber says the Solo® puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Kimber also says what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal, and many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. The triggers are as smooth as butter! It is a double action only but fells like silk! Comes with 1 six round mag & soft case. Text me at REDACTED"
