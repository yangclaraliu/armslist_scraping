Now we have a new vehicle so i dont need it. It runs and drives great. turn key instant on all winter. previous ownder went through the engine compartment and basically replaced anything that was original to make it new again. The whole top end, the spider injection system, belts hoses, starter, water pump, blower motor. It has a rebuilt engine with about 100k miles on the block, which was tested and shown to be in great condition for the rebuild. power windows, heat, defrost, lights all work. Sony Stereo, all new sony speakers, and amp and subwoofer for awesome sound. Tires are 90%. headliner is clean and tight, seats are in amazing condition for their age.  engine bay is clean and all the new parts.   The rear window defrost does not work, but the rear wiper does. the digital dash lights up and gauges work, but the light for the speedometer goes on and off sometimes. i ordered a new digital dash, its in the box i never installed it. you can have the spare gauge cluster thats worth $150.   It had a fresh transmission installed, which was under warranty until this year. right now the transmission has some linkage issues, it was working fine, and then all of the sudden it doesnt want to go into reverse. I would step on it a little and then it would budge. Well the other day it now refuses to move in reverse. it drives forward fine. 4 wheel drive high and low, also works. i think its probably something really easy like a clip or something came loose.   Im into this rig for about 2500$. im dumping it for cheap because you have to figure out whats wrong with the transmission. it does run and drive, i drove it from olympia to Everette and back no issues.   This was a great vehicle to cruise around town and not have to worry about it geting dinged up, pretty good on gas too.   If you want a trust worthy ride that can start instantly all year round this is a great low cost ride to get you by. very few dings the body is pretty straight. it was kept in a garage for the first 15 years or so of its life. its got a nice drop down tail gate and flip up window to the back compartment. it says truck on the side of it, and pretty much a chevy truck they just added the windows and top to it to make it an suv.   the wheels and tires, and the stereo alone are practically worth 2/3rds what im asking for.   Clean Title in hand. Not salvaged. tabs good until November 2016. CASH talks.http://seattle.craigslist.org/oly/cto/REDACTED.html"

That means you have to spend the money and then wait until they send you your rebate that can only be used at RK. While 700 is high for that rifle it was not out of the ball park. I found it ranging from 6-700 on several websites. By the way every gun on this board that is listed in Fremont is at cost or higher. But I am sure the guy who posted the ad bashing someone else's post has nothing to do with that."

Includes case, night sights  and 3 mags. I picked up two of these a while back so parting with one in hopes to add something new to the collection.  It's  an excellent gun. If you own Sigs you know what I mean. If you don't own any Sigs ya better ask somebody. The recoil is practically nothing even being a .40 S&W. These Sigs absorb the recoil better than any other guns I have. The trigger pull is a smooth and crisp 5lb with a Wolff reduced power main spring. This has the DAK trigger system. It's a hybrid double action pull. The first pull is a double action then rest are double action but from a half cocked hammer. If you haven't shot a DAK trigger you should try it. It's awesome for carry. Those that say they hate it are mostly regurgitating a review they read from some gun snob with poor aim and no fundimentals. Most have never actually shot a DAK sig. The wolf spring makes the double action pull a little lighter at around 5lbs. Just an absolutely awesome gun. Open to all trades but I'm primarily looking for the following; Sigs, 1911, Sigs, P226, Sigs,  P220, FN, Sigs, HK, bullpup, ak, AR10. Can add other guns or cash for right trade."

Available in a choice of the widely used caliber sizes of .308 Winchester or 300 Winchester Magnum, this platform provides high-precision performance and proven reliability.The .308 Winchester magazine holds 10 rounds and is available in either a 23.6-inch Heavy Barrel version or a 20-inch heavy barrel compact version. Both options feature a muzzle brake as well as a durable synthetic stock with an adjustable length-of-pull-- via stackable buttplate inserts-- and an adjustable cheek piece.As in other Steyr high-performance bolt-action rifles, the SSG 04 is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety's release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position. The receiver is topped with a Picatinny rail for optics mounting.Another feature in the SSG 04 is the 2-stage magazine securing mechanism that uses a first stage to lock the magazine in but allows the bolt to be operated without feeding rounds in the magazine, thereby providing the user with the options of dry-firing or loading individual rounds by hand while maintaining a full magazine at the ready. Simply pressing up on the bottom of the magazine seats it in the second stage, which is ready for auto-loading.The SSG 04 A1 is also available by special order. The SSG 04 A1 replaces the standard Picatinny rail with a shroud that is attached to the receiver and covers the barrel for the length of the forend. The shroud is topped with a full-length Picatinny rail, and two short rail segments are attached on the side of the shroud for mounting of accessories such as lights and or lasers.Model   SSG 04  Purpose  Long-Range Target Shooting Tactical  Manufacturer  Steyr Mannlicher GmbH Kleinraming, Austria  Importer  Steyr Arms, Inc Bessemer, AL USA  Operation  Bolt-action Repeating  Caliber  .308 Winchester  Magazine Type / Capacity  Polymer Double-Stack Detachable Box 10 Rounds  Action Material  25CrMo4 Steel  Barrel  20"" Cold Hammer-Forged Heavy Barrel  Rifling   4 Grooves 1:10 RH Twist  Sights  20-MOA Picatinny Rail  Finish  Mannox  Safety  3+1 Position Safety  Trigger Type  Single-Stage Direct  Pull Weight   3 lbs 8 oz (Adjustable)  Stock Material / Type  Reinforced Polymer  Length of Pull  14.25"" min.

This is not something I built myself in the basement, the complete lower was purchased from 111 gun shop and the upper was assembled by PSA. It has a MPI-HP tested bolt from PSA. I have a new Bravo Company bolt I could substitute for the PSA for an extra $25.00.  I'm including a genuine USGI bayonet- this is not a reproduction,and an Allen soft carry case.The mid-length gas system makes a little softer shooting rifle and allows a bayonet to fit- a bayonet does not fit the more common carbine length system that most AR's use. I have only put about 200 rounds through it,enough to sight it in and play around with it in 1 trip to the range. It is very accurate. I also have a Colt LE6920 I would consider selling, but I'm not selling both. Selling one to help fund a home improvement project. For sale face to face only at my shop in Dixie Manor. ID and signature on a bill of sale is required.

Unlike conventional carbon-fiber stocks made from woven carbon fabric that often suffer from side-strike structural failures, the SSG Carbon's stock is made using the same ""chipped-carbon"" Sheet Molding Compound (SMC) construction used to create load-bearing structures in Formula 1 racecars and high-performance aircraft. The SSG Carbon's chipped-carbon flakes combine thermally with the binding agent to form the SMC fror a distinctive appearance to the stock, but like the spirals on the rifle's cold hammer-forged barrel, they aren't just there for looks. The carbon chips interlock with each other to create an unparalleled tension net that is superior to steel in every direction, yet weighing a fraction of either steel or aluminum.Due to the unique recoil absorption properties of its SMC technology, the SSG Carbon is surprisingly lightweight, and its recoil absorption is unmatched. Utilizing the same barreled action and muzzle brake as the famed SSG 08, the SSG Carbon utilizes a direct trigger, legendary for its crisp, clean and repeatable break. A detachable box magazine functions either as a constant-feed magazine or it can be placed in a second position that acts as a magazine cutoff to single-feed the rifle over the tip of a loaded magazine.The SSG Carbon is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety's release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position.The stock of the SSG Carbon has multiple mounting points for sling attachments. It also features an adjustable cheek piece, an adjustable butt plate, rubber-wrapped pistol grip, and an integrated finely adjustable rear-elevation pod.
