This is NOT a cheapo, low end, upper. This is good quality and for serious performance. Only had 250 rounds through it.

No optic or lower - I will leave the can on it
The 5.56 PDW Tactical Elite 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 7.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. We've also added a 7"" Samson free floating Evolution forearm giving the shooter the ultimate tactical option in a personal defense weapon. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.

Description:
The new SR-556E features Ruger's patent-pending two-stage piston and multi-stage regulator that runs cooler and cleaner than traditional AR-style rifles.
The Ruger SR-556E comes equipped with a new, lightweight, adaptable handguard which provides multiple options for mounting optics and other accessories. This new, round handguard features a full-length Picatinny rail at the 12:00 position, which aligns with the rail on the flattop receiver. The handguard also accepts sections of rail or handguard covers, available at ShopRuger.com, which allow the user to configure the handguard to their exact requirements while minimizing size and weight.
The SR-556E still offers the basic features that make the Ruger SR-556 family a success. The two-stage piston operating system runs cooler and cleaner than gas driven rifles, and the multi-stage regulator allows the operator to tune the rifle to the specific ammunition. The cold hammer forged 41V45 barrel provides outstanding accuracy and longevity. The barrel is threaded 1/2-28 and is capped with the Ruger flash suppressor. The regulator, piston and piston bore are chrome plated, the transfer rod is nickel-Teflon coated, and the balance of the rifle is hard coat anodized or black oxide treated.  The SR-556E also features an A2-style pistol grip."

Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there. If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S 3.3"" Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it.

Initially built it for a combination of hobby shooting and hunting, but I chose a very heavy bull barrel, and thus it's not practical to carry around the woods. So I built another one, and don't need this one anymore. I installed an AR Mag Lock (armaglock.com) to make it NY compliant. You cannot eject the magazine unless the rear take-down pin is pulled and the gun is opened up. ATI-Glow polymer lower, Anderson upper, 20 inch 223 Wylde Bull barrel that can shoot 5.56 or .223 ammo. UUQ 14x50 illuminated scope with a rediculous sun shade attachment. A charge handle with a red latch on one side, and a deadpool metal decal on the magwell. Also has 45 degree off-set pop up iron sights. Shot probably 800 or so rounds through it. It's a fun shooter and it'll hit what you're aming at. Not included: a magazine. (Keeping those for my other AR-15). I will not ship it. Too much of a PITA. Price is negotiable. Make an offer. I put about $800 into it. Note: I'll bump it down to $650 right away if you offer to pay in Bitcoin. And I'll throw in the case."

It was the successor to the Smith & Wesson .32 Hand Ejector Model of 1896 and was the first Smith & Wesson revolver to feature a cylinder release latch on the left side of the frame like the Colt M1889. In production since 1899, it is a six-shot double-action revolver with fixed sights. Over its long production run it has been available with barrel lengths of 2 in (51 mm), 3 in (76 mm), 4 in (100 mm), 5 in (130 mm), and 6 in (150 mm). Barrels of 2.5 inches (64 mm) are also known to have been made for special contracts.[1] Some 6,000,000 of the type have been produced over the years, making it the most popular centerfire revolver of the 20th century.[2] Model 10 Engineering and Production Changes Timeline As the Model 10 evolved, the following Engineering and Production Changes were made:  10 (1957): begin stamping model number. 10-1 (1959): introduction of heavy barrel (the frame is slightly different for the heavy barrel, and changes to the standard-barrel variant were generally carried over to the heavy-barrel variant, thus the engineering changes happen in pairs) 10-2 (1961): change extractor rod thread for standard barrel 10-3 (1961): change extractor rod thread for heavy barrel, change front sight width from 1/10"" to 1/8"" 10-4 (1962): eliminate trigger-guard screw on standard barrel frame 10-5 (1962): change sight width from 1/10 in to 1/8 in for standard barrel 10-6 (1962): eliminate trigger-guard screw on heavy-barrel frame 10-7 (1977): change gas ring from yoke to cylinder for standard barrel 10-8 (1977): change gas ring from yoke to cylinder for heavy barrel 10-9 (1988): new yoke retention system, radius stud package, floating hand hammer nose bushing for standard barrel 10-10 (1988): new yoke retention system, radius stud package, floating hand hammer nose bushing for heavy barrel 10-11 (1997): MIM hammer/trigger + floating firing pin for standard barrel 10-12 (1997): MIM hammer/trigger + floating firing pin for heavy barrel 10-13 (2002): limited production 1899 commemorative edition 10-14 (2002): internal lock  Smith & Wesson Model 10-5 .38 Special"

Single action only. Unlike new model blackhawks this is the older ""3 screw"" model with no interrupter bar and an actual half cock. With the exception of a scratch on the right side, the finish is very good and the bore is very good as well. The trigger is great and it feels wonderful in the hand. 41 magnum occupies that sweet spot between 357 and 44, and with the proper hand loads, I feel it gives my M29-2 (44 mag) a run for its money. Price is $600. Loads of fun, but I need wedding money now.  If interested, please contact me by text and REDACTED or by email. I am a graduate student at UK and I live in the Lexington area.

The trigger pull on this gun is amazing for a mil-surp and amazing even compared to modern commercial rifles. The gun shows average wear for a milsurp and has the information about the man to whom it was assigned under the butt plate. This a straight-pull, bolt action rifle that is very comfortable to shoot. Accuracy is great and the barrel is floated (a cool feature on a mil-surp). Rifling in the bore is great. Price is $400, I love the rifle, but I need wedding funds.

Serial number is 114XXX. 5-screw, pinned barrel.  Appears to be a 2nd change model (with two dowell pins in the extractor) and manufactured about 1908-1909
Serial number matches on the frame, barrel, cylinder, ejector and right grip panel (left panel has no number, so maybe original as well). Right grip panel has a slight crack which is most visible when the panel is removed, but it is still very tight and solid. Assembly number matches on the frame and cylinder yoke. Pinned barrel.I have personally run 50 rounds of HSM Cowboy Action .38 lead rounds without an issue. With that ammo I found it shot low and left, but it functioned fine in both double and single action.  I will include the box of once-fired starline brass if so desired. This would make a great 'shooter grade' pistol to take out and shoot.  C&R eligible.I am a home based FFL and this is selling on consignment for the owner, so this will need to transfer with a background check (included in price) and I can ship if needed.  Asking $279, no trades."
