This thing is much more than a weather meter and if you are into long range shooting, this is a must have. Very simple to use once you learn to navigate it. It has Bluetooth to connect it to a computer to download preloaded cartridge loads, or you can enter them in yourself manually after a quick Google search of your cartilages specifications. It is rugged, water proof and even floats. It's small, pocket sized, built in backlight and batteries last a long time. I have used this thing personally in a foreign country and made shots out to 1140 meters with a .308 rifle. The best feature of this kestrel is that it accounts weather, wind and direction including slope into your trajectory. Takes only a few seconds so it's much better than looking at a bunch of charts to math together your shot. Asking $400. Original retail price is $650ish from Amazon."

I have about 300 rounds down the tube and it finctions flawlessy it's the best piston complete upper you can buy besided PWS. Only reason for selling i want to buy the adams arms 11.5"" Carbine Tactical Evo Upper to put a suppressor on it.  From talking to a local gun shop and sliencero there is no silicner that will be  warrantied for any barrels less than 10.5 and they do not even reccomned even for a pistion gun to put ut a can on something that short. My pirce is firm no low ballers. Troy folding battle sights are not inculded in the saleDETAILS Upper Receiver: A3 Flat-Top, Forged Barrel Length: 7.5"" Barrel Contour: Medium Barrel Material: 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel Muzzle Thread Pattern: 1/2""-28 Chrome Lined: No Barrel Finish: QPQ Melonite / Black Nitride Twist Rate: 1 in 7"" Chamber: 5.56x45mm NATO M4 Feed Ramps: Yes Bolt Carrier: 1-Piece w/Integral Piston Strike Face Muzzle Device: A2 Flash Hider Gas System Length: Pistol, Short Stroke Piston Operated Gas Block Diameter: 0.750"" Handguard: Samson 7"" Extended Evolution Modular Rail, Free Float Sights: None Extras: One 4"" Rail Section, QD Sling Swivel Adapter, Single Rail Piston Gas Block Weight: 3.91 lbs (Without Rail Sections)  UPPER ASSEMBLY DESCRIPTION This Adams Arms Tactical EVO PDW Gas Piston Upper Assembly is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and comes ready to fire right out of the box after installation onto any standard AR-15 pistol or registered SBR lower receiver. The Tactical EVO upper receiver line represents an outstanding value, and is the result of blending characteristics from the Adams Arms EVO Ultra Lite configuration with their Tactical Elite series to create a new, high performance platform at a more economical price. It features a melonite finished, 7.5"" medium contour barrel with a 1 in 7"" twist, making it capable of stabilizing medium- to heavy-weight projectiles of up to about 77 grains. Despite its short pistol length gas system, the piston chamber inside the PDW's gas block is the same size and has the same volume as Adams Arms' other gas system lengths. This means that unlike most AR-15 based systems that become notoriously unreliable once the barrel is reduced to less than 10"" in length, the super short Adams Arms 7.5"" PDW upper has the proper gas dwell time and bolt carrier velocity to allow it to function reliably and consistently in all conditions. It comes equipped with a free floating, 7"" Samson Evolution Modular Rail Handguard that extends to surround the picatinny rail piston gas block on its bottom and both sides for a clean look and additional rail space if required. Additional features include M4 feed ramps, an A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group, charging handle assembly, one 4"" modular rail section and one QD sling swivel socket adapter.   BARREL DESCRIPTION The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel.   PISTON DESCRIPTION All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance.   LIFETIME WARRANTY All Adams systems come with a lifetime warranty provided you have not modified any of our parts or used them for anything other than their intended usage."

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."

The design is so close owners may be tempted to interchange parts of the M1-22 with their counterparts made for the M1 Carbine. Various marketing claims over time have claimed the parts of the M1-22 are interchangeable with their GI counterparts. This claim is not completely accurate. Most parts and/or groups of parts that can be replaced with their GI counterparts may not work properly and cause the carbine to malfunction.  If you decide to replace any of the parts on this replica carbine with parts made for an M1 Carbine there are a few things you should know beforehand.  This is a replica of the U.S. M1 Carbine, not a U.S. M1 Carbine Surplus GI parts were made for the centerfire .30 caliber carbine cartridge. Intermingling them with parts designed for a rimfire .22 long rifle may shorten the lifespan of the latter. Steel GI parts may damage aluminum or plastic parts they come in contact with. Although close to the dimensions of the M1 Carbine parts, the M1-22 was made using the metric system. Screws and nuts are metric and incompatible with their GI equivalents. Small variations inherent with certain M1 Carbine parts and differences between the metric and U.S. measurement systems may cause other parts, or the entire M1-22, to not operate properly. Replacing parts may void the warranty and Chiappa may decline any civil or penal responsibility (liability)"

Finally, a .22 LR tactical training rifle that looks, feels and handles like its full-size counterpart.  The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR rifle is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.   Ambidextrous Controls A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.         Limitless Accessorization, Customization Options This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations.     Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain The ARX160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and technopolymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down.   For the full-power, centerfire version of this tactical rifle, check out the ARX 100."

This is one of Beretta's tip-up barrel ""mouse guns"" that allows you to load a round in the chamber without racking the slide. The Alleycat is a limited run edition of the Tomcat with night sights. This one is in excellent, UNFIRED condition and includes original box, papers, and two six-round magazines (they shipped from the factory with only one). I don't know if this qualifies as a rare gun but it's the only one I've ever seen.I'm asking $500 or best reasonable offer or will trade for .40 S&W or .45ACP of comparable value or gun of lesser value plus cash.

The P99 has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools.This variant comes closest to a traditional Double-Action/Single-Action trigger with a decocker. In Double-Action mode the internal striker is at rest with no pre-load and the trigger travel is 14 mm (0.55 in) long at approximately 38 N (8.5 lbf) trigger pull. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon (re)loading, the internal striker is manually pre-cocked to Single-Action mode and the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti Stress mode is activated. The trigger travel is 14 mm (0.55 in) long in the Anti Stress mode at approximately 20 N (4.5 lbf) trigger pull. On all subsequent shots, the P99AS is automatically pre-cocked and the trigger travel is reduced to 8 mm (0.3 in) at the same 20 N (4.5 lbf) trigger pull. For manually deactivating the Anti Stress mode and setting the pistol to Double-Action mode the P99AS features a decock key or knob on the slide. The Anti Stress mode can also be manually activated by moving the slide approximately 10 mm (0.4 in) back."

This is a unique gun because instead of being made of aluminum like standard J-frames it instead uses a Scandium frame which is lighter than aluminum. Compared to my 442 this is a couple ounces lighter even with this having the extended grip. With the grip you are able to get your entire hand on the pistol. I picked this up in a trade and have no use for 2 j-frames, appears to have a low round count and has minimal wear. It has a hammer so it can be shot in double action or single action. The single action pull is super light. Is rated for .38 special. Has keys and original brass from factory. Looking to get $450 obo with holster and ammo or $400 without. I will include 20 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense and a BlackHawk! IWB holster. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I am open to anything firearms related besides .22 Rifles and shotguns. Mainly looking for some reloading equipment or guns."

If you want one I can bring it up with me. I'll only be available those days to do a face-to-face sale in the DFW area. I have a C&R FFL and you MUST be willing to provide name, drivers license and address for my logbook. Up for sale are my two M91/30 Mosin Nagants and a load of accessories and ammo to go with them. I bought these about 8 years ago and they were hand-picked by me as the best shooters from 3 crates I went through.  The bores are rust-free with strong rifling, unlike most you will see. Both are Izzy hex receivers and  rearsenaled.In the rear is a 1928r, and in the front a 1933r with factory orange infill on the serial and rear sight. Both are unmodified by me and have matching serials with no force-matching. I was meticulous about cleaning the corrosive residue out after shooting them and they remain in VG-Ex condition. Both also have matching serialed spike bayonets, straight cleaning rods and original slings. Barrels are not counterbored. Stocks are not cracked but the 1933r has two 3"" x 1/4"" arsenal-applied repairs to the very front of the stock that blend pretty well.Also for sale is 273 rounds of 148gr surplus spam can ammo, 29 stripper clips, 15 ammo pouches, 2 oil bottles, 1 oil bottle pouch, and 2 complete cleaning kits.These are good shooters that could maybe only be benefited by a bedding job, and way above average from what you'll find available nowadays. Don't lowball me because you're looking at quality here.For the whole lot, both rifles and everything, $650 cash.For one rifle and all the accessories and ammo, $425For first pick of the two, plus half the ammo, clips, pouches, an oil bottle and cleaning kit, $375If somebody takes first pick, the other rifle and half of the stuff will be $350For just one rifle, sling and bayo, $300 but I will only offer that if this ad doesn't get much interest or somebody takes all the stuff in the other deal."

That is a modification I made to make it better concealed and also a lot easier to draw. It is much better than the little plastic clip it comes with.
