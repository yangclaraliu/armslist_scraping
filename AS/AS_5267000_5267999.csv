An inexpensive alternative to the commercially available aluminum and steel sight installation/adjustment tools. This will fit Glock 17, 19 and 26. I am not sure if it will fit others.  This does not have to be printed in the pictures colors. It can be printed in; black, white, blue, green, orange, yellow, and red. When purchasing let me know what color you will want. It can take up to a week to print, get metal parts and epoxy the parts.  The slide is reversible, so it can be used with Glock sights which have angled sides, or with aftermarket sights with vertical sides.   It should go without saying, but adjustment or repair on a firearm should only be performed by people who have been trained to do it properly and safely. This tool should only be used on the slide and sight of a pistol that is unloaded and disassembled in accordance with its manufacturer's instructions. Also note: a number of aftermarket sights have lock screws which must be released before they can be adjusted. Trying to move one with this press when it is locked will result in damage to the press, the sight, and or the slide. I am not responsible for any damage done to any firearm and/or Glock Rear Sight Tool.

Just recently got a call from the FFL and he had one last one with a lower parts kit installed and upgraded stock with QD sling point. I was told people are trying out different mag releases like the saiga mag release, cmmg mutant release, etc which is cheap. All that holds it is a roll pin. This is obviously a project but this is the only Rhino lower in Colorado. This is the final price drop, I'll even throw in a slingI the links to the parts that will complete the upper.
