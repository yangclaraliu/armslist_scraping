These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™."

If they're posted I still have them. I'm very diligent about returning legitimate inquiries and updating my posts. Send me your name and number, or a more specific inquiry and I'll answer promptly. Thank you. I bought these sights and briefly installed them on an unfired AR build. They are absolutely mint. I've since ordered a set of the offset Magpul Pro sights instead and no longer need these. These are the metal versions that sit very low on the rail. I used to be die hard Troy BUIS, but no more after seeing these! They are extremely solid sights. The rear is the standard dual aperture and not the LR version. They are brand new without the box, authentic Magpul ordered from Primary Arms. I'll sell the complete set for $140 or the front only, for $50. I do not want to sell the rear separately. If the front sells I'll keep the rear to replace my standard MBUS on my other rifle. Then you'll see the Gen2 MBUS for sale!!!"

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ's corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (Single Action / Double Action) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes and extended beavertail to protect shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

This particular sniper rifle has all original sniper components from the Korean War era.The history of the M1D Sniper rifle begins during WWII. When the United States entered the war it did not have a dedicated sniper rifle in its inventory. Although the U.S. Marine Corps had a small number of Model 1903A1s that were modified for sniper rifle use, the U.S. Army had no sniper rifle in inventory and nothing on the drawing boards.The Ordnance Department realized the need for a sniper rifle and ultimately issued a contract to Remington Arms Company to develop a sniper rifle. Remington began work on the contract and used its recently approved Model 1903A3 bolt action rifle design as the basis for a new sniper rifle. The result was the Remington Model 1903A4 Sniper Rifle, which began to be issued in 1943. The Model 1903A4 was issued with a Weaver 2.75 power telescopic sight but was, in most other respects, a standard issue Model 1903A3 rifle. While the 1903A4 Sniper Rifle filled the pressing wartime need for a standardized sniper rifle, it fell short compared with sniper weapon technology at the time.NO FFL, Accepted Postal money order,Certified check."
