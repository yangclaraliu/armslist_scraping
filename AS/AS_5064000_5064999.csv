He had it built and has used it extensively in the prairie dog fields. He generally only buys the ""good stuff"" and this rifle is no exception.Action appears to be tuned (not sure if ""blueprinted"" is appropriate term) and is silky smooth. The serial number is A6392XXX making it late-80s according to my research. Glued-in single shot follower. I see no manufacturer markings on the trigger. The trigger shoe is wide and serrated. Trigger breaks at 2-1/2#. Barrel is stainless and fluted with muzzle break. Overall length is 28"" from brake to bolt. Diameter is 1.23"" at recoil lug and .90"" at brake. Exterior shows signs of use, but could be cleaned up nicely with a fresh bead-blasting. This barrel is ""well-seasoned"" in that to my untrained eye, it appears the rifling is well-worn for the first 8-10"". I have no idea if this barrel has any accuracy left or if it can be set back.Stock is fiberglass and of unknown manufacture. The forend is 2-3/8"" wide with rounded bottom. There is one 3/4"" x 1/4"" piece of the surface coat missing on left side of forend where you can see the mesh beneath. It would be an easy repair during re-painting. The bedding is well done, obviously by a professional.Overall, a nice rifle with potential to become a VERY nice rifle with a little TLC and perhaps a new barrel.

Clean rifle. This rifle will make a collector happy. Hakim rifles have Arabic script on them and were used in Middle Eastern Wars. They also shoot 8mm Mauser, which you can still find as surplus. This Hakim comes with a bayonet and scabbard both marked in Arabic. The Hakim (pronounced HA-KEEM) was the first rifle ever produced by Egypt. It was the result of a modernization effort after their very significant defeat to the new state of Israel, in 1949. Some time prior to 1955, Egypt purchased the machinery and with the help of Swedish engineers set up the tooling originally designed to produce the Swedish Ljungman AG42 Rifle. The factory was set up in Egypt and the original AG42 was adapted to fulfill the needs of the Egyptians. The caliber of the rifle was changed from 6.5x55mm to 7.97 (8mm) Mauser, reportedly due to the large amounts of 8mm Mauser ammunition left over from WWII in the country at the time. The Hakim served in the second Arab-Israeli war in 1956 and the third Arab-Israeli war (also known as the “six day war”) in 1967. Only est.71,000 were prouduced.All matching numbers. The bore on this is beautiful. The wood is sound and in very Good shape. Fired 10 rounds with perfect function. Gas system works properly and is adjustable. Tightest example I've ever handled. The bayonet is in just as good condition. The streaks in the picture are cosmoline not scratches. Price is Firm. May consider certain trades. If you have any questions please ask. Must have valid OH DL, be of age, and initial BOS. Here is a little more info. Thanks for looking. Comes with bayonet and scabbard."

So carbs will need gone through.  1998 Karavan two place tilt trailer with lifetime license/registration card - $800 This summer the trailer was torn down and mostly rebuilt. The frame was re-welded and strengthened with new steel. It was painted with rust-oleum implement epoxy (very hard stuff) to keep any rust from forming in the future. The deck was replaced with new treated plywood, and new hardware (for treated wood) was used to attach it. The wiring was completely replaced with all new wire and 4-pin connector and all the sealed lights work perfectly. There are 2 amber running lights on either side of the front of the trailer, two red running lights at either side of the rear, and 2 6"" running/brake/turn lights installed in the very back of the trailer. I also added a new swing away third wheel tongue jack. The trailer is very light and easy to pull around by hand though too.  The axle has a slight bend to it- but I've pulled it this way for many miles without an issue- but eventually that should be addressed.  Custom built Cutter / Sleigh / Trailer (wreath and bows not included) - (will not sell till Sled and Trailer are sold or traded) This summer I also built the custom cutter. The frame and skis were painted with the same rust-oleum, the wood is new (treated), all hardware is stainless or appropriate for treated wood. The wood was stained for a rustic look, and my wife made a cushion for the inside.

It came with two 10 round magazines and I purchased a third 10 round Beretta magazine. It also came with a loading cup, loader, safety lock, instruction manual and I purchased a black hawk paddle holster that is either a paddle or belt holster. This gun cycles and shoots like a machine and I never had a single malfunction. All internal parts and barrel are fine. I have shot in the area of 3000 rounds through it. It has some scratches but this is a lifetime gun and if your familiar with these 92's you know their quality.
 
It has a fully metal upper and lower and is a full size pistol.
I’m asking $400 and will also include the pictured 50 rounds of ammo in the white Styrofoam.
 
I can also include a box (49) shy of one round (was 50 rounds) of the best self defense 9mm ammo you can purchase it is Speer Gold dot ammo and costs a buck a shot. But then I will be firm on the $400.
 
located in the lower Hudson Valley area. This would be a face to face cash transaction and I'm sorry but not interested in any trades.

This rifle has a blued octagonal barrel with a wood stock & brass hardware with QD swivel studs front and back.  
 
This was the first Black powder Rifle I ever had, I got the rifle from a buddy and I Thought he was giving me a deal. When I got home I discovered that the sights were missing  ($40.00 from factory). The ram rod was also missing, I got a fiberglass one with brass ends at Walmart for $25.00. 
 
This rifle does have a couple of scratches and a place where the finish is pealing on the stock, it probably needs refinishing, but I was going to wait until I got the rifle shooting like I wanted before I did this. Due to heart surgery things have just not worked out like I wanted.
Before I became disabled and was working every day, a couple of people I shot with had muzzle loaders, one of them used loose powder, which I thought was a mess. The other used something called “ Pyrodex Pellets”, this was 50 grains of smokeless Black powder pressed into a pellet. These things did not spill powder everywhere, and 2 pellets equal 100 grains of black powder. I liked these and bought a box of 100, there are several other pellets that came with some bullets. 

I don't think I shot the rifle over 3 or 4 times! I got sick before I could really even get the new sights dialed in. 
Of course I bought bullets also, here again I went with less mess, I bought bullets and sabots, instead of lube and wading.
Two powder pellets, a bullet and sabot, ram it home, no mess no fuss, cap it an your ready to fire...

There is a new unopened pack of powder belt bullets, these have a plastic tip to help the bullet expand, I beleave these are 200 grain.
 
 
There are also ten 300 grain hollow point bullets.
 
I got these because my wife's uncle has seen Elk on his farm, and I was hoping to get an Elk tag... There are eleven other bullets & sabots which I think are 250 grain, copper jacketed lead HP bullets.
 
The next problem I discovered was that the rifle would not shoot!Turned out the old #10 nipple was not hot enough to ignite the pellets, So I replaced it with a new, bigger #11 nipple.
 
These came in a package of three and there are two #11 nipples still new in pack along with a new tin of the hotter #11 Percussion caps, several caps are missing. 
 
There are several other accessories include with the rifle,there is a Thompson Center 50 cal black powder cleaning kit. 
 
There is also a real horn, I've never made it a functional powder horn because I used the pellets. I did install ends on it and it looks great hanging beside the rifle when not in use.
 
I had this big idea that I would make a set of buckskins after I got a couple of deer hides. So I got a cheap knife from knife from Smokey Mount Knife Works, this knife has plastic handles and a fake Damascus blade. Along with the buckskins, I was going to replace the handles with deer horn and make a sheath from deer hide. it's still new in the box.
 
After I collected all these items I needed some place to keep it, so I got a Allen company “made in the U.S.A” soft case for a scoped rifle.
 
This case would not hold it all, so I keep the rifle, cleaning kit, powder horn and knife in this case. The power, bullets, caps etc. I keep in a surplus mag satchel, I use for a possibles bag.
 
 
Dream again I know but I had hopes of making a possibles bag similar to the one below out of deer hide.
 
Realistically: with a muzzle loader, your probably only going to get one shot off! BUT another accessories I was thinking about making. (This would be after I got the rifle shooting like I wanted and saw the number of pellets, etc.) The cleat tubes that the 300 and 250 grain bullies are in at the moment. After I found what worked, and cut them to size. I was going to use them for homemade tubes for a fast second shot. Probably enough tub to make several
 
 
Reloading tubes.
 
 
If you count the rifle and accessories I probably have between $300.00 / $325.00 in everything.

507,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5064507,For Sale:  Complete Alice Pack for sale,"Richmond / Berea,  KY., Lexington, Kentucky",$ 75,"Listed On: Friday, January 15, 2016",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have one complete Alice pack for sale! 
 
FRAME: The frame was just a standard issue USGI Alice pack frame, complete with a soldiers name and old dried Duct tape residue. (I found this frame on the the web, it fairly close to what mine looked like). I tried several cleaners and wound up spraying and scraping to get it all off, and of course most of the paint came off also. 
 
I had several can of flat camo paint, and came across a can of Army Green, so I sprayed the frame with that. This turned out to be a big mistake, because I did this at night. Next morning
I discovered it was a bright, flat celery color! I got something called “Deep Forest Green” (this was the closest Wally World had to OD), and resprayed the frame with about 3 light coats of that. The paint is darker than the pictures show, but it's real close to original color. Frame has total of about 6 coats of paint.
 
HANDLE:  I had 13 1/2 ft. of some old OD nylon rope, don't know if it was military or not! I cut this into sections, and used four, 32 inch long pieces to weave into a handle for the 
frame. After handle was double tied, I put several drops Gorilla Glue on the knots, then after the glue dried I cut off the excess rope and seared the ends with a match. 
 
 
MEDINUM ALICE PACK: ""All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment"". While this pack is in good shape, it does have some wear. It has the Maim compartment, with radio pouch in the back. Map pouch in top flap, three pockets on the out side, plus, Two Inch Nylon Webbing sewn Around the Top of the Bag and on Both Sides to Attach Additional Gear / pouches on the Outside of the Pack.
 
GOOD: The Nylon On The flap is not peeling away as happens with most of these packs. 
 
BAD: The support pocket that slips over the Alice frame shows some wear. One of the Metal Drain Vent Holes at the Bottom of the pack is loose! And on the the left top side between the webbing, there is a hole that has been repaired... 
 
MOLLE II SHOULDER STRAPS COMPLEET: with sternum strap: in Woodland Camo. These straps have a Large back panel and 2"" wide support strap, with a D-Ring on each strap, with thick mold-and-mildew-resistant padding. They also have the sternum strap. Originally; the lower Quick-Release Buckles were missing, I bought a new set that look like what the Marines call “Foliage”, which is a greenish / grayish color. 
 
MOLLE II KIDNEY PAD: in Woodland Camo. This kidney pad has durable thick padding to make the load more comfortable on the lower back. These can be used with the MOLLE frame or as an upgrade to the ALICE pack frame, and is adaptable to other back pack frames, I've even seen them on tree stands.. This is military surplus and has been used, there are a couple of wear spots on the inside top. 
 
 
If you are familiar with the “Hellcat” modification, all this packaged needs to be a hellcat is a Sleep Systems Carrier. 
 
 
I can only put 3 photos here: if you go to Craigslist, Lexington KY. Under “Sporting” type in  “Complete Alice Pack for sale” There are 24 photos there. Or you can email me and I'll try to send any photos you need. 
 
The frame has been put into a box, the kidney pad , shoulder straps and the lower quick release straps on tho of this. Then the Medium Alice pack put on top of this. All items covered in brown paper and box taped shut.

Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies.The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class.This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the 92FS the choice of military and police professionals all over the world, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection.

The benefits of the Lady Hawk outweighed the fact that the words “Lady Hawk” were carved into the slide of the gun. As with all things, the Lady Hawk has evolved. The slide of the pistol is being ordered, again at the 90% rate, with no markings on the slide. It can come with or without the Lady Hawk markings, your call.The grip frame on the Nighthawk Heinie Lady Hawk has been thinned at the front and back, wears slender grips, and is matched to a Commander length slide for ease of concealment. Chambered in 9mm, slide-racking force is drastically reduced and the front strap and backstrap are elegantly scalloped to provide a solid purchase without torturing hands. Most women choose the Lady Hawk in 9mm and men often opt for the 45 ACP.Richard Heinie has been building custom 1911 handguns for more than 40 years. That’s long enough to learn how to do more than just turn a screw. He understood women and some men needed a 1911 that fit their hands and was devoid of sharp edges. So, he built one and now it’s available from Nighthawk, the Lady Hawk.Regardless of your gender, the Lady Hawk represents a level of elegance, grace, slender, and shooter comfort never before seen in a 1911. That’s why both women and men are drawn to it.FEATURES ON THE LADY HAWK INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:Caliber: 9mm / Match Grade Crowned and Recessed BarrelHeinie Signature Scalloped front strap and Mainspring HousingReduced overall frame circumferenceNighthawk Custom Ultra-Thin Alumagrips™Forged Carbon Steel Frame and 4.25"" SlideHeinie Magazine ReleaseHeinie Stainless Steel Hammer and SearFinish: Titanium Blue with Stainless Steel ControlsHeinie Slant Pro Straight Eight Night SightsMagazine well contoured for carryTactical Magazine ReleaseHand Serrated Rear of SlideWe offer LAYAWAY, with terms of 1/3 NON-REFUNDABLE down payment (no credit cards on first payment), 1/3 in 30 days, and the balance in 30 days following.

Slight holster wear around muzzle, though nothing defining or noticable.  Has been kept in range bag in vehicle as a commute carry.  Has eaten everything I've fed it, recoil is very nice for a .40 this size, and shoots point of aim for me - All in all, it's a Sig.  It DOES have factory Trijicon night sights, though these are not as bright as you would find new. Low-light conditions, your eyes may strain to see them.  It works for me, but YMMV. At night, I can still see them in my vehicle even under street lighting - however, if the night sights are a make-or-break for you on this model, look elsewhere.  This will come with 3 magazines and some Speer Gold Dot HP Ammunition.  No original box or paperwork as the original owner did not provide.Have liked this as it's been reliable for me, but will be purchasing a smaller commuter vehicle and will eventually need something smaller with comparable or greater capacity.  Text anytime at 615-NineSeven1-9Four11.  If you have any trade offers, please keep in mind that for what is provided (Sig, 3xmags, ammo) that I will be looking for around $620 cash, trade, or combination value for consideration.  If you want to lowball, that's fine, it's a free country, but do that with your local gun and pawn.  I have given my ""bottom dollar"" value."

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com    The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com    The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Mil Spec+™ Cerakote™.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com    The DDM4v11 Pro Series was designed for competitors looking for the platform to dominate podiums in today’s popular multi-gun matches.  Built around our newest 18” Strength to Weight, Cold Hammer Forged barrel, this platform delivers the speed, controllability, and precision required to engage the course designer’s most difficult stages.The V11 Pro Series carries the new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics.  A newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb.  A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset.  Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle length gas system, equals shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue.        MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION  LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

Serial numbers 2930424 and 2930425.
These Colt Government Models are completely finished in bright Nickel with 24K gold trim. Each one of these deluxe Colts comes with two magazines. Each body, foot, and follower are high polished bright nickel.
This pair is new and un-fired. The mainspring housings were plastic from the factory but we fixed that! Before being polished and 2X plated in 24 karat gold, we replaced the plastic housing parts (backstraps) with steel housings.
The standard plain black factory aluminum triggers were precision drilled with three holes then nickel then gold finished as an additional custom feature.
We have taken every precaution and all the steps necessary to be sure this consecutive numbered pair of Colt .38 supers are worthy of a place in any top shelf collection.
Both of these Colts were disassembled, then all parts were individually worked and hand polished. Each of the large and small parts, pins, and screws were given attention. Once each part was hand polished to a bright finish, every part of these Colts were bright nickel plated.
The small parts and pins were then 2X plated in 24 karat gold that was applied in a process ensuring even color and distribution. The end result is a fine pair of Colt .38 supers that have been worked into a rare consecutive numbered set that would be very hard to find elsewhere.
This consecutive set represents our best work. Attention to detail is our specialty and we have focused all of our best efforts here on this pair of .38 Super Colts. We are careful to leave the corners, edges, and markings sharp. The nickel finish is both beautiful and durable. You could save these and hand them down to future generations, or you could shoot a box of shells up every night keeping the coyotes away.
We installed hand picked pairs of white pearlite grips with matching large Colt gold icons, but other grips styles are available"

The MK12 is constructed around an 18-inch Stainless Steel barrel with a chamber created during the Cold Hammer Forging process, which ensures the most precise alignment of the chamber to the bore possible.  These barrels, some of the most accurate and durable barrels available, are bead blasted and chemically passivated to resist corrosion.  The MK12 barrel is engineered with a rifle-length direct impingement gas system and utilizes the MK12 gas block, which is built to Crane Specifications for USSOCOM.  The MK12 gas block is precision CNC machined from 416 stainless steel and Black Oxide Coated.  The rifle is fed with a M16 profile bolt carrier group and uses a Vltor Mod 4 charging handle for ease of operation.  The upper receiver is equipped with a free floating DDM4 Rail 12.0™ allowing for your choice of optics and accessories and is finished off with a Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor. The MK12 was designed from the ground up to be a precision rifle, therefore it required certain refinements.  We equipped it with the Geissele SSA® 2-Stage Trigger to give the marksman an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.  This precision rifle comes finished with Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™ and is furnished with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com    The Daniel Defense MK18 Pistol is a variation of the MK18 SBR which has been extremely popular within the Law Enforcement and Special Operations communities. A newly designed Pistol Receiver Extension classifies it as a Pistol and not a Short Barreled Rifle (NFA regulated items require ATF approval and a tax stamp). The Daniel Defense MK18 features the railed forend Daniel Defense currently provides to USSOCOM and a 10.3” Cold Hammer Forged Barrel, the same length commonly used for CQB operations. The MK18 RISII features the Bolt-Up System and has been rigorously tested prior to fielding by USSOCOM (currently over 15,000 units). This pistol comes equipped with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Pistol Grip with an integral trigger guard and soft touch overmolding. The MK18 Pistol by Daniel Defense is unmatched in size, weight, and performance. The MK18 Pistol is available with a Black or FDE Type III Hard Coat Anodized Rail System.
