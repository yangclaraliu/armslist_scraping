The Predator is the 1911 John Browning would have loved to have made. By eliminating the barrel bushing and installing a full-length guide rod and a coned (wafered) match grade barrel, accuracy is improved and recoil is reduced. The added weight to the muzzle along with the full length guide rod dampens the recoil and muzzle flip, which allows for faster follow up shots, giving the shooter a distinct advantage.
Nothing short of an engineering masterpiece, the fit between the integral barrel wafer and the slide is impeccably executed to appear as one, yet the two never contact each other.
The Predator is the perfect candidate for protection, uniform, competition, hunting and recreational employment. Mr. Browning would be envious."

Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel-Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonomics, perceived recoil, and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. This P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.Features:Caliber: 9MMCapacity: 10+1Magazines: 1Barrel Length: 3.1""Finish: Tan CerakoteAction: Double OnlyOverall Length: 5.6""Height: 4.3""Width: 1"""
