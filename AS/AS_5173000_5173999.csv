If it's deemed to high/expensive to some, it may not be to others. If somebody pays an astronomical price, IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY CAN NOT LEGALLY OWN/LEGALLY BUY A WEAPON. It more than likely means they have more money than sense and they want it. It's up to the buyer to do THEIR research and decide to pay that price or not. The great thing about America is capitalism. The seller has every right to ask whatever he/she wants. The seller can also ask for a driver's license and/or a valid CCW before they sell. The sad, but true fact is people are selling guns and ammo for stupid prices all over Armslist as well as gun shops and (especially) gun shows too and people are buying, for whatever their own reasons are. The real Bottom Line is somebody will buy it or they won't. If I or anybody else thinks the price is too high, then we will/can move on. It's up to us the buyers to either let the sellers get away with the high prices or be stuck with their toys. Besides, it gives us all a good laugh sometimes..."

Check out the Noveske website for all specs / details. Some main things: 13.7"" Stainless Barrel with pinned KX5 to bring the overall length to 16"", so no NFA rules apply. Gen III Billet Upper and Lower Receivers cerakoted FDE, Noveske marked Raptor Ambi Charging Handle, 15"" NSR Handguard, FDE Magpul STR stock and Miad Pistol Grip, Magpul MBUS Pro Sights. The rifle started life as a complete rifle factory built by Noveske. The previous owner purchased a different upper so he could shoot suppressed. I purchaseed the factory built upper from him and went to Rainier Arms, bought a Gen 3 Noveske lower and sent it for cerakote before I even picked it up. Lower was built with the same magpul furniture as comes from the factory on the rifle. Only difference is I went with a Spikes Battle Trigger over the ALG ACT (very similar). I also installed an ambi safety selector. There is zero round thru the lower and 30 thru the upper. It is in 99% condition. You would be hard pressed to even tell that it has been fired. I don't need to sell so don't waste my time with lowball offers, the only other one on here is $3k and I don't charge tax. I may consider partial trade vcog, razor hd gen II 1-6, or possible the right large framed AR. No other trades. Text is best, call or email works too.

It's all Yugo surplus and there are six 15 round boxes of M908 and six 15 round boxes of M30. The M908 started as Russian wartime ammunition that was acquired by Yugoslavia. They completely remanufactured it using new sealed primers and powder. The bullets are 147 grain FMJ that attract a magnet so they are probably steel core. The M30 is more recent and it's loaded in beautiful brass cases with a heavy 182 grain lead core bullet. This Yugo ammo is some of the finest surplus out there and prices are going up. Importation of most all surplus has ground to a halt and it's unlikely that large quantities will be coming again like they have in the past. $108 picked up in the Brandon area.
