This is the Standard Model M1A with 20” GI barrel dropped into the Sage EBR Mod 0 stock. This is the rock solid setup that the U.S Military used to repurpose many of the M14 rifles that were in storage and bring them up to a modern platform with increased accuracy.This M1A EBR features an adjustable stock and adjustable cheekpiece, pistol grip, and plenty of picatinny rail space for added gear. Included with the stock is the Sage Detachable Cantilever Sight Base (DCSB) that provides an absolute rock steady solution for mounting a scope to the rifle. (The scope pictured is also included with the sale). The attached scope is a Nikon Monarch 3 4x-16x BDC reticle and has been sighted in at 100 yards.A few internal upgrades to the rifle were also added such as a Sadlak Op Rod Spring Guide and a SEI Muzzle Brake. The combination of the muzzle brake and the EBR stock produces almost no felt recoil and allows for very quick follow up shots.This rifle is very accurate, typically producing 1 MOA goups, and has been my favorite hog hunting rifle. However I am now looking to sell it for my next project.Rifle Features Overview:    Springfield M1A Standard w/ GI 20” Barrel    SAGE International EBR Mod 0 Stock    SAGE Detachable Cantilever Sight Base    Nikon Monarch 3 4x-16x BDC reticle Scope    SEI Navy Muzzle Brake    Sadlak Op Rod Spring Guide    MK14 Mod 0 3 Point Sling    Harris Bipod 6”-9”    20 Rnd and 10 Rnd MagsPlease let me know if you are interested.

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Paid almost $20 for it. I'm asking $10 or will trade for other ammo. Below is a detail description copied from a website. Federal® American Eagle® 17 Win. Super Mag Rimfire Ammo delivers a 20-grain ""Tipped Varmint"" bullet at a sizzling 3,000 fps for explosive expansion on varmints and predators. The 17 Win. Super Mag cartridge is the fastest rimfire round today. The increased velocity over other rimfire ammunition flattens trajectory considerably. With a 100-yard zero the 20-grain bullet drops just 4 inches at 200 yards compared to 10"" or more with any other rimfire. And, because the bullet gets to its target so quickly, the wind drift is also cut down considerably. American Eagle 17 Win. Super Mag Rimfire Ammo is truly effective at well past 200 yards for varmint and predator hunting, and costs less that centerfire varmint ammunition, and has minimal risk of ricochet.Manufacturer model #: AE17WSM1.20-grain bullet at 3,000 fpsExplosive expansionFlat trajectoryMinimal wind driftEffective at well past 200 yards"

It fires a 7.62X39 rifle cartridge.  Type in ""Creative Arms ARK"" into Youtube to check out some of the awesome videos of the demonstrations of this thing.  It is amazing!  They are built to last and are put through every kind of torture treatment you can think of and still comes out shooting straight and true without missing a round.There are few distributors around right now, but that is only because it is new and they are in the process of getting in place, or so I am told.  I was fortunate enough to get 4 of these at a demonstration meeting a few months back.  I have two left, but only selling the one in the picture to the first person that agrees to purchase this one.  When and if you get the opportunity to take one of these to the range and you open it up on the first target, you are going to be sooooo happy you did.  If you are close by, I will be happy to meet you at a designated location for you to check out the pistol and purchase it.  Cash only.  If you are out of my area, I will be happy to accept your payment through PayPal.  PayPal will keep both parties in check and protection.  Then I will send it to the FFL Dealer of your choice.  Feel free to ask any questions you have.Thank You"

I am selling to offset its cost . This is a fantastic scope but I already have a High scope so this one lost the coin toss. Its set up for .300 Wm but it can be set for others. the one shot zero really works and saves on ammo why spend a $1-2 a round trying to find zero which can take a half a box of ammo when you can zero it in one shot and use the rest of the ammo target practicing its only been hunted with 2 trips and babied by the previous owner so it looks new and has about 60 rds on it comes with some unique rings i thought they were 30mm with inserts but actually the inserts are rounded to fit specifically to the ring like in a pocket for a sure grip and cushion on the scope .Go their website for more info but the sighting is the easiest thing ever just shoot from a steady rest move the main cross hairs to the point of where it hit on the target while leaving the secondary (small knobs ) at the original point of aim then move the secondary to the primary so simple but make sure to read the directions first to not get it backwards.I can see how this would be a fantastic scope for longer range hunting . this comes with the rings and all the paper work that came with it and its original box it is 5 years old and they currently are listed at $799 its a very solid scope Made in the USA $565 SHIPPEDthis is in excellent condition not even a ring mark
