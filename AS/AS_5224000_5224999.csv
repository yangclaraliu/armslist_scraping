The Rifle is not in the best condition. It will fire I have put probably about 20 rounds throught it. but the problems are that after you fire the rifle the bolt locks up and you have working harder than most rifles to eject the empty cartriges but I have had mo misfires with the rifle. also the rifling is also very worn out on this rifle. But this Rifle has Great historical value. The VZ 24 was produced from 1924 to 1942 by Czechoslovakia and was based off the Famous Gewehr 98. After the German Annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1939 the Germans obtained all of the rifle in the Arsenals and sold them to ally and non ally countries. This one was sold to the Republic of China (1912-1949) and was most likely used to fight of the Japanese that invaded in 1937. Also this Rifle has no importation marks so it would have most likely been captured by Communist Chinese forces and ended up in America most likely from an American GI Bringing it home from the Korean War.

Maybe calling it ""like new"" would be more appropriate.Second it has an aftermarket Bar Sto barrel. I don't know of any Sigs that came from the factory with Bar Sto barrels.So be careful out there. This seller probably is a decent guy that doesn't know any better but I would never consider this gun ""brand new."""

Rifle was zeroed and sadly never fired the remainder of deer season, has been fired approx 15 rounds. Has Redfield Royal 3-9 scope, also in excellent condition. Rifle has one ding near buttpad, no blueing loss or rust. Carries very well in rough country, very light weight, shorter barrel and thinner profile makes it very handy and fast to the shoulder, you can carry this one all day and not notice the weight. Great rifle if you hunt on the move, in thick brush, or other confined space, but still has the accuracy for long range shots and the knockdown of the .308 makes it an excellent deer or hog rifle. This one carries well in a truck also. Email me for more pics, have several closeups. Thanks for looking"

That’s why Les named his newest 1911 model after the Boss 429 Mustangs he admires above all other cars. Like our entire pistol line, our newest .45 is based on our popular Premier II, but it has enough thoughtful extra touches to really make it the new Boss of custom .45s. As with our other pistols, the new Boss is guaranteed to shoot 3” groups at 50 yards. Special features include: • Rear cocking serrations on the slide • Baer fiber optic front sight (red) • Flat mainspring housing, checkered at 20 lpi • Extended combat safety • Special tactical package • Chromed complete lower • Blued slide • (2) 8-round premium magazines"
