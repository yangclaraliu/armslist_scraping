When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."

It was distributed in the United States by European American Armory (EAA). The A-100 is also known as the ""Panther"" as imported into the United States by EAA, and some specimens have this roll-marked on the left of the slide. The A-100 design is a further development of Astra's earlier A-80 and A-90 models. The A-80 was originally patterned after the SIG P220. The A-100 is a recoil-operated, locked breech design with improved Browning-style linkless locking. The lock up is similar to the Browning High Power or CZ-75 with locking lugs on the top of the barrel which mate with lugs in the slide (not with a single lug in the ejection port like a SIG P22X.) The pistol's safety features include a manual decocking lever, firing pin block, and hammer safety. The A-100 lacks a manual safety, but depends entirely on a deliberate pull of its trigger to fire it; in this way it is similar to the SIG P22X series of pistols. The double-action trigger pull is relatively long and heavy, thereby precluding the need for a safety as the probability of an inadvertent discharge is low. The A-100 resembles the SIG P228 and is similar in overall size and dimension, but differs in several respects, the most visible being the location of the take-down/disassembly lever on the right side of the frame (from the shooter's point of view) as compared to the SIG design, in which it is located on the left. The A-100 is also slightly heavier than the SIG, owing to its all-steel construction. Additionally, the A-100's chamber contour as visible when the slide is fully forward is rounded whereas the SIG design is squared. The configuration of the hammer is also different, with the A-100 having a rounded hammer provided with a lanyard hole and the SIG having a more conventional spur hammer. Magazines are not interchangeable between the A-100 and SIG pistols, however many holsters made for the SIG P229/228 fit the A-100 satisfactorily. The various A-series pistols were submitted unsuccessfully as contenders for Spanish military contracts beginning in the 1970s. The Lebanese Forces political party named the A-80, A-90, and A-100 as a few of the many semi-automatic pistols in use by that organization's members."

Imports of this particular model stopped in 1968, and this is probably the best firearm Rohm ever put out. It's more accurate than you would think (I won a handgun postal match with this one), totally realiable, and points well.  There is some finish wear near the muzzle, ejector tube, and topstrap, all consistent with holster wear, and is visible in the pictures. The bore and chambers are shiny, rifling is crisp, and the crown is in excellent shape. Overall, I would rate it to be in Very Good condition. It's a fun, handy little gun, perfect for snakes, pests, coyotes, or just plinking and target shooting."

We had the interest and now they had an urgent need so we rose to the challenge to expedite it since their unit was about to deploy in a few weeks and we didn't want to let our brave troops down. We did our initial design overnight and had the first prototypes for heat-treat and testing in 2 days. We were cautious in where and how much material to remove to avoid compromising the over-all strength of the new light-weight mount. After many design revisions and prototypes and a few 18hr work days, we had the right balance and production began. Mike Sadlak and his dedicated precision tool-makers worked tirelessly through many nights to deliver the finished mounts to the 101st Airborne on time. It was a proud day for the employees at Sadlak Industries LLC. We thank the 101st and our military for the opportunity to serve them for a change! See thru Channel Using Iron Sights with a Sadlak Scope Mount Similar to the original Brookfield Precision Tool mount, the Sadlak mount also has a U-shaped channel thru the precision machined Picatinny rail that provides an opening under the rings to use the iron sights with the scope and rings attached.

Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies. The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period. Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class. This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the 92FS the choice of military and police professionals all over the world, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection."

It is the first of its design allowing the shooter to suppress multiple shotguns with the use of different mounts that thread into the barrel's threaded choke system. It also may be adapted to different sizes by taking it apart and using different rod lengths to make it 10in, 8in or 6in in length. As is, it is 12inches, but it is extremely light weight at 34oz, and it can be taken down to 21oz at 6in. It is extremely effective at suppressing your shotgun using waded shot of various sizes or slugs. These are superbly designed to be a great suppressor for hunting, skeet, trap, or sporting clays due to its light weight, and of course like all Silencerco products it comes with a Lifetime Warranty. This is an NFA item and requires Form4 approval from ATF before you can take possession ONLY CAN SELL TO NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS. Please contact me with any questions @ REDACTEDThe Salvo™ 12 is the first commercially-viable shotgun silencer and represents an incredible advance in engineering and technology. The Salvo 12 is designed to operate with nearly all shotguns and ammunition on the market today including pump actions, semi autos, and inertia driven models. Due to the modularity of the Salvo 12, the shooter can remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight, and length needs and can attach the Salvo to their favorite shotgun with choke mounts available in improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, and full. This adaptability makes the Salvo 12 ideal for use with sporting clays, waterfowl, turkey hunting, home defense, and everything in between. At its full length of 12 inches, sound is brought down to 136.8 dB at the muzzle — well below the 140 dB hearing-safe threshold set by OSHA. Pair this sound reduction with a noticeable decrease in felt recoil, and after just a few rounds through the Salvo 12, you’ll never go back to shooting unsuppressed again."

The rifle originally came with a set of open sights, but those were removed upon mounting the scope.  The original sights are included with this rifle, as well as the original box and instruction manual.  Also included are three factory magazines...two 5-round and one 10-round.  The original packaging for the scope and rings is included as well.
I cleaned out the factory grease and relubed the action.  I also made a few passes with a Bore Snake down the barrel.  This rifle is clean, lubed, and ready to shoot.  The bolt action is very smooth and locks up tight.  The scope has been bore-sighted, but not zeroed in yet, as I have not fired the rifle.
I'm asking $400 cash for the entire package.  I prefer to sell, but I'm also willing to consider trades depending on what you have to offer."
