Comes with tons of extras. Two holsters, one Winthorp OWB pancake holster in black and one Chiappa IWB holster in soft suede. I have both factory grips as well. The stock rubber black grip and the Walnut wood grip. I like the feel and look of the wood grip better. Also includes the 5 Star Firearms speed loader designed just for the Rhino, some use J frame loaders but they don't fit quite right, the 5 Star works perfect, and also includes a speed loader pouch. Lastly a new box of Hornady Critical Defense .357 Magnum. All in all you are getting over 200.00 of goodies that you would probably buy anyway and since new White Rhinos are selling for 900.00 alone, I feel my price is quite fair. Gun id in excellent condition, very tight lock up and has always been babied and cleaned meticulously. If you ever shoot a Rhino you will be ruined for other revolvers. I will always have a Rhino in my stable, they are just too much fun to shoot and extremely accurate! You can reach me at the email link or call or text 423 737-36OtwoSorry, no trades.

That is why this gun is priced over $100 cheaper than a new one from any store in Huntsville. This model also has the removable trigger assymbly so you can change grip size, color, or even buy a different caliber barrel and slide for it. I would be interested in trading for Glock 19 (prefer FDE or Green 19, but open to black), Glock 26, 357 revolver, or other Sig Sauer 9mm guns. I can add boot on my end if needed (for a p226 or p229). Also interested in trading for an ar15 plus boot on my end and very interested in trading for Sig Sauer p290. I would consider trading for other 9mm guns but would need a little boot. No hunting rifles, 40s, or shotguns. $525 cash (Cheapest place to get this gun in town is $599 without tax). I also can include a nib Crimson trace cmr-201 red rail mount laser for $75 extra. Trade value is $600. Please send trade offers or questions to email provided on this page. No lowball offers.

Comes with tons of extras. Two holsters, one Winthorp OWB pancake holster in black and one Chiappa IWB holster in soft suede. I have both factory grips as well. The stock rubber black grip and the Walnut wood grip. I like the feel and look of the wood grip better. Also includes the 5 Star Firearms speed loader designed just for the Rhino, some use J frame loaders but they don't fit quite right, the 5 Star works perfect, and also includes a speed loader pouch. Lastly a new box of Hornady Critical Defense .38All in all you are getting over 200.00 of goodies that you would probably buy anyway and since new White Rhinos are selling for 900.00 alone, I feel my price is quite fair. Gun has always been babied and cleaned meticulously. If you ever shoot a Rhino you will be ruined for other revolvers.
