I have almost $5000 invested into this amazing firearm. Any serious buyers can text me at 520 - two five seven - five eight 16.  
 
Here is some background info on this epic rifle
 
The actions by the US Government banning the importation of many advanced semi-automatic rifles has prevented rifles like the HK91, HK93, and HK94 from being brought into the US. However, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms has certified the SR9 Sporting Rifle, SR9(T) and the PSG1 Marksman's Rifle as legal for importation and civilian ownership.
 
The SR9 continues the tradition of the HK91 but with several important modifications that make it the ideal sporter, target rifle, and heavy-duty hunter. Polygonal rifling is standard on the SR9, the same bore profile found on the PSG1 Marksman's Rifle.
 
Also standard is the new MSG90 buffer system, a significant improvement over the older system found on HK imitations. This makes the SR9 rifle one of the lowest recoil semi-automatics in the world. It is equipped with a specially designed thumbhole stock constructed of kevlar-reinforced fiberglass that is both durable and ergonomic.
 
A target version of the SR9, the SR9(T) adds a special MSG90 adjustable buttstock, PSG1 trigger group, and a PSG1 contoured handgrip to the standard SR9 rifle configuration."

It has less than 100 rounds through it & professionally maintained. Dozens of additional pictures at http://therealtysystem.net/ss1911 -  http://occustomcoating.com/test-gallery ------------ As you can see in the pictures the handle areas have been filled in, welded with stainless steel, and smoothed nicely.  Nice fittings (screw holes for the handles) which can be removed & any grips of your choice run with stock grip screws.  --------------- This makes the gun thin! & slick!  The trigger is nice & light, smooth.   The extra weight of the light on the front actuallyh helps with second target aquistion for controlled pairs.  The SureFire DG Switch allows your left pointer finger to control the light for low light no light situations. This is an amazing tool.  ---- Work done.... Extended Slide Stop.... Abi. Extendted Safeties.... SureFire Ultra 300X Rail Mounted Light, new paid $250 .... SureFire DG Switch, new paid $92.... Cerekote Flat Black, $270 by OC http://occustomcoating.com which does factory coatings for a number of firearms manufactures  I mention this because their work is A+, they are industry know, & have an amazing reputation.... Barrel and all parts professionally polished and toughly checked within the last 7 days..... I have over $1,600 wrapped up in this gun,  & light set up.  My loss your gain!!!!  I need to raise money for Paramedic school.After the 2 photo shoots with Maxpition & DAG last summer, the guns just sat because I don't shoot .45 ACP as I said.  So if you have a Glock 27 or 26 Gen 4 plus some cash. Or if you have a 556, 762 or 308 I may be interested.  I'll drive to meet yu throughout the state.  Please email with any questions."

If you are looking at this Ruger you already know that Bill Ruger is an amazing firearm designer and of his success in producing a quality “everyman’s” rifle, the M77. Much has already been said about the flat shooting accuracy of the .270 caliber. My M77 .270 is an older Ruger M77 1982 model with the tang safety that does NOT allow the “dogleg” design bolt to be moved when in the “SAFE” position and has the adjustable trigger. My M77 is walnut with checkering and has the red stock pad as well as the integral Ruger scope mounts allowing the scope to be located closer to the barrel sight line. The barrel is 22” long and has no hard sights. I bought the M77 in 1982 and used it for one hunting season. It has seen very light use, mostly related to originally sighting in the gun and shooting just “paper” occasionally in the first two years of ownership. The rifle has seen almost no use in the last 30 years and has been properly stored and cared for. The “bluing is about 99%-100%. There are marks on the stock as a result of normal use although the marks do not show up well in the photos. The Bushnell 3x9 scope with Ruger scope rings, gun case/bag and utility nylon web sling with Ruger mounts are included. Serial No. 77-2976X. Original box included.

Pulling from his background in law enforcement, training and his passion for competition, allowed a truly special pistol to be formed. The Shadow Hawk Government is a unique blending of the pistolsmithing skills at Nighthawk Custom along with Mr. Fisher, and the electronic sight geniuses at Trijicon. (When paired with the optional Trijicon RMR sight). Attention to detail starts with the one-piece machined steel magwell/mainspring housing for quick and sure reloading of the Shadow Hawk. You will notice the chiseled look and feel of the black, flat faced trigger preferred by competition shooters. The gun is topped front and rear with Heinie Ledge Straight Eight Tritium night sights. Your hands will quickly notice the high undercut on the trigger guard along with 25 LPI checkering on the front strap. The high beaver tail will amaze you with the almost seamless fit and finish. The black and gray spiral-cut G10 grips add a subtle highlight to the black Nitrite finish and the stainless bushing contrasts nicely with the slide and frame. The aggressive cocking serrations are not just for looks but provide a sure purchase to rack the slide. Finally, leaving nothing to chance, we have beveled and recessed the slide stop to allow for the addition of Crimson Trace Laser Grips if you so choose. Once you get the chance to use the Shadow Hawk Government , you will have a true appreciation for the experience and knowledge that went into this particular pistol.

I bought it brand new about 8 months ago and have fired approx. 150 rounds through it. This thing is pretty awesome and a joy to shoot. Only reason I'm selling is because unfortunately I need the $$ and it is somewhat impractical for my usage. Fires great but it is rather picky about the ammo you use. Just a heads up. SRM themselves states how picky it is with ammo. Included with the gun is the original 16 round mag, a 6-point breacher (threaded end cap also included), butt-pad, Magpul front and rear folding sights, Orion H40W-S tactical strobe flashlight (w/original box, pressure switch, allen wrench) and a padded zipper Bulldog case. No manual included but you can find it online with a simple Google search. All in all I paid close to $2,600 for everything included...sacrificing for $1,900. Will only do an in person transfer at an FFL in the Spokane/Pullman area instead of shipping FFL to FFL...cash only. If you're out of driving distance and are interested I also have it listed on GunBroker."
