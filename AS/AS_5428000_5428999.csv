DEFECT: I notice a couple inches of corrosion near the muzzle. Otherwise, a few dings. Clean bore.
I inherited this from my uncle. I haven't shot it. Don't know any particulars about it other than looking at it. So just judge by the photos.
SHIPPING: After you win the auction let me know your FFL's zip code and I'll give you a total price of the item plus postage. Then I'll need a copy of the FFL that I'll ship to. I prefer using USPS. I sell a lot in my eBay store and have a 100% rating so I can pack things well. I'll padding and ship in a cardboard box.
PAYMENT: I take check, MO, Visa/MC, or PayPal. (I'd have to wait for a check to clear.) 
RETURNS: I don't know what's standard here. I'm not an expert on guns or their condition. So bid based on the photos and give some leeway. Your satisfaction is my goal, but note that I am only claiming that the above description is accurate generally speaking, as are my photos. I have very little interest in having guns shipped back and forth. If it has more scratches than you thought it would then you didn't allow enough leeway. But if I am ridiculously ""off"" somehow then I'll take a return gladly. (I know how to serve a customer and get the job done right!)"

However, I decided it's time to start thinning out my collection, and I probably won't be using this unless I fit it with a scope. Anyone with older eyes probably understands. Since these have become so collectible, I guess I may as well take advantage. These are great guns, and have a lot of history. They do make new scopes for Mosins now, but it's time to start thinning out."

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 models now feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. The Evo comes with two 20-round magazines. 
Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.
Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.
The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. $799, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck."

Comes with three 10rd mags and 5 interchangeable plates. I also have 15rd, 17rd and 33rd mags available for purchase. Optic not included. GLOCK introduces revolutionary design changes. The MOS pistols come with five interchangeable plates: 00 is the cover plate for when using iron sights and no optics; 01 for use with Eotech, Doctor, Insight and Meopta; 02 for using Trijicon RMR; 03 for C-More; and 04 on the Leupold Delta Point. Installation is simple; unscrew and remove the base plate, position the plate designed for use with your optic and screw it in position. Then attach your optic to the plate with screws, using the method outlined by the optic manufacturer. The end result is a system that is versatile, simple to use and provides a very secure mount. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. Price doesn't include tax. Price is firm, no trades.

This has been a dream rifle of mine for a while and I absolutely love shooting it, but I also have a project car and I've decided to sell this rilfe to fund it. Below is a list of the major components:
Rhino Accuracy Barrel

I will also include a hard case to keep the rifle safe during  shipping (I will ship to FFL upon receipt of payment). Paint on the rifle is rattle can and although I think it looks great, if you don't it could be removed relatively easy I would think - it's already worn off in some places. I have over $3500 invested in this rifle and I'm asking $2,500.

A great combat/opperator/police pistol. If you get shot at often get an HK blah blah blah. don't believe the haters. they didn't sell 1.5 milion$ of these to sweeden and germany beating out sig, glock, baretta etc for nothing. not even counting the other country contracts. the P-30 was clocked at 91,000 rounds before it died in the 9mm version. far more than the 20k before glock needed new springs and reworking.  basically it's a very streamlined model with no safetys or decockers on the frame or back of slide. only crisp 4.5 lb trigger pull to worry about in only single action mode. when a round is cocked into chamber the bobbed hammer is precocked internally to the single action mode. the only time you deal with double action is if the round doesn't go off then unlike a striker fired pistol you simple repull the trigger and the round will likely fire. no racking the slide required and that second pull of the trigger will be the only time the pistol is in Double action mode. this version is the simplest version with the best trigger pull and reliability with no compromises of either. comes with 2 spare HK mags (3 total) all are 13 rnd standard HK no 10 rounders.all grip plates included, HK pistol box with foam and owners manual included. only customization or mod is a few shallow lines carved into mag release for added grip. the modification is minor and barely noticable but may be a deciding factor for you. the surefire x400 is not included in this sale. txt or call 918-eight zero four- 8053for 1400 i may also part with a streamlight tlr2 laser/light combo and nylon thigh tac holster of unknown brand as well as itac spare mag holder with tensioner originally made for glock 22 mags but sufficient for the P30 mags and with very good fit. i do not have a standard P30 holster as i only carried it on duty with the tac light.

This is a factory police model not some vtr, sps, xcr, or other crap, if you need and are a serious buyer I can give you the serial # to run through Remington to confirm. This gun left the factory in 2012. It has the desirable 40x trigger everyone wants. These are hard to find rifles and built to much higher tolerances and specifications than any normal 700's. I paid $999 for just the gun a couple years ago, I added a Houge stock cause the stock HS one does not appeal to me. It has a Bushnell elite tactical 10x scope, leupold rings, bipod and soft case and about 35 rds of ammo. This is a sub .5 MOA gun with match ammo. I have well over 1600$ Into this gun and less than 300 rounds shot though it. Asking $1100, no stupid low ball offers, I'm in no hurry to sell. Cash is king and the Only trade I would consider would be 20g 870 plus cash or 20g over and under plus cash. Only reason I'm selling is I don't have access to a 400+ yard range anymore.

Was purchased new from Sportsworld in 2014. I've put about 800 rounds through it. It's been cleaned regularly and comes with all of the pieces originally in the Springfield issued case: two clips, a paddle holster, a lock, and a holster for the clips. No issues other than YOU MUST keep a strong stance with very little give in your arms to allow the slider to reset. I am a little embarrased to admit that as a woman, I've had a little difficulty with this, making it a poor conceal carry option for myself. However anyone with a little better upper body strength than myself should have no problems. Its a great little gun."

John Browning was a genius who was able to sit in his rocking chair and conceptualize abstract ideas that had never been used before in the firearms world. His mind was far superior to any CAD software, and his legacy lives on today as his 1911 pistol has influenced in large or small part most every successful modern pistol design following the model 1911. As he endeavored to bring his revolutionary designs closer to perfection, we continue that tradition, honoring the past while looking to the future."

Bluing is in good condition though it does show some hunting/handling wear. Wood is overall good with some light wear as well. Forearm does have a hairline crack that has been repaired and is holding strong. Includes a custom Browning hard case and two full chokes.       Citori White Lightning      Silver nitride finish steel receiver with high-relief engraving, polished blued barrels, oil finish grade II/III walnut, standard Invector choke tubes.        What makes White Lightning? The term ""left in the white"", or simply ""white"" has been used for decades describing the color of shotgun and rifle parts. ""In the white"" means that firearm parts were not blued or color case-hardened or colored in any way, but left in the natural, polished color of the metal, such as steel. Often times, the bolt, top lever, slide, ejectors and other parts are left in the natural color of the metal, providing a luxurious contrast to the rest of the shotgun. In this way, the Browning's Citori White Lightning receiver and action offer a fine choice as opposed to ""blued"" over unders. But don't be afraid that the steel receiver is unprotected: the natural color steel receiver and trigger guard are protected from corrosion by a durable coating process called a ""nitrided"" finish, offering similar protection to bluing. Just with a uniquely elegant and attractive look. A well-rounded pistol grip for performance. The Citori White Lightning's round knob or pistol grip allows the shooter to position his hand at the same, solid place for each shot, thus offering better control for fast-flying waterfowl  upland game, sporting clays or trap and skeet. Matching the rounded pistol grip is the forearm. It is nicely rounded and together, they give the name to this over under gun as ""Lightning Style,"" or the Citori White Lightning, a classic style indeed, a timeless style.      12 Ga 3""26""8 lbs 0 oz$2,069.99      Item Number 013462305 UPC REDACTED24   Gauge 12 Ga Chamber Length 3""   Barrel Length 26"" Overall Length 43""   Length of Pull 14 1/4"" Drop at Comb 1 5/8""   Drop at Heel 2 1/2"" Weight 8 lbs 0 oz   Magazine Capacity 0 Rib Width 5/16   Barrel Finish Polished Blued Stock Finish Gloss Oil   Wood Grade Grade II/III Chokes Included Full, Modified, Improved Cylinder   Receiver Finish Silver Nitride Dura Touch Finish No   Chamber Finish Chrome Plated Chamber Front Sight Silver Bead   Choke System Invector-Plus Flush Barrel Material Steel   Stock Material Black Walnut Recoil Pad Brown Ventilated   Checkering Cut 18 LPI Sling Swivel Studs None   Receiver Material Steel Trigger Finish Gold Plated   Trigger Guard Finish Silver Nitride Trigger Material Alloy   Trigger Guard Material Steel Trigger Guard Engraving Buck Mark in Gold   Choke Wrench Included Flat Wrench MSRP $2,069.99        The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"
