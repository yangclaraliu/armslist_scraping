""We have the best""**We use lead-free solder unlike many of our competitors so be careful. Made in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITH PRIDE!The Process of Using A Still/things you might like to know:Boil your grains and sugar to make your mash.Cool mash and add yeast.Siphon from still to primary fermenter.Wait 3-14 days.Rack/strain your mash into the still.Heat still and cook SLOWLY. I said SLOWLY!Temperature matters. Less than 180 can be methanol. Between 180 and 195 are called the heads. Between 195 and 210 is the mids. This is your 120 proof product. From 210 to 225 is your tails. More than 225 is just water vapor.THROW AWAY EVERYTHING COOKED BELOW 180 degrees. Collect the alcohol until you get to 225ish or the product coming out has no alcohol.If you collect with smaller jars you can go by taste it (will be harsh).Save the tails for your next run, and put them in your thumper just before your next run. This will increase the proof of your next run.Store your alcohol in glass or wood barrels NOT plastic! Common questions Do I have to heat the thumper?**This still has a thumper between the still and the condenser. You do not need to heat the thumper. It will be heated from the steam coming from the still it will be HOT.What is a thumper used for?**Thumpers allow two distillations in one run, saving time and energy. They also help clean the vapor and increase the proof of your final product.Do I need to solder? ** No you Do not solder your pots together with the connecting pipes! They come apart on purpose for cleaning! How much can a still produce?Unfortunately there's no way to answer this. It depends upon your mash. How much heat you use. And to many other valuables. What else can I use a still for?Depending on what you use as ingredients, you can produce different products. For example:1. Brandy: use grapes or wine.2. Whisky: use barley and wheat.3. Rum: use sugar or molasses.4. Gin: use barley, malt or wheat.5. Tequila: use maguey.6. Vodka: use wheat, rye or potatoes.7. Moonshine: use corn and sugar8. Water : if the Apocalypse is coming you can clean your water. The images in this posting are stock photographs of my stills.These kettles are hammered and stamped. This increases the durability and strength of the pots. Small dings may be visible due to the hammering and stamping process.If you have any questions feel free to ask, I love to help in any way that I can.Even if You don't buy from me, I will still help in any way that I can. I'm hear to help you.****Remember making moonshine is illegal and buyer takes all responsibility and liability****"

The 525 has a steeply curved Etchen-style pistol grip paired with a Schnabel fore-end, giving the gun a much different feel from the Lightning-style Citoris when you pick it up. The Euro-checkering (Browning's term, not mine) is cut in swooping panels that I could take or leave alone, but the stock has nice walnut and an attractive matte finish in place of the shiny urethane found on far too many guns. What sets the 525 apart from other Citoris is its dynamics, not its cosmetics. If Citoris have a fault, it's that the barrels are thick and heavy, making for a sometimes ponderous swing. Browning has shaved ounces out of the 525's barrels, resulting in a much livelier gun. The Sporting Clays model I shot moved easily and surely to the targets, and I have no doubt it would do the same in the dove field. The Sporting Clays model features ports, HiViz sights, interchangeable trigger shoes, and competition choke tubes. If you live without the competition bells and whistles, you can spend $700 less and buy the Field model, which listed for $1,777 last year. It should make a great crossover piece for folks who want to shoot the same gun for birds and targets."

Designed by John Browning in 1898 and patented in 1900, it was produced continually for almost 100 years by several makers with production ending in 1998. It features a distinctive high rear end, earning it the nickname ""Humpback"". The top of the action goes straight back on a level with the barrel before cutting down sharply towards the buttstock. This distinctive feature makes it easy to identify A-5s from a distance. A-5s were produced in a variety of gauges, with 12 and 20 predominating; 16 gauge (not produced between 1976 and 1987) models were also available. The gun saw military service worldwide between World War I and the Vietnam War. John Browning presented his design (which he called his best achievement)[3] to Winchester, where he had sold most of his previous designs. When Winchester refused his terms, Browning went to Remington. Tragically, the president of Remington died of a heart attack as Browning waited to offer them the gun. This forced Browning to look overseas to produce the shotgun. It was manufactured by FN (a company that had already produced Browning-designed pistols) starting in 1902. Browning would later license the design to Remington, who produced it as their Model 11 (1905–1947). The Remington Model 11 was the first auto-loading shotgun made in the USA. Savage Arms also licensed the design from Browning and produced it as their model 720 from 1930 to 1949, and their model 745 with an alloy receiver and two-shot magazine from 1941 to 1949. Browning's long-recoil design itself served as the operating system for subsequent Remington (11-48), Savage (755, 775) and Franchi (AL-48) models. Production of the Auto-5 in Belgium continued until the start of World War II, when Browning moved production to Remington Arms in the United States. The Auto-5 was produced by Remington alongside the Model 11 until FN could resume making the gun after the war.[4] Unlike the Remington Model 11, the Remington-produced Browning shotguns had magazine cutoffs. Some 850,000 Remington Model 11 shotguns were produced before production ended in 1947. In 1952, production of Browning models returned to FN, where it continued until the end. However, the majority of production moved to the Japanese company Miroku in 1975. Finally, in 1998, manufacture of A-5s ceased except for a few commemorative models created at FN in 1999. By that time, it was well established as the second-best-selling auto-loading shotgun in U.S. history, after the Remington 1100."

After purchasing the gun, I contacted Steyr for the replacement extractor and plunger. I received them in a timely manner and installed them, significantly improving the function of the pistol.
-It feeds/ejects HSTs and Gold Dots fine, but can be picky with range ammo. In my experience, Magtech/S&B/Speer Lawman/PPU have been OK, with an occasional light primer strike. Stay away from shooting Blazer Brass, Winchester White Box, Remington UMC, and American Eagle with this gun."

In good working order. Barrels hold most of there blueing as do most hidden areas. Action has turned a honest grey patina as most do from this vintage. Wood had a very fewclight handling marks with NO cracks or chips of any kind. Wood still fits a little over sized to metal parts so I don't think it has being sanded down. Varnish has a few dull spots but is all there. Original butt plate still hold most of it blue with no rust just a little dirt. Bore needs cleaned it smells like gun power but looks free of pits and can see the rifling from breach to muzzel. Call or text REDACTED

This pistol was bought new by a coworker of mine and has a very low round count (less than 200), and it looks it! Never carried, it will almost be like going back in time and buying one in 1995. He bought three at the same time and this one ended up in the back of his safe collecting dust. I had planned to keep the pistol for myself but after shooting Glocks almost exclusively for around twenty-five years, the mechanics and ergonomics of this fine pistol are just too foreign for me to shoot well.

This is not a complete AR-15 lower receiver and still requires machining, or drilling/milling, to be completed.  This kit was designed as a complete system. There are NO expensive jig sets, or other expensive tools, that you will have to purchase to complete the AR-15 80% lower receiver that comes with this kit. This Polymer80 AR-15 80% lower kit is a COMPLETE, all inclusive package.  I would like to sell this Polymer80 AR-15 80% lower receiver kit. I am located in Union County, North Carolina.  The AR-15 80% lower receiver that comes with this kit is made from Polymer80's proprietary polymer composite. This 80% lower receiver has a solid core design, a stiffened magazine well, and a beefier buffer tube housing. The pistol grip area features a unique, no-thread design, which is specific to Polymer80's AR-15 80% lower receivers.  A one-time-use-only jig is included with this kit. This kit also comes with all of the necessary drill bits, and one specially-marked-with-precise-depth-indicator end mill bit. All of these things would be required to finish this AR-15 80% receiver project the right way.  Design features:  * Unique polycarbonate construction * Solid core design * Beefed-up buffer tube ring and ribbing * No-thread design on pistol grip area. * Stiffened magazine well  * Ultra-light design * Improved jig system with additional insert to assist with trigger hole drilling * Specially-marked-for-precision end mill bit and all other necessary drill bits included  If you would like to see how the Polymer80 kit gets completed the right way, you can watch these two videos on Youtube here:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MssQSPcPBs www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XkR9UuiiLQ  If you would like to see how a Polymer80 AR-15 80% lower receiver, one that is very similar to (It is the G150 Version 1) the one which I am selling, did under torture testing, you can watch this video on Youtube here:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlmrZ1oDWoE My asking price is $90 for this AR-15 Polymer80 80% lower receiver kit. (I can ship this entire kit to you for an extra $12.)  I would be willing to meet you for a face to face, cash only transaction in Union County, North Carolina.  I will accept money orders, Dwolla, Bitcoin, and Paypal for shipping, but you must pay any applicable Paypal transaction fee.  NOTICE: I ALSO CAN ACCEPT DWOLLA PAYMENTS. WHAT IS DWOLLA, YOU ASK? DWOLLA IS A NEW ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICE AND IS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO PAYPAL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ANTI-GUN LIKE PAYPAL IS. THE TRANSACTION FEES WITH DWOLLA ARE NO LONGER IN EFFECT - NOW THERE ARE NO TRANSACTION FEES FOR ANY TYPE OF TRANSACTION! YOU CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT DWOLLA HERE:  www.dwolla.com/  The total cost to you for a Paypal transaction would be $105.36 - $90 for the piece, $12 for shipping, and $3.36 for for the Paypal transaction fee. You would also have to keep the Paypal transaction discreet, too. No mention of anything related to guns should be made on Paypal when you complete the transaction. Paypal is ardently anti-gun in case you don't already know this, which can mean that the transaction will be voided by Paypal before I receive your payment, that is, if you tell them or include any information that you are paying me for what could be used as a gun part.  Please contact me with any questions that you may have.  Please check out my other listings for some other 80% lower receiver items, plus other items altogether, here on Armslist. Thanks!   NOTE: If you want me to send a text message to your cell phone, I can do this if you would please tell me what carrier your cell phone is with. (Verizon/AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/?) I need to know this because then I can send a text to your cell phone with my textem account, which I log into with my computer. I prefer to do it this way because it is much easier for me to send text messages with my computer, than it is with my cell phone. Thanks!"

You would also have to keep the Paypal transaction discreet, too. No mention of anything related to guns should be made on Paypal when you complete the transaction. Paypal is ardently anti-gun in case you don't already know this, which can mean that the transaction will be voided by Paypal before I receive your payment, that is, if you tell them or include any information that you are paying me for what could be used as a gun part.  Please contact me with any questions that you may have.  Please check out my other listings for some other 80% lower receiver items, plus other items altogether, here on Armslist. Thanks!

I need to know this because then I can send a text to your cell phone with my textem account, which I log into with my computer. I prefer to do it this way because it is much easier for me to send text messages with my computer, than it is with my cell phone. Thanks!"
