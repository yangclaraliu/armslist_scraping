I am the original owner but CORE offers a lifetime no BS warranty which covers anything and everything no matter what happens, and no matter if the rifle changes hands 50 times. Arguably the best warranty in the industry! Founded and operated by veterans that know how to put out a quality rifle built to extremely high standards. The rifle is like new with only one range trip, totaling 90 rounds. Mid-length gas system on a Mil-Spec 1:7 twist rate CMROV 4150 black nitride barrel.

The only way it can be damaged is with some form of aggressive abrasive, like sandpaper. It will last a lifetime as long as you dont abuse it!Each set we create here at Wicked Grips is based on hours of art, style and design… with each art piece created to flow with, and not against the shape of the grip, and the firearm. Because our ideas are so often “borrowed” by others in the industry, we limit our production to 50 pieces, and then discontinue the design. Why? Because we can. We don’t have to wait for someone else to think it up.. create it.. then “borrow” itBASED ON OUR WICKED GRIPS GRAPHICS AND MADE FROM AN ALUMAGRIPS PANEL, EACH SERIES WILL BE LIMITED TO 50 SETS, THEN DISCONTINUED PERMANENTLY."

It was taken out twice: once to sight in the scope and once to sight in the iron sights. It almost saw some action with a hog on my property but I lost sight of him before I had loaded the weapon. Back in the case it went. Great AR though, carbine length hand guard and gas system, 16 inch barrel 1 in 9 twist chambered in 5.56 NATO, shoots tight groups at 125 yards with my scope. I wasn't even pushing it, it just got dark before I could move back further. Kept well cleaned and lubricated even though I've barely used it. I've added a quad rail hand grip for the mounting of accessories but I'll give you the glacier guards it came with as well if you prefer them for some reason. Also has the DPMS Pardus stock which I find much more comfortabel than the typical mil spec stock due to the nice curve it has instead of being flat against your shoulder. I will sell this AR bare with the rifle, the quad rail, the glacier guards and a 30 round magazine and some ammo for 600.

My other G19 Gen 3 is the 'TALO' Boron slide finish model, and is one of the most accurate CCW guns I have ever carried for my personal protection, but it isn't for sale, so don't ask.Most people don't know, but the G19 Gen 3's are still the most sought after 9 mm pistol by professionals, and ones in the know about CCW guns.Why is that you might ask? Because the Glock 19 Gen 3 model has a track record, and was sold by the 10's of millions world wide. They have also consumed 100's of millions of rounds through them, and have probably the best reliability record in existence, for when you pull the trigger they go “bang.” The Gen 3 also has a thicker polymer frame than the Gen 4. Glock hollowed out some of the polymer frame, to make room for the double spring that was un-necessary, for an already easy shooting pistol. Unless you need the ambidextrous mag release, there is no reason to go to a Gen 4.I'm looking to trade up with “Boot” for a DA/SA 9mm compact pistol with a hammer.I have a special need for one of these. I like the HK P30SK DA/SA V3 9mm and/or a SIG P224 DA/SA 9mm. Looking for one in LNIB condition.If you want to make a CASH offer for my gun, the magic number is $495. Just not interested in selling a New G19 Gen3 for anything less. Will ship to your FFL dealer as long as it is legal for your state to have high capacity mags."

I bought with the intention of carrying it and decided to go another route so its been a safe queen, now Im looking to thin the herd. Powderhorn has them for $415 plus 7% tax which works out to almost $450.They are selling on Gunbroker for around $375 plus shipping and an FFL fee. Cash only NO trades."
