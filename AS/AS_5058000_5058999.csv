The EXP-556 utilizes a polymer lower which is mostly standard other than the buffer tube area which is solid and unthreaded compared to a standard lower. Other than the pins and springs the entire lower is comprised of polymer parts. The trigger is marketed as a 5.5lb trigger. In testing, the trigger is very good considering it is polymer. There’s no real takeup or slack and it breaks very crisply. The lower has an integrated winter trigger guard to ease gloved shooting. The pistol is shipped with one 30 round Tapco magazine.BoltAssembly The upper is also polymer and features a proprietary recoil spring system sitting over a somewhat familiar looking bolt assembly. Since it is spring dampened there isn’t a long bolt carrier like a standard AR, it’s carrier has an abbreviated length. The upper is also unique in that it features a reciprocating charging handle on the left side. There is no dust cover or forward assist on the right side of the upper.The front gas block has an integrated front sight post machined into it and the rear sight is a ghost ring fitted into a dovetail in the polymer top rail. Between the upper and gas block is a stabilizing rod which helps keep the upper aligned and supported.The 8.25” barrel features a very effective muzzle brake. The brake pushes the barrel length to 9.25” overall. Its so effective that when shooting, the gun actively pushes down and back against the shooter. This creates a flat shooting pistol with minimal recoil felt to the shooter. The flipside of this effective brake is an engulfing muzzle flash and a deafening concussion. This is definitely not a gun you would ever want to shoot without hearing protection.Features Lightest 5.56/.223 Pistol In The World Made In USA Compact Design With No Buffer Tube Ergonomic Pistol Grip Integrated MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny Rail For Easy Mounting Of Optics And Accessories Extremely Low Recoil – Can Be Held And Shot With One Hand With Virtually No Muzzle Climb Crisp Trigger Pull Of 5.5 Lbs Reversible Safety To Accommodate Left Hand Shooters Why Pay Extra For Parts?

You will get everything that is shown in the pictures.  Original case, owners manual, test target, 3 clips, original scope box with original mounting rings.This has all the bells and whistles as it has been modified for Bullseye Target shooting.  I have added a set of Volquartsen target grips, extended mag release, extended bolt lock, and a Ultra-Dot 4 red dot scope with Leupole quick disconnect rings.  All of these were added by a gun smith and while there he did a trigger job to make the pull even less.This pistol is very accurate and will tell you if you are a good shooter or not.  It is capable of shooting tight groups at 50 yards inside a quarter.  The best I was able to do was a score of 48 out of 50 with 5 shots.  Choosing your ammo and getting what works best for you is important.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  I may be able to meet you at a range if you would like to test this before you buy it. I also have a Winchester aluminium hard case that will let go for an additional $50.00 if you want it.Russell"

Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. The Golden Boy has a 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate, with a gleaming Brasslite receiver and barrel band. The classic styling will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America's Old West, when company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle. Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6.75 lb. heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness, and left-handed shooters can safely use any of Henry's lever action rifles.New in box, sold by FFL."
