No Trades.Polish PPS-43C semi auto pistolThe History...The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied."

Putting together a heavier bullet, a cleaner powder, a premium lube on the lead round nose projectile provided consistent velocities and harder hitting performance at subsonic, suppressor-friendly speed. The 42 grain lead round nose bullet is heavier than traditionally available rounds, but isn't so heavy as to cause instability. While ""harder hitting"" and .""22lr"" aren't usually associated together, steel silhouette shooters will appreciate the difference between a knockdown and a wobbling target that stays up! A designed velocity of 1020 feet per second ensures the heavier projectile remains subsonic speed in most all firearms without resorting to anemic velocities.Multiple bricks available"

By the time you pay for tax, shipping, transfer fee, background, etc. you would spend over $500 as I did. I will sell for $350 FIRM! Or, your trade valued at $400. I will consider partial trades, trades in full, or tade up with some cash on my end. This is a nice little pocket cannon that shoots well and dissapears in your pocket.
That is the actual gun in my jazzed up picture there.
You must be legal to own/purchase and show me your Florida ID or Drivers License. Sorry, but no felons or underage folks please. Thanks for looking!"

The Dolos, (Greek god of deception), is a revolutionary new product that allows the user to quickly remove their barrel, or change calibers, in seconds on their rifle or pistol with no tools. There are other takedown systems on the market, but none can compete with the Dolos in terms of speed, handiness or repeatable accuracy after a barrel change. The new Dolos Gen2 incorporates a locking mechanism to prevent barrel from backing off. To break the rifle or pistol down, simply lock the bolt to the rear, disengage ratchet lock, turn the aluminum handguard and pull the barrel assembly straight out of the receiver. To reinstall the barrel, insert it into the receiver and twist the handguard. The kit comes with an Anderson pic rail compatible vented handguard, updated lock ring, ratchet housing assembly, jam nut, and set screws. Installation takes only a few minutes and the Dolos is compatible with any mil-spec upper. The kit is designed to work with any carbine or pistol length direct impingement gas system. The system is designed to work with the supplied 7 inch carbine length handguard and is also compatible with Yankee Hill Machine railed handguards. The kit is designed to work only with direct gas impingement systems and is not compatible with gas piston conversions. The Dolos works fine with railed gas blocks on carbine length or longer barrels using the factory 7 inch handguard."

The pistol itself is in great condition with about 400 rounds through it and some minor holster wear on the slide. It operates flawlessly and I've never had any malfunction issues. In the box you'll find all the original paperwork, factory-fired case, and lock. All internal parts are stock factory OEM. From the factory it comes with two mags but I purchased a third. I have installed aftermarket magazine follower kits manufactured in the USA by Magguts. These magazine internals add an extra round to the magazine without having to add a larger baseplate. I also added Pierce +1 extensions to two of the magazines. This means the flush fitting magazine has a 7+1 round capacity while the two extended mags have an 8+1 round capacity. This is a significant upgrade over the stock 6 round capacity and all three magazines cycle and feed perfectly, I've never had even one issue with any of the upgraded mags. The original Glock mag springs, followers, and baseplates are included. There is a good amount of info and videos online about Magguts products and it is all positive. The sights have been upgraded to Trijicon HD tritium night sights with a yellow outline front sight. Also included are 17 rounds of Hornady Custom 90 grain XTP hollow point self defense loads and a package of .380 snap caps. This pistol comes with everything you need to get going right out of the box. I'm asking $500 + shipping to your local gun shop. Buyers in the Denver area can meet at a local dealer for the background check and transfer. Thanks."

Beautiful in every way. Nearly one of a kind, I can't find another one of this caliber (.357/38spcl...it shoots both from the same chamber and is stamped for both) anywhere.Never intended to sell but need the cash, moving.This is a Taurus Thunderbolt long barrel rifle. It is designed after the Colt Lightning rifle, and Taurus only made a few in this caliber.Taurus Thunderbolt rifles were produced for a very short time and they were all in the caliber of 45LC. They promised the .357/.38 Spcl model to soon come but then, to the world's disappointment, advertised they were not going to manufacture that model. Somewhere in the last minute of making this gun, they ran a few...very few.The 45LC models had a problem, they were not always extracting properly because that .45 had nearly no rim on it(you can read all about it on the internet)..that is probably why Taurus halted expanding the model, but the .357 and .38 special round has a perfect rim for extracting and the few that they made, run absolutely perfect.I have no idea why they didn't take off with that model once they learned it was a winner. Maybe they were committed to moving to the next run of something else. Anyway, the bluing is so dark it looks almost Parkerized, but it is certainly just quality bluing, it is a Cadillac of a finish. The hard wood furniture is stained so dark it is almost black...very nice.It is heavy, supremely built and has a glass like finish with equally impressive lines.The recoil is almost zero. It has zero malfunctions and is near perfect in every way.Has a Skinner Peep sight and stacks bulets nearly on top of each  other at 35 yards. You cannot be disappointed if you.end up with this.I will be, but you won't."
