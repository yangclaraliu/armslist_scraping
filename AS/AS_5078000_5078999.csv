It's built on a Nodak Spud NDS-1 receiver using a Romanian G parts kit hand-picked by Gabe Suarez of One Source Tactical. The rifle has all of Jim Fuller's custom features, including:• Tuned Custom G2 Trigger• Tuned Action - Rails, Bolt, Carrier & Trigger assembly• Modified Fuller Rear Sight• Dehorn Entire Rifle• Black Norrell's Moly Resin over Parkerization• Magpul MOE AK Stock• Magpul MOE AKM Handguard• Magpul QD Sling sockets (handguard and stock) • Side Scope Mount• US Palm AK Battle Grip• Wolverine Flash Hider• Krebs Custom SafetyThis rifle also has about 100 rounds through it, basically for sighting in and a day at the range. The rifle is immaculate inside and out with no finish wear. If you know who Jim Fuller is, then you know what kind of rifle this is. Given that this rifle is built early in Mr. Fuller’s career and Romanian G parts kits are rare, this rifle is a collectible item. Plus, there’s no wait for a true Rifle Dynamics AK. The price is $1595 plus $50 shipping. The preferred method of payment is a bank cashier’s check.Additional info:I have the ORIGINAL Romanian G leftover parts including stock, forend, safety, piston, trigger, grips, etc too. I'll throw that in for free. I am the original person who ordered and purchased the rifle from Jim. I had Gabe at OST hand-pick the Romanian G parts kit and ship it directly to Jim. The rest of the parts came from OST and Jim himself. There is no ""Rifle Dynamics"" wording etched into the receiver. He was not doing that at that time, because the Rifle Dynamics company did not exist yet. This rifle was built before the company existed. The parts kit this rifle was built from did not come with a side scope rail originally. I had Jim install one when he built it just in case I wanted to use it. I have the original receipt from Jim that details the build. I also have the receipt from Gabe at OST detailing all of the parts I purchased from him and had shipped directly to Jim (parts kit, stock set, internal parts, etc). I also have the original rifle build bag that Jim used to keep track of this build order."

I don't want another revolver I have enough. FDE is wanted in the fore mentioned trades. Used or new.

Keeping the tactical shooter in mind, he designed this pistol with everything it would need to take it from “pretty good” to become “the best.” After taking the basic 3rd generation Glock chambered in 9mm, this weapon received Wilson Combat VT sights to ensure shooters would have perfect accuracy when it matters most. Next, Vickers slapped on an exclusive slide stop and magazine release, ensuring that the handgun would always have a smooth action. Beyond its tactical superiority, this is a limited production firearm and features an FDE rough texturized finish on the frame that is sure to attract all the right attention while adding a better grip option for the modern shooter. To top this off, the weapon includes a few extra special parts to ensure your success, including 2 Tango Down magazine base plates. Whether you simply want to display your limited production Glock firearm or have it ready for an emergency, you will always have 17 rounds at the ready."

This is a Ruger New Model Single-Six Single-action Revolver chambered for the ever popular.22 Long Rifle [LR] cartridge. The Single-Six is currently produced as the New Model Single-Six. The term ""New Model"" simply means that this model includes Ruger's transfer bar mechanism for increased safety, allowing one to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. Prior to 1973, the Single-Six was produced without the transfer bar mechanism, making it less safe to carry with all six chambers loaded, and with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. The transfer bar safety allows the weapon to fire only when the trigger has been pulled. Ruger provides the transfer bar safety upgrade free of charge for owners of any old model Single-Six.
This example of the Single-Six features the 5.5"" barrel, blued finish, and walnut wood stocks. The serial number places it in 1982 production year,69-204XX.  This does NOT have the 22 Mag cylinder.  There is no box the manual is available at Ruger.com.
The weapon is in excellent shape for being 34 years old.  The cylinder does have a faint line on it.  The  RUGER® NEW MODEL SINGLESIX® revolvers chambered for .22 long rifle are intended to be used with any standard make of .22 long rifle, long or short ammunition in either regular, high velocity or hyper-velocity loading.
$375 cash, no trades at present.  Must be 21 years old have a valid Florida drivers license or CWP and a bill of sale will needed to be signed.  Pick-up must be in Boynton Beach or Lake Worth.  I will not send through the mail.

My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $199 for a trust. This includes an initial in-person or phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Arkansas, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Florida and Texas and can assist with trusts in those states as well. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at razorbackguntrust@gmail.com to inquire about my services."

I thought I wanted to get into reloading but I just never could get all that interested in it, so I'm selling the set that I bought.
Set Features:
 
1 Franklin Arsenal Digital Caliper
An assortment of spent .45 apc and .38 special casings
1 4pc set of Lee reloading dies including
     Carbide factory crimp die
     Powder through expanding die
     Steel shellholder and powder measure
     Carbide sizing die
     Bullet seat and feed die
1 Lee load-all 2 for 12 gauge shotgun shells
1 Hornady electronic scale GS 1500
1 Lee safety powder scale (this one's manual)
100 CCI large pistol primers no. 300
An assortment of 45 acp 230 gr bullets
1 unopened Lee case conditioning kit
1 tube of Lee resizing lubricant
1 Lee safety primer feed
1 Lee perfect powder measure
1 Lee breech lock challenger
Every piece of equipment still has it's own instruction manual. I also have included a hodgdon data manual, the Lyman Reloading Handbook 49th edition, and of course all the nuts and bolts and little bits and whatnot you need along with it either in their original packaging or safely placed in plastic bags, and all accounted for.
 
Basically, pictured here is everything you need to make your own ammo, except for the powder. I'm a student, I need money, and sadly, this setup was sitting around collecting dust, and admittedly, starting to collect a bit of rust. I took care of the bits of rust with sandpaper and WD-40, and took that as the sign that I was never actually going to get around to making this one of my hobbies. All in all asking for a grand total of $400.00
 
I am willing to ship within TN. We'll have to calculate costs on that though"
