This was a very difficult decision for me to make, as I am kind of in love with this rifle but am moving away from the larger calibers (such as, .308 and 7.62x54R). There have been exactly 0 failures or issues with it and I've put about 200ish rounds down range. Very accurate, especially with a good scope. I've a little obsessive-compulsive about cleaning, so rifle is very well maintained. Receiver, like all VEPR rifles, is from RPK design, so it's veritably built like a tank (and generally just tougher than other AKs).I installed a removable grip-wrap that makes the rifle featureless (so you can insert and detach magazines without using one of those Hellish contraptions they call an AK-bullet-button, yuck). All it does is cover the thumb-hole (according to the ATF rules, if your thumb can wrap around the grip, it's considered a pistol grip and you need a bullet button). This, to me, is vastly superior to the bullet button. Included in price are original factory magazines: (1) 10rd and (1) 7rd.
 
Optional: I have 40+ .308 rounds that I will no longer be needing, since this is my last .308 rifle. If you want them, I'll sell them to you at a great price (much better than retail). Also, I have a LimbSaver recoil pad on the end of the stock that actually greatly reduces the felt recoil and is fairly comfortable. If you want that also, let me know and I'll throw it in for cheap (I bought it online for $65).Email me if interested!"

I generally used the standard barrel which minimized carbon build-up on the front sight and significantly reduced flash when shooting in low light.

As a logical evolution of the Thunder 9, the well known weapon by law enforcement and military in South America, the Thunder 9 PRO adds improvements and new features as the the result of the experience and relationship with these professionals.
Its capacity is one of the largest among pistols in its field. Furthermore, their accuracy and reliability has made it possible to pass the toughest tests to become sidearm of the best law enforcement agencies of the S. American continent. They also became an excellent pistol for sport use in such rigorous disciplines as IPSC and IDPA.
It is an ergonomically excellent gun. Every single detail in its design has been well cared to for providing comfort and safety. This model is 100% ambidextrous since its safety levers and slide stop levers are located on both sides of the grip, and its magazine catch is also reversible.
The Thunder PRO's polygonal rifled barrel offers an excellent performance and durability, and a new firing pin design provides an extremely durable life for a service pistol.
 
The location of the safety and decocker grant unequalled comfort and a perfect grip.
The Thunder 9 PRO has the Improved Browning Petter barrel locking system, giving an excellent reliability during ejection of empty cases and feeding live ammo, also come with or without PICATINNY RAIL for easy accessory mounting. As we always do, safety is first, and Thunder 9 PRO has many safety devices: manual safety lever and decocker, firing pin safety, hammer automatically remains in half cock notch and separate the hammer from the firing pin, and a new loaded chamber indicator.
FINISHES: matte blue. It also comes in two tones with nickel plated slide and an anodized frame for superficial hardening and corrosion resistance.

For lovers of this calibre, this pistol gives a superb grip comfort unmatched by the competition.
With Bersa's careful design and extremely soft, controlled recoil, shooter's of all kinds will experience superlative results.
The Thunder 45 is an excellent option if you are looking to acquire a .45 ACP caliber firearm. This will be confirmed the second you grip and shoot the pistol. You will see why so many .45 caliber enthusiasts love this pistol.
This gun is fully ambidextrous like high capacity versions. Its safety/decocker and slide stop levers are located on both sides of the gun. The magazine catch is also reversible. The location of the safety and decocker grant unequalled comfort and perfect grip.
The Thunder 45 Ultra Compact PRO has the Improved Browning Petter barrel locking system, giving an excellent reliability during ejection of empty cases and feeding live ammo.
As we always do, safety is first, and Thunder 45 Ultra Compact PRO has many safety devices: manual safety lever and decocker, firing pin safety, hammer automatically remains in half cock notch and separate the hammer from the firing pin, and a new loaded chamber indicator. This pistol has also a Integral Locking System, to store the gun safely.
REAR SIGHT: Dovetail fixed, with white dots, u or bar for faster target acquisition.
FRONT SIGHT: fixed in the slide with white dot for faster target acquisition.
FINISHES: matte blue. It also comes in two tones with nickel plated slide and an anodized frame for superficial hardening and corrosion resistance."

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16′s unique design.The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect.If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16.

M4 feed ramps are incorporated into the barrel extension and upper to enhance reliable feeding, while a true 5.56x45 NATO chamber ensures that both commercial and higher pressure surplus mil-spec ammunition may be safely used. The bolt and carrier both pass a thorough Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) test for guaranteed structural integrity, and the gas key is properly staked to its mil-spec bolt carrier.

The DDM4 Rail combines the best features of Daniel Defense's previous handguard designs to create an entirely new and improved platform. The 1-Piece Lower Rail of the handguard has been located closer to the barrel for an exceptionally slim, compact exterior footprint that is more comfortable and ergonomic to hold in the off-hand. The DDM4 rail is secured to the upper receiver with a new Bolt-Up System using 4 steel fasteners for rock solid stability and repeatable positioning of rail mounted accessories, and includes 4 Integral Quick Detach Sling Swivel Sockets for a multitude of sling mounting options.

The original owner used it mainly for enduro riding and sold it to me around May 2015 because of financial issues. About a month after buying it I lost balance going up an incline and fell on my wrist wrong. I ended up breaking my scaphoid, so after that I didn't ride for a good 5 months.. Then winter came along.. So the bike pretty much sat for a year, id guess I've put around 6-8 hours on it. Despite barely ever being used the bike runs great, I go out and start it up every now and then and it starts up fine each time. Occasionally ill take it out for a quick spin around the block just to keep it warm. The tires still have good tread, the body plastics are slightly scraped up and the right front fender is chipped as you can see in the pictures. Also the left hand guard needs a new clamp/bracket (cheap), other than that theres just some minor scuffs here and there. The bike was rode for what it was meant for, if you want though it could easily be fixed up into a street beauty. The pictures show what looks like stains on the seat but thats just water, it also looks like there rust on the bottom but its just mud/clay. Im only selling it because id like a bike for the roads this summer and just don't have the money for 2 bikes.. Various other parts will be included. REMEMBER: The bank still has the title. The original owner is working on paying it off. I am the second owner. I have the bill of sale and still stay in contact with the original owner, he's a nice guy, this isnt shady at all. You will be able to speak to him yourself too. The bike has a clean vin and should be paid off by next year at the LATEST. If your looking for a bike just to keep out on the property or do some trail riding with or if you just don't care about a title then this would be a great buy! Its only priced so low because I know nobody wants to deal with this title situation. If you don't care though you'll save a couple thousand.. Give me a call or text and id be more than happy to go more in depth about everything. Thanks! -Caleb"

I am the second owner of this pistol and it has been very well taken care of. The description is as follows: Made by the legendary German Weihrauch company, the HW 45 is the pinnacle of sporting air pistols.Unlike many modern air pistols, the HW 45 isn't made of molded synthetics. It's a solid metal gun with finely checkered walnut grips. And, it's truly ambidextrous. The 11mm dovetails make it easy to mount a pistol scope or a red dot sight.The .177 version has two power levels. Low power is approx. 410 fps, and high or full power is 557 fps. The different power levels are created by cocking the gun to different lock points. The distance you shoot, the weight of the pellet and the type of target will determine which power level is best. The HW 45 is an excellent indoor trainer for those who shoot the M1911A1.Comes with around 900 .177 pellets (Gamo and Crosman) and a lockable MTM pistol case."
