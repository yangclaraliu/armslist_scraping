The barrel has been threaded for Rem-Chokes and the forcing cone has been lengthened and polished. The original forearm had been permanently modified with a rail along the bottom, and currently has a Magpul AFG2. Currently on the weapon is a Blackhawk Knoxx SpecOps Gen1 NRS stock with side saddle, high cheek riser, and limbsaver recoil pad. I have also added a side saddle on the receiver, and a picatinny rail with a BSA red dot. There is a Mossberg heat shield on the barrel. I have a custom single point sling mounted to a GGG QD doing swivel at the back of the receiver, but I also have sling studs at the bottom of the butt and the bayonet lug.If you read all that I thank you. Please email me for loads of better pictures or more info."

Also have an excellent condition Glock 27 Gen 2.5 with new Meprolight Night Sights. I have 4-5 factory magazines for it as well. It will also come with the factory Tupperware container. Has rubber talon grips on it too. Thinking about getting away from the 40 s&w and going to all 9mm.   Looking to trade for Glock 19 & 26 gen 3 only. Not interested in gen 4's dont like the grips. If yours doesn't have new or newer night sights I can put the stock sights back on these guns and keep mine. I will do mag for mag on the 27 otherwise it will come with the 2 stock mags. These are the only trades I am interested in. Nothing else please.  I also have 1000 or so rounds of new brass ammo I could trade for some 9mm ammo. Only trading ammo with the guns. Local Missouri residents only unless you want to do the driving. CCW PREFERRED.. Thanks

Both barrels have 8 holes on each sides total of 16 on each barrel.  Some upgrades I did to the Mossberg 500...Replaced the rear pad to a much softer, rubber pad to absorb the recoil a bit better. Added the six saddle shell side holder with Velcro. What you see in the pictures are what you get. What you'll need will just be a scope and your good to go.

I like the stock, will order the longer LOP. This is great for tactical, but I need for hunting purposes.   OverMolding provides the ultimate in a comfortable, non-slip, super smooth attractive finish that is durable and extremely quiet. The exclusive Cobblestone texture further enhances all Hogue stocks by providing an efficient non-slip, non irritating stippling pattern. OverMolded Stocks are constructed by molding a super strong, rigid fiberglass reinforced skeleton or ""insert"" that precisely fits the guns' action. This rigid skeleton is then OverMolded with a durable but soft synthetic elastomer (rubber). During the heat and extreme pressure of injection molding the elastomer adheres chemically as well as mechanically to the skeleton, resulting in a permanent bond between the rubber and the insert. The super strong skeleton gives the stocks their strength, and the precise molded dimensions provide a perfect drop-in fit of your rifle or shotgun. The state of the art elastomer material used on Hogue stocks won't harden with age and is virtually impervious to all oils and solvents found around firearms, providing years of dependable service."

Assembled by the celebrated importer William H. Horstmann of Philadelphia. Horstmann was a Top Tier sword Retailer and Importer who contracted with the Prussian firm for most of there better, high quality swords. Horstmann imported and assembled the blades with grips and then applied there name on the ricasso. The Majestic high-quality steel blade is slightly curved and both flats of the blade were intricately acid etched with floral decorations along with military motifs. Most etchings have lost detail due to age and battlefield use. The Ricasso on the blade obverse exhibits the retailers mark that reads HORSTMAN and SONS the other reads PHILADELPHIA (see photo's) Blade back exhibits a pleasing mottled silver gray patina with some expected pitting and oxidation. The remarkably crafted ornate cast brass hilt is authentic to a foot officer’s sword and displays an awesome floral decorated guard with a single band integrated into the knuckle bow. The Handsome ornate hilt has swelled grips in Very good condition that feature a fine ray - skin covered wooden handle that does have a few expected worn spots. Grip secured with double twisted original brass wire that has remained tight and intact. The Piece exhibits a very pleasing floral casting that let's one easily identify the superlative craftsmanship and the All original Pommel shows a single-domed cap with a beautifully constructed oak leaf design along the edges. All the brass has acquired the kind of bronze patina one hopes to find. A very obvious rare quality weapon, This Horstman Sword is a truly elegant and historic piece that provides that unique pride of ownership that we as collectors yearn to find but seldom do. As we all know only too well the highly sought after artifacts are either unavailable or seldom within our financial reach as they quietly pass from one collection to the next with few opportunities to purchase, This is one of the few occasions to acquire one well within the range of affordability and just to further eliminate any last shred of doubt you may have. This Private Purchase Kepi is Very sound and solid overall with some tiny moth holes. (SEE PHOTOS) Remarkably it has retained its original chin strap and Deep Indigo Blue that the most avid collectors insist on. Brass Federal buttons are attached which have turned to an exquisite antique brass shade. Beautiful Blue cloth patina throughout shows a piece that was lovingly cared for with slight or no damage of any consequence we could find. The leather presents with less crazing then associated with Kepi's of this age. Kepi has no separated pieces and hand stitching is firm, tight and intact. Lining is of the custom private purchase butternut which was so popular among officers and troops. No large tears or holes were found, the sweat band shows expected wear (see Photos). A truly wonderful piece in excellent all around condition that shows little age. Another piece of grace and character that along with the above artifact will without doubt make for a an envious display. The trumpet is not attached to the hat. It still has the pins on it.The price is firm and no trades please"

823,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5045823,For Sale:  Rare & Premium 5.56/9MM/.308-I.E.,"Corona, Riverside, California","$ 1,111","Listed On: Saturday, January 9, 2016",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm looking to sell some ammo that you don't see on here often at all. First up, is 6 boxes of Winchester Ranger RA9T 9MM 147 grain. This ammo is by far one of the most sought after SD rounds on the market. I'm asking for $250 for all 6 boxes and I'm looking to sell them as a whole lot, not by box. I'm also interested in a partial trade for .223/5.56, 9MM, or .45 ACP plinking ammo plus cash on your end.Next, I have 13 boxes of the rare and discontinued Silver State Armory 5.56 70 grain Barnes TSX that's barrier blind and by far the best 5.56 round for hunting, as shown by various people on online forums who've posted their personal results. This ammo is identical to the military's 5.56 70 grain ""brown tip"" that everyone lusts after. When they are available on the market, they command a ridiculous amount of money per round. SSA has been bough by Nosler sometime ago and does not produce this ammo anymore. The only other top tier producer of this ammo is Black Hills, which makes the 5.56 70 grain GMX, which is similar, for $75 per box of 50, not including shipping and tax. ASYM also offers this round in .223 for $80+ for a box of 50, without shipping and tax. I'm asking for $25 per box, or partial trades for .223/5.56, 9MM, or .45 ACP plinking ammo and cash. Last, I have 10 boxes of Silver State Armory .308 168 grain Barnes TSX ammo. This ammo is lead free and CA compliant for hunting. This round is ideal for hunting and if I'm not mistaken, great barrier blind ammo. Top tier producers of the same ammo like Black Hills and ASYM sell for $50 per box of 20 without shipping and tax. I'm asking for $40 per box or partial trade for .223/5.56, 9MM, or .45 ACP plinking ammo plus cash."
