It will need a new trigger, triggerguard, trigger return spring, and all firing pin related parts. Everything else is there. The cylinder times correctly and lockup is still tight. I believe this could make a decent shooter if restored. I simply don't have time or money to fix it up. It is chambered in 32 short. The bore is dark and pitted but for a pocket pistol, accuracy should be acceptable. As always, email me with questions or for more pictures. I will ship. Shipping is $25."

This gun is quality built and you can feel it! Functions like it just came of the asembly line! Not a speck of rust on this gun. Bright and shiny bore. I have seen these guns being sold for up to $700 but I'm letting this one go for a fraction of that price. The first one to show up with cash in hand takes it. It wont be around long!

Just recently got a call from the FFL and he had one last one with a lower parts kit installed and upgraded stock with QD sling point. I was told people are trying out different mag releases like the saiga mag release, cmmg mutant release, etc. All that holds it is a roll pin. This is obviously a project but this is the only Rhino lower in Colorado. * will also throw in a new black bungee sling"

The rifle is in decent shape overall with no rust or pitting anywhere I can see (I haven't taken the stock off) the bore is in good shape. It has the S stamped which means it's safe to shoot modern ammo and I was told the punch mark indicates a heavy barrel. There are no Turkish markings anywhere on the rifle. The numbers don't match. I was told the flaming bomb stamp means it is either a Spanish Civil War rifle or that it was used by a grenadier unit. I was also told that it has bavarian markings, I'm mainly looking to trade for another rifle preferably a semi automatic, like a commercial m1 carbine or something like that but I'm open to other offers as well.

It has a textured black finish with an aluminum bedding block. As the name suggests this is a high quality precision shooting stock. This stock increased my .308 700's accuracy and consistency. It is definitely a huge upgrade over the hogue stock that comes with the 700s. I purchased it from midway around a year ago and only shot the rifle a handful of times with the stock during that time. It looks brand new still and shows no sign of wear. This is designed for a BDL bottom metal.

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.
