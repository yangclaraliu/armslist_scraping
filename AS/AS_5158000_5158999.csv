Working with the NRA's field staff, thousands of volunteers nationwide participate in the program by organizing committees and planning events in their communities. Monies raised at these events go to The NRA Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.[2] Established in 1990, The NRA Foundation raises tax-deductible contributions in support of a wide range of firearm related public interest activities of the National Rifle Association of America and other organizations that defend and foster the Second Amendment rights of all law-abiding Americans. These activities are designed to promote firearms and hunting safety, to enhance marksmanship skills of those participating in the shooting sports, and to educate the general public about firearms in their historic, technological and artistic context. Funds granted by The NRA Foundation benefit a variety of constituencies throughout the United States including children, youth, women, individuals with physical disabilities, gun collectors, law enforcement, officers, hunters, and competitive shooters.[3]"

Upon reholstering, simply activate the decocking lever and the pistol is again ready for quick use when you need it. Super-safe against accidental firing, the 92G retains all the legendary qualities of the 92FS, including 3-dot sights, high-capacity magazine, superior accuracy out of the box and more. I really hate to sell this one but I'm trying to finish some projects around the house and could really use the money. When I purchase another it will also be the 92G , Training with the p226 and the 92G works out great because of the decocker only."

It is like new with the original box. It has about 40 -50 rounds through it. It is an excellent shooting piece. The recoil is not as bad as you may think. It is no worse than a 30-06 in my opinion. The scope is NOT included but the Ruger rings are. Shipping by me is $40. From a FFL add $15 for his fee. I am also including a set of RCBS that are virtually new & bag of new brass. This is worth another $50+. NOTE: If it has to be shipped through an FFL the brass & dies will need to be sent separately because he charges $20 extra for packing & shipping extra items. I can include them into the box if I ship it at no extra cost.

ALL OTHER CALIBERS IN STOCK. Cocking the R8 iC activates the illuminated dot of the ZEISS rifle scope. The hunter is immediately ready to shoot. He gains time, remains calm and therefore is able to shoot safely. WITH CASE. Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy. Blaser Saddle Mount Only with a perfect scope mount, rifle and rifle scope become one accurate unit. Four inconspicuous notches which are aligend with the chamber hold the one-piece mounting base without causing tension. Thus, the barrel can float freely and keeps its point of impact even with the heat generated by a quick succession of shots. By just a few turns, the rifle scope can be detached and reattached within a split second – all without needing to re-zero your optics. Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion."

But if you want original for 50-60 dollars you can buy a stock and barrel bands for it. Seeking trade for Glocks, AK rifles (prefer 7.62x39 but open to other calibers), Kel TecP11 or PF9, Ruger LC9s, or SW 38 snub nose bodyguard style revolver.

Since the upper is not a serialized ""firearm"" it is the same as buying a new grip or trigger. The barrel is a chrome lined 16"" 1:7 twist which has shot consistent 1.5-<2"" groups at 100 yards with the supplied matech back up irons and the F marked front post. I'm sure a dot sight or some glass would get that a little tighter. The upper has been mounted and fired, but less than 200 times. The reason for sale is the added weight of the SOCOM profile barrel does help follow up shots, but adds weight to the muzzle end and makes the rifle seem heavier after a long hike.
