The TP9SA is the next evolution of the popular TP series pistol. With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The added safety feature of not engaging the trigger is a huge benefit for the civilian and law enforcement market. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights.   The new frame design of the TP9SA contains several upgrades inspired by the feedback of military and law enforcement. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm.    Specifications   Barrel   4.47 Inches  Overall Length    7.5 Inches  Weight    1.8 Pounds"

In very good condition, pretty much all metal that doesn't move is cerakoted. There is no rust anywhere on the gun, really there isn't any wear either, it has also never shot corrosive ammo so the bore is in great condition too. Comes with muzzle break, carry handle, adjustable iron sights, vertical grip, three tapco 20 round mags and has a US made spring loaded firing pin. It also has nicest bullpup trigger I've ever felt. I can hit clay pigeons at 150 yards with it so yes it's quite accurate and it is super fun to shoot. Also have 500 rounds of ammo that can go with it for the right deal. Make me a cash offer or a trade offer. Particularly interested in AK's because I've never had one, really like the Century C39V2. For some reason it won't let me post pictures but will gladly send them if you contact me. Thanks. REDACTED"

This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M4 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories.Rifle Requirements: The M4 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, M4-type handguards. The rifle must have a carbine length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and round handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (M4 or Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variants.Summary: My brother (US Army) intended to use this during his deployment to Afghanistan, but ended up using another quad-rail system instead. This is exactly what's issued to US troops with their M4 Carbines. Box and packaging have been opened, but rail and accessories have never been used and are in excellent condition. MSRP: $250Asking Price: $100Local only. No trades. Cash only.Note: I will only be available to meet/sell this on the 16th and 17th of February since I am visiting the Charleston area from out of state. Offer good for a limited time only."

Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation. These are the newest and current production or UTS-15 shotguns Generation 3.  PLEASE NOTE : This is the NEW GEN 3 Model that will fit the New Style Switch found on the Flashlight Laser Accessory combo (not included)  . The UTAS UTS-15 Also has Flip up sights, Muzzle brakes, Laser/Light and even a carry bag available (not included)   Bullpup design: pistol grip and trigger are located forward of the barrel breech and action assembly. This allows for the same barrel length as a traditional shotgun but shortens the overall length of the weapon.[3] Top mounted picatinny rail: allows for the mounting of a wide variety of iron and optical sights. Twin magazine tubes: set above the barrel to allow for easy access to the loading ports. Alternating or select tube feed: a selector switch located on the top of the tube/barrel assembly allows for use of multiple ammo types (i.e.: buckshot and birdshot; buckshot and rubber pellets; etc.). Built-in laser/light controls: the right side of the grip is reserved for controls (a button) for controlling the optional light and laser assembly. Threaded barrel: Beretta-style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to be adapted for any situation and a range of attachments.[4]    Accessories and optional equipment for the UTS-15 (as listed by UTAS USA):  Front and rear sight assembly: machined from a solid billet of 7000 series ordinance aluminium with matte black anodized finish these sights are elevation and windage adjustable.[5] Tactical Choke Tube: machined from 4140 ordinance grade steel and matte black oxide finished. This choke features muzzle spikes and gas ports for breeching. Also considered a choked cylinder it can be used for firing slugs as well as buck shot.[6] 7.5"" Barrel Extension: machined from 4140 ordnance grade steel with a matte black oxide finish. This attachment is threaded to screw into the UTS-15 barrel (like the Tactical Choke Tube).[7] Red Laser/Flashlight Unit: the laser/flashlight unit is specially designed for the UTS-15 shotgun. The flashlight casts a 200 lumen lens focused beam when switched on (using the integrated control button on the grip). The laser is high-intensity and adjustable for both windage and elevation. The machined aluminum housing for the laser/flashlight holds two lithium batteries and is specifically designed to slide into the barrel retaining tube in the lower stock below the barrel where it is held in place by the barrel retaining cap. The UTAS provided set comes with the necessary equipment for mounting the assembly into the shotgun.[8]"

Last year I had a gunsmith do an action and trigger job on it and its been babied. This rifle is a little different than the average 336 because it has a handgaurd end cap, instead of a barrel band. I think that adds to its accuracy (and it just looks cool).The scope (Bushnell Elite 4200) is not included unless you want to add $300 more. But I would rather just keep it.Comes with original box, see through rings, and weaver flattop mount.Price is $400  No trades."
