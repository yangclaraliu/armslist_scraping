No need for a B.A.D. lever to get in the way with gloves on. The safety selector is a Noveske Short Throw model. The lower has a patented, flared standard magwell that can be changed for a wider one if desired. The buffer is a Spikes T2. The barrel is a 16"" Spikes M4 profile 5.56 lightweight cold hammer forged and hard chrome lined unit with 1:7 twist that has been HP and MPI tested (the barrel part number is MIL-B-11595E if you wish to look it up). The bolt carrier group is from WMD and includes their trigger, hammer and disconnector, all plated with Nickel Boron which they claim can be run completely dry to cut down on clean-up time (I actually put a small dab of moly-lube on the hammer at the trigger notch but there is no lube anywhere else). The charging handle is a Vltor/BCM model 4. The 13.5"" handguard is from Diamondhead and includes two 3"" and one 6"" picatinny rail sections that can be installed most anywhere along the length and at 3, 6 and 9 o'clock. The pistol grip is from MagPul and the stock is a Rogers which locks up very solidly. The receivers, handguard, grip and buttstock have all been Cerakoted in titanium. The muzzle device is a Troy Industries Medieval Flash Suppressor. Included is a new MagPul P-Mag. Nothing here is cheap or average, I spent over $1400 on it. Only for sale because I bought a new LMT MRP and can change between calibers easily without using different upper receivers so that one rifle fills dual roles and I could use the space in my safe."

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action.The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well.These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired.With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public."

The Windstar runs strong with less then 103,000 miles (low for year). The AC blows cold and the Windstar has new tires and brakes. The upholstery is in amazing shape. The Windstar will come with a clean California title (pink slip). By no means this Windstar is in excellent condition or even close. I was told the check engine light is on due to a sensor not connected to the evap canister. The van will need a new paint job as the paint on the top and some other areas is coming off. The driver side window will not roll down. The Windstar has been sitting for two months due to only being allowed to have one parking spot in our complex, therefore, unknown if there are any leaks. We are basically getting rid of the Windstar due to one parking spot and we want it off our insurance stat. Feel free to take a look at the Windstar and bring a mechanic if you want. If we can strike a barter, paperwork for the Windstar and the DROS/PPT paperwork will go through Discount Gun Mart in Santee. I will cover the dross fees as you will cover the smog for the Windstar. It is currently registered until April of this year. The van is traded/bartered (sold) as is. Thanks for looking!"
