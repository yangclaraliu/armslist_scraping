In 2011, however, the company took a step back to pay homage to the gun that started it all in 1988. The Para P14-45 is, with only a few minor improvements, the original Para M1911A1 model that put the arms-making company on a road to success from which it has never veered. While high-capacity .45 ACP semi-automatics are not uncommon today, the Para was the first production gun to take the 1911 design to the next level. The rest, as they say, is history. At Para, the guns were always a work in progress and the company was continually developing new ways to improve the 1911. The first major step came in 1990 when Para decided to take the plunge and begin manufacturing the entire gun themselves. Using the basic shape of the proven M1911A1 as a starting point, they created their own version, the original P14-45. The 1911- style frame was rede-signed with built-in plunger tubes and grip bushings. Frame wall thickness around the slide stop hole was made 20 percent greater for extra strength under stress, and the new Para models had a standard ramped barrel with supported chamber; features that were generally expensive options from custom gun-makers. The Para’s double-column tapered magazine also offered more reliable feeding characteristics combined with a beveled magazine well. Other improvements included flaring the ejection port for more reliable operation, a positive slide lock safety, a custom grip safety, and an internal firing pin block. The end result for Para was a 1911 that could feed any type of ammunition—even hollow-points and semi-wadcutters—and take the abuses of competitive shooting or hard use in the field with +P ammunition. It was a 1911 that could do it all at a price that wasn’t prohibitive. The P14-45 was a benchmark for Para. The re-introduction of the gun in 2011 featured a tough black Para PK2 finish and superb white-dot rear sight combined with a red fiber optic front sight; otherwise it’s the same gun that made Para famous over 20 years ago. Standard features on the model include a skeletonized competition trigger and hammer, an oversized beavertail safety, extended thumb safety and magazine release, and a ramped, match grade stainless steel barrel with crowned muzzle. Running very close to the original P14-45, this latest version tips the scales at 40.5 ounces empty, and 49.5 ounces with 15 rounds on board, (14+1). With one more round in the magazine than the original Para model, this heavyweight, full-size .45 is well suited for law enforcement, concealed carry, or home protection. The only minor disadvantage to the Para is finding a holster that fits the raised fiber optic front sight. Most contoured 1911 rigs are a bit too tight out of the box for the Para, but we did find several abbreviated belt holsters like the Galco Combat Master (CM424) that worked ideally with the P14-45’s dimensions. The holster’s butt-forward cant, open-top design and contoured open bottom and sight channel allowed for ease of draw and re-holstering even with the fiber optic front sight. Considering the carry weight of the Para, this style of belt holster is an excellent choice for concealment, comfort and ease of access. Another belt holster that allowed the P14-45 to draw seamlessly was the original style Bianchi Speed Scabbard designed more than 50 years ago. The new Speed Scabbard from Frontier Gunleather also provided excellent carry and concealment for the Para."

Shortly, let me just say that when Palmetto State Armory released this item on their website 8 months ago, it was the first and last time I've seen it in their inventory and I was thrilled to have been part of the few who jumped at the opportunity of such a rare receiver. The descriptions below speaks for itself about how special this receiver is. Not all of PSA's barrel are made by FN and are Cold Hammer Forged (CHF), but not only do you get that, you're also getting a receiver that has a double thick chrome-lined barrel and has undergone magnetic particle inspection. Plus more. The original price on this upper was $359 and because of it's rare quality, I feel it should still stay in the ballpark of it's original value so I'm letting it go today for $335.00. I included the SKU at the bottom, but since PSA took it down months ago, the SKU has not worked. Below is more descriptions on the product. Description:Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine length gas system. A2 style profile is Mil-spec phosphate coated, MP and HP tested. The barrel is finished off with our SQR 11"" free float rail and a low profile gas block.Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish.

I have made a few upgrades to the rifle. It started life as a Pm400 which is sigs offering of an AR pistol. I changed out the barrel and installed a Premium PSA Mid-length Gas system barrel and a 9"" troy Alpha Rail, I also installed a Magpul CTR stock and a Fail Zero Bolt Carrier Group. The Buffer is an H2 as well and will come with a 30 Rnd Pmag. The rifle runs flawlessly and has seen around 200 rounds with the new barrel. the rifling is a 1/7 twist which can handle anything from 55gr to 77gr, even 80gr.
