Works on runflats as well. This unit not only punctures tires, but due to the shape of the blades it actually tears a long gouge/slice of the tire as the tire rolls over it.  Super heavy duty mil-spec construction, hardened stainless steel replaceable blades and axles, bullet proof control box, amphenol connectors for remote control and DC power supply to charge the battery or permanently power the unit. The unit actually has a built in wireless receiver, however I do not have the keyfob/ transmitter, but it can be ordered for less than $30 if you really think you need wireless control. The pad units have 2 holes in them for permanently staking them to the road/driveway if that's your application. This entire unit deploys from the trunk of a small car.I purchased this unit almost ten years ago, it has never been used. It has sat on my shelf since I bought it.  THIS DEVICE COST THE U.S. GOVT. $27,000.00. I would like to see $1600, but I'm willing to move slightly for an immediate sale. I would also be interested in trades. Since I could only upload 1 picture I got you a shot of the control box and 1 of the 20 claw pads.

The SL, which stands for ‘stretchlightweight’, incorporates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifl e. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market our lightest factory piston driven rifle to date. The SL utilizes the ‘stretch’ or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI’s NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight. The ambidextrous SL also comes standard with a LWRCI Rear Skirmish Sight and a fi xed A2 front sight post. The M6 Stretch Lightweight is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifl es. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifl e that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system It also has all of the advanced coatings that make LWRCI rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price."
