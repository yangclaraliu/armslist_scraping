I used it only at the trap range, so it has only had 2 3/4"" target loads put through it. It was also always stored with the springs depressed by using snap caps. The Turkish walnut on it is beautiful and has a nice looking tiger pattern. The bore is flawless. A few things to mention, probably being overly picking. There are a few small marks on the stock, a tiny area where the bluing shows wear and some discoloration spots in the action. Overall the gun is in excellent condition and will serve someone well! It comes with the original box, chokes and I will throw in the snap caps so you can store it properly as well.Lot's of pictures: https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=397603E611E1F458!358964&authkey=!AAkmeUP8fEnl6sk&ithint=folder%2cjpg"
