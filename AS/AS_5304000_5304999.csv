Made Famous in the Indian Wars
After the American Civil War, the United States military was slow to adopt new technological advances in firearms and opted to retrofit their enormous surplus inventory of Model 1861 type muskets to fire cartridges. Many different types of conversions were conceived and implemented.
 
These conversions were the main infantry weapon of the West and played a large role in the Indian Wars of the late 19th century. 25,000 Model 1863s received the Allin Conversion, enabling them to be loaded via the breach through a “trapdoor” mechanism.
 
This one is in .50 centerfire.
 
Lock is dated “1864” rear the hammer. The federal eagle is forward of the hammer as is “U.S. Springfield”. “1866” over an eagle head is visible on the trapdoor mechanism.
Serial Number: none
 
Caliber: .50 centerfire
 
Bore is in nice condition and all parts mechanically functional.
 
Overall condition as seen in photos."

Manufacturer #3200140. Complete with two mags, factory box, and extra grips. $1000.00. Gun related trades considered. Text REDACTED. Meet in Land O Lakes, Lutz, or N Tanpa only.
From Kimber Site:
The Stainless TLE/RL II .45 ACP is a stainless steel version of the duty pistol carried by LAPD SWAT, plus it has the added advantage of an integral Kimber Tactical Rail. Critical custom shop upgrades such as Meprolight night sights and 30 lines-per-inch checkering are also included. Based on the Kimber Stainless II model, it has features like match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from stainless steel for additional resistance to the elements. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the authority of the great .45 ACP cartridge, there is no better pistol to carry for duty or use for home defense than the Kimber Stainless TLE/RL II."

I bought this instead as even the price of a used one was too much. The Night Evolution copy is very solid and the switches are all very tactile. I have expended a good amount of RTV trying to waterproof it, and failed. It is weather resistant, you can drop it in a puddle, but it will not tolerate submersion. The battery compartment stayed dry but the primary light would glow until the thing dried out completely. It's still completely trustworthy for HD use, the nav lights are a useful addition and the main light beam is clear and focused, its even decently heat-sunk for the power output. The emitter is also easily gotten to for replacement if you want to put a warmer LED in it.I'm selling because I took a carbine class recently that pretty much confirmed I don't terribly like vertical foregrips. As well, my hands are on the smaller end and the grip is a little uncomfortable. Will ship conus, accept paypal or cash ftf. Asking $80 shipped, $70 ftf."

Ok what makes it special? Still in the same holster that it was in when taken from a Major back in WWII. Also the 2 magizines match the serial number on the gun. It will come with 4 orig rounds it was captured with, and I have a box of 50 reloads. Now, the reloads were done in the 1960s, so I wouldnt fire them, bowever they are hard rounds to find. The gun functions as it did back in WWII however should be stripped down and cleaned and reoiled. The only bad thing is, the round rings you would find on tne back of the holster are missing. Excellent item to put on diplay, or just an awsome piece of history to own! Price is $1,200 OR BEST OFFER. PLEASE NOTE I WILL NOT TAKE 600 FOR THIS, IT WILL STAY IN MY SAFE FOR A PRICE LIKE THAT."

This a pre-Remington (JM stamped, but not removing the rail)  I've owned for about 10 years. This was originally purchased to replace my old 444S that I lost in a home burning down sometime ago.Shortened the barrel to 18.5in (not ported as these don't really buck that much and too much flash), and replaced stock lever w/ a factory stainless hoop. XS sights and rail, Leatherwood long eye relief scope, and nice butt stock shell holder. Wife nicknamed it ""The Moose Masher"" as I have taken quite a bit of game with it, including the moose I did indeed mash with one 300 grain Belt Mountain Punch slug (of which I have 2 full boxes remaining available for sale).
Minor nicks, scratches, etc. and actually looks better than I would expect considering I don’t baby many things. 
The crowned barrel reduction and lever swap (not for a John Wayne look, but to facilitate gloved hands when it’s below 0 here in Wisconsin) were performed by a reputable local gunsmith and not one of my experimental hacks. Includes the Hi-Lux 2x7 scope with Warne QD rings, the Lyman tang sight (used this sight exclusively until the Express sights and rail were installed and been kept on hand for backup), etc. per the pics.
If you've ever owned one, you know this round kicks ass. I also have a great deal of ammo ranging from Hornady to heavy Grizzly and Buffalo Bore available as well. Let me know if you're interested and can forward additional info, pics, etc. I will ship ammo UPS ground, free if you want to buy enough.FFL to FFL only on the rifle and I will cover the outbound FFL shipping."
