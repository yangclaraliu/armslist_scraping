Smith and Wesson created its first revolver, the Model 1, in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1856. The company continued to innovate and improve generation after generation to become the leading manufacturer of handguns in the United States: The Model 3, released in 1970, made Smith and Wesson a worldwide success thanks to two important customers, the U.S. Cavalry and the Russian Government. The introduction of the .38 special Model 10 has been used extensively by police and has not ceased production since its introduction. In 1935, the company introduced the .357, the first Magnum revolver, which the company says is the most popular line of revolvers of all time. The .44 Magnum Model 29 was made famous by Clint Eastwood in the 1971 film ""Dirty Harry."" The Model 60 Smith and Wesson revolver became the world's first stainless steel revolver when it was released in 1965. In 2015, the Model 69, .44 Magnum revolver received the National Rifle Association's Golden Bullseye Award for handgun of the year by Shooting Illustrated Magazine."

It’s a decent pistol, but the general perception among the Lucky Gunner team was that it was the most difficult to shoot of the six guns we tested. A long, heavy double action trigger is hard enough to master as it is, and the light weight of the LC9 makes it even more challenging.By the time we published that article, Ruger had released a new striker-fired version of the LC9 — the LC9s. By switching from a double action to a striker-fired design, Ruger was able to make the trigger much lighter, smoother, and easier to manipulate. At SHOT Show this year, I saw the newly released LC9s Pro, which omits the manual thumb safety and magazine disconnect safety found on the original LC9 and LC9s. Ruger let us borrow one of these pistols, and I made another quick 60 second review video to summarize my impressions."

I would like to get 150$ or I will keep it and put the saftey in myself. thanks these guns are pretty rare they only made the 16 gauge for the first 2 years of production

I've never fired it and hate to see it go but it would be nice to have some cash in the bank whilst I'm at Boot Camp.  It is a Beretta 1301 Tactical with a Nordic Components Tactical Extension Kit which also includes a picatinny rail for a flash light and a QD sling area and Low Drag Follower. These shotguns fully loaded with 9 rounds (7+1+1) feel like they weigh less than my old Remington 11-87 Police Magnum when empty. I also comes with everything the shotgun came with originally in the box.  It is a great shotgun, and is an absolute bargain at $1,000.  I will meet you within an hour of Harrisonburg, or in Richmond. I can ship but payment must be made very quickly as I'm due to move on February 29th, all fees will be paid by the buyer.  Here is your chance to get a great shotgun that hasn't even been used, at a great price.  Thanks!  Cross Posted"

M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.
 
The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.  $1899.00 plus tax, with a free NICS check/transfer."

Thanks to its accuracy, durability and versatility, it also makes a superb choice for personal or home-defense as well as concealed carry.  Just as the US Marines are rightly famous for their reliability and endurance, the M9A1 is built to be ultra-tough and always dependable. Besides the superior steels of which it is constructed, it also features a unique sand-resistant magazine that was developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan and comes standard only on the M9A1. The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of grit accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 even in the most extreme conditions."

It’s a decent pistol, but the general perception among the Lucky Gunner team was that it was the most difficult to shoot of the six guns we tested. A long, heavy double action trigger is hard enough to master as it is, and the light weight of the LC9 makes it even more challenging.By the time we published that article, Ruger had released a new striker-fired version of the LC9 — the LC9s. By switching from a double action to a striker-fired design, Ruger was able to make the trigger much lighter, smoother, and easier to manipulate. At SHOT Show this year, I saw the newly released LC9s Pro, which omits the manual thumb safety and magazine disconnect safety found on the original LC9 and LC9s. Ruger let us borrow one of these pistols, and I made another quick 60 second review video to summarize my impressions."

NOTE: You must be at least 21 years old and have a valid AZ ID to purchase this item. Comes with two magazines, one 5 Round & one 6 Round with Extension. Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full-size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol? The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use. Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™. The best value around. Quite possibly our best value yet. This lightweight optics ready carbine features a mil-std A3 upper receiver, lightweight barrel and Pardus stock for user comfort and advanced capability. All of this and plenty more, at a price set for any budget. Tax not included in price. Dealer sale. Price is Firm, no trades.Credit cards accepted. Visitors by appointment only. Credit cards excepted with no extra fee. Located in North Phoenix near 15th Ave and Union Hills. Call or text REDACTED to set up an appointment.
