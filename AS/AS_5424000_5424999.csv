There are a few modest handling marks but no meaningful dings, no cracks and no repairs. It appears to have had a receiver sight at one time. There is some very light crud on outside of barrel but this does not detract from the unusually well preserved condition of this gun. Front site hood is still in place. Rear site replaced with a blank to provide clearance for scope or peep which may have been in place at one time. The clip is said to hold 8 .22 LR rounds"

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.
One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.
On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.
During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!

In very good condition.  It is by far the best handgun I have ever fired, it feels great in my hand, and it is unbelievably accurate! It comes with a range carry case, 2 12 round magazines, a Galco Inside The Waist Holster, a speed reloader to make reloading easier on your thumb, and the two magazine belt holder.  It is missing the belt holster, as I swapped it out for the inside the waist holster. It is black on black.  Very minimal use, I purchased this handgun new and have only put a small case of Federal ammunition through it. It is extremely accurate. I had no issue  hitting a silhouette target directly center from 30 yards easily.  GREAT grouping. The 12 round grouping were a total of about 2.24"" in width and about 3.8"" tall.  I have shot a lot of handguns and this one is hands down my favorite."

NO orders outside of the USA no shipping to Hawaii or Alaska.The TASER C2 Electronic Control Device (ECD) is the most powerful less than lethal option available. TASER C2's are more than ""stun gun"". TASER C2 ECD's fire probes close to 95mph that pierce the skin or clothing of an attacker, sending electirical signals to the muscles. These signals override the central nervous system, causing immediate lock up of the muscles for 30 seconds or more immobilizing any attacker. TASER C2 ECD's have an effective range of up to 15 feet. This distance allows the user to remain at a safe distance from an attacker and escape a dangerous situation, unlike a stun-gun which must be applied at close range."
