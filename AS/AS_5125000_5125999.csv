The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights are removable and adjustable for windage.

It is not a typical hack job that we have all seen. It looks really good and has a nice stock with a cheek rest and a high gloss blueing on it. internal parts are very smooth and polished clean. It is a fantastic shooter. I shot it this sunday when we had the nice weather and was able to get a really nice grouping at 200 yards. very accurate for as old as it is. It also has a redfield peep sight that makes it very easy to shoot. I have killed alot of deer and hogs down south with this rifle. It has never gave me one jam or hickup in anyway. Looking to sell for $450 or possible trades for something different. This is a much better rifle than what you would get if you went to a store and spent $450 on some plastic peice of junk. This has been around for a hundred years. It will be here for a hundred more! thanks for looking. Would possibly take trade offers. just text me what your thinking. 317-43one-7zero25.

It could be simple or hard to fix and that is the reason I am going to put a price on it but will take the best offer by the end of this month. If the offers aren't good enough I will tear it down and sell it as parts and probably make better money but I really just want to get rid of it.

There are a unusual amount of gun traders who don't respond to people, my reasons where as listed.1- Unintelligent sounding writing and use of words.2- A mass influx of idiots offering way less then the asking price. If you don't like price then don't offer with reasonable exceptions.3- I was pretty busy and couldn't respond to all emails however I tried as best as I could.4- Now there's little excuse on my end for the people who were being fair, however with increased traffic it is quite easy to not respond to unsavory offers or ones that seem rather short.too long and it's an eye sore.. At this age you guys should know proper etiquette and I shouldn't have to teach you anything. 5- Please read for god sake your not children... I get many offers that blatantly ignore my requests and what I am looking for, this is a sure fire way to waste an email and your time! --that being said the item is sold and I will have some more in the future.. Hopefully you can take this into consideration as I did respond to people who made a decent effort. I am not everyone but common sense dictates reply rates may increase. Have a great day everyone, thanks for reading if you took the time to."

Not having any import marks leads one to believe that it was brought back as a war trophy, but which war is unknown. What is known is that the Rifle was well taken care of, and has a clean barrel. The rifle as a whole does show a few signs of wear, and several minor spots of rust. The Bolt functions flawlessly, chambering, firing, and ejecting with out issue other then a slight patina from use. The weapon is accurate, light (in comparison), and would serve well as a show piece, a bush gun, or for plinking which is exceptional for an rifle nearing 72 years of age.*I am asking 425 OBO, and am open to most trade offers. I live in Owenton, KY but I am able to meet in any of the surrounding areas with notice.

This pistol was so accurate, that it pushed my legendary SIG 210 9mm to the selling block several years ago. I don't shoot that much any more, so I just decided to see if some other gun enthusiast might be interested? I don't need to sell any of my guns, so my asking price will be my selling price. This gun is still like new and comes with everything that it came with from the Custom Shop when I ordered it. $1750 CASH or multiple pistol trades with “boot” or AK-47 variants with “boot.” Please no junk or anything that you can't sell already on your own. This gun is for the person that wants only the “BEST” and can afford it. You won't find one of these in your local gun store.When ever I decide to sell one of my high end guns, I offer the following: Come take a look at my gun, and if you like it, I will give you up to 60 days to sell your gun/guns to come up with the remaining balance. I am a gun enthusiast and not a gun dealer or collector. I can make this statement, and that is, ""it will sell to the first person that comes and looks at it?"" The Pro-Tek I begins life as a CZ 75 Compact D PCR pistol. Once it is turned over to the custom shop in Mesa, Arizona the transformation begins! They completely de-horn the pistol. They replace the original rubber grips, and blend a set of textured aluminum grips into the frame, so that the fit of the grips is perfect. This lessens the width of the pistol from 1.34 inches in its original PCR configuration to 1.14 inches in the Pro-Tek I version. The slimmer grip frame seems to accentuate the curve of the back-strap as it melts into your hand.The slide is given an octagonal cut with a flat top, and this completely changes the lines of the pistol giving it a streamlined appearance. This pistol also has excellent three-dot night sights. The rear sight is a low profile wedge type, that is adjustable for elevation.The de-cocker has been cut back to make it less obtrusive without sacrificing its function or ease of manipulation by the shooter. CZ’s competition hammer is also installed on the Pro-Tek I model. The slide is given an anodized Bronze/Gold finish, and the aluminum frame is manufactured with a glossy polycoat finishAll of the controls (de-cocker, slide stop lever and magazine release) on the pistol are in easy reach of your right thumb. The magazine release button is slightly extended but smooth and de-burred; when it is activated the magazines fall free. The magazine well has been beveled to augment the process of recharging the pistol with a fresh magazine. All in all, there is very little they didn’t think of to attain their goal of making the Pro-Tek I the ultimate CCW pistol. This gun has the smoothest DA trigger pull that you will ever experience on any gun, and the SA trigger pull when cocked, breaks like my Custom Les Baer 1911.As wonderful as this pistol is to hold and look at, the best experience comes once you hit the shooting range. Whether you are shooting standard or +P loads the Pro-Tek I handles recoil beautifully. The grip frame spreads the recoil evenly across the web of your hand and between the textured grip panels and the beavertail the pistol stays centered in your grasp. Between the recoil handling aspects of the pistol and the short reset trigger, it sure makes for easier and accurate follow-up shots.As far as accuracy goes, if you like all of your rounds to produce one gapping hole in the target then you will like firing the Pro-Tek I.Take a look at the factory supplied test target.Will trade for:"
