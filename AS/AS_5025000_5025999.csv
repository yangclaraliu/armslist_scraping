I'll sell it trade.
All Mossberg 930 Special Purpose shotguns feature a self-regulating gas system that vents excess gas to aid in recoil reduction and eliminate stress on critical components. All 930 autoloaders chamber both 2 3/4 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease—from target loads, to non-toxic magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo. Magazine capacity is 5+1. To complete the package, each Mossberg 930 includes a set of specially designed spacers for quick adjustment of the horizontal and vertical angle of the stock, bringing a custom-feel fit to every shooter. Safety and safe handling is of paramount importance in special purpose firearms, and the 930 was engineered with that in mind. The receiver-mounted safety is convenient for right or left-handed users; simply push the button forward to take the weapon off safe. A protruding chrome cocking-indicator button is strategically placed in the front inner-edge of the trigger guard, making it easy to see and feel when the weapon is cocked or un-cocked. Unloading has been made easier too, with the Mossberg EZ-Empty™ system. By depressing the bolt release, the carrier can be pushed up and the first shotshell in the magazine removed. Simply repeat until the magazine is empty. All 930 Special Purpose models feature a drilled and tapped receiver, factory-ready for Picatinny rail, scope base or optics installation.

From the Browning Web Site:

The X-Bolt Stainless stalker is anything but high maintenance.  With Dura-Touch Armor Coating and a matte Stainless steel barrel and action, it will endure punishing weather and terrain and still give you the throuroghbred performance you can expect from a Browning rifle.

This attractive and weather-resistant bolt action rifle is similar to the X-Bolt Composite model, except for a Stainless steel receiver, barrel and bolt. It has a comfortable palm swell for right-hand shooters, textured gripping surfaces for keeping your hands where they should be on the stock, even in wet and cold conditions. This model also features a deluxe Inflex Technology recoil pad and sling swivels. If you are looking for a hard core bolt action rifle that you can rely on, in the rugged areas and inclement weather conditions hunting deer, elk, varmints and the like, the X-Bolt Stainless Stalker is your rifle.

Whether youÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½re burning through a 3-Gun Stage, logging some range time, or holding for hair on a coyote youÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve duped into thinking youÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½re lunch, the Strike Eagle is up to the task. High-quality, fully multi-coated lenses deliver a clear, crisp sight picture and optimal low-light performance. A true one-power on the low end of its 6x zoom range provides quick target acquisition in close quarters scenarios. Need to engage targets at distance? Crank it up to 6x and let it rip.
