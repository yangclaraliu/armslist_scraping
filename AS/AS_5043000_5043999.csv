If you are looking to trade - there is no need to reply. If you cannot legally buy or won firearms - absolutely do not contact me as I will not sell you one of my guns.I will not engage in back and forth emails or text. Example: ""what do you got ?""if you are interested and are a cash buyer ... simply reply via email and include your name and PHONE NUMBER ( and best time to call you ) and maybe a general idea of what you are looking to buy. Very likely I have it or something very similar. This is not a fire sale so please safe your time and don't expect me to sell you an exc condition HK-91 for $1100 or a S&W mdl 29-2 for $500.We can discuss things over the phone and I can text pics to your smart phone or email address of things you may be interested in buying after we talk.

I am a member of Marysville rifle club and that is a great local spot to meet at and do deals - inspect guns etc ...If I bring a gun to show you - i expect you to have cash to buy it or the deal is instantly over.

I ain't got time for that.Yea I am sure this ruffles some feathers ... if your skin is that thin, I wouldn't want to meet you anyway or sell you one of my firearms."

I bought this gun about 2 years ago and have used it occasionally, but now need to make room in my safe for new guns. The MP5 works fine, looks great, and has no cosmetic or functional issues. Also included with the gun are a number of upgrades/accessories, including:  2, 25 round stick mags (the gun whips with only 1 normally) - $30 value 1, 50 round drum mag (made by BDM exclusively for HKPARTS) - $80 value A new forend with integrated, pressure switch activated light - $70 value A fixed stock (the gun ships with only a collapsible stock normally, you get both) - $85 value Claw mount with picatinny rail - $15 value Micro red dot sight - $40 value  The gun alone sells new for $430 without any of those upgrades/accessories. All in, you would be paying $750 for this package new.  Since the package is a $750 value, I'd like $600 cash for everything or will consider partial trades as listed."

$900 firm in cash or higher in trade value.  No hurry to sell, just wanting to free up some cash to finish a couple projects and get some new tires in the next month or so.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

This is for all sellers and all buyers and for anybody who just browses Armslist in general. Read on if you hate this new Armslist Format put into place the start of 2016. Remember when Armslist used to allow users to use HTML in their listings a few years ago? then out of nowhere -slashed that out which can be understandable. I assume it was because of the flashy ads and that HTML takes up more space on their servers. i get it- I think? But this latest attempt is just horrible! Number one... It's darn right confusing to browse your account! what's worst is -trying to read the sellers' ads because there are no spaces and no paragraph breaks in the bodies! With this new format, I've tried every which way to manipulate my ads so other viewers can read it more clearly. If you are like me and like to run on a little about your ads then let's speak up and make our concerns loud to the Armslist Operations and/or Owners. Many sellers want to be complete when listing their ads and others just like to tell All In a few words. I really think this latest format is an attempt to reduce our ads to one liners and put a limit to our photos. Do you remember when Armslist allowed you to add a max of 6 photos for every listing? Now I can barely get 2 non-HD IPhone Photos Listed w/o an Armslist Error Msg! Popping up. Craigslist hasn't really changed a darn thing with their format in over a decade! It's not the best but it's user friendly. CL just doesn't hack away features like Armslist has done so many times in the short time they've existed. Well...the whole CL PRostitute/Escort SVc stuff doesn't count guys! Lol. Let's put together a group or a list of disgruntled Arms Listers and make our case known. In that maybe, they should ask our opinions first! And then decide whether to implement a 180.  Seriously, I thought this Website stood for Liberty and the right of freedom to do what we want with OUR 2nd Amendment? Correct? Then why would Armslist recklessly not ask its users about our thoughts on the changes? Why intentionally keep hacking away w/o consulting its users? Aren't these the features the very things that ""USED"" to make this sight Cool? If you want to be heard or want to poke at me its all good. My info is below.

$1,200 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.  
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal and the value is there, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now and am needing some tires in the next month or so.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.
Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or I can ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail."
