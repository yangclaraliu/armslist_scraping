This is one of the best he has seen for a rifle of this vintage. The scope is a Vector Marksman 3.5-10x44 with 30mm tube.  I generally have little interest in any military rifle that has been 'sporterized', but this is an exception.   The pictures show the detail and quality.  Contact me with any questions you may have."

Included with the stock is the Sage Detachable Cantilever Sight Base (DCSB) that provides an absolute rock steady solution for mounting a scope to the rifle. (The scope pictured is also included with the sale). The attached scope is a Nikon Monarch 3 4x-16x BDC reticle and has been sighted in at 100 yards.A few internal upgrades to the rifle were also added such as a Sadlak Op Rod Spring Guide and a SEI Muzzle Brake. The combination of the muzzle brake and the EBR stock produces almost no felt recoil and allows for very quick follow up shots.This rifle is very accurate, typically producing 1 MOA goups, and has been my favorite hog hunting rifle.
