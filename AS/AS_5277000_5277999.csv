The upper is made with high quality parts and wasn't homemade but produced on the same machines that make rifles for one of the most renound AR producers in the world.Here are the details and what's included: 1.) COMPLETE 10.5"" Upper Receiver with Flat Top & Railed Gas Block with Forward Assist, Dust Cover, Complete Bolt Carrier Group and Reliable M4 Style Feed Ramps, & Flash Hider & a New Smith & Wesson M+P Charging Handle. You can buy a nice compete lower reciever for about $125 or s complete AR Pistol Lower Reciever for just a little more from Palmetto State Armory who is based in South Carolina and ships very fast to us in Virginia or you can build your own even cheaper- just a thought. You can have a nice AR Pistol or SBR Setup for just over $500 and it'll be ready to go with all of the accessories you would have to spend another $150-$200+ on anyway but they're included so I think that's a great deal and I'd gladly take it. (I am selling only because I need to take care of a few things and would rather keep it but as they say- ""my loss is your gain"".2.) Included Reflex Sight that's only been mounted and never fired on a Firearm. It has both Red & Green Reticles to choose from- standard dot,  crosshairs, 65 MOA Circle with Center Dot, and Crosshairs with Circle in Middle & all are available in 5 Red/Green Brightness Settings perfect for any weather or shooting Conditions. Sure,  it's not a $500 Optic but I have known of several AR owners and even 12 Gauge Shotguns using them with no issues- that's what I based my decision to buy it on. 3.) Includes 4 Brand New Magpul PMAGS- 2 New 30rd Magazines, (1) New Magpul Gen 3 20rd Magazine Full of XM855 62 Grain Green Tip Penetrator Ammo, and (1) Magpul Gen 3 10 Round Magazine Full of 55 Grain FMJ Ammo4.) Also Includes new .223/5.56 Cleaning Kit to keep your New Upper Receiver Clean- it's already fully cleaned and lubricated and ready to take out for a lot of shooting. *****I'll sell or trade for a very fair deal.  Cash Price is $400 Firm because I paid more than that for just the bare uoper reciever and I have about $570+ in the whole setup after buying everything listed and paying the associated shipping/taxes, etc. but I'm not complaining,  just explaining that I think $400 is a nice deal considering the upper alone with no extras whatsoever cost more than that and it basically comes with everytHing you need to get started for less than the price i paid for the bare upper reciever.

The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, the 887 has no external surfaces to rust. Remington's exclusive ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that's barbed wire, gnarly thorns, or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it's time for action, the revolutionary SuperCell recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12-gauge feel like a light field load. Featuring a 28"" barrel with a solid rib and a Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable fiber-optic light tubes to maximize visibility for the conditions, the Model 887 Nitro Mag handles 12-gauge 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" loads interchangeably. Like the Model 870, the receiver of the 887 is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged, ensuring strength and longevity."

The new Walther Softcoil gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.How Walther Softcoil Technology Makes This Pistol a Must-HaveThe CCP's Softcoil gas-delayed blowback  system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case.CCP Features3-Dot Polymer Sights  Rapid aiming and target acquisition Rear sight screw adjustable for windage Low profile - wont snag clothing  Custom Accessory Rail  Picatinny rail Mounts optional flashlight or laser  Dynamic Trigger  5.5lb trigger pull Short .27"" trigger travel  Slide Serrations  Front and rear slide serrations Non-slip surface to operate the slide Distinctive Walther styling  Slide Stop Lever  Slide locks back on empty   Magazine Release  Conveniently positioned for thumb operation Ambidextrous for right or left hand operation  Ergonomic Walther Grip  Non-slip, cross-directional grip surface Better control Comfortable shape  Softcoil Technology  Gas-delayed blowback system Easy cocking slide  2 Safeties  Manual thumb safety Firing pin block for safe carry  Finish  Steel barrel housing  Stylish Stainless or Cerakote black    Specifications Model  5080300  UPC Code  REDACTED30  Operation  Gas Delayed Blowback  Caliber  9mm  Finish Color  Cerakote Black  Barrel Length  3.54""  Trigger Pull  Single Action 5.5 lbs  Trigger Travel  0.27""  Capacity  8 Rounds  Overall Length  6.41""  Height  5.12""  Width  1.18""  Weight (Magazine Empty)  22.33 oz"

Pistol has approximately 150-200 rounds through it and barrel shows minimal wear confirming this. Pistol has been drawn and holstered more than it has been shot due to practice from a kydex holster and due to such practice, it shows very slight wear on some corners. Pistol has been very well maintained, just does not get shot as much as my other competition or RMR'd pistols. Comes with case, all original documents and accessories, 2 mags and I can throw in an APEX flat trigger in original box for a great price. Also have a kydex LH holster for pistol (only works if pistol is equipped with Surefire X300U) I can throw into the deal. Email for addtional pictures, serious inquiries only and no low offers, as they will not get a response.
