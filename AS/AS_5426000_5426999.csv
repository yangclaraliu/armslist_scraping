For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****   The Colt O6891 Mustang Pocketlite Pistol in .380 ACP features a 2.75-inch barrel, stainless steel finish, electroless nickel alloy frame, black composite grips, front ramp sight, rear dovetailed sight, single action trigger, an overall length of 5.5 inches, an unloaded weight of 12.5 oz, and a 6 1 round capacity. The new Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite is small, lightweight and boasts enhanced durability, reliability and accuracy, making it an ideal handgun for personal protection. The precise machining process, use of high quality materials and improvements in design make Colt’s new .380 Mustang Pocketlite one of the most consistent and reliable firearms on the market. The aluminum alloy receiver, stainless steel slide and barrel are CNC machined from solid bar stock for precise tolerances. “Machining solid stock is certainly a more involved manufacturing process,” said Joyce Rubino, Vice President of Marketing, Colt’s Manufacturing Company, “But it is that process, combined with our engineering specifications, expertise and demand for perfection that allows Colt to deliver one of the highest quality products available to today’s marketplace.” With a loaded magazine, this handgun weighs less than one pound. It measures 5.5 inches long and has a 2.75-inch barrel. The minimal weight and length of the gun, combined with the short single action trigger, grip design, frame design and firing pin safety block, make this firearm ideal for personal protection. The magazine holds six rounds. Improvements in powder and bullet design have increased the velocity and terminal performance of .380 caliber ammunition, adding to the viability of the Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite for personal defense. “Accuracy and reliability was a top priority as we looked at what improvements could be made to make this classic backup even better,” said Rubino, “Though the changes may seem subtle to the untrained eye, every Colt employee takes great pride in knowing that their dedication has helped bring a vastly improved and enhanced firearm to market.” The new Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite descends from a famed line of pistols, including Colt’s Government Model, and improves upon the best that each had to offer.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $555.

Built to exacting standards like our Fast-Attach® suppressors for centerfire calibers, the Ryder 22-A features a patented aerospace aluminum body with rounded ends and flutes to reduce weight with no sacrifice in strength, and is coated with a tough Mil-Spec hard-anodized black finish that resists scratches, abrasion, and corrosion. At just over three ounces in weight and only 5.4 inches long, the compact Ryder 22-A minimizes effects on your weapon’s weight and maneuverability. The Ryder 22-A features patented pig-nose baffles that provide superior sound attenuation and reduce muzzle blast by precisely directing the gas emitted from each fired round. Built-in spacers between the baffles help to reduce carbon buildup and keep the suppressor clean longer. The indexed, individually numbered baffles are easy to remove, disassemble, clean, and reassemble, and are coated in tough Mil-Spec red hard anodizing that makes cleaning them easier and helps prevent gas and particle erosion. Ryder 22-A’s stainless steel back plate contributes to overall durability. Single-point cut ½ X 28 threads provide secure and easy attachment to an appropriately threaded .22 caliber barrel, with no tools required. Simply screw the suppressor on until hand tight; unscrew it to remove. The Ryder 22-A comes standard with an included assembly/disassembly tool for removing the baffle stack and reassembling it after cleaning and a spud-extension tool that aids in pushing the baffle stack out of the body tube. Just like SureFire Fast-Attach suppressors, Ryder Series suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, helping to conceal an operator’s position and protect both the operator and any team members from permanent and temporary hearing loss while enhancing situational awareness and communication; they reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, helping to conceal an operator’s position and preserve night vision and unobstructed view; they reduce dust signature, again helping to conceal an operator’s position; and they reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots.Visit our ONLINE STORECalibersUSA.com"

186,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5426186,For Sale:  NEW Surefire | Socom 556 Mini Silencer FDE | SOCOM556-MINI-DE,"ONLINE, Albuquerque, New Mexico","$ 1,170","Listed On: Sunday, August 14, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"NEW Surefire | Socom 556 Mini Silencer FDE | SOCOM556-MINI-DECLICK HERE TO BUY NOWCheap Shipping Cost Flat Dark Earth, FDE The SOCOM556-MINI Fast-Attach® suppressor is shorter, lighter version of SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, which was selected by US Special Operations Command as first among all competitors in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor evaluation in history, covering all aspects of suppressor performance, and which also received the USSOCOM official safety verification in support of fielding. With an overall length of just 5 inches, the SOCOM556-MINI is 1.2 inches shorter and 2.5 ounces lighter than the SOCOM556-RC. It features advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. SureFire’s patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a true technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree. A new indexing system means it mounts to a SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous models and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area. Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-MINI produces minimal, consistent shift in point of impact compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles. The SOCOM556-MINI is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color. All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm—see Parts and Accessories on this page. SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use. All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots. NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brake/suppressor adapters, and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous generation SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders.   Features  Patented Fast-Attach® design provides rock-solid attachment and easy removal in seconds Same revolutionary suppressor technology as SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, winner of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) extensive and rigorous suppressor trials Provides effective attenuation of sound and dust signatures Minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon regardless of number of attach-detach cycles Compact and lightweight for minimum overall weapon length and minimum impact on handling characteristics Advanced core design to reduce back pressure, cyclic rate, and gas blowback Patent-pending front-plate design and proprietary gas-flow improvements virtually eliminate first-round flash Integrated blast shield increases durability Constructed of advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and stainless steel Redundant-welded subcomponents eliminate parts loosening Tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond and Cerakote™ finish in Black or Dark Earth color   Note: All NFA Rules apply.

ValueMyStuff has appraised this rifle at 900-1100 dollars, citing it as an all correct late war parts rifle, and a nice example of a late war K98.
A bayonet is included with the rifle.

No, not all numbers match (Only receiver and both barrel bands). This is entirely normal for late war rifles. Towards the end of the war, Germans were repairing their rifles with any parts they could. You're more likely to win the lottery than find a late war K98 with waffenamts, no capture or import mark, no defacing of the waffenamts, and in good shape.
No, it is also not a Russian capture.

All Illinois laws will be followed."

They are both M91/30s. The one with the original stock is a Tula armory russian with what lookst to be matching serials with everything but the bayonette. It had some flaws in the bluing so I had it stripped and had black duracoat put on it to protect the metal. I realize these things aren't super collectible so I preferred a way to preserve it. It has all the tools, the ammo pouches, bayonette, strap, oil can, etc... I also bought the bore laser sight for it as well as stripper clips to help with faster loading of the ammo. The second gun I got on trade. It is another M91/30 but I don't remember the manufacture location. The previous owner stripped the bluing off of it in preference of a more stainless steel look and put it on an Archangel stock. It looks nice and still shoots well. I also have the bottom section of the original stock if you want to take it out of the archangel stock and maybe make it a sporterized mosin. The parts are still there to do it, I just forgot to include the stock in the photo and can provide a picture of it if needed.The ammo comes with the box and is as follows:



280 rds. (that's 14, 20rd bags.) of the russian surplus FMJ steel core ammo
12 rds. of silver tip russian surplus ammo
6 rds. of FMJ non-corrosive ammo
20 rds. of Tulammo non-corrosive ammo
Total of 318 rounds of ammo. Even if I sold the ammo by itself it would be worth around $125 alone. I would like to sell this as a lot but will break it up, just realize if it goes as a lot it will be cheaper. I would consider trades for a *good* 308 rifle, I can add cash to make up the difference for something like a mossberg MVP, Remington 700, etc.. I'm not wanting a hard core sniper rifle, just a good rifle in the .308 (7.62x51). I recognize optics plays a big part in price so a Mossberg Patriot or similar with a good scope would also be considered."

I would recommend this as a pack rifle due to its relatively low weight and durability, in a caliber that still packs a punch. Mount a sling, a quality set of iron sights (and/or a red dot), and you have a handy, rugged, multi-use outdoorsman's carbine. The rifle comes with one 30 round magazine. Additional pictures are available upon request.Trades not necessarily considered at this time, but feel free to make an offer. I'd prefer a face to face exchange. Buyer must have a Texas ID (preferably a CHL), and be willing to sign a bill of sale. I can travel as far south as Decatur, but that is negotiable.Specs from the manufacturer:Carbon fiber receivers will dissipate heat faster than aluminum have no surface finish to wear off and the carbon fiber composite has an inherent lubricity that enhances long wear. Windham Weaponry’s receiver molds were created at a state of the art design facility to yield a superior fit and function while utilizing many standard AR parts.
These Carbon Fiber Receivers retain all the recognizeable features of the AR platform but are molded with a unique “billet machined” appearance.

1944 Mosin 91/30 PU Sniper from the Izhevsk arsenal. 
The 91/30 PU sniper rifle is an upgrade of the standard Model 91/30 rifle. The functional and robust bolt and magazine remained essentially unchanged except for the bent bolt which allowed it to clear the scope so a round could be easily chambered. The sniper rifles were highly respected for being very rugged, reliable, accurate, and easy to maintain.
The 91/30 PU's were generally built to more exacting standards than their standard issue counterparts. The standard M91/30's were thought to have been fired and the best of the lot were selected to become sniper rifles. Once selected the triggers were reworked and the finish on the later PU snipers were better than the standard infantry rifles.
This rifle is in wartime stock, has an original 1944 scope and mount. Been refurbished, as most have, and the numbers on the magazine is lined out (forced matched), looks to been done at the refurbishing arsenal (Russian letters with numbers). Optics are very clear. Fun and accurate to shoot.

It can shoot a 270 gr .375 at 3250 fps. Very acurate and flat shooting rifle. The brass needs to be fire formed to expand the H&H case to allow over 100 grains of powder. The smith made custom dies and produced a moa load, getting sub moa is hard with the large caliber bullet but I have hit one hole groups before. I have all the paperwork from the smith. For right handers, the left handed version is nice because you can work the bolt while never leaving the trigger and changing grip, I use this method when running right handed bolt rifles. The action sits in a pilar beded stock, the muzzle brake was custom from the smith and helps reduce recoil a lot. I placed a 308 next to the bullet for comparison. Below is a list of what is included and I will not seperate.- Browning A bolt left handed stainless steel 375 H&H improved- Scope rings- About 3 lbs of reloader 19- 100 270 gr bullets- aboout 100 fire formed brass- a lot of H&H brass- Custom dies- about 20 loaded roundsI am entertaining cash offers, please consider what is included and how much is invested.

It does come with the ORIGINAL MANNLICHER 3-9x40 scope with a plex reticle and pure clear glass.  This rifle shoots extremely well, prefers top flite ammunition such as Federal Premium, Hornady GMX, or Sako Hammerhead.  Does not do well with Winchester ammunition of any type--do not know why that is but it just doesn't like Winchester ammo.  Does fine with premium Remington ammunition including the classic core-lokt bullets.  Does not seem to care whether it is 130,140, or 150 grain bullets--shoots all of them well.  Has a good recoil pad, and is heavy enough to help absorb standard 270 win recoil.  Also,will shoot both Remington and Hornady reduced recoil ammuntion very accurately, out to factor specified 200 yards without difficulty.  With a tripod rest, can easily be used by women and younger shooters when using the reduced recoil ammunition.  An excellent rifle with outstanding features and high quality throughout.  You will not see this kind of rifle again except at astronomical prices."
