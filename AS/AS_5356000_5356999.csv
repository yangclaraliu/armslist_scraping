All deals will happen in Mason unless I approach you, all buyers must present state issued photo ID at time of sale, all local and federal laws apply, fellow CCW holders take priority, trade value will be based upon full retail of my firearm and your in order to keep this fair for both parties, and cash only for those wanting to purchase in which my price is 100% firm and fair. If interested please respond to ad and I will e-mail you ASAP or text only at 513-630-6551. Thanks for looking"

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

It is 4.25” tall and about 5.4” long with a 2.75” barrel. The frame is aluminum and the slide, barrel and internals are steel. Taurus lists it as weighing 12.3 ounces, but mine weighed 13.5 ounces on my scale. The magazine holds nine rounds. With another round in the chamber, that’s an even 10. That’s a lot of ammo for such a small pistol. Fully loaded,  the gun weighed 15.3 ounces on my scale. It’s a little heavy for its size, but this helps to minimize recoil. Taurus offers the PT-22 and PT-25 pistols in a variety of finishes to suit just about any taste, including nickel, stainless steel, blue, gold accents and Rosewood or polymer grips. They also have a new polymer-framed gun with a slightly shorter barrel that weighs some two ounces less than the other models. They are priced very reasonably, with a manufacturer’s suggested price around $300 give or take, depending on the model.My PT-25 had a price tag of $240 at the local gun store. My slide and barrel have a dull blued finish with slightly polished flats. The frame is black with gold-colored trigger, thumb safety, tip-up barrel lever, magazine release and grip screws, and the grips are rosewood. I prefer the stainless or nickel-plated version for their corrosion resistance, but this was the only one in stock at the dealer at the time, so I didn’t complain too loudly and pretended that the gold accents might add a little class to my otherwise classless existence. Okay, maybe not. The pistol is blowback-operated and lacks an extractor, relying on recoil force to push the spent case out of the chamber to interact with the ejector mounted in the frame as the slide moves rearward. It has a thumb safety on the left side. The black sights are small, but adequate. It has a magazine disconnector and will not fire with the magazine removed. In fact, the magazine must be inserted in order to rack the slide. The grip is rather wide and measures 1.25” at its widest point. I like this because it fills my hand. The gun is hammer-fired and the trigger is double-action only. The trigger pull is a little heavy with slight stacking but is very smooth throughout the entire pull. It is capable of double-strike in the event of a misfire. The PT-25 (and PT-22) has a tip-up barrel for easy loading and unloading of a round in the chamber. The barrel is released via a lever on the left side. You can also load the chamber the old fashioned way by racking the slide. However, I was surprised by how much strength it took to rack the slide manually. It takes He-Man-level effort and a hell of a grip, because the slide is small and there isn’t much to grab ahold of. Don’t bother with this method. The tip-up barrel is a godsend and makes loading very easy. Use it.This model has the Taurus Security System, which locks the action, so the gun will not function. It is engaged with a key that is inserted in the lock in the backstrap and must be rotated 180 ̊ to lock or unlock the mechanism. Two keys are provided. While some folks disparage the locks that are included on many modern firearms these days, I like them. They are an additional safety mechanism to prevent them from being used by unauthorized personnel. For the people that don’t like it? Ignore it. It doesn’t interfere with the gun’s operation when disengaged. The .25 ACP cartridge was created by none other than the legendary John Browning in 1905. Yup, it’s been around for more than a century. Its diminutive size allows it to be chambered in tiny pistols that easily fit a pocket or purse. Being centerfire, it isn’t prone to the misfires that plague rimfires. One funny thing about this round is that the base is so small and the small pistol primer is so large (relatively) that you need a magnifying glass to read the caliber and manufacturer stamp. The .25 ACP is a semi-rimmed cartridge the same as the .32 ACP and .38 ACP (not to be confused with the rimless .380 ACP), all designed by Mr. Browning. The purpose was to have the cartridge headspace on the semi rim. The usual load for the .25 ACP is a 50 grain FMJ bullet that runs about 760 fps from a 2” barrel. Winchester also loads a 45 grain JHP to 815 fps, and Hornady offers a 35 grain XTP bullet at 900 fps. Muzzle energy values run in the range of 60-70 ft-lbs. The only .25 ACP ammunition I could find online or at the local gun stores at the time was a PPU (Prvi Partizan) and Aguila 50 grain FMJ. Yes, the ammo shortage affects even these little guys. I fired 170 rounds of this mixture. I experienced three failures to completely eject during the first 70 rounds, two during the slow-fired 10-shot group accuracy test and one while shooting one-handed. They were easily cleared. I attributed these malfunctions to limp-wristing and general break-in. There were no malfunctions in the last 100 rounds fired.Ejection was upward with a tendency to be tthe right, with some brass going forward and behind me. The pistol is quite accurate for its short sight radius, and produced a 2.25” 10-shot group fired offhand with PPU ammunition at seven yards in spite of my poor vision. The double-action trigger isn’t the best for precise target shooting, but this is not a target gun, and as you can tell from the 10-shot group, it does not hinder the gun’s potential to shoot straight. Ten shots of the PPU ammunition over a Shooting Chrony chronograph at about 10 feet averaged 736 fps (this ammunition has an advertised velocity of 771 fps from a 2” barrel). The PT-25 points naturally, so I could almost ignore the sights for close targets – just point it at the target and start pulling the trigger. Was it fun to shoot? Yes! This gun is just like its .22 caliber brother: little recoil but serious fun. Would this be a good carry gun for self defense? Most people scoff at the idea of using a .25 (or .22) as a carry gun. The .CP is not a real man-stopper. It is simply a cartridge of convenience because of its small size. Its advantage is that the gun can be really small, and in the case of the Taurus, it enables high capacity. Ten rounds is, well, 10 rounds, and a larger caliber would result in less rounds or a larger gun. By the way, the PT-22 holds one round less because its magazine only holds eight rounds, so to get the most ammo, go with the PT-25. For comparison, one of my current carry guns is a Taurus PT 738 .380 Automatic. It is about the same size as the PT-25 but holds less ammo with a capacity of 6+1. The .380 is a much more powerful round, but the PT 738 will run out of ammo faster. It’s always a tradeoff between power and capacity. More power means more recoil and less ammo in the same size gun. Even if you don’t consider the PT-25 as a good choice for a primary carry gun, it could serve as a backup gun. Having 10 shots for backup is not a bad thing, and the Taurus‘ small size is easy to carry. It also makes a nice kit gun. The downside to the PT-25 is the cost of ammunition. Round for round, .25 ACP costs about the same as 9mm Luger ammunition. If you’re getting one just for fun, consider the PT-22 to save money on ammunition. If you might use it for a defensive gun, the surefire reliability of centerfire .25 ACP is worth the extra cost for ammunition. Or get both! Beretta makes similar pistols in .22 long rifle and .25 ACP, the Bobcat. It has less magazine capacity at seven rounds plus one in the chamber for a total of eight rounds. They also have a .32 ACP version, the Tomcat, with the same 7 + 1 capacity. One significant design difference is that the Berettas are single/double action while the Taurus is double action only. The Berettas’ suggested retail price is around $400.These small Taurus pistols rank high on the fun scale. Whether it’s a .22 or a .25, they’re guaranteed to make you smile."

After briefly experimenting with the M9 and other 9x19mm pistols, most American special operations organizations returned to the .45 ACP. Marine Corps special operations capable expeditionary units continue to use modified M1911A1 pistols, designating them MEU-SOC (Marine Corps Expeditionary Unit - Special Operations Capable) Pistols. Then there is Heckler & Koch’s .45 ACP Mk 23 SOCOM handgun, designed specifically for special operations use. Most recently, the 9x19mm has proven to be less than satisfactory in combat in Afghanistan, where there has reportedly been a clamor for resurrecting M1911A1s or at least a .45 ACP handgun that is an effective “people stopper.” When one thinks of a .45 ACP pistol, the venerable M1911/M1911A1 usually comes to mind. It remains a viable handgun for military, law enforcement or personal defense use. In its “commander”-size, the pistol is more adaptable to concealed carry. One problem with most standard M1911 type pistols, whatever their size, is the fact that they are not fully reliable with all types of ammunition, especially some jacketed hollow point (JHP) cartridges. The price of entry for a quality M1911 is typically quite high - usually over $1,000 for a pistol with a crisp trigger, reliable feeding and enhanced accuracy. There is, however, a very reasonably priced alternative to an expensive custom “commander”-sized M1911 - the Taurus PT945. Taurus pistols are made in Brazil on computer numerical controlled (CNC) machinery and thus maintain a high degree of consistent tolerances and quality of manufacture. Lest the reader mistakenly believe that Brazilian manufacture is somehow of lesser quality than “Made-in-USA” firearms, the fact is that several “name” manufacturers of high quality firearms import their components from Brazil and assemble them here. The PT-945 combines the best from Taurus’ 9mm PT-92 series, along with some desirable features from the M1911. The combination is a Commander-sized “single stack” .45 ACP pistol that is worth a look by anyone desiring a reliable, high quality .45 ACP pistol. A comparison between the PT945 and Commander reveals that the two are virtually identical in every dimension. The silhouettes of the two pistols are likewise almost the same. The PT945 mimics the Commander in almost every tactile aspect. Controls are placed similarly to the M1911, but improved in size and shape. The PT-945’s frame is alloy, with a double-action/single-action fire control mechanism. The frame-mounted safety lever has three positions. “Up” is safe and the pistol can be carried “cocked and locked” in Condition One. The middle position is “fire.” Pressing the lever fully down safely drops the hammer. I personally use a matte stainless PT945 for IDPA and concealed carry, and unlike many factory M1911A1 pistols, it reliably feeds every type of ammunition I have ever run through it, including semiwadcutter, which rarely will feed reliably through a stock M1911A1, except very expensive custom pistols that come from the factory “ramped and throated.” The Taurus’ trigger pull in the double-action mode is long, but smooth, and at an average of 9.5 to 10.5 pounds in the pistols tested, not overly heavy. Despite this, when one fires the first shot in double-action and then must switch to single action, the trigger’s position and pull weight are changed, and the firing grip must be altered somewhat, affecting accuracy and speed of the following shot. For this reason, I carry my PT945 just as I carry a M1911A1 - Condition One, “cocked and locked.” The manual of arms in this mode is identical to that of the M1911A1, so there are no changes. The PT945’s single-action trigger is two-stage with a crisp “break,” no discernable creep and a small amount of overtravel. Single-action trigger pull of the PT945s tested for this article averaged 4.5 to 5.5 pounds, which is pretty close to ideal for a combat handgun. As to overall “feel,” the Taurus engineers mimicked that of the M1911A1 to the greatest extent possible. The PT945 grip-to-frame angle is identical to the M1911A1, but there is no grip safety. Both the front and back grip straps are serrated along their entire length for enhanced grip. The PT945’s butt is rounded, which makes it less likely to “print” when being carried concealed. The magazine-well is beveled to facilitate reloading. Controls such as safety, slide release and magazine release are positioned in essentially the same location as those of the M1911A1. The safety is ambidextrous, but doesn’t “bite” the knuckle of the trigger finger like some M1911 ambidextrous safeties. Again, if one is familiar with the M1911, there is nothing new to learn. The M1911 shooter can pick up a Taurus PT945 and head to the range knowing that the manual of arms for his new pistol is identical to his old favorite. The PT945 sits relatively low in the hand, and points in an almost identical manner as any M1911A1 variant. The PT945’s backstrap contour is slightly different than the M1911 or M1911A1, but this did not affect accuracy or the pistol’s natural pointing capabilities. The PT945 slide is steel and has no barrel bushing. The extractor also serves as a loaded chamber indicator; when a round is chambered, it protrudes slightly revealing a small red notch and stands just above the slide’s surface to provide a tactile indication. This doesn’t eliminate the need to physically clear the pistol in accordance with good gun-handling practice, but it does provide an instant indication. Sights are combat-type with a square-notch rear sight with small white dots and a blade-type front sight with a larger single white dot. Trijicon(tm) tritium sights are available as an option. The PT945 is unique in the variety of finishes available. Many pistol makers offer various finishes, but Taurus’ variety exceeds that of any other manufacturer. PT945s are available from “plain vanilla” blue with rubber grips to “fancy” in either blue or polished stainless with gold-plated controls and rosewood or mother of pearl grips. While some may denigrate fancy grips and gold plating, we should recall that no less an American hero than George S. Patton, Jr. carried fancy pistols, as have many other very serious and deadly handgunners. My personal carry/IDPA PT945 is stainless with hard rubber grips.  Besides the special finishes, which are esthetic enhancements, Taurus also offers functional options, one being barrel porting. This option reduces felt recoil and muzzle flip, but if one plans to use their PT945 in IDPA competition, it must be noted that ported barrels are forbidden. Also, I find cleaning the inside of the ported barrel PT945’s slide is a real chore.  The PT945’s method of operation is the Browning short recoil system with the barrel’s locking block engaging the ejection port. This system improves the basic Browning system by reducing the number of engagement surfaces. The very large ejection port extends halfway down the right side of the slide and wraps over the top left of the slide. There is no barrel link, but a cam lug similar to that of the Browning M1935 on the bottom of the barrel forces it into and out of battery. The slide locks to the rear after the final shot and the magazines drop free when the release if pressed. I stated earlier that the PT945 is more reliable “out-of-the-box” than any standard grade M1911A1 I have experienced. As mentioned, I have been unable to find a .45 ACP cartridge that would not cycle through any of the PT945s tested for this article. This is attributable to the polished feed ramp that is actually machined into the barrel. When the barrel moves slightly to the rear and drops down after the spent case is ejected, the ramp is positioned into a notch in the frame. At the same time, the magazine positions the next cartridge high on the feed ramp, almost in a direct line with the chamber. This is a decided improvement over the M1911A1, in which the round first hits the feed ramp in the frame, and then bounces up into the chamber. The next M1911 critical point is the chamber throat, which also should be polished to ensure reliable feeding. After the cartridge bounces off the frame’s feed ramp, it caroms up into chamber throat, where the nose impacts it at an angle. If the throat is unpolished, the cartridge may again come to a full stop, causing a severe stoppage. Most high quality 1911-type handguns today have taken steps to eliminate this problem, but the potential is still there, and the author has experienced it in several current standard-grade production pistols I found the PT945 to point naturally and to be easy to control, even with +P ammunition. At an overall average of 2.9 inches at 15 yards, accuracy for the eight pistols tested was about what one would expect from a stock .45 ACP pistol. Since the test results for all pistols would create a very busy chart, I have reduced the accuracy to averages for each type of ammunition fired. Accuracy results can be found at Table 1. Aside from the variety of pistols available, Taurus has two additional features that they pioneered. One is the Taurus Security System(tm). Taurus’ system is integral to the pistol and requires no external locks, cables or other equipment, except a key. The second unique Taurus feature is the company’s Unlimited Lifetime Repair Policy(tm). If a Taurus pistol ever breaks for any reason due to a manufacturing defect, the company will repair it at no cost. This warranty is transferable from one owner to another without registration, but does not include sights, accessories, cosmetic defects after one year, or damage caused by customer abuse, such as high-pressure reloads. The sole complaint I have regarding the PT945, or for that matter, any Taurus pistol is that there is only a single magazine included in the purchase price. I believe that any pistol that might be used for self-defense should be provided with at least one spare magazine.  PT945 takedown is actually simpler than a M1911 type pistol. Clear the pistol and remove the magazine. Move the slide forward into battery. Press in on the locking button on the right side of the slide and rotate the takedown lever clockwise. (The takedown lever will not rotate with the slide to the rear.) It will automatically lock into the down (disengaged) position and the slide will move slightly forward on the frame. The slide can then be removed from the frame by pulling it forward. Lay the slide upside down on a table or bench. Press forward on the full-length recoil spring guide rod and separate it upwards and to the rear from the slide assembly. Lift the barrel out of the slide. This completes field stripping and no further disassembly is necessary or recommended. Reassembly is generally the reverse of disassembly, except when the slide is mated to the frame, the takedown lever will automatically snap back into the locked position. Move the slide back and forth a few times to confirm that the slide is locked to the frame. To sum up, Taurus’ PT945 offers a lot for the price. Suggested retail runs from $560 to $655, depending on options. The PT945 offers a reliable, quality pistol for competition or self defense at a very competitive price. If there is any downside to the PT945 or any other Taurus pistol, it is the lack of carry gear for it. Holsters intended for other pistols can be used with Taurus products, but they generally do not fit well, and few manufacturers offer custom-made holsters for Taurus pistols. This is about to change, however. A small specialist company, Ready Tactical Products of Decatur, Alabama has begun manufacture of holsters and magazine carriers for all Taurus pistols. The holsters are made of high grade Kydex and are of extremely high quality, but are priced very competitively. All Ready Tactical holsters are adjustable for tension. In addition, Ready Tactical offers its very innovative “Claw”® magazine carriers that positively retain magazines without the use of snaps or flaps."
