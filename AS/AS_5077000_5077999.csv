I have also already machined the auto sear catch out of the bolt carrier. The fcg is removed from the housing and ready to be clipped and pinned. The kit also comes with 8 20rnd. G3 mags and the g3 cleaning kit. Can email more pics upon request. Will ship if needed."

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal. Trades considered:  I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns. Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-ups.  Would also like more Pmags for both. Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54. 1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer. Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

$900 firm in cash or higher in trade value.  No hurry to sell, just wanting to free up some cash to finish some projects.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any ammo deal will need to be good.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250’s innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes – there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world’s only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the “To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability” you’ve come to expect from Sig Sauer."

I would like to sell, but more importantly trade for good quality 9mm hollow point defensive ammo. I recently sold the carbine I bought this ammo for and don't want to run it in my ""BABY"" lol, my 1911, it would handle them fine but just don't see the need to wear out my recoil spring and I just bought a nine mil compact for my EDC which will handle +P's fine so will take those in tade and if you have some 124 grn +P golden sabres in 9mm I will trade even up. If you don't have ammo to trade I will take $15 a box or $55 for 100 rounds, these sell for about $30 a box in most stores and even more in some so the price is very good. Again I need good defense ammo for the new nine when it gets here in a couple days. This is hot ammo, 1140 fps out of a 5"" barrel and if you have a carbine of 16"" to 18"" barrel your looking at around 1500fps which is hot stuff!!!! Guys, please don't contact me and ask if I still have it, the ad will be gone withing minutes of the mrchandise being gone, and if some goes I will update the available amount left!!!"

$500 firm in cash for the pistol and mags only or $540 firm with the DeSantis rig, this rig will also work with other small pistols.  Higher in trade value as I am really wanting the cash right now.
Might look at trades as long as it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers 9mm to help complete a deal, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY, but will consider an all ammo trade if it's really good.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland area.  Thanks for looking!"

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with rosewood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish. This particular piece of machinery started as a base Nitron model and had TruGlo front and rear sights installed. There are signs of wear from being used as a carry weapon. This weapon has not been fired since the tritium sights were added and may require windage adjustment. Anyone who has dealt with these small Sigs will tell you that they are amazing.

She is also the straightest shooting gun I have ever owned. If there is one gun I would pick for a survival gun it would be this .22 Hornet/20 gauge.

The gun is in a safe 45 miles from here since there is no real place in Springfield I would have legal fun shooting it so I am asking for absolute serious replies only. $600 is for the gun and 85-100 rounds of .22 Hornet rounds. If you don't want the rounds I'll sell the gun by its self for $550. Don't offer less, I would rather keep it than lower my standards.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10. Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54. 1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer. Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal. Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or I can ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

A few things I would not mind having more of right now would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Last one I picked-up was the PX4 model new for $600 and came with five mags.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it, let me know if it has extra mags, the capacity, if it has an upgraded trigger etc.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails. Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54. 1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

This is a bit older Marlin, I believe early to mid 1980's judging by the marlinowners code system, it would make it a 1985. The rifle is in great shape, the blueing on the barrel and magazine tube is strong and not worn. There is no rust on this rifle anywhere, inside or out. The reciever shows some heavier wear toward the back where the finish has worn off a bit. The magazine tube catch is also a tad bit bent making the magazing tube release a bit hard to get out, but it could be straighted out with a steel dowel of the same diameter and fix the issue. The stock has a few small blemsishes in it. Overall still a nice highly accurate rifle. Open sights I was able to hit soda cans at 100 yards, and I'm not a great shot. Good accurate rifle, with no bending in the barrel. The rifle will come with the Gamo 4x32 scope and 100 rounds of Federal High Velocity 40gr American Eagle rounds.

Technically it is designed around the Gen3 frame, but I've used it on my Gen4 pistols with zero problems. I've never had the issues described in the reviews on this link. Maybe this one is just better than the average, but either way, this conversion unit is up to TacSol's reputation! It comes with one 15-round magazine. (Set worth $350) I bought THREE more TacSol 15-rd magazines. For the front sight I wanted fiber optic so I bought a Hi-Viz sight, which will also include the pipe installation tool and the other two color pipes (green and white). (Extras worth $100) I will also include a full 525-round box of Federal Champion copper-plated high-velocity 22lr ammo and a light box which has about 350-400, for a total of about 900 rounds. (Ammo worth $75) I'll go $325 for the whole set. Ammo isn't available separately!! I am willing to ship on your dime. I'm not really negotiable since I'd rather just keep it. But I got a little exuberant on eBay and my wife says I need to sell something. Obviously, the Glock frame is not included.  For more photos go to my other listing: https://www.northwestfirearms.com/threads/tactical-solutions-tsg-22-glock-conversion-3-mags-22-ammo.212754/"

It features front, side, and rear ballistic resistant panels that offer NIJ rated Level IIIA standards that have been tested by HP White. The ballistic material is constructed from UHMWPE fiber which possesses outstanding performance in high strength. UHMWPE fiber has better energy absorption and damping capacity than Kevlar fiber.  Manufactured through gel-spinning this makes it subsequently unchained from previously intertwined and random large molecules. The result of such effort is a fiber with superior performance, lighter than competitor’s fiber, flexible, high strength, and high modulus, ultraviolet-proof, shock-resistant, acid-proof and resistant to seawater corrosion.Our Undercover Concealable vests offer clean design which allows the user too freely and easily maneuver. Waste straps are elastic and feature hook and loop fasteners to achieve the proper fit.  The ballistic chips are removable so you can wash the outer carrier. We designed this vest to look like a T-Shirt under other clothing and are available in M, L, XL and XXL sizes."

It features front, side, and rear ballistic resistant panels that offers NIJ compliant Level IIIA standards that have been tested by HP White. The ballistic material is constructed from UHMWPE fiber which possesses outstanding performance in high strength. UHMWPE fiber has better energy absorption and damping capacity than Kevlar fiber.  Manufactured through gel-spinning this makes it subsequently unchained from previously intertwined and random large molecules. The result of such effort is a fiber with superior performance, lighter than competitor’s fiber, flexible, high strength, and high modulus, ultraviolet-proof, shock-resistant, acid-proof and resistant to seawater corrosion. Our Sentinel vests offer clean design which allows the user too freely and easily maneuver. Waste straps have Level IIA protection which gives you more side protection than any other vest on the market today. We also feature hook and loop fasteners on the top and sides to achieve the proper fit.  The ballistic chips are removable so you can wash the outer carrier. This vest was designed to also accept 10” X 12” Level III or IV plates in the front or rear pockets. To give you a higher level of protection. Our Bulletproof vests are available in M, L, XL and XXL sizes."
