This is the full size .40. For those who are curious the difference between the FNX 40 and FNS 40 is the FNX is hammer fired, where the FNS is striker fired. The FNX has a hammer, with a decocker and safety. Included in the sale is what you see in the pictures. The FNX 40, three 14rnd magazines, factory handgun case and original manufacturers documentation, the adjustable grips, the bore snake. This gun is very easy to shoot because of its larger frame. There are no scratches/dents/or dings on the slide or the frame. There are no marks or scuffs on the gun from a holster or carrying. The gun has been gently used, maybe 400 rounds throught it, as it has sat more than I shot it. I am selling because I prefer my 9mm. This was my only .40, so I would also be willing to sell all my .40 Winchester target ammo. I have 6 boxes or 300 rounds. I'd see for $15/box. I have a valid IN drivers license and LTC, to purchase this weapon, you will need these too. I will also expect completion of bill of sale, for my personal documentation of sale.

Fully ambidextrous safety, slide release and magazine release makes this a very versatile concealed carry gun.  This particular gun is in great overall condition light marks on the sides of the frame. I bought this used and have put about 300 rounds through this gun. It is extremely accurate and makes a solid and reliable concealed carry gun or collector's item. It's double action only and the trigger pull is firm but smooth throughout the action. Doesn't beat up the web of your hand like a Walther PPK and is actually fun to shoot at the range. Comes with original box, original paperwork, cleaning brushes and 2 10 round magazines whcih are also hard to find. The only reason I'm selling this is because I also have another one in the palladium finish and have too many other guns on my wish list to keep both.
