The M45A1—a .45 ACP, forged stainless steel 1911—was brought to USMC specs, including a non-reflective, battle-ready finish and drop-in parts interchangeability.The M45A1 CQBP is manufactured from forged stainless steel just like the Colt Rail Gun. The receiver, slide, slide stop and barrel go through a forging process to make the steel stronger and tougher as well as to hold tolerances more closely. The barrel is match grade. The finishing spec specified dull, non-reflective surfaces and use of standard military colors, so the M45A1 wears a desert tan Cerakote finish over markings that clearly indicate the end user. “Colt USMC” is roll-stamped on the left side of the slide; on the right is “Colt Government Model.” The pistol also wears a unique identification (UID) label on the receiver. Similar to a barcode, the UID is basically a serial number that comprises a 2-D matrix symbol containing data that can be deciphered by a reader. Since 2005, all DoD equipment wear UIDs. Colt chose the rail gun as a basis for the M45A1 since one of the requisites called for an accessory rail that met Mil-Std-1913 specifications to mount accessories. The rail needed to be a true Picatinny rail—not a lookalike—which has more actual surface area for an accessory to grasp onto than, say, a weaver style rail. That extra surface area makes the mountings more reliable in extreme environments.The M45A1’s grooved, long, solid trigger and the flat mainspring housing are similar to those of original-issue 1911s. World War II–era 1911A1s changed the setup with a short trigger and arched mainspring housing in an effort to help GIs shoot higher. Shooting styles have changed over the years but have come full circle with the M45A1. The trigger is spec’d out to 5 pounds and measures 5.3 pounds on average. A trigger with a pull of that weight is fine considering this pistol’s intended purpose. The M45A1 does utilize the Series 80 trigger system, which has an internal firing-pin safety that is actuated via the trigger. (That firing-pin safety was a requirement for the M45 replacement.)"

It was running well when I put it into garage storage around 3 years ago, but after getting it back out I haven't been able to get it to reliably run. One mechanic said it was the fuel pump and fixing that did get it to start/run for a while, but only a little while, and when it did the exhaust smelled rich. Unfortunately I'm not technically inclined, and my ability to play ""hunt the gremlins"" financially isn't there. The body is in good shape overall - it does have a dent in the right side rear door where someone backed into it (see photos). The interior smells musty and there is an above average amount of wear/tear around the edges, but the seats themselves are in good condition. The frame is solid - only superficial oxidation. The electronics work other than the power windows, which will sometimes work if you play with the center console. The mileage is 102,000.As described, the car has issues. I'm sure it has more than I've listed here, but the current issues have stopped me from digging further. I'm listing is at a price where it could be parted out (wheels/rims/trim/panels) and you'd still make a good profit, or use it as a project RR to get it back to daily-driver status.So, I'd sell outright for $2,385, or I'm looking for the following two pistols, new, which if you have and/or can get you'd get a great deal on the Range Rover.1) A Glock 19 G42) A Beretta 92FS/M9 Compact(Retail value on both guns is somewhere in the $1,300 range, and I do have a CHP and/or can do the sale at an FFL if you prefer.)Email through here, or 355-7038 (336 area code)."

Featuring the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry. From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension™ magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal. Like all XD®s, the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone™ ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry.Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays exact shipping or sales tax.Buy this gun online at www.copsgunshop.net."
