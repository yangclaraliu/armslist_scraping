These are among the most accurate AR-15s available. I bought it a while back with the intention of hand loading for it to make a one hole accurate gun. But, my hand loading time has been spent making 270wsm for nuisance deer hunting, so this has been gathering dust. I've fired a couple boxes of cheap ammo through it when I was sighting in a scope on it and doing some plinking that day. The man I bought it from told me he had done the same. I'm selling stuff to fund a thermal scope to help with the nuisance deer work, so here's your chance to have a rare upper. These have been showing as out of stock on bushmaster.com for a long time and I've only found one for $810 at a dealer. It's all factory built, so has the aluminum free-floating forearm, heavy profile fluted barrel under the forearm, a low profile gas block, fluting ahead of the gas block and an unthreaded muzzle with competition crown.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

There are plenty of detractors online and almost without reservation they are people who have never had them. If you go on Youtube you can see this set shoot the a dime at 10 yards and a quarter at 25 yards. I have never been THAT good with my set and it is great for using ammo that is otherwise not of use to you. I love this set - I ended up with 2 sets by buying one after thinking I lost the auction I was bidding on and then winning the auction as well. I love the 44 mag adapter - it is a blast to shoot. It is a great set. They are rifled adapters and shoot very very well. I am very pleased with the purchase and cannot say how helpful this would be in a SHTF scenario. Ever wished that you had a way to take your favorite break action 12 gauge shotgun and convert it to shoot a variety of your favorite calibers, well now here is your opportunity. Introducing the Chiappa X-Caliber set! This caliber conversion kit has more to it that meets the eye. This kit features 8 fully rifled adapters with an over all length of 8"" each. These 8 adapters allow you to convert that break action 12 gauge in popular handguns calibers such as 9mm Luger, .357 Magnum, and .45 ACP just to name a few. So dust of that shotgun and head to the range with the Chiappa X-caliber conversion set. Specifications and Features: Chiappa 970.387 Caliber Adapter/Conversion Set Fits any 12 Gauge break action shotgun Eight fully rifled adapters Each adapter is 8"" long Carry Pouch is included Convert to .380 ACP, 9mm Luger, .38 Special/.357 Magnum, .40 S&W, .44 Magnum, .45 ACP, .410/.45 Long Colt, .20 Gauge Trades considered.

They now come with Pierce finger groove inserts that sandwich between the G10 grip and that body of the weapon.

Undoubtedly the best compromised between fulll rubber Hogue grips that are not practical for carry because they bind on the clothing and the plain VZ g10 grips that lack the fingure grooves with add (IMO) a lot of stability.

Up for sale is a DSA SA58 FAL Carbine with 500 rounds through it. It is chambered in 7.62x51mm. The rifle is in VG+ condition, with the exception of some finish wear on the rail from a Larue Tactical mount, minor handling marks, and typical finish wear on the dust cover from ejected brass. I am the original owner and I bought it NIB last January. This gun has a forged receiver, versus the new ones which are all cast. If you are looking for the poor man’s SCAR-H, this is it! As best I can tell, this gun is all US made with the possible exception of the bolt carrier, which has a small star and a square on the front face. The original case, paperwork and take-offs will be included.

Here’s the rundown:

Forged type 1 receiver

16” barrel

Full length gas system

DSA railed handguard

Larue Index Clips on 3 sides of the handguard

DSA railed top cover

From Sig Sauer:
Winner of two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards, the P-250 is designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters.  The innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional (registered) serial-numbered frame and fire control assembly and place it into another polymer mechanism of choice.  One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.
This allows an immediate change in caliber (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP) and size; (subcompact, compact and full). After any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. 
Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, changes in grip circumference and trigger style. 
Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Looking to part ways with my LNIB Glock 42 .380 ACP. Purchased new approximately three months ago, ran one box of ammo through it, pocket carried once or twice, and it has sat in the safe ever since. Like new condition, no scratches or finish wear. Has brand new Truglo TFO tritium night sights, 3 six-round magazine, 2 with flat bases and 1 with a pinky extension, grip plug, a Desantis Nemesis pocket holster, and the box and all the factory stuff.

G42 is currently listed at Cabelas for $450, night sights were $50+$25 to install, third magazine was $25, holster was $20, grip plug was $5, for a total value of $575. Asking $450 for the package, and will leave all 3 mags loaded with fresh Winchester PDX1 95grn hollow points for asking price.

Gun is located in Klamath Falls, willing to travel a moderate distance to make a deal. While I realize many law enforcement agencies have expressed they will not enforce this stupid background check law, I do require we do a transfer legally, through an FFL. I have a dealer here in Klamath Falls that will complete a transfer for only the $10 it costs to do the background check, and if we can meet at this dealer, I will cover the $10. If a different dealer is used, any additional costs are covered by the buyer.

Looking to part ways with my Rossi Ranch Hand in .357 Mag/.38 Special. Bought from Cabela's a couple years ago for $450, ran maybe 3-4 boxes of ammo through it, cleaned it, and it's been sitting in my safe ever since. Very good condition. Would make for a heck of a short-barrel rifle if a person were inclined to spend the money on a tax stamp, or a fun plinker or truck gun, surprisingly easy to shoot accurately up to 50+ yards. Replaced the plastic magazine tube follower with a metal follower, and removed the cheesy loose ""safety"" on top of the receiver with a plug, with a parts cost of $50. Looking for $400.

Gun is located in Klamath Falls, willing to travel a moderate distance to make a deal. While I realize many law enforcement agencies have expressed they will not enforce this stupid background check law, I do require we do a transfer legally, through an FFL. I have a dealer here in Klamath Falls that will complete a transfer for only the $10 it costs to do the background check, and if we can meet at this dealer, I will cover the $10. If a different dealer is used, any additional costs are covered by the buyer. I do frequently travel throughout the state, so if you're interested but not in the Klamath Falls area don't hesitate to contact me.

Only trade interest would be for a similarly LNIB S&W 637 or 642.

Looking to part ways with my very good condition Gen 3 Glock 21 .45 ACP, with the older and generally more desirable glossy slide finish. Has seen some carry duty, but finish is good, no notable wear, low round count. Has fresh Truglo TFO night sights installed, and a grip plug installed. Includes six 13-round magazines, a tan Bianchi Carrylok OWB holster with a matching single mag carrier and a somewhat worn tan double mag carrier, a brown UBG Canute IWB holster, a black basket-weave Safariland Level 3 duty holster which accepts a weapon light, and a matching black basketweave double magazine pouch. Additionally, the gun comes with a like new condition Storm Lake 10mm conversion barrel and one 10-round Glock 20 magazine.

Gun & 2 mags valued at $500, night sights $50+$25 for install, grip plug $5, four extra mags $100, Carrylok $50, mag carriers $50, Canute $75 (plus skipping the 2 month wait), Safariland holster $75, basketweave mag pouch $25, $100 for the 10mm barrel, $20 for the G20 mag, for a total value of $1025.

Looking for $925, and will include all six G21 mags loaded with fresh Winchester PDX1 230 grn hollow points for asking price. Not looking to sell gun without accessories at this time, prefer to move as a package.

Gun is located in Klamath Falls, willing to travel a moderate distance to make a deal. While I realize many law enforcement agencies have expressed they will not enforce this stupid background check law, I do require we do a transfer legally, through an FFL. I have a dealer here in Klamath Falls that will complete a transfer for only the $10 it costs to do the background check, and if we can meet at this dealer, I will cover the $10. If a different dealer is used, any additional costs are covered by the buyer. I do travel throughout the state a fair amount, so if you're interested but not in the Klamath Falls area, don't hesitate to contact me.

Only trade interest would be for a similar condition S&W 637 or 642 in .38 Special, plus cash on your end."

An Aero Precision lower and a Radical Firearms Enhanced LPK makeup the bones of this gun.  The enhanced trigger guard makes it easy to find the trigger even when your wearing gloves.  The mag release and bolt release are textured to aid in manipulating them. The takedown pins are made by Strike Industries and make it very easy to remove them. The Grip is an Ergo and the fire control group has a reduced power hammer spring to keep the load light.  Also, the contact surfaces of the trigger group have been mirror polished to aid in smooth overall trigger pull.  The buffer tube is a Phase 5 with a Phase 5 Hex extension. A SigBrace rounds out the lower receiver.  The upper receiver is also an Aero Precision and sports a 10.5"" 300BLK barrel with a KAK Industries flash can.  The barrel is free floated thanks to an ALG Defense handguard.  It also includes 2 short picatinny rail sections that can be mounted anywhere on the handguard.  One of the rails is sporting a Magpul AFG. A pistol length gas tube and low profile gas block are installed and work perfectly.  A BCM Gunfighter charging handle with a medium latch eases the chambering of a fresh magazine. Another nice thing is, since this has been built as an AR pistol, it is now legal to change uppers and add a stock should you wish to use the lower as a rifle.  A 4-40 set screw that holds the spring and detent, for the rear takedown pin, makes it possible to remove the stock without fear of the spring flying across the room should you remove it.  Ill toss in some mixed ammo and a new 30 round  PMAG as well.  If you are interested in any optics, I have a Vortex Strikefire Id sell for $100 with it as well.  Thanks for looking."

602,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5031602,For Sale:  Mossberg 500 12ga Persuader,"Cliffdale Rd, Fayetteville, North Carolina",$ 340,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 6, 2016",Shotguns,Mossberg                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This is an older Mossberg 500 -- it was sold as a home defense gun back in its day (late 1990s), but it's called the Persuader today: it's the 12 ga 20"" cylinder bore barrel version with a full length 7 round magazine (for a total of 8 shells of the stoutest stuff you care to shoot).  Unlike today's Persuader with black synthetic stock, this one has a wood stock -- and the condition of the stock is very good -- at least 8 or 9 out of 10.  I don't guess I'd swear that it's perfect, but there are really no visible blemishes on it.  It also has the polymer pistol grip that came with it.  I've had the pistol grip on it a few times -- it's a lot of fun to shoot it that way.

My dad bought this gun in the late 1990s from Sports Authority up in Virginia, as a defensive weapon for their RV.  He doesn't remember ever putting any shells through it.  I've owned it for the last few years, and I've probably put 20 shells through it total.  I've cycled it a lot doing practice and such at the house, but few shells were put through it.  It's really in very nice condition...as new as it can get for an uncommon wood-stocked Persuader model like this.

I'm selling (or trading) because the 12 ga is really more than I care to shoot, and my wife isn't comfortable with it at all, so I'm looking for a 20 ga.  If you would like to buy this outright, I'll be glad to sell it to you.  If you have a similar 20 ga (either Mossy 500 or Rem 870) to trade, I'll consider that as well.  I think I would prefer a youth or Bantam size 20 ga, for the slightly shorter stock.  I don't really have a preference on Mossy vs. Rem -- both are good in my experience.

The closest thing to this model today looks to be a Mossberg 500 Special Purpose model 50579.  Link to it on Buds is below.  This is their current 20"" 8 shot package that comes with the full stock and the pistol grip.  Again, today's model has synthetic furniture; you cannot buy one with wood like this today.

I'm also including (but forgot to haul them out for the picture), 95 rounds of Winchester Heavy Target Load shells, 12 rounds of Winchester Dove and Quail shells, and 5 rounds of Remington 9 pellet 00 buck -- 112 rounds of good stuff to put through this thing.

Bud's has the gun listed for $371 cash price, plus FFL, so it's going to be a $400 package by the time you can buy it.  Gander Mountain has it for $450:

http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Mossberg-500-Persuader-Shotgun&i=728986

I'm asking $320 for the gun, plus another 20 bucks for all the shells -- $340 total package.  Please send me a cash or trade offer and I'll consider it."

I will update the ad as more items are added and of course when items are gone. I have other firearms listed as well for a bigger deal. Prices firm at this time, may change them later if not moving. 1.) Hornady Critical Duty 9mm FlexLock 135gr +P JHP 50rd. boxes. The more common 25rd. boxes go for $20-$25 online and the 50rd. boxes for usually $35-$40 plus any tax and/or shipping when you can find them in stock. If you can find it cheaper, great, but I have looked and I could not. $300 per case(500rds) no shipping. 2.) D&L Sports 1911 Single Stack Quad Magazine Pouch/Holster, like new. $60 shipped. http://www.dlsports.com/kydex_1911_single_st ack_quad_magazine_pouch.html 3.) Grips are in excellent/like new condition, prices are the same whether shipped or FTF, from left to right starting at top, smooth wood grips $40, checkered Walnut $30, S&W ""K"" frame $50, faux Stag $25 and the Pachmayr Rosewood/rubber $25. Found another pair of AJAX Pearlite 1911 grips $30. 4.) 6 boxes of 20ga. shells, see pic for load info. $30 no shipping. 5.) Zombie flash suppressor, perfect to top or tip off your Zombie rifle. $20 shipped. 6.) Nikon M-223 1-4x20mm Point Blank Reticle with flip caps and box/ppwk, mount is NOT included. $220 for scope shipped. Sells new for around $300 and no mount included. 7.) Nikon M-223 1-4x20mm Point Blank Reticle, no box and the M223XR mount is NOT included unless you want to add $80(sells for $100). $200 for scope shipped. 8.) Beretta 92/96 Crimson Trace Laser Grips, older model I think, traded for these a few years ago and never used them. They are used, but still work great, the pic with laser dot on cabinet is taken 20+ feet away. I think you will have to order or make something to hold the batteries in when mounted on pistol, you will see what I'm talking about when you take the factory grips off. Also, the very small Allen Key to adjust, if needed. $80 for grips shipped. Sell new for around $300. Might look at trades as long as it's a good deal on the value, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now. If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal. Trades considered: I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now. Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns. Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each. I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up. Would also like more Pmags for both. Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54. 1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars. Gold in grams. Please check current prices before making offer. Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal. FTF in the Garland area only or will ship, if stated. I can accept PayPal. Thanks for looking!"

Date code puts this pistol at 1977, overall, I would say very nice to excellent condition for a pistol almost 40 years old, a little wear on the edges of the slide.  If you like the 92 models, you will love this one, feels great in the hand and would be great for CCW or OCW in 2016.  I would like to keep this one, but I need some new tires in the coming month.

$580 firm in cash. 

Might look at trades as long as it's a good deal on the value, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol. The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger. Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.Another unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap.

I have a very nice looking 1940 Brno Vz24, Romanian Contract rifle and post war bayonet for sale.  The Romanian Contract rifles were made in occupied Brno, Czechoslovakia under the direction of the Germans as aid to Romania to fight the Russians.  A rifle with neat history. The finish on the rifle and stock are VERY good, frankly one of the best I have seen. There are some interesting marks on the stock (acorn?, script letter). The bolt does not match but is a Czech Romanian Contract bolt. The rifling is strong but dark. Many correctly marked Cz parts. There is a fine crack in the wood at the top of the wrist behind the receiver but I don't believe it to be a problem and is repairable. I have never fired this rifle so I can't speak to its accuracy but I will say the action is the smoothest ""mauser"" action in my collection.

The bayonet is a 1950 dated blade with a 1946 scabbard.

It really is a beautiful rifle I hate to get rid of but I am trying to add some focus to my collection.

I am asking $320 + $30 Shipping. Must ship to C&R or FFL.

Thanks for looking!"

That said, the only other example Ive found for this model in this size in this condition auctioned for $980 on Gunbroker earlier this year.  There is another currently there with a buy it now price of $1100, which IMO is too high, and isnt in as nice a condition.  Those are my only real reference of value, but Im not asking for those kinds of prices.  Maybe one day itll command that kind of thing but I dont think its now.

$900 firm in cash or higher in trade value.  No hurry to sell, just wanting to free up some cash to finish a couple projects and get some new tires in the next month or so.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
