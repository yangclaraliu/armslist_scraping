All numbers match -- original matching, not electro-pen. This rifle comes with a Brass Stacker picatinny rail for mounting a scope. The Brass Stacker product is amazing because it's installed without having to make any permanent changes to the rifle. Feel free to remove it for future use and the gun is back in original form. The stock is in nice condition. When I got it years ago it was dripping with cosmoline. I removed the cosmoline, gave it a VERY fine sanding to smooth the surface, and hand-oiled it using natural oils. The rifle also comes with a cheek pad that doubles as a ammo holder, and the original Chinese oil can for lubrication. The gun is a pretty sweet shooter, and a prepper's perfect companion."

Nobody at the last gun show could tell me either. I downloaded a schematic and I don't see any spring or anything parts wise that would have held tension on the lever, so I think this is how they worked.  Made from 1903-1912. Very collectible. Bluing and overall condition very nice. Had a couple collectors at the gun show tell me that it was the nicest one they have seen, and they don't see them very often. Still has good bluing, wood is all intact, and the butt plate is there...rare for these.  Will fetch $550-650 when reworked. Really needs very little work.
