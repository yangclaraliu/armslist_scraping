Before the pistol can be fired, this lever must be squeezed. Thus this lever acts as a safety. The pistol has an innovative trigger (with a squeeze cocking lever located at the front of the grip, beneath the trigger guard) and is striker fired. Squeezing the cocking lever cocks the firing pin. Once fully depressed, only 2 pounds of force are required to keep the weapon cocked. The weapon is then fired by pressing the single stage trigger rated at approximately 4.5 lbf. As long as the lever is depressed, the weapon fires like any other semi-automatic pistol. If the lever is released, the weapon is immediately de-cocked and rendered safe. This method of operation dispensed the need for a manual safety selector while providing safety for the user carrying the pistol with a chambered round, and increased the speed with which the pistol could be deployed and fired.

Will come with its original wood grips with an added Tyler T grip, as well as a pachmayr grip and speedloader.  Has also been drilled and tapped for a scope mount, and I have a Leupold scope mount and Centerpoint red dot sight for the right trade or price.I have another revolver and I just don't use it, so I'd be open to trades.  Would consider most handguns in 9mm, 40, or 45 (No Taurus or Kel Tec pistols please). Would also consider any interesting military surplus rifles, particularly Mausers, Swiss service rifles, or Finnish M39 Mosin-nagants.If you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $400 for just the revolver, 550 for the revolver, scope mount, and red dot. I have considerably more in it so cash prices are fairly firm. If interested feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts will get the fastest response from me.Thanks!"

The Combat Masterpiece (Model 15-7) is known as being S&W's pinnacle revolver. At one point in time, the entire Los Angeles police force, Air Force pilots, Officers in other branches and other elite M&P branches were issued these. This is very nice example, that shoots very well and is both functionally and cosmetically in great shape. Blue is 90% or greater. Wear is typical holster wear, but not that bad! Has the original Uncle Mikes grips it was issued with. Grips are very ergonomic. The gun just feels great in hand. This gun allows meet to shoot better than any other gun I own, or have owned. Unlike most revolvers, these came with adjustable rear sights. I do not have a box or papers for it. Just the gun itself as shown in the pics.I would like to either sell it, for as close as I can get to $475 cash (Or Best Offer), or accept a trade with some cash. If trading, your trade must be a good deal (not just under retail for a used gun). I wouldn't mind another 9mm or .45. What do you have? Please, no rifles or shotguns. I am a handgun shooter/lover. Also open to you covering some value with ammo. I need some .380 ACP, 9mm Luger, .45 ACP or 223/556. I also could use some more Pmags (30 round 223/556). Thanks! Face to face transaction in Orlando/Winter Park only. Will not ship, or take checks, paypal or wires. You must be legal to own a gun and show me Florida ID. Thanks!"

Shooters could easily eject all six spent cartridges and reload while on horseback. The top break pistol also proved useful to the likes of Jesse James and Wild Bill Hickok. The Schofield features a blue frame, barrel, and backstrap; and a case-hardened trigger guard. The Schofield Russian was a favorite side arm of the Russian government. Modeled after the Smith & Wesson Schofield, this revolver features a blue frame, barrel, and hump-backed backstrap; walnut grips; lanyard ring; and a case-hardened trigger guard with trigger spur."
