KRISS Vector CRB Gen. 2: Carbine / Semi. / 16"" barrel / M4 stock / 13 rds / .45ACP / FDE

Experience one of the most innovative developments in modern firearms technology with the patented KRISS Vector Platform. At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.


The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.


The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16” barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states."

The barrel has some bluing scraped off and some rough areas.  That's why a low price.  Other than the mentioned the rifle looks great.  Buyer must have a NC conceal Carry lic. or a NC purchase permit ( just to verify a background check has been done).  Would consider a trade for a 9mm handgun. I do have aNC conceal carry lic.

Lots of people have success with this press, but I could never get it to run smoothly. Maybe it's just my inexperience. There are lots of videos on Youtube of how to use this press, and ways to make it run smoothly. I'm going to downgrade to a single stage press, which I probably should have started with anyway. I loaded about 500 rounds of 9mm with this press, so it is still in like new condition. I am keeping the 9mm dies and the auto-disk pro powder measure that it came with, because I plan on using them with my single stage press. It will come with the 9mm shell plate. When this comes as a kit it costs $250. So if you're a tinkerer, or have experience reloading ammunition, this might be for you. I really just want it to go to someone that will make it work, rather than in the trash. Asking $100, or best offer."

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. P30 and P30S models available in 9mm and .40 S&W. Key Features:Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral platesMIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessoriesCorrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer framePolygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel lifeMultiple trigger firing modes availablePatented HK recoil reduction systemOne piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steelCorrosion resistant “hostile environment” blued finishAmbidextrous slide levers andAmbidextrous magazine release magazinePatented lock-out safety deviceBobbed hammer (LEM models)Spurred hammer (DA/SA models)Automatic hammer and firing pin safetiesAmbidextrous safety levers (P30S model)"

If you have something I can use, I'll give you basically double the MSRP in Cerakote work, so for example if you have a $115 stripped spikes crusader lowers, I'll give you a $250-300 rifle or pistol job of your choice. If you have a 13"" guiselle MK4 rail that runs $250, I'll give you 2 rifle or 2pistol jobs or $500-600 worth of cerakote work. I love to barter, and I have more time & energy than cash, so I can promise you, I'll make it worth your wild. I own East Tennessee's #1 cerakote shop, and have been voted one of the top 10 cerakote shops in the country, So I can guarentee the cerakote work will be top notch quality, performed in a timely manner, and it will come with my lifetime guarentee. So if you've been wanting to get something coated but have been strapped for cash, here's your chance! If you want to see some of my work, you can check out the gallery on my website;Matt Nichols Customs Dot ComYou can also check out; MATT NICHOLS CUSTOMS on facebook to see some of my reviews, come by my shop in front of Frontier Firearms in kingston, or just swing by my booth at any of the knox gunshows and lets see if we can work out a trade!Thanks!-MattText: REDACTED"
