The only marks you will find is where the scope mounts were, no big deal just impressions where the mount was. Filled the factory tapped holes with the original screws. I cannot find a flaw on this gun. The marks you see around the breakdown bolt are grease, I keep them coated with Du lite when not in use. I do have another 39A listed here on Armslist also. To obtain these years ago I had to pay a premium price for them which reflects what I am asking for them today. Please no keyboard cowboys, Price is firm, I do not entertain offers over the internet. Must be a Mn. Resident and I will need a copy of your drivers license. (you can black out the numbers if you like) I just need it tho show who bought this gun. $700. Cash only.

The action and gas piston recoil system are identical to the setup used in the Winchester Super X2.  Smooth cycling and light on recoil.  The metal and furniture are very good to excellent; no scratches or rust anywhere. It has been out ""in the woods"" a few times years ago, but I haven't hunted in a very long time and I shoot single trap occasionally these days exclusively with my O/U.  I have never had any kind of failure to feed or eject from this shotgun, regardless of what retail or reloaded cartridges I've fed it.  I removed the bolt and trigger group for a more detailed cleaning about a year and a half ago, all of the internal components still looked new. I hesitate to take it out much anymore because I don't want it getting dinged or scratched after almost 20 years.  The shotgun will be delivered to you clean and properly lubricated in a zippered gun sock.  As far as trades, I'm really only interested in a higher quality AR platform rifle (i.e. Colt, LMT, FN, Sig, etc.) with iron sights. I have cash to add if you have a rifle that I like.  I'm pretty flush on handguns and other shotguns, but I'll entertain all offers.  Thank you for your interest."

It has been sitting in a safe for many years and looks new. I spoke with Colt and they confirmed the year of manufacture is 1991. This is a “Target Model” and the bore is shiny with deep sharp grooves. The barrel is stamped 5.56 MM. Plastic is all very good to excellent condition. Unbelievably, the mag-well is free of any scuffing. Not many shots have been fired through this beauty. Moreover, the hammer and firing pin look shiny new and there is no wear on the charging handle catch (see picture). The bolt, gas key, and hammer all look new. There is no slop in the charging handle, gas key, safety switch, or trigger either. If you have been waiting for the “one” this is it. This is a clean and lightly used late model pre ban AR and you will not be disappointed. I have had many calls asking for the weapon to be sold without the scope to get the price down and because of these requests, I have decided to drop the price and keep the scope. Therefore, the sale only includes: weapon, strap, and case. The new sale price does not include the Trijicon ACOG Scope, Rail, Flashlight, or Laser shown in the pictures. I also ordered and now have a new 10 round magazine for this weapon which will go with the sale also. I accept checks, Paypal, or cash (buyer is responsible for any financial transaction fees).

I just don't really need it so I'm consolidating. Gun from factory comes with 1 magazine, a flush 5rd and new at Buds they run $360 before tax. I have two extended Kahr brand 6rd mags and a Remora pocket holster for it also, mags run at least $30 new each and the holster around $25, so all of this will run over $450 when you factor in taxes, etc. I'm asking $300 for all of it, which is $80 cheaper than the gun alone after taxes plus you get two extra Kahr magazines and a Remora holster.

I cannot find a flaw on this gun. The marks you see around the breakdown bolt are grease, I keep them coated with Du lite when not in use. I do have another 39A listed here on Armslist also. To obtain these years ago I had to pay a premium price for them which reflects what I am asking for them today. Please no keyboard cowboys, Price is firm, I do not entertain offers over the internet. Must be a Mn. Resident and I will need a copy of your drivers license. (you can black out the numbers if you like) I just need it tho show who bought this gun. $700. Cash only. Just e-mail and I will get back to you asap. Thanks for looking"

The scope is a vortex viper 6-24-50 with a 4"" sunshade. I love this gun and it will be like loosing a family member but the woman says it's time to remodel so I need to liquidate. The gun was professionally broke in. It has about 200 rounds through it. I installed a krg bolt knob and a vortex bubble level. I have shot the gun out to 650 yards and connected with a 6"" target every shot. I can get about .4 Moa out of it with a hand load and about .8 Moa with Hornady match 168g. This is not a hunting rifle it weighs 18 pounds.   Chambered in 308 if you were to build this as I did you would have about 2600$ in it I am asking 2200 it is in excellent shape I'm a freak about a nice gun. Call or text me at REDACTED NO TRADES WHATSOEVER. I have several rounds of Hornady match id sell and 4 lbs of n55 powder and some 168 Sierra match kings I also have a nice 150$ Plano case that has the pluck foam that has been fitted to this gun.

The rifle has been used not abused, so standard wear and handling marks. Bore is in very good shape and the only real wear is some of the finish around the ejection port. The rifle comes equipped with see through rings, ready for your rimfire scope and still letting you access the irons without contorting your body in an odd fashion. It also comes along with 3 Ruger 25 round magazines and a 10 round rotary mag. Also included is the standard rail should you wish to change out from the rings to a more versatile mount. Rings are thrown in for free just because you're so awesome.Item 2: Smith and Wesson M&P 22c. This little spitfire of a pistol has been used very little and comes with a threaded barrel, factory box docs and goodies, 2 10 round factory magazines, and is in great shape. Item 3: 1625 rounds of .22lr. This ammo is made up of 500 rounds of CCI Standard velocity, 325 rounds of Federal Automatch, 500 rounds of Remington Golden Bullet, 100 rounds of Armscor Hyper Max Velocity, and finally 200 rounds of Federal Premium HV Match Ammo.So there you have it.
