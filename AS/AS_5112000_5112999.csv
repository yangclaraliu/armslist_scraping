Its slim forend, light weight, precise symmetry and refined design allows responsiveness that only few shotguns in history can claim. The integration of form and function makes the Affinity a natural extension of the shooter.

Military knife.The knife was beautifully crafted and the design is simply exceptional. It's an ""all performance, all business"" kind of design. The knife has a solid, sure feel in the hand and presents an aggressive profile. The thick blade was crisply ground from 154CM (Post ATS-34) high speed steel and displays clean, sharp lines. It has a soft, bead-blasted finish and the markings are bold. The blade has a combo edge with the final 2"" being a deeply scalloped, wickedly sharp section of serrations. This produces a highly efficient cutting action that's ideal for rope, cord, netting, etc. The straight edge is probably the sharpest I've ever seen on a Camillus. The spine has a pronounced thumb ramp with deeply milled ridges on both sides. There's also a long section of deep ridges on both the top and bottom of the handle. The handle is of canvas micarta and offers excellent slip resistance. The butt was drilled for a lanyard (by manufacturer) and the handle has an outstanding feel all the way around.The sheath is the original Kydex, attachment that releases easily and is reversible / ambidextrous - right or left handed. It offers excellent versatility with at least six different carry configurations. It can even be configured for jump-safe inverted carry, although this requires an additional safety strap for use when parachuting.This knife is beautifully balanced, offering the feel and handling of a fine custom knife. It's quick and agile with great blade response.The blade is 5-3/4"" and the knife measures 10-3/4"" in overall length.This model was designed by noted Knifemaker's Guild member Bob (Robert) Terzuola and it was designed to offer top-level performance and durability.If you're a Camillus collector/enthusiast, this knife is one of the finest they offered. It's also as nice as they come.An awesome, premium-quality fighter from this American icon!! Will make great companion for any hunting or field work expedition.Beautiful execution with elements suggesting hand made (or benchmade)"

776,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5112776,For Sale:  Leupold Mark AR mod 1 3-9x Illuminated TMR reticle scope,"New Berlin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 19, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here’s what I have:Leupold Mark AR mod 1 3-9x 40mm objective, illumintated TMR reticle.LaRue Tactical LT104 QD scope mountVortex 1in bubble levelThe scope sells new for $450, the LaRue mount is $210 new, the Vortex bubble is $35.I bought the scope and mount about a year ago, the bubble I just got a few weeks back - it's mounted loosely, not leveled.This set up has served me extremely well. I’ve shot many prairie dogs out to 400 yards in South Dakota, I’ve shot 10inx14in targets out to 585 yards at a range. I run it on my Midwest Industries AR with a 16in barrel. The repeatability of this scope really impressed me, also the LaRue mount is fantastic, I also run an AimPoint on the same upper, so constantly switch optics back and forth and this thing holds its zero everytime. The value of the scope has really impressed me, it is a great set up to get into long range shooting with the TMR reticle, don’t be fooled by BDC reticles out there, it’s a gimmick, the mrad/mil system is quite simple to use applying a basic formula and using a basic ballistic calculator. The reticle really makes this scope, you don’t see this combination of functional reticle at this price point from a manufacturer like Leupold. Check out their warranty, never expires, no need to be original owner, no need for a receipt or warranty card. Check Leupold’s site for the warranty info, Armslist won’t let me provide the link.So why sell it? I just built a 20in precision upper, that I want to push out to further ranges, like 600+, would love to get out to 800. A 9x scope just can’t handle that range as comfortably as I’d like to. So the time has come for me to invest in a nice high end, high powered optic. However, a high end, high power scope also has a high price tag. I figured if I could sell this set up, it would help me get there a little sooner.This really is a fantastic set up if you’re shooting 400 or less. If it doesn’t sell I will be completely fine hanging on to it and delaying my next purchase a month or two.In the pictures you can see the TMR reticle. This has .5 mil markings, which are great for two reasons. 1- range estimation, 2 - hold overs. It seems like many optic companies are making BDC reticles and/or turrets these days, which just seems like a marketing gimmick to me. Having a scope with yardage marking for a standard round may do ok but if you care about precision, you know it’s a joke. Plus those reticles are set up for one type of ammo, theoretically. A mil based reticle works for any ammunition you want to use, any caliber you want to use. Picture 1 is the scope mounted on my rifle.Picture 2 is a photo of the reticle aimed at two Freon tanks (10in wide x 14in high) the tank to the left of the vertical axis is at 300 yards, the tank to the right of the vertical axis is at 585 yards. Using this scope I was able to hit that 10inx14in tank at 585 yards using 55gr fmj ammo moving around 3,050 fps out of a 16in AR. Hold over was 4.6 mils, which was easy to dial in, was holding 1-1.5 mils for wind, which I didn’t dial as it varied, so the reticle allowed me to easily adjust for that. Picture is not great because I took on an Iphone 4 that had seen better days.Picture 3 is Leupold’s stock photo of the reticle, the green center has 5 levels of brightness and really pops, even against a grassy background. So yeah, that’s what I have, I’d let it go for $500. If you need it shipped and paypal, $525. Not interested in any offers under that. Let me know if you’re interested, otherwise I’ll hang on to it.I have the owner’s manual and all that as well.Check Leupold’s site for more detailed info on the scope, Armslist won’t allow me to provide the link."

Comes with factory box and one 6 round mag. The finish is in very good condition, with only minor wear from carry. I shot it and, while it is very accurate, it had an issue. The hammer occasionally followed the slide back forward, but the hammer stopped in the decock position. This means the gun shoots, but you sometimes have to cock the hammer like a SA. I replaced the sear spring and main spring housing with the new Gen2 version, but it didn't fix it. I think the issue is the sear itself or possibly the hammer. I just don't feel like dealing with it anymore. Sig will usually send you the parts for free; they even cover shipping. Looking to sell or trade for S&W 637, Glock 43, other 9mms, or a 12 gauge for hunting. I can add cash where needed. Price is fair considering issue, so please don't lowball me. Prefer CWP holder.

Matching serial numbers on receiver and barrel and bands. Bolt onto itself.  These iconic weapons were extensively used by the French army throughout its Colonial period, all the way through WW1. They were also heavily used by the famous Legion Etrangere in North Africa and Indochina through the turn of the century. The bore has strong rifling. The wood is very nice, with the typical pre-war ageing in a pleasant dark brown tone with no dents, but the usual handling marks of a military gun.  It comes with its original, huge spike bayonet with wood/ brass handle. It also has its original scabbard. This M1874 Gras is LOADED with character. With its spike bayonet mounted, it makes for a fearsome sight! Best part, this is an antique, and it does not require a license to own. An awesome, impressive display.
