I am only selling it because I got a new 308 and don't need two of them. This rifle is a beauty. The first time I pulled the trigger it was true love. This is a very lightweight scout rifle and if you've done your research it's one of the best available. The trigger is very smooth and so is the bolt. Running the bolt is very quiet and easy to do even without taking your face off of the gun. The recoil is surprisingly low on it for being a 308. My wife who weighs 100lbs can shoot it over and over without it hurting her. The butt pad is very soft and is also adjustable.With iron sights it's surprisingly easy to hit targets, most fun with steel targets and listening to it ring. I've shot this out to about 750 yards and it was still hitting steel no problem. Rifle also comes with proper 30mm scope rings if you don't want to use a scout scope and want to go traditional style. Also comes with 2 extra polymer 10 round mags so reloading isn't as common and you can shoot longer between having to reload the mag.Includes adjustable length of pull pieces to make the butt stock longer if needed.This is a great package, everything needed to customize the rifle to your standards."

There are a lot of guns that I think that I might like to buy but have not shot or seen them shot and I think others might be the same. I have quite a few firearms and thought it might be cool to invite guys to try them out, and bring their guns and let others try theirs. Everyone would bring factory ammo so that everyones guns would be safe from reloading mistakes (it happens). We could do a little 3 gun shooting or IPSC/IDPA style shooting. I have 3 rubber dummies and some steel targets but would be nice if others could bring some targets too. I would not want any kids or new shooters coming. You must have seriously safe gun handling skills. If you muzzle other shooters you will be asked to leave. I dont want any trash, losers, drunks or addicts. This will be a dry event, booze and guns do not mix. Alpha males are welcome but no territorial pissing, if you cant get along with others then please dont come. If you are a level headed, nice, responsible gun lover then you are more than welcome. We can shoot from 0-500 yards and the berm is a long U shape so you can engage in 180 degrees. Prior service and law enforcement are very welcome (i was a contractor for 10 years and have lived on a lot of the same bases and FOBs as you prior service guys), if anyone is interested in traning on a regular basis we can set something up on a once or twice a month basis. There will be no fees to attend, this is my property. I will ask everyone that attends to sign a waiver so if you shoot yourself in the foot you cant sue me. Other than that there will never be any kind of cost, just bring your own ammo. Do not bring your kids and spouses (unless your spouse is a serious shooter). We are thinking about doing some new shooter training days and woman only shooting in the future. The drive is a bit of a haul, its roughly 45 min east of Ozark doing the speed limit. However you can shoot at 500 yards and its FREE!The only requirements are that we dont want any dirtbags, drunks, druggies, losers or parasites. Do not show up with a single box of ammo and expect to shoot all day on the generosity of others. This is not the place for you. If everyone bahaves themselves and gets along then i can host these shoots every month. If you are interested in attending send me a message. Be sure to mention what kind of shooting you enjoy and a little bit about yourself. A picture or a link to your facebook page would be great. If you are invited I will send out a group email so we can coordinate the shoot date and time.  Only those 21 and up will be invited unless you are active duty or prior service and have been deployed. (need to see a dd214 if you are under 21, so no bullshitters)"

These were made for the seal teams, and are superior quality. The is the OD green model, with a black, plain edge. This knife fires with authority! The firing button has blue tritium inserts as well, for visibility at night, or deep underwater. Manufacture date is 08/15, because that was the last time they were made. These knives are not currently in production, they are not discontinued, but will not be made for a while. Get one of these while you can, they are extremely hard to find! What can I say, this knife is awesome! The navy scarab series will fire and retract underwater as well, and has a very very high resistance to corrosion, due to the special costing to protect from saltwater. This knife has only been out of the box 2 times, for a few minutes each time. I am willing to ship to any state in the continental US that does not have automatic knife restrictions. Please know your laws. Currently asking 750 shipped, or best offer. Let me know if you are interested. I would also trade for firearms and firearm related stuff. Just let me know what you have.

While similar in concept to earlier over/under derringer-type pistols in design, the DoubleTap's materials, construction, functioning, and options are as modern as tomorrow.The DoubleTap Tactical Pistol features an all-metal frame and buyers have a choice of aluminum or titanium. If you choose the titanium, your gun will weigh two ounces more than an aluminum model.To provide a firm purchase, the frame features square-cut checkering on the sides of the grip and sharp cut serrations on the front strap and the front of the trigger guard. In addition, the ergonomics of the grip cause the pistol to recoil straight back into the shooter's hand which, theoretically, reduces muzzle flip. More about that later.Ambidextrous barrel release catches are positioned above and slightly behind the trigger, and a lanyard attachment point is located on the heel of the grip. A unique and practical feature on the DoubleTap is a trapdoor on the bottom of the hollow grip frame, which allows the shooter to carry two spare rounds of ammunition on a speed strip for convenient reloading.The double-action-only (DAO) trigger has a stroke of approximately 5/8 of an inch. It is stage free, and according to my trigger pull scale, it takes approximately 12 pounds of pressure to trip the sear. Pulling the trigger rotates a two-sided ratchet in the frame, which pushes one hammer at a time back and then releases it to fire the barrel. Pulling the trigger again fires the next barrel. If you have a misfire you must fire the second barrel before you can ""second strike"" the cartridge in the first barrel.The over/under octagonal barrels are three inches long and made from stainless steel and are available in .45 ACP and 9mm, either plain or ported. The ported barrels have five ports on each side that vent powder gases upward at an angle to help reduce muzzle flip. Barrels can be quickly changed by simply removing the hinge pin in front of the frame; no modifications to the frame are necessary.As this pistol was designed from the ground up as a last ditch, defensive weapon intended to be used at ""reach out and touch someone"" distances, the sights—a low blade at the muzzle end of the barrel and a gutter-type rear sight on top of the frame—are probably superfluous. But they are there.Pulling one of the barrel release catches to the rear allows a spring inside the frame to tilt the barrels up, whereupon the shooter must manually extract the live or spent cartridges.Super ConcealableTo my way of thinking the DoubleTap provides several advantages over the semi-auto pocket pistol and small-frame revolver. With a cross-section of slightly more than half an inch, this pistol can be carried concealed under the lightest clothing in a pocket or ankle holster. The concealed hammers give the gun a snag-free design, which allows for a smooth presentation from concealment.The DoubleTap has fewer parts than a pistol or revolver and thus is less likely to get out of order. And the operating drill is simplicity personified: draw pistol, aim, pull trigger. When you are done firing all you must do to make the pistol ""safe"" is remove your finger from inside the trigger guard.As a defensive handgun the .45 caliber DoubleTap has another advantage. When viewed from the ""wrong"" end, the gaping muzzles remind one of the entrances to the Lincoln Tunnel and should serve as a visual deterrent"

These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast.

You will not find a better deal than these. The ammo cans are GRADE 1. They show very little use. Some a a little surface rust and dings, but there are no dents or holes. Any flawas are simply cosmetic. These ammo cans have been converted into great handgun cases! There are two options for these gun cases: military grade foam or regular foam. The military grade foam only has cutouts for 4 magazines. The military grade foam is much more rigid than the other foam option, which has cutouts for 8 magazines. The picture should give the general idea about the gun cases. You can get full size handguns in these cases. A full size 1911 is about the maximum size. These gun cases aregreat because you can just grab them and go. I prefer emails, but if you wish to text me you may: REDACTED. I charge $55 for the military grade foam and $50 for the regualr grade foam. I will do deals on purchases of 5 or more cases. Please feel free to contact me with questions. Thanks!

Please no low ball offers. I want it gone as soon as possible so all offers will be considered. I would perfer to meet up in person with another GA resident with a weapons license but I will consider shipping it through an FFL if the price is right. Up for sale is a Glock 21 Long Slide. This gun has mostly been a safe gun and has only been fired 25 times to insure reliability and sight in the RMR. It is equipped with XS suppressor level big dot tritium sights that co-witness with the RMR. It is also equipped with a Streamlight TLR-1 HL. This Glock has a 6.61 inch Lone Wolf threaded barrel and a Lone Wolf 21L stainless steel slide. The slide has been milled for a Trijicon RMR. The slide has also been completely cerakoted in Graphite Black.The barrel is threaded so you can run a compensator or suppressor if you desire. All the internals are 100% OEM stock glock. The lower is also OEM Glock and completely Stock. This Glock is chambered in .45 ACP but will also fire .45 Super and .460 Rowland (the barrel has been professionally reamed). It is equipped with a DPM Mechanical Recoil Reduction system to handle the extra recoil of the .460 Rowland or .45 super. Because it uses a DPM system it will fire .45 Auto 100% reliably because the system does not require extra power recoil springs. So standard .45 will cycle the slide perfectly and reliably. The kit also include a low power outer spring (it is a triple spring system) that I will include if you prefer that. I can also include a standard gen 3 Glock recoil assembly instead just message me if you win the auction. This is the coolest most powerful Glock you will see. As you may know .45 super out powers 10mm and .460 Rowland matches .44 Magnum in knockdown power. .45 ACP +P pushes a 230 grain bullet ~950 FPS, .45 Super is ~1100 and a .460 Rowland is over 1400 fps! You will be surprised at how little recoil this gun has shooting .45 ACP and even .460 Rowland does not feel anywhere near as stout as it usually does. I am selling because I just don't really carry it. It is my favorite Glock but it is such an expensive set up that I am afraid to carry it and mess it up. My wife says some of my ""excess"" guns must go. For all intents and purposes this gun is Brand new. I will list out how much all the components cost so you can get an idea how much money I actually have in this thing. I am not really looking to make money off of it just come as close to braking even as possible. Even the buy it now price is 200$ off what you would pay to build this, not including all the wait time, assembly, hassle, and shipping costs. I am also offering free shipping. If you were to build this gun yourself a lot of time would be spent assembling it a and acquiring the actual parts. Also at the moment Lone Wolf wait times on custom work can be well over a month. The gun comes in a Glock case with all the accessories and no magazines. It also does not come with the RMR. I just included that in the pictures to show that it fits perfectly (it also comes with the properly sized screws for the RMR). Here is a breakdown of what it cost me to build this gun: Standard OEM Glock Gen 3 Lower: $300 Threaded Barrel with .460 reaming: $150 Streamlight TLR-1 HL:130 OEM Glock Upper parts kit: $110 Slide:$175 Slide Cerakoting Service:$80 XS Big Dot Tritium Suppressor Sights:$135 Trijicon RMR Milling:$125 Barrel thread protector: $15 DPM Recoil reduction system: $75 Total: $1,295 This does not include shipping for any of the items. I will accept money orders of anykind, certified checks, and personal checks. I would prefer not to use pay pal but if that is the only way you can pay I will accept it. Thank you for your interest"
