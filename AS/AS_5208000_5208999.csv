Purchased for a project but no longer need it. Need to get it out of my garage!Made of very lightweight aluminum but is extremely strong. In good condition overall - some original stencils have been painted over and a small ding or two. Nothing that effects function. Outside front has 4 heavy duty latches, back has 4 hinges, sides have 2 carry handles. Also has a pressure relief valve, a humidity indicator and inside has 2 locking hold-open arms to keep the lid up when the case is open. Perfect case for storage, transporting, or shipping your large/expensive firearms like Barrett .50 cal riffles, machine guns, etc. Could be adapted to use as a gun safe and hold or transport several guns as well. There are many ""how to"" guides online about converting this to various things like rifle cases with wheels, Ammodor cigar humidors, gun safes, etc.The US government (our tax dollars) paid $2,500 each for these cases! That's very expensive for a case, but it housed and protected a Stinger Missile system, which cost $44,000. The Stinger contained very sensitive electronics and a high explosive fragmentation warhead......so these cases needed to be indestructible. I HAVE ALREADY REMOVED the foam original foam inserts so the inside is almost ready for your project - just needs to be cleaned up a bit (picture below shows the foam but again I removed it already...it had to be cut out).The case weighs 47 pounds, and it has the following exterior dimensions: 66 inches in length, 13 inches in depth, and 13.5 inches in height. The interior dimensions are: 63.75 inches in length, 11.125 inches in depth, and 13 inches in height. The bottom half of the case is 8 inches deep, and the top portion is 5 inches deep. Units in better condition sell for $375 - $500. Priced fairly at only $275 due to condition. That much less then I paid for it. I WILL SHIP - shipping will likely be $50-100 by UPS Ground.

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?The XD-S Single Stack from Springfield Armory has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you're used to in the XD and XD(M) lines can in the shockingly slim XD-S Single Stack - a pistol that packs so easily you'll forget it's there.The XD-S is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.The strengths of the XD-S 3.3 inch Single Stack doesn't stop there. Try it with an X-Tension magazine (7 Rounds) and you'll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics - complete with two interchangeable backstraps - allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System,  loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD pistols safe and easy to use.Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn't have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don't have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don't have to carry a gun to the store that you'd rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S 3.3 inch Single Stack in your hand today, and you'll want to shoot it.

The one-piece steel feed lip unit is permanently fixed to the polymer body. The steel is hardened so the dimensions will not change in long term storage or rough use. The PTFE coating ensures the steel will not rust. The polymer body is designed with an internal dimension that is a constant curve, combined with a no-tilt follower for maximum reliability in feeding 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition. The steel feed lip assembly and the polymer body are corrosion and chemical resistant. The floor plate slides off similar to a USGI magazine for cleaning and maintenance."

L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.  Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage.  An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.  The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few and is available in 10, 20 and 30 round capacity with a translucent or opaque polymer body.PayPal: For PayPal transactions please send us your PayPal email address and we will send you an invoice for the products you would like to purchase.

Specialized Superformance uses ultra progressive propellants that take your favorite SST or GMX bullets to levels of performance that are simply unattainable with conventional propellants. In order to get more velocity in the past – shooters have used a brute force approach – large charge weights of a slow burning powder in a larger cartridge case. Ultimately this leads to more recoil and muzzle blast. The Superformance solution is an elegant approach that utilizes specialized powders…at NORMAL charge weights, that impart ALL useable energy to the bullet reducing the ROCKET NOZZLE EFFECT at the muzzle while still increasing velocity! Versatile Superformance provides increased performance, and is safe to use in ALL firearms, including semi-autos*, lever gun and pump actions. Increases in rifle performance, no increases in barrel wear and felt recoil, along with superior temperature stability are all realized with Superformance ammunition."

Looks awesome. This is a big bore powerhouse that packs 10+1 rounds in but has almost the same grip size as the single stack 45 models. Comes with 2 mags and factory everything included. Looking to trade ONLY for other pistols in 9mm or 45. Prefer 9mm at this time. Please text me at REDACTED for questions or offers. Thank you.
