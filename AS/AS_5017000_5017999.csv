This was a guys competition garand.  He indicated it has a match barrel on it.  Like many of us, he moved up to a more rare Garand for bragging rights at his matches so this one got traded away.

As near as I can tell from everything out there, this should be around $1400-1500+ if I piece-mealed it, went to gun shows, put it up for auction, got a PhD in Garand history to know each minor variant, etc.  However, I'd rather just move it on to a better home so the first $1300 gets it all with the promise that if you tear it apart and it is a $2000 Garand, you never tell me about it ;)"
