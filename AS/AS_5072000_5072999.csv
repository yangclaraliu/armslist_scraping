It is built around a vault-tough cross-bolt action, a whole 3mm wider than its predecessor’s (the DT10) and therefore stronger and even more durable. The trigger has a truly custom feel, breaking at a crisp 3 ½ lbs--which minimizes muscular interference with your swing and results in many more broken targets. The center-mass of the DT11 is designed to be low and coaxial with the bottom barrel, giving this shotgun unmatched stability and greatly reducing muzzle rise. And with its premium-grade Steelium-Pro barrels and high-grade stock that can be tailored to the customer’s specifications, the DT11 was born and bred to keep the serious competitor on target and on the podium.http://www.calibersusa.com/beretta/beretta-dt11-12-gauge-jdt2p10-55053"

I could move and shoot on the move using this set up.  This package cost over 4500.00 to put together...and I am pricing it to sell fast at 2900.00.  I don't think I have ever seen a deal as good as this for such good equipment but I need to offset my recent expenses.  I am available to show or sell the package just about any time.  You can call or text REDACTED.Thanks for looking"

The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect.
If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16. Bring Enough Gun™"

If you live in the Stillwater area, I will help you load it AND help you unload it into your garage if you need assistance. It's a 2-man lift for sure. Not exactly a gun safe, but it is a very nice weapon/gear storage rack. These retail for almost $2,000 brand new and I absolutely hate to sell it but I have to. I am selling this one because I have not had time to fix the doors. The picture looks kind of weird because I took it at night and used my light bar on my truck for lighting. The rack itself is NOT discolored. I can send more pictures upon request. IF I fix it before it sells, the price will increase. They were slightly bent at the top during shipment and I figured I would buy it and fix it for personal use but I just can't find the time and do not have the proper tools to correctly bend the metal without beating it to s*** with a hammer. I want someone to actually use it for its intended purpose and be able to enjoy it. I just don't have enough boom sticks and gear to justify keeping it (I also have a wife now, which may or may not be another deciding factor here). As you can see in the picture, this thing is big. It can be removed from the rolling platform underneath it so it will be a foot or two shorter and it will also be flat on the ground instead of locking the wheels to ensure it doesn't move. Everything works and holds weapons/gear just fine, you just can't slide the doors open and closed right now without them hanging up on the tracks. If you are skilled with metal and tools or just want a hell of a deal for a sturdy weapons rack, feel free to contact me at 918-nine31-8five78. Sorry for the weird numbers, I'm tired of scammers. As stated earlier, if I fix it before it sells, the price WILL go up. I'm interested in trades/partial trades as well depending on what you have. Worst I can say is no. Price was $800, now $500 OBO. Low-ballers and scammers can go play in traffic."

The 92D came with the good looking slick slide that is free from a slide mounted safety or decocker so there is no chance of inadvertently activating the safety while releasing the slide, the trade off is that it does not have a decocker so with the FS parts installed the hammer must be thumbed down before holstering.   Gun comes with a frame parts kit, and original DAO hammer, 3 holsters, 4 mags, and the original box.  Trades considered listed below.  Contact me for more pictures.  Gun has been reliable in both configurations, I have owned it for over 12 years, and cannot recall a malfuntion that was not ammo related (dud round)."
