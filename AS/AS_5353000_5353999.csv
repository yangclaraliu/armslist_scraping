This beast of a semiautomatic pistol is chambered in .44 Magnum. Despite the massive cartridge it fires, the recoil on one of these is rather mild due to the weight (over 3 pounds) and the gas operation, which soaks up a lot of the recoil as well. This particular gun appears to be unused, just shows some very minor light scratches in the finish from handling. The gun is finished in matte black, a very durable and easy to clean finish and is equipped with a top picatinny rail. The pistol comes with three magazines, one black magazine from the era when it was made. The gun also comes with the manual, soft case, and factory box.I wish I didn't have to sell this must have piece to any handgun enthusiest but I need the money for a business venture!"

Its ergonomecs, perceived recoil, and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.Normally retails around $350Selling mine used for $150obo comes with 2 magazines, 1 carry-case, 50 rounds and 1 holster."

I haven't started it in a month but I know it will start and should be able to get to started pretty easily. I can pay a mechanic to put the clutch back and I will ask $850 for the bike. If you want to do it then $400 gets it today and no less. Will also trade for firearms. Carb was rebuilt and ran strong.
