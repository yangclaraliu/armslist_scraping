I love this gun, but sadly I got too many kids and too little time to keep this thing, so she's on sale. The M1919A4 is a lot of gun with a lot of history and she comes with a lot of parts and accessories to keep her up and running. THIS IS NOT the M1919A4 you see in a lot of other ads; this is a full system complete with tripod, belts, tools, accessories, etc. Included in this offer are the following: 1x M1919A4 .308 Semiauto MG This M1919A4 was assembled by Rapid Fire of Troy, Ohio Serial #11XX. This M1919A4 is .308 caliber, NOT .30-06. I dunno what the round count is, but 500-1000 is probably a good bet. 1x M2 tripod with Pintle and T&E This is a WWII reproduction by IMA USA and is supposed to be the most accurate repro out there. It comes complete with a WWII reproduction brass data plate riveted in place and is NOT post-war or Israeli model. Additionally, this is not one of those cheap tack-welded AIM sports Chinese knockoffs welded from cheap Maoist pot metal.  (please note, the Bren tripod next to the set on the right is not included in this sale.) 1x Weasel Winder hand crank firing device Bolts onto the side of the M1919 for rapid fire, sort of like a Gatling Gun. 1x .308 caliber linker Loads 20 links at a time. Will also link .30-06 and 8mm in Israeli links. 5x Canvas .308 belts Canvas USGI 100 round belts. 3 unused belts. 1 belt loaded with .308 ball. Another belt has a few dummy rounds for display purposes. 150x M13 .308 links These are your classic .308 links. 3x M13 Starter Tabs Occasionally billed as M60 MG tabs. 300x .Israeli links Sarco sells these as good for both .308 and .30-06 20x Starter Tabs Single piece metal strips with a small loop at one end and a large cartridge loop at the other. These used to be really hard to find, so I got a pile of them. 1x M1919A4 Lube Oil Can Steel USGI oil can. Looks like it was never used. 1x M1919A4 WWII M13 Spare Parts Roll USGI WWII issue green canvas 9 pockets. 1x M1919A4 extended charging handle New production.

Also included-a couple ammo crates to hold various and sundry items. For those truly interested, I can also make available a USGI WWII repro uniform, kit, pistol belts, GI pot, etc for an additional fee. That’s the whole shootin’ match. You get an awesome historic gun and you get it with a mountain of supporting accessories. And you get it at a time when M1919s seem to be drying up. I used to see a lot of them on sale, but not so much now.   Also, allow me to point out the Resident is trying to make guns much, much harder to buy-you better act now while you still can before this gun becomes history a second time. Thank you very much for looking! Terms- Cash face-to-face or Paypal and shipping to your FFL.  Buyer pays shipping and any other relevant charges.  If you're as hinkey about sending money to a total stranger as I am, I can also arrange to personally deliver to your FFL for inspection and transfer for a delivery fee   No sales to CA or other libtard anti-gun states. Buyer's responsible for knowing his state's laws."
