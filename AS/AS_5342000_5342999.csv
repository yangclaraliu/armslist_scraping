I do not have a set price in mind so please make an fair offer cash or trade. I have only included one pic, but I can get many more on request. I'm an easy guy to deal with so please send any questions or concerns you may have. I received these on trade and they all belonged to someone's great grandfather. I have not shot any of these yet, but all look to be in safe firing condition, timing seems right and all cycle very well. If someone  doesn't snatch these soon I might test that theory;)#1 is a Smith and Wesson  Model 1903 hand ejector (bottom of pic). This firearm is chambered in 32 s&w long, a 6 shooter, and is a very early  variant from what I  can tell.  Serial number starts with 15xxx and I believe  it was shipped around 1908. This is the original nickel finish  and I would say it is 50 -60% Nice set of aftermarket  pearl grips, decent bore, locks up tight and timing seems dead on. No original box or papers but this really  is a dandy. I would feel confident shooting  this revolver, you can tell it was built very well. Someone who is a smith fan will enjoy this, built on the popular small frame.#2 is an H&R 5 shot, auto ejecting top break revolver chambered in 38 S&W. (Top of picture) this gun is also very solid, awesome bore and cylinders and much of the original blued finish remains. I'd say the finish is 80%+ with an awesome  patina. Bullseye target grips, with logo. Trigger is heavy on this guy, but again I would feel confident  shooting  this gun, timing  seems  correct and hammer drops hard. This is an antique gun but still in great shape. #3 is an very  old Iver Johson top break 32 caliber revolver. Nickel Finish is rough on this one with some rust on the external of gun. ( the bore and cylinders look great) has the old owl head grips and is a very compact revolver. This one I'm not sure about shooting condition."

These date from the mid 1970's, they were my Father's, he's been gone a year now. They both need repaired and both have the same issue. The cylinder will move when the revolvers are cocked. They both need a simple spring. I ordered some springs from Wolff. They are sear/bolt springs, they really are more like spring steel. These revolvers are Colt single action clones, the problem is they were only imported for about 2 years. The replacement springs I ordered do not have enough of a radius in them, they need bent a little more. I ordered a 3 pack of springs and have played around with one of the springs bending it, and have it working for the most part, but not completely. I'm selling these as a pair, AS IS, they need work. They are very collectible, and the pair I have are a barrel length that is even more collectible, they have 4 5/8's barrels. I remember as a kid and young man, we shot them, they have handling marks, nothing serious, but we did shoot them. The broken spring issue is quite common. The serial numbers are very close, they are not consecutive, but close. The boxes are rough but I do have them, I also have a target he sent to Hammerli, and a letter and pin that they sent him back. These are pretty cool revolvers and highly collectible. They have not been fired in at least 25 years. I'll assume if you are looking, then you know what they are. I have taken a bunch of pics, but armslist will only allow 3.More pics on request to serious buyers, no pic collectors please.I cannot accept any trade offers on these, if you email me with a trade offer do not expect a reply.Also if the ad is up, then yes they are still available, I will not respond to an email asking if I still have them.  My email has been spammed one too many times, and it is usually an email asking me if I still have something.Another note, I had to list them as Colt, they are Colt single action clones, but there isn't an option for Hammerli or Interarms."

ITEM DESCRIPTION:
Colt rifle customers want the genuine article. They know that the story of today’s Colt commercial and sporting rifles began with the Stoner AR-15® design that Colt transformed into a military-grade rifle -- the Colt M16 automatic rifle. First deployed in the early days of the Vietnam War, the M16 followed in the footsteps of its Colt ancestors, establishing the quality, reliability and performance benchmarks by which all tactical military rifles have since been measured.
 
Nearly half a century has elapsed since the United States Government first fielded the Colt M16. Since that time Colt has never surrendered its position as manufacturer of the world’s preeminent combat rifles. During the War on Terror that followed September 11, 2001, American troops have increasingly been outfitted with the Colt M4 carbine, successor to the Colt M16 and proud bearer of the American and Colt military tradition.
 
Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.
 
This COLT Match Target HBAR is similar to the modern MT6700 configuration.
Caliber: .223 Rem
Capacity: Standard AR platform detachable magazine
Sights: Adjustable rear and front sights 
Features: A2 style upper, with fixed carry handle

A gun that could only come from Sig. The P320 elevates the standard for a striker-fired pistol with an exceptional trigger and a design as dependable as it is one-of-a-kind.

Disconnect Safety: Prevents the pistol from firing out of battery. 3-Point Takedown Safety System: 1. Must remove magazine. 2. Must lock slide to rear. 3. Rotate takedown lever for disassembly without tools or trigger manipulation.  The Most Adaptable Pistol Ever. No two hands - or scenarios - are quite the same.

This rifle only has 450 rounds through it so it is very close to new. The rifle will come with the original box, cleaning kit, Manuals, and pmag magazine. All of those are in new condition as well. The only reason I am selling is because I already own a Tavor and am looking to put money towards a new project. OD green is also harder to find right now, so this would be a sweet opportunity to pick one up in near new condition for less than the $1750 most people are asking brand new. I won't accept low ball offers. I also am not really looking for trades at this time.I am willing to meet F2F or at an FFL to ensure maximum safety. I prefer FFL to avoid sketchy situations. I will ship to your FFL if they accept from non-FFL. If meeting F2F, I will not sell to you without a valid Michigan I.D. I also will produce two copies of a bill of sale which will be signed and dated with the serial number of the firearm for both parties protection. I also am a CPL holder, so everything is okay on my end. If interested please contact me via email and we will go from there with discussion Thanks!"

ITEM DESCRIPTION:
100% Legal to own and use!
 
Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Comes with the Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions on the box. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.
 
Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.
 
The primary difference between the SSAR-15 SBS™ and the SSAR-15 OGR™ is the design intent. In an effort to cater to varying consumer preferences, the SSAR-15 SBS™ is designed to resemble current combat rifle stocks. In addition, the SSAR-15 SBS™ was designed with multiple accessories in mind which will be available in the near future.
 
With a traditional tactical style design, the second generation SSAR-15® stock adds rapid fire mode to your AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.
 
Features High Strength Polymer No Permanent Modifications Traditional Battle stock design Enables rapid fire mode
 
Compatibility Fits AR-15 with Carbine Style Buffer Assemblies. Compatible with mil-spec and most commercial buffer tubes. Most third party sling attachments are not compatible.  MSRP: $149.95 (Note that I am selling this for $100!!!)"

I acquired a 12' Semi V Boat from a guy at the beginning of winter. It was gutted and nothing done to it. I spent 3 months working on it and just dont have time for it. THIS BOAT IS WATER READY. It is tagged until 2017 and all I have to do is sign the card and hand it over to you. It didnt have a trilor but I have an old one laying around you can have. I also have an older 6hp motor that literally looks new on the inside. Great condition. You can finish my project by basically bolting down the seats I put in it and drilling the holes for the rod holers I have for the trolling set up. If you are a fisherman you will see this boat will be a great crappie or saugeye boat. Comes with new bilge pump (Needs mounted) rope lights(Needs mounted) cd player and marine speakers(Need mounted), I put seats that flip up for storage in it. It really is a must see. I am honestly looking to trade for a couple guns. If I was going to sell this I'd ask $1100.00. I am looking mainly for a glock 23 or 27 but prefer 23 and the other firearm could be?  Surprise me.

New plugs, new hoses, new fuel filter, air cleaner, a set of mulching blades and a set of high lift blades. I would recommend replacing is the plastic elbows where the hose meets the hydro's sometime. They seemed to have developed a small leak over the winter, dropping maybe 1/4 qt of oil since January. I fired it up last week and it was running a bit sluggish until it warmed up. My (smarter) buddy told me it would most likely be stretched idle springs on the throttle body or governor springs. Cheap fix, but I dropped the price to $1200 value because I haven't proved it."

The GP100 is built on a robust, medium/heavy frame of stainless steel. To withstand recoil from heavy 357 loads, a triple-locking cylinder is locked into the frame at the front, rear, and bottom so it stays aligned without getting sloppy over time. A full-length rib along the top of the barrel adds weight, and provides ample steel to dovetail the front sight, making the sight easily replaceable. The rear sight is fully adjustable for windage and elevation, and the factory ramp front sight is easily seen, while providing minimal interference when drawing the sidearm from a holster. (3"" barrel model has a fixed rear sight and a pinned front sight.) The angle of the GP100's peg-style grip frame, and the recoil cushioning Hogue® Monogrip®, greatly absorb recoil and allow the shooter to stay on target while firing the revolver in double-action mode. A full-length ejector rod shroud puts extra weight out front to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster sight acquisition on follow up shots. The Ruger GP100 has a smooth double-action trigger pull, and a clean, crisp break in single-action. Stainless steel construction provides corrosion resistance, and low maintenance in the backcountry. The solid frame of the GP100 has no side plate, and the revolver disassembles into large subassemblies with no tools, aiding to ease of maintenance in the field. As with all Ruger Double-Action Revolvers, the GP100 features the patented Ruger transfer bar mechanism that provides an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge—the revolver can be dropped directly on its hammer and will not fire without the trigger being pulled all the way to the back. The Ruger GP100 Double-Action Revolver is solidly built sidearm that will serve a lifetime of hard use.Manufacturer: RugerModel: GP100Action: Single/Double ActionCaliber: .357 MagnumCapacity: 6Barrel: 4"""
