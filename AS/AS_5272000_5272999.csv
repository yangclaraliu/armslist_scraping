$900 firm in cash.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or will ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

This is a John Browning design. The shot gun has a steel reciever and was manufactured in 1949. The 755A was Savage's first attempt to re-design the ""ugly hump"" of the Browning A5 and Remington 11, and to provide a better sight plane. It is almost exactly in parts and function to the A5 and Remington 11, John Browning's famous blowback design. The wood is excellent - no dings or scratches. The gun comes with two barrels: 29"" Improved modified and a 26"" Improved Cylinder (IC) choke barrels. The bores are excellent. A few very small dings on the 29"" barrel otherwise in great shape. The bores are excellent on both. The reciever has etched scroll designs on the top and sides. The receiver bluing was faded so it was treated with Steel F/X patina to simulate case hardening and has a hard laquer finish for protection.  A fancy grip cap has been added. The internal mechanism has been inspected and most pieces including the trigger group has been polished. It functions flawlessly - a great example of the history and evalution of John Browning's design legacy."

Not a scratch into the actual metal, it just made the finish smooth. See picture with red circle.

I received this brand new in case Springfield XD9 4"" Full Size Service Model 9mm pistol from my local gun shop last week after ordering it online. It is the ""essentials"" package which includes the Springfield XD9101HC 4"" Full Size Model 9mm Black pistol, two 16 round stainless steel magazines, bore brush, gun lock, plastic Springfield case, and manuals. This gun has never been fired since coming from the factory. The warranty information has not been registered with Springfield. 
I love the Springfield pistols, with the only reason I am selling this one is to purchase a new XDS 9mm that is more to my liking as far as size. 
From the Springfield website: ""The XD® 4″ Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD® 4″ Full Size has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD® 4” Full Size is the original XD® offering from Springfield Armory®, and the most basic XD®. This is the XD® that started it all.
The XD® 4″ Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4” Full Size. Where you point is where you shoot.""

The Kimber Solo DC (Deep Cover) is a beautiful DLC coated carry gun. It’s a 9mm, and it’s tiny. Barely used, only a few magazines shot through it, I just couldn’t bring myself to carry it because it was just too good looking.Can’t beat this deal, only asking $800 Or Best OfferIncludes two magazines.FTF Sale in St George, UTAH DL required to prove residency. Bill of sale must be signed.  The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-packaged size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the double action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare. SpecificationsCaliber: 9mmHeight (inches) 90° to barrel: 3.9Weight (ounces) with empty magazine: 17Length (inches): 5.5Magazine capacity: 6 roundsFrameMaterial: AluminumFinish: Matte Black KimPro IIWidth (inches): 1.14SlideMaterial: Stainless steelFinish: Matte Black DLCBarrelLength (inches): 2.7Material: Stainless steelTwist rate (left hand): 10SightsMeprolight Tritium 3-dot night sight, fixedRadius (inches): 4.4GripsMicartaCheckeredTriggerDouble action striker- firedFactory setting (approximate pounds): 7"

I don't know how to edit the ""shipping"" option but I will ship it with an FFL transfer.I built this rifle for long range shooting with a 62 grain bullet since that is the ""most common"" available for the 5.56. I built it with a semi tactical mindset  because of my military background. I spared no expense and bought quality parts from the gound up. I have never fired the weapon or even oiled it. It has been assembled over the past 3 years as my bank account would allow it. The final piece to my project was a Leopould MK4 scope so (as my dad puts it) I could count the hairs on a deers ass. I have more or less lost interest in the build and the price of the scope that I want has made it clear I wont ever finish it. So I am offering it to sale. The total invested is $1598 plus shipping costs for each piece on the rifle as I have stated I built over the past 3 years. A lot of the pieces on my rifle are either no longer available or are sold out. My price is pretty firm if sold outright
