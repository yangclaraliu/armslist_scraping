Gun has had the slide fitted (supper tight, but smooth like butter) with trigger trigger work, and has had Novak's rear sight and Novaks Gold bead front sight installed (all work done by Novaks).  Gold bead is amazing for picking up light.  I forget what grips I have on this Browning, but they weren't cheap as well. 

Gun has about 500 rounds through her over the years, no issues.

$1,050 and this includes the gun will shipping from my FFL to your FFL in it's original box.

For face to face private sale in NC, $1,000 (all NC laws followed).

I lost the paperwork from Novak's years ago, thus the reason for the lower price (I have no proof that the work was done). 

However….

If the firearm does not leave your FFL (they don't transfer it over to you), you can send the pistol back for a full refund if you aren't satisfied with the pistol (you however pick up the shipping back to my FFL)

Gun will also ship with 2- 13 round mags and 1 - 15 round mags, all Mec Gar's, who still at this time is the factory OEM supplier of Browning Hi Power mags (100% reliability with mags).

Trade value is $1,200

Trades interests are in handguns in 9mm, prefer Sig's 226/229's or Springfield XD's in 9MM as well.  Rifles anything black, but prefer factory stock, no 50% or more builds please.  CZ Scorpion as well.  I have hands on the small size, so prefer a handgun with smaller grips.

Cash can be supplied by myself if trade value on your end is higher, and cash is expected on your end if your trade value is lower.

My FFL is a brick and mortar shop with a e-store front as well, and knows me by name.  I've come across alot of shady people on gun selling sites.  Have no problem confirming who I am (I just love people, who before you ask any questions want to know how fast you'll send the check, and they have a google voice mail box with a PO address and they'll never call you, only text you).  I'm not a flake and have been a registered member here since 2012.

Any questions, don't hesitate to ask.  All e-mails will be resonded to within 48 hours.  

Needless to say, please ensure the gun and magazines are allowed in the state where you reside.

	Hello Everyone, 
I have available for trade/sale a lot of Thermold AK47 30rd Magazines. These are in unused condition and just have handling marks from shipping/storage. These would be a great way to stock up on more magazines for one of the most fun sporting rifles out there for cheaper than elsewhere. Here is what I have:
-28x Thermold AK47 30rd magazines- $10 each 
	I would also consider trades on these. Mostly looking for PMR/CMR30 magazines, certain 22 magnum ammunition, 7.62x39 HP ammunition, CZ P-09 Magazines, or firearms. Just shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here if you would like to pick up some or make a trade offer. Need to meet in Norman on these.
Thanks for your time and happy hunting,
