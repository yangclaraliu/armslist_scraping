The P-83 was designed as a sidearm for the Polish police and Polish military, and in production from 1983 up to 2000. This P-83 is a single-action/double-action chambered for the 9mm × 18 Makarov round. The construction is all steel with hard rubber grips with a great feel and excellent balance. The trigger pull in Double Action is nice and smooth and the Single Action trigger pull is light and crisp. If you’re looking for a conceal carry weapon the P-83 would work well, especially considering the price. It’s about the same size as a Walther PPK but a little wider in the grip and slide. I’m attracted to these older Eastern European Cold War era arms. I’m as interested in the history of the gun as I am the gun itself.This P-83 is a fantastic shooter, very accurate and field strips ridiculously quick and easily for cleaning. Really, it's a pleasure to shoot this beautiful piece of cold war history.To buy the gun you’ll need a current Wisconsin driver’s license and be at least 18 years of age."

The SureFire X400U-A-RD Ultra WeaponLight integrates powerful, high intensity 500 lumen white light illumination and high visibility laser aiming capabilities in one compact rail mountable package, an extremely effective combination for close to longer range engagements in law enforcement, military, and self-defense applications. 

A high performance LED generates 500 lumens of brilliant white light that is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a beam with a bright central area, providing greatly extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The X400 Ultra produces tactical level lightÃ�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark adapted visionÃ�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

The X400 Ultra's laser is located below the primary light, and its aiming adjustment mechanism uses Nylok screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The X400U-A-RD Ultra features our original high visibility 5-milliwatt / 635 nm red laser.

The versatile X400 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock system permits rapid attachment/detachment to either universal or Picatinny rails. Its integral ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional DG grip switches are available for use with a pistol, and an XT07 tape switch permits the X400 Ultra to be activated when attached to a long gun without altering your grip on your weapon. 

The high strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture.

Three of the four variants were sold with an attached Picatinny rail for mounting optics or accessories and the bottom forward edge of the forend is also drilled to accept an accessory rail. These shotguns are sold with their Tri-bore barrel which is a deep-drilled, machined barrel with three separate internal bore profiles. Beginning at the chamber and forcing cone, the bore is enlarged to .7401"" to soften recoil while the second profile is in the middle of the barrel gradually choking down to .7244"" to emulate a cylinder bore profile to increase velocity. The final bore is the FABARM choke system which consists of standard choking followed by a cylinder profile at the muzzle which serves to improve shot patterns and distribution.  The muzzle is threaded to accept one of five different chokes or a muzzle brake/compensator. Some models were sold with a ventilated barrel shroud.  Features of the weapon include a chrome-plated trigger, slide release, and shell carrier. There is also an oversized triangular push-button safety. The trigger group is held in the receiver by two pins which makes removal for cleaning and maintenance very easy."

Looking to trade. Call or text with any questions. REDACTED.Trades I'm looking for TavorScar with cash or other firearms on my endKrebs custom akThe Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 Lightweight, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4V11 LW is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Lightweight profile barrel, making it almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip."
