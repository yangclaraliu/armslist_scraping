I apologize for that. Hello all, I have a nice AR15 up for sale. I've never fired it - it looks like they test fired it once or twice at the factory. It's made by Radical Firearms. I'll cover some of the basics. It's a 1/7 twist 16 inch barrel chambered in 5.56/.223. It's got a mil spec buffer tube and an ergo grip, as well as an aluminum free float rail. The barrel end is threaded but it has a birdcage flash hider on it. It's got forward assist and a bolt release. It's got a Vortex Diamondback HP 2-8x32 scope on it, which I think is perfect for the AR platform. The scope is a high end and fully featured one. It's reticle is the Dead-Hold BDC. Vortex's website has more info on the optics, and Radical's site has more info on the rifle. The scope is mounted on Leupold rings which also are really nice. Since I haven't fired it, it hasn't been sighted in yet. I've read these will shoot sub MOA. That sounds optimistic to me but it's agreed that these are very accurate. I know is it's a quality build. The handrail is free floated, and it has many other high end features. I'm looking to sell the whole package. This includes the rifle, one Troy Battlemag (30rd) magazine, scope, rings, rifle case (a nice Plano padded hard case), all of the Vortex original packaging (which includes cloth, covers, etc.), scope ring allen wrench, gun lock, etc. I simply would rather have cash than the rifle at the moment. I'm sure I didn't cover everything here. Feel free to email me with questions. It's a really solid AR - I hope somebody can enjoy it more than me! The pics attached are of my rifle and everything it includes. Not pictured is the Vortex box and manuals, etc. Payment in cash and I'd need to see a PTC and a valid ID/DL. Thanks!"

It is best for applications where minimum size is the highest priority but good suppression is still required.  The ULTRA 5 will suppress a typical .308 bolt-action rifle down to approx 143-145 dB1. The ULTRA 5 weighs only 7.6 ounces and is just 5 inches long. The ULTRA 5 is also perfect for .300 Blackout rifles. A 16-inch bolt-action .300 Blackout will be suppressed down to 133-135 dB with subsonic ammunition.  The ULTRA series represents a revolutionary improvement in titanium precision rifle suppressors.Compared to the prior 30P-1/30CB9 series, the ULTRA series is 25-30% lighter, 4-5 dB quieter, and much stronger. The ULTRA series holds the same precision and repeatability as the 30P-1/30CB series.The ULTRA series is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded core. This material and construction provide a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out. With the CB mount, (included) the suppressor mates to a conical shoulder on the brake and locks up rock solid and extremely tight. In direct thread configuration, the ULTRA suppressors use a heat-treated 17-4 thread insert and initial blast shield. The ULTRA series suppressors also have the flexibility to be changed from direct thread to CB mount and vice versa via a simple factory service operation, in case your needs change. This is accomplished by removing or replacing the default brake from the direct thread version."

The ULTRA series holds the same precision and repeatability as the 30P-1/30CB series.The ULTRA series is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded core. This material and construction provide a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out. With the CB mount, (included) the suppressor mates to a conical shoulder on the brake and locks up rock solid and extremely tight. In direct thread configuration, the ULTRA suppressors use a heat-treated 17-4 thread insert and initial blast shield. The ULTRA series suppressors also have the flexibility to be changed from direct thread to CB mount and vice versa via a simple factory service operation, in case your needs change. This is accomplished by removing or replacing the default brake from the direct thread version."

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration.  The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional."

If you're reading this ad, you probably already know about this gun. It's simply AWESOME. I can only afford one gun at the moment, so I'd like to sell it for something more compact. This is easily my favorite gun I've ever owned, and when I have a chance I'm definitely going to get one again someday. It has an awesome double action trigger when it's decocked, and a super super nice crisp and light single action trigger when it's cocked. This means it also has restrike capability. I just wish they made a compact version. It's just so damn nice. The machining is of as high a standard if not better than most higher end guns I see (HK, etc.). Mine includes everythong originally included. The gun, a holster, the manual, a lock, two 17rd magazines, etc. People are starting to pick up on how awesome these are - seriously do a little research and you'll understand why! I've included stock photos, but mine has shot about a hundred rounds. I can take and send pictures if you like. It's in effectively perfect shape. Shoot me an email for more info! Cash only and PTC and valid ID required. Thanks!"

SIONICS Director of Operations, K.L. Davis told us “it’s kind of tough in a way… we focus on what’s inside, the parts that matter to how the gun runs” – picking up one of the their Patrol Model rifles he added – “we don’t do a lot of glitzy stuff on the outside, so to just look at the rifle you can’t see what makes it tick… to do that, you’ve got to shoulder it and get some trigger time.”  He went on to tell us that their mantra is “The Barrel, The Bolt and The Trigger… we give you the best combination of those parts that can be found on a production gun.”  When asked for more detail on those parts, Davis told us that SIONICS either makes or has made to their specifications the best parts that they can find for the heart of the rifle, among some of the things mentioned were a standard after-market trigger, plated bolt carriers and premium barrels."

Springfield accidently put two in the box instead of one to your benefit. This is from my personal collection and for serious collectors only. If you want a weekend can shooter DO NOT PURCHASE THIS RIFLE. You can get something a little less nice for that. Again, this is for the serious collector. It comes with two new magazines (It originally only came with one). YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS RIFLE. YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER ONE THAN THIS. I do not sell or deal in junk, only prestine collector pieces. Look at the pictures. You want the best, here it is. Please ask all questions before bidding.
