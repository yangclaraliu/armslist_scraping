But it is at the shooting range that this double/single-action compact handgun will truly wow you: thanks to its rotary barrel system, recoil dissipates radially, resulting in much less thump in your hand and super-fast follow-up shots.As you read this, the PX4 Storm in its various configurations is being carried by countless law-enforcement and military organizations around the world, in every environment imaginable. This is because it is engineered to be absolutely reliable and ultra-durable, and it is capable of shooting well over 100,000 rounds without any part breakage. And its dimensions that fall right in between the full-size PX4 Storm and its sub-compact counterpart make it perfect for everyday holster carry (concealed or open), offering light weight and smaller proportions while still affording a full grip. The Px4 Storm Compact offers a plethora of features that make it easily adaptable to your preferences. Its modular construction allows you to interchange backstraps to perfectly fit your hand and shooting style, while the slide lock and safety are ambidextrous; in addition, the magazine release is reversible, meaning that you can easily train with and use your PX4 with either hand.

The Crimson Trace proven laser sight technology is the single best way to enhance the overall performance and accuracy of a DB380. So you can feel safe knowing you will hit the target every time. Mine is in great shape. Only about 300 rounds through it, which is the break in recommendation. There is a little wear on the slide and a little on one of the mags. Other than that everything is like new. The Crimson Trace Laser activates when you squeeze the grip, and will turn off when you relax your grip. In my opinion, this is the best type of laser, because there is no switch to turn on or off. Simply squeeze to turn on and relax the grip to turn off. This one is the Red laser. The laser alone sells for $200 on Midway and has a 4.8 out of 5 star review. I also added a “Clip Draw”clip that easily clips to your belt, a pocket, whatever. The clip can be removed without a trace, if you don't like it. This is a great carry gun. Easily clips to the inside of your pants or pocket and is very comfortable. Comes with the original box, trigger lock w/ keys, instruction book, two 6 round magazines, the Crimson Trace laser, and the gun. Transfer at a gun shop of your choice. You pay the transfer and background check fees. Asking $350"

It has functioned flawlessly since purchased new (original owner here), and has no problems whatsoever. 

It comes with all the original items:
-Px4 Storm Compact, with rotating barrel design
-Original hardshell box
-2 10 round magazines
-unused beretta branded lock
-owners manual and warranty guide

There is currently a rubberized Talon Grip branded Px4 storm custom grip tape installed on the grip. Talon grips are $19, and it was expertly installed. If you want to remove it after purchase, simply peel it off. Talon grips leave no residue when removed. 

Please note this is the COMPACT version. Px4 comes in three sizes, Full Size, Compact and Sub-compact. Subcompact does NOT have the rotating barrel design and is actually thicker than this compact version. This compact DOES have the rotating barrel, and as a result it is the softest recoiling 9mm I have ever fired. This gun has a smooth Double Action first shot (unless manually cocked or slide cocked), then a super crisp single action trigger. A joy to shoot. 

Also for sale, is a brand new, unopened, original Beretta parts conversion kit to covert this Type F Px4 to a Type G. The Type G is not typically available in the USA. Type G has low profile safety levers and slide stop levers. The Type F has more pronounced safety and slide stop, and the safety functions as both a full safety and a decoker. 
This conversion kit will turn the levers into low profile levers (ideal for CC), and also turn the slidemounted safety into a docker only (optional for CC, as thumb safties are a matter of personal preference). There is not need to install this kit, it is just an option as I have it for sale also. Purchased directly from Beretta for $69. 

Price for the Px4 Package: $415
Price for the Type G conversion kit: $30
Price for all: $435

Cash only. Must meet at Johnson's Country Store in Lockport to complete NICS background check paperwork. They are great for transfers and actually only charge the buyer the $10. Other places, if they do it at all, charge $40-60. 

My price is the lowest on armslist for the Compact version."

Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."

Holsters: I recently bought an LAG holster and it replaced both my concealed and open carry holsters

First is a basic blackhawk holster without the button lock. Works fine, comes in box with both belt loop and paddle attachments 10$.

Second holster is an alien gear holster. These are great because they offer a lifetime warranty and free shell trades if you get a new gun. This originally had a shell for a full sized M&P, then I swapped it for a ruger lc9, then swapped again for this shield shell, all for free. This holster comes with a ""custom"" rear shell I made when I fancied myself a kydex maker, so it actually has more retention than a regular alien gear. 30$ takes it, which is comparable to buying one new without the wait time and or the inner shell

Belt is an EDC low profile with velcro liner by SOE or Special Operation Equipment. You can check them out on youtube, they have tons of reviews that speak to their quality. This belt is a size 34 meaning if you wear size 34 pants it is designed to fit. I got it when I was a size 36-38 so it adjusts outward a bit. Belt is in perfect shape, I bought this and a different SOE belt with a different buckle and just chose the other one. The female velcro liner makes the belt even more rigid and is designed to accept male velcro tabs on holster loops to keep the holster from sliding around 50$ takes it. 

If you buy the belt and the alien gear, ill throw in the blackhawk holster for free."

The Colt 1991 Series is a direct descendant of the original Colt M1911. A long trigger, flat mainspring housing and original style recoil spring system remain from the original M1911 design. Upgrades from the original include white dot sights and a lowered ejection port for extra reliability. It still remains “the standard” that everyone tries to imitate, but no one duplicates.

Like New 14+1 45acp EAA SAR K2 45acp or trade YOU DONT WANT TO MISS THIS. 
North Port, Florida 
Like New EAA Sar K2. 14+1 shot 45acp. Bought last month. Nice smooth double action, great single action, adjustable sites, like new - 50 rounds fired. Most sites selling for $490+ cdnn is cheaper if they still have them. Only going to seek or trade to get something I want more. My son likes the 1911 better than this and I don't want another 45. I prefer 9mm. Will as cash for the right guns. $349 cash or trade. 
This gun is very very similar to the Browning Hi Power and the CZ 75. It is larger but not as large as you would imagine. The grip circumfirance is only 1/8"" larger on the double stack 45acp SAR K2 than the double stack Browning Hi Power in 9mm. I have a picture for comparison attached to the comments - they are virtually the same width. The K2 feels only slightly more secure because of the added grip space. The stock grips are good and could probably be textured by someone with a hankerin or a someone with the cash to pay someone to do it for them - they are polymer so sprinkle texturing would make the best option imo. This gun is double action - better than the BHP in that way. Adjustable sights, just like the BHP. Clean crisp single action trigger - like the BHP (after a 85$ trigger job). It is a gun that offers the stopping power of the 45acp (not 45acp +P) NOT +P!. With all of the features and quality fit and finish like the Browning for about 40% of what the Browning will cost you new. It is a great value.

 MIAMI CLASSIC SHOULDER SYSTEM

 The Miami Classic is quite possibly the most imitated shoulder holster system in the world. A direct descendant of the original shoulder system first introduced by Galco in 1970 (then the Famous Jackass Leather Company), the Miami Classic has since become the favorite of professionals worldwide. 

 A key component of this shoulder system is its spider harness. All four points of the spider harness pivot independently and are connected by our unique clover shaped Flexalon™ swivel back plate, which is a Galco trademark. This results in a perfect fit and lasting comfort for all sizes and shapes. 

 This system is constructed of premium saddle leather and includes holster, harness, ammo carrier and a set of system screws. The Miami Classic is fully modular. Optional accessories and components may be purchased separately.   I also have two new fur hats for sale starting at $110.00 ."

It is built with a G34 slide width on a G21 Gen4 frame and is 1.5 ounces lighter than the G21 Gen4. The longer barrel and slide on the G41 Gen4 help to reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil, while the longer sight radius makes it more accurate for competition or duty use. The surface of the frame employs the scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. The modular backstrap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. Glock engineers have developed the Glock Modular Optic System (MOS) to simplify mounting of popular optics without costly custom machining of the pistol's slide. The MOS is offered with cover plate when no optic is mounted and four plates options to comply with the specifications of some of the most trusted optic manufacturers in the industry. MOS gives you the option of adding tall iron sights allowing the optic and the iron sights to co-witness.Brand new in box, sold by FFL."
