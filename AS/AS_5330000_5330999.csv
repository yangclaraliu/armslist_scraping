You can text me, call at REDACTED if you rather. If not please email me & I will get back to you the same day. I have 60 Magazines left but have more if you're the person who sells a lot of AR accessories. I'was selling them for $12.00+shipping on eBay but they got complaints from Anti Gun members. I'm asking $9.00 each but bulk price is $7.00 which is what I paid for them. I'm also looking for another Hi point 995TS, Hi Point 995 [older model as long as it's not all worn out & is in good working order], which could make it a better deal for both of us. If you do have what I'm looking for, it would be a private deal. I do carry a CCW so we can do our own dated paperwork, meaning we each have a copy with our information included. I've done it before. I did buy a couple Ruger mini 14 & the owner would only do it at a gun shop. I ended up being charged tax & their fee for doing the transaction, so that is why I'll only do this between seller & buyer. I have son & a grandson so it's for them when we go to the range period. I have other rifles & shotguns for them to use to hunt with.Back to the Magazines: By Bulk, I mean groups of 20 magazines. I'm trying to keep it as low as I can so if you plan on reselling them, you could still make money. I originally bought these Magazines in order to complete a rifle transaction, or I would have only bought 30 Magazines. If you live to far from Waterford, I will ship for the price of the shipping. These Magazines have never been used."

The P30SK completes the P30 full size series with a further first class defence weapon in an extremely compact design. In addition to it's reknown reliability, the P30SK is especially notable for its completely redesigned pistol grip ergonomics. The easily interchangeable grip shells (right/left) are a unique feature of the weapon. Together with the interchangeable back strap, this means that the pistol provides maximum configurability to any hand size - for both men and women. The standardised Picatinny rail according to MIL-STD-1913 at the front of the pistol grip provides greater flexibility when mounting additional tactical accessories. The P30SK is an ideal backup weapon for military and law enforcement users as well as for private security and bodyguards. In particular the compact design allows for a concealed and inconspicuous carry weapon.

The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle. But aside from the caliber, this .22 LR rifle is virtually identical to the centerfire version as far as operations, controls, accessorization and customization options. A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.  Ambidextrous Controls A serious training rifle should always mirror the “real thing” in the way its controls work. This is why the ARX160 features ambidextrous two-position safety, magazine release and cocking handle. With this rifle, you can easily train and shoot with either hand dominant and improve your skills without breaking the bank.        Limitless Accessorization, Customization Options This training rifle is a great base for building the tactical system of your dreams. It comes out of the box with four Picatinny rails: on top, a full rail enables you to easily attach your favorite sighting or optics system, while on either side and on the bottom of the fore-end additional rails let you add other accessories such as tactical lighting. Other customization options include the telescopic folding stock: you can adjust the length of pull at the touch of a button, while the stock can be folded partially or all the way to accommodate most firing situations.    Durable, Easy to Shoot and Maintain The ARX160 is built to be durable and super-tough, being constructed of superior steel and technopolymer. Its flip-up sights are just like those on the full-caliber rifle—super-light but rugged, and featuring a rear diopter for quick and accurate target acquisition. Maintenance is easy thanks to the simple way in which it comes apart and is reassembled without any tools. Whether you use it on its own as a rimfire tactical rifle, or as a training tool to improve your handling of the full-power counterpart, the ARX160 will always turn heads at the range and will never let you down."

The P-01 9mm was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.
 
The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01 are completely interchangable with every other P-01, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
 
Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!
 
For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public.
