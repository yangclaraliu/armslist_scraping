Package deals w/ holster magazines considered.Interested in a 9mm or .40 S&W, Ruger or Walther even possibly Taurus (close price range). Trying to steer clear of Hi-Points/Jiminez and other lower end pistols and any caliber smaller than 9mm. She's a smaller individual so something that would be a good fit in a smaller set of hands is preferred. She's a Vet and has carried an M9 as one of her service weapons on USAF Security Forces. She said they were a bit bulky for her - so she's interested in something with a smaller frame.But possibly a larger frame that accepts single stacks will be considered if it's fitting.Shes had loan of my pistol for a while and is wanting to purchase her own. She is a primary VT resident 5 days a week and teaches in Hanover so she does not need a CCP in her home state - but will do an FFL transfer if it's what your preference is.Let me know what you have and your asking price. Thanks!She knows what she wants and is very specific on this, she's just not familiar with purchasing firearms.

This top of the line take-down rifle comes with 3 different barrels, (1-270 Winchester, 2-300 Winchester magnum and 3-416 Remington magnum). With this setup you are covered for anything from long range light skinned game all the way to heavy African hunting. The first 2 barrel each have their own 3-12 x 50 D Swarovski scopes with Ballistic turret attachment. The 416 barrel has iron sights and a muzzle break. There are 2 complete bolts, one for the 270 and one for the magnums. The 416 barrel also has it's own forearm for the heaver barrel contour. The stock has a “kick-stop” recoil reducer. The Blaser R93 Luxus is a top of the line straight pull bolt action hunting rifle from Germany. The locking system of the R93 bolts in a straight line without rotational movement in the barrel. When repeating, the body movement is minimized. The process is faster than with conventional actions, allowing more time to aim and re-aim for subsequent shots. This is a particular advantage on drive and big game hunts. The safety system is also very advanced in that the firing pin is not cocked when on safe. Immediately prior to firing a shot, the firing pin spring is cocked by pushing the safety slide forward. This movement is virtually silent and will not alert game to your presence. If no shot is fired, simply return the safety slide to its original position for maximum safety."

Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back. Period. No questions asked.  Attorney Christopher Gasper: 614-845-1923 or chris@gasperlegal.com  http://www.gasperlegal.com/nfa-trust/  What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.  As an Ohio lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!  This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.  I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.  Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.   What the Trust includes:  - The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages) - Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms) - Appointment of Trustee (1 Page) - Trustee resignation (1 Page)  I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.  Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***  Attorney Christopher Gasper www.gasperlegal.com chris@gasperlegal.com 614-845-1923  25 E.

546,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5350546,For Sale:  BLASER R93 3 BARRELS,"South Carolina, South Carolina, United States","$ 3,200","Listed On: Wednesday, April 6, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This rifle is an estate item and appears to be unfired since purchase. This top of the line take-down rifle comes with 3 different barrels, (1-270 Winchester, 2-300 Winchester magnum and 3-416 Remington magnum). With this setup you are covered for anything from long range light skinned game all the way to heavy African hunting. The first 2 barrel each have their own 3-12 x 50 D Swarovski scopes with Ballistic turret attachment. The 416 barrel has iron sights and a muzzle break. There are 2 complete bolts, one for the 270 and one for the magnums. The 416 barrel also has it's own forearm for the heaver barrel contour. The stock has a “kick-stop” recoil reducer. The Blaser R93 Luxus is a top of the line straight pull bolt action hunting rifle from Germany. The locking system of the R93 bolts in a straight line without rotational movement in the barrel. When repeating, the body movement is minimized. The process is faster than with conventional actions, allowing more time to aim and re-aim for subsequent shots. This is a particular advantage on drive and big game hunts. The safety system is also very advanced in that the firing pin is not cocked when on safe. Immediately prior to firing a shot, the firing pin spring is cocked by pushing the safety slide forward. This movement is virtually silent and will not alert game to your presence. If no shot is fired, simply return the safety slide to its original position for maximum safety."

This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.
With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the double action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.
Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare."

The plate carriers are adjustable from Small up to XX-Large MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs. The measurement of the plates are 1/4"" also not to mention tested by the U.S Army test labs. This particular armor is made to military spec and it is designed to withstand higher caliber rounds. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at The Mil-A-46100 plates at 30 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun still no penetration. This will not fail as this is one of the best quality steel out there. This is much more sophisticated steel compared to AR500, AR500 is level 3 and is target material. Our Armor is Level 4. I've shot at our Mil-A-46100 Armor multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up.

995,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5350995,For Sale:  	WWII WW2 BYF 42 LUGER P08 NAZI MARKED,"Beavercreek, Dayton, Ohio","$ 1,200","Listed On: Tuesday, April 12, 2016",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"BYF 42 Nazi marked Luger. Numbers do not match, three different sets of numbers. The barrel and slide match and the lower match. The finish is exceptional with good strawing, I'm a collector and I'm willing to look past the mis-match, the action is smooth and everything fits exact. I believe this to be a field assembled Luger. The bore has good lands and grooves and is in excellent conditon. The magazine fits tight it may need serviced or replaced. This is not an import and it has NOT been reblued. Perfect for the collector who still likes the history and needs a good shooter."
