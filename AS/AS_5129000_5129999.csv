This pistol was so accurate, that it pushed my legendary SIG 210 9mm to the selling block several years ago. I don't shoot that much any more, so I just decided to see if some other gun enthusiast might be interested? I don't need to sell any of my guns, so my asking price will be my selling price. This gun is still like new and comes with everything that it came with from the Custom Shop when I ordered it. $1750 CASH or multiple pistol trades with “boot” or AK-47 variants with “boot.” Please no junk or anything that you can't sell already on your own. This gun is for the person that wants only the “BEST” and can afford it. You won't find one of these in your local gun store.When ever I decide to sell one of my high end guns, I offer the following: Come take a look at my gun, and if you like it, I will give you up to 60 days to sell your gun/guns to come up with the remaining balance. I am a gun enthusiast and not a gun dealer or collector. I can make this statement, and that is, ""it will sell to the first person that comes and looks at it?"" The Pro-Tek I begins life as a CZ 75 Compact D PCR pistol. Once it is turned over to the custom shop in Mesa, Arizona the transformation begins! They completely de-horn the pistol. They replace the original rubber grips, and blend a set of textured aluminum grips into the frame, so that the fit of the grips is perfect. This lessens the width of the pistol from 1.34 inches in its original PCR configuration to 1.14 inches in the Pro-Tek I version. The slimmer grip frame seems to accentuate the curve of the back-strap as it melts into your hand.The slide is given an octagonal cut with a flat top, and this completely changes the lines of the pistol giving it a streamlined appearance. This pistol also has excellent three-dot night sights. The rear sight is a low profile wedge type, that is adjustable for elevation.The de-cocker has been cut back to make it less obtrusive without sacrificing its function or ease of manipulation by the shooter. CZ’s competition hammer is also installed on the Pro-Tek I model. The slide is given an anodized Bronze/Gold finish, and the aluminum frame is manufactured with a glossy polycoat finishAll of the controls (de-cocker, slide stop lever and magazine release) on the pistol are in easy reach of your right thumb. The magazine release button is slightly extended but smooth and de-burred; when it is activated the magazines fall free. The magazine well has been beveled to augment the process of recharging the pistol with a fresh magazine. All in all, there is very little they didn’t think of to attain their goal of making the Pro-Tek I the ultimate CCW pistol. This gun has the smoothest DA trigger pull that you will ever experience on any gun, and the SA trigger pull when cocked, breaks like my Custom Les Baer 1911.As wonderful as this pistol is to hold and look at, the best experience comes once you hit the shooting range. Whether you are shooting standard or +P loads the Pro-Tek I handles recoil beautifully. The grip frame spreads the recoil evenly across the web of your hand and between the textured grip panels and the beavertail the pistol stays centered in your grasp. Between the recoil handling aspects of the pistol and the short reset trigger, it sure makes for easier and accurate follow-up shots.As far as accuracy goes, if you like all of your rounds to produce one gapping hole in the target then you will like firing the Pro-Tek I.Take a look at the factory supplied test target."

I’m not asking for any monies up front all will be handled thru a local Albany Attorney.This is a long story but, to make it short my weapons were confiscated by the NYSP. Everything has been returned to me with the exception of my assault weapons. I cannot legally take possession of them as they were not registered under the Safe Act. What I am looking for is for someone to either take them and sell on a consignment basis, or buy outright. I have contacted a few gun shops and they don’t seem want to get involved. It would entail going to the NYSP barracks, possibly with my attorney, and having them signed over to you by the state police. The weapons involved are as follows:UZI Model A 9mm (late 70’s to very early 80’s manufacture) with original box and manual,which have the serial # of the weapon on themBushmaster XM15-E25 .223 cal W/BIPOD AND 3-9 SCOPE (POSTBAN)Bushmaster XM15-E25 .223 cal W/Holographic site and 5 point sling (PREBAN)Auto Ordinance 1927 A1 Deluxe .45 cal (Hurley Model)Beretta Storm CX4 9mm THIS IS NO JOKE!I really don’t want to let these sob’s keep them.Send me an email if interested and we’ll work out the details."

Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back. Period. No questions asked. Attorney Christopher Gasper: REDACTED or REDACTED http://www.gasperlegal.com/nfa-trust/ What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property. As an Ohio lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME! This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs. I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless. Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms. What the Trust includes: - The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages) - Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms) - Appointment of Trustee (1 Page) - Trustee resignation (1 Page) I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible. Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information*** Attorney Christopher Gasper www.gasperlegal.com REDACTED REDACTED 7652 Sawmill Road Suite #166 Dublin, Ohio 43016"
