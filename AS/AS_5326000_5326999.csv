National Match front and rear adjustable sights are complimented with a $350 Springfield Armory 7.62 Government Model 6x 40mm rifle scope and $100 Springfield Armory M1A scope mount - both included. Will also include several 20-round CMI USGI and Tapco poly magazines with carry pouches. Complete with original retail packaging. High-resolution images and data sheet are available upon request.

Weaver Tactical 1-7x24mm Dual-Focal Plane w/ Mdr Reticle, 800384
Manufactured to the strictest tolerances, Weaver® Tactical scopes are built to perform in the harshest environments. The new 1-7x24mm Tactical Scope features Dual-Focal Plane MDR technology that integrates the close-range, quick targeting of a second focal plane (SFP) illuminated dot with the medium- to long-range versatility of a first focal plane (FFP) mil-dot reticle. In this unique design, the SFP dot is slaved to the FFP etched-glass reticle to offer maximum versatility for competition, tactical and sport shooters.  For close range, and super-fast target acquisition, the scope offers true 1x power and a 4-MOA, daylight visible red dot that remains the same size at any power. This dot can be turned off for clear viewing of the Mil-Dot Ranging (MDR) reticle. The MDR reticle is placed in the first focal plane, so it sizes along with the image as magnification is increased or decreased. Additionally, ranging calibrations are valid at any magnification. The scope has a rugged 34mm, one-piece tube and a unique interchangeable magnification throw lever for user adjustability for mission- and competition-specific configuration
Features of Weaver 1-7x24mm Tactical Scope with Dual-Focal Plane MDR Reticle:
Powerful 7-time magnification
Rugged 34mm, one-piece tube
.1 mil click adjustments
Dual-focal plane reticle design incorporates a SFP illuminated dot and FFP reticle
Glass-etched Mil-Dot Ranging reticle in FFP
Illuminated dot is daylight bright
Illuminated dot side turret has 11 brightness settings with an “off” setting between each “on” setting
Extra battery compartment built into each turret cap (2x)
True 1x low magnification power for both-eyes-open shooting
Turrets can be reset to zero
Comes with two sizes of interchangeable magnification throw levers – ideal for competition use
Covered by Weaver's lifetime warranty"
