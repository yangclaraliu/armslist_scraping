One tool, any job.   The Sphinx SDP Compact Sand is a duty-sized pistol for the most discerning of shooters. The SDP Compact Sand features a full anodized aluminum lower frame, which gives it unparalleled balance, and can adapt to virtually any role. Every design feature on the SDP Compact Sand is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The aluminum pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allows for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Sand. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.   Technical Specifications   Caliber   9x19 mm / 9x21 mm  Overall Length    7.4 Inches / 188 mm   Overall Height    5.4 Inches / 136 mm  Overall Width    1.4 Inches / 35 mm  Weight    29.06 Ounces / 824 Grams  Barrel Length    3.7 Inches / 95 mm  Sight Radius    5.7 Inches / 145 mm  Sights    Front: Iron blade with white dot Rear: Serrated fixed sight  Action    Double Action / Single Action  Ambidextrous decocking lever  Trigger Pull Weight    Single Action: 4.0+lb / 1.8+kg Double Action:10.0+lb / 4.5+kg  Slide Material    Steel  Slide Finish    Black with TIAIN coating  Frame Material    Upper: Hard Anodized Aluminum Lower: Hard Anodized Aluminum  Grip    Finger molds Interchangeable Inserts: Polymer base with Rubber Size: Small, Medium, Large  Magazine Catch    Left / Right - reversible  Magazine Capacity     17 Rounds"

If it doesn't sell at $1,100 I am just going to remove the listing and keep the shotgun.  Here is a beautiful over under from CZ. This is one of their high end target models made to withstand tens of thousands of rounds of shooting each year. The 30"" barrels pattern great thanks to the 6 included extended chokes. There are 2- short range 2- mid range and 2- long range chokes allowing this gun to excel in every discipline of the shooting sports. The barrels have dual vented ribs to dump heat and reduce swing weight for those crossing targets you would see in skeet and sporting clays. The top rib is 10mm wide and has a brass mid bead and green fiber optic front bead. This makes a great sight picture when you pull the nicely figured Monte Carlo stock up to your cheek. There is a right hand palm swell which adds to the shooter's comfort and grip. The trigger is a single selectable, mechanical trigger. A feature not seen in the Browning Citori until the 725. Gun comes with all six chokes, original box, and an aluminum hard case. Shot very little. I am the original owner. I had to special order it. I only have put about 2000 rounds through it. Not a mark on the gun."

Rapid target identification and quick and precise repeated fire on a target's center-zone nets you the best possible score. In home defense scenarios, time and accuracy are also important factors. Smith & Wesson created its 5-inch M&P9 Performance Center Ported (M&P9 PC Ported) to increase the performance of its M&P line of pistols so that they can be shot at competitions, straight out of the box. Does this increased performance translate into the home defense realm?   Conventional wisdom rules out a tailor-built competition handgun to fill the role of a home defense pistol. Custom-modified race pistols often ride the ragged edge of ultimate performance to the point that they can sometimes sacrifice reliability. This is much like how a finely tuned race-car is capable of astonishing performance on the track, but wouldn't last a day chugging along in gridlock to and from your work.    Race-guns also usually have a very light trigger, which may not be welcome when adrenaline is coursing through your veins, making your heart race at what feels like 500 beats per minute. In such a stressed state, your fine motor skills become an afterthought. These are all valid arguments against using a high-performance competition gun for home defense.   With all that in mind, a couple of questions arise. When the lives of loved ones are on the line, wouldn't you rather have a pistol that can give you every advantage over the bad guy? If you were given the choice of defending yourself and your family with a run-of-the-mill pistol or one that has been worked over to run faster and more accurately, which would you choose? What if a commercially available pistol can deliver some of the positive attributes of a race-gun without the shortcomings?   The M&P9 Performance Center Ported is based on the five-inch-barreled, long-slide version of the popular striker-fired, polymer-framed M&P9 pistol, but features a few upgrades performed by the folks at Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. Engineered with competition shooters in mind, the ported M&P9 is easy to spot at a glance due to its polished stainless barrel and the slide's lightening cuts. It's no custom race-gun, but we'd say that it's inspired by the same performance features, bundled in a factory-reliable package.   If you look carefully at the two slots cut into the slide closest to the muzzle, you'll notice that the barrel is ported as well. The two ports at the end of the barrel help keep muzzle rise down by channeling the escaping gas of a fired cartridge upward and outward as the bullet travels out of the barrel, helping push the muzzle down. The gasses escape in a V formation from the top of the slide.   In the years since the M&P's release, aftermarket companies such as Apex Tactical and even Smith & Wesson itself have steadily enhanced the M&P trigger in a variety of ways. This most recent version of the trigger by S&W's Performance Center on the M&P9 PC Ported features an improved ""Performance Center Sear"" that is said to give the shooter a quicker and more defined trigger reset.   The Performance Center trigger feels smoother and not at all like the older generation of triggers. The product description for the M&P9 PC Ported on S&W's website listed a pull weight range between four and five pounds. We measured it at a consistently smooth six pounds. To further enhance this pistol, the engineers at S&W added an adjustable trigger stop just behind the trigger. The trigger stop essentially a long setscrew threaded into the frame adjusts through the rear of the frame with an Allen wrench when the grip's backstrap is removed. The trigger stop is used to stop the trigger's rearward movement after the trigger break, resulting in less over-travel, which in turn leads to a quicker trigger reset. When each of the M&P9 PC Ported enhancements works in unison, it equates to fast and controllable follow-up shots.   Specifications   Manufacturer Number   10098  Model    M&P9 Performance Center Ported  Frame Size    Full Size  Caliber    9mm  Action     Striker Fired (Double Action)  Magazine Capacity    17+1 Rounds  Barrel Length    5 Inches (12.7 cm)  Front Sight    White Dot Dovetail  Rear Sight    Fixed 2-Dot  Overall Length    8.5 Inches (21.2 cm)  Grip    Polymer  Weight    24.1 Ounces (683.2 Grams)  Barrel Material    Stainless Steel  Slide Material     Stainless Steel  Frame Material     Polymer  Finish    Black, Durable, Corrosion-Resistant"
