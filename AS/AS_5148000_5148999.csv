This gun is from the 1900's and is in pretty rough condition. It does break open and the ""automatic"" ejection of the brass does function. However the action does not cycle when the trigger is pulled. I believe it has a broken spring. The grip on the right side is original. However the grip on the left side is a Colt Pocket Positive one and has been fitted to this gun. It is a candidate for repair and/or as a parts gun or wall hanger. There was a ton of these made in Europe at the turn of the century by several different manufactures as a direct copy of the S&W. This one was made in Belgium and is marked as such. It also is marked ""38"" on the left side. See pictures. Would like to get $60.00 bucks for it or best offer. Thanks for viewing my and use the reply to ad link above with any questions or comments.

It was designed prior to the Japanese manufactured Citori. Although made primarily for the European market, some were imported to the United States. Marked “BROWNING ARMS COMPANY MORGAN, UTAH & MONTREAL P.Q.” The wooden forearm is released by depressing a “U” shaped button located in the front of the forearm, just below the barrels. The lack of a visible and normally placed forearm release gives this shotgun a very subtle, clean look."

Ideal for a replacement for carbine-length rifles using standard front sight bases. The 7.0's length stops just short of a carbine-length gas block, providing true free-float. Our two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. LaRue handguards also include integral QD sling-swivel sockets at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, our Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures.Used, great shape just switched to a different system and don't need any longer.

For sale is my Beretta 92G, it's like the 92FS but instead of a safety/decocker it's decocker only, which many find preferable. It's not too easy to find these! It's been used very little because I just can't find a way to make it feel good ergonomically, (hence me looking to sell or trade for something that fits better). Some wear on the exterior of the barrel, as is very normal for this gun, is pictured. Other than that, it's in great shape. Yes, this is a MA legal gun and an FFL can transfer it. No, it's not the Brigadier model. Wilson Combat modifications include fluted steel guide rod, Steel Short Reach Trigger, and Reduced Power Recoil Spring. Wolff 'D Spring' Hammer Spring is also installed. Original parts included, also pictured, as are Hogue Rosewood Fancy Hardwood Grips and Hogue Rubber Finger Grips, Original OEM grips installed already.
