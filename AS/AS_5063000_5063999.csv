The NVA soldier that it was taken from was killed by a Claymore mine that was set up that night to guard the Chaparral Unit. The blast was heard but action wise nothing followed. The next morning they investigated and found the NVA soldier deceased by the Claymore blast. My friend was the Warrant Officer who was in command of the Chaparral team took the rifle and eventually brought it back to the USA. He brought it back in his duffle bag on the plane. Things are a little different now. The SKS rifle has holes in the stock and dings from the Claymore shot that took the NVA soldier's life. It is a piece of history. REDACTED Paul

CORE Rifle Systems NO BS Lifetime Warranty One of my favorite things about this company and this rifle is the last thing on that list, and yes you read it right. CORE offers a NO BS lifetime warranty, and yes the BS stands for what you think it stands for, and it is the best warranty out on the market. Pretty much if anything breaks, even if it is your fault, they will send you a new part no questions asked. And the warranty extends to whoever owns the gun aka however many owners it ends up with.The company is based out of florida and all parts used are 100% american made by milspec standards.Here is the official website and full information about the rifle:http://core15rifles.com/core30-moe-rifle.htmlAs you can see the rifle sells for about $2,000 brand new, I am asking $1,500 for it and that includes an additional 20 rd pmag, and the CORE hard carrying case.The only gun/guns I would consider trading for are: Kimber Ultra Covert 2, Ultra TLE 2, Master Carry Ultra, Super Carry Ultra HD (Depending on which model it is I would take a straight up trade or a trade with some cash)."

Albert.  OVERVIEW: Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged. KEY FEATURES: Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% Our softest-shooting pump gun ever Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes Sling swivel studs built-in Includes Modified Rem Choke"

Functions properly. Comes with hard case, manual, lock, one magazine. Thanks for taking a look. Buyer must have Alabama driver license and prefer concealed carry license as well. -----------------------------The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.Calibers: .380 AUTOWeight unloaded: 8.3 oz. 235gLoaded magazine: 2.8 oz. 81gLength: 5.2"" 132mmHeight: 3.5"" 89mmWidth: .77"" 20mmBarrel Length: 2.7"" 68mmSight radius: 3.8"" 97mmMuzzle Energy Max: 250ft-lbs 340JCapacity: 6 + 1 roundsTrigger Pull: 5 lbs 23N"

This gun is excellent. This gun is awesome. It shoots better than I do. I really don't want to sell it. However I'm in the process of getting my concealed carry permit and this gun is much heavier and larger than what I need and I can't afford to feed it. Hence why I've only shot about 350 rounds out of it. It also has a fully supported chamber, so unlike the Delta Elites you can fire full house 10mm loads out of it. It comes with the case, 1 magazine, and an Aliengear Cloaktuck 2.0 IWB holster. The holster is really great and supports it well, but I'm in and out of a car all day and the gun is too big for me.$550 NO TRADES!!!!"

Still an icon almost a century and a half later, it was manufactured between 1873 and 1919. Originally chambered for the .44-40 cartridge, it was later produced in .38-40 and .32-20, all of which were also popular handgun cartridges of the day, allowing users to conveniently carry just one type of ammunition. The Model 1873 was produced in three variations: a 24"" barrel rifle, 20"" barrel carbine, and a musket. The easy to transport and handle carbine was the most popular, while the musket accounted for less than 5–10 percent of total production.I believe this is a model 44-40 however there are no markings on the barrel to indicate itplease feel free to email me for more pictures"

It seems like all too often lately that people expect top dollar for every little item they have replaced on their ARs. But, if you're the type of guy who has a box of dusty, old, or even worn out parts laying around and you'd rather see them put to use than thrown in the garbage, then I'm your guy! Send them my way. I do have items that I would be willing to part with that are mostly in the second picture, but I'm not opposed to trading anything pictured as long as I can come closer to my goal of a complete rifle. I.e., your carbine barrel and gas system for my mid length. So  if you're interested, take a look at the pics, let me know if you have any of the missing pieces, or if you're interested in anything I have, let me know. The initial trade items are: 12"" armalite free float hangaurdss armalite gas block with picatiny rail2 magpul rail sections2 key mod rail sections22 cal chiapa charging handleCall or text @ REDACTEDthank you for your time!"

This is one of the most sought after SAA models because the .38 Special chambering was discontinued from the line in 1964. Colt SAA revolvers made in 1956 are also more desirable because it was the first year of second generation production and the hand-fit quality was the best. Colt made a total of 2,706 revolvers in .38 Special with 5 ½” barrels that year.Positive proof that this is an original from 1956 is the low serial number (in the 5000SA range), plus the 3 digit assembly number, on the face of the cylinder, the loading gate and the rear of the frame. The revolver has a shiny bore and chambers, gently aged case colors and bright polished bluing on the barrel and cylinder. There are light scratches on the cylinder and minor bluing wear on the leading edge. The bluing is mostly worn off the front and back of the grip straps, so it won't hurt the value to shoot this one.The action is smooth, the timing is correct, and it shoots very accurately. The photos speak for themselves, showing a used, but well-cared for shooter with blued/ color-cased frame and ivory grips.Text me at (724) 471-8431 for more details"

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5063998,For Sale:  Laserlyte Rear Sight,"Webster Groves, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 50,"Listed On: Friday, January 15, 2016",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a used Laserlyte rear sight for a Glock 19 or 23 (and I believe other models with the same slide).  I do not believe this will work on large frame/slide Glocks (like the 29/30, 20/21).  This is used and works as expected.  Looking for cash.The high performance laser built into a rear sight specifically designed for all GLOCK pistols features a simple, ambidextrous “press and go” activation. The laser is easily programmable to either constant on or pulse mode. Another great feature is the “auto-off” feature that displays a unique flash after 5-minutes of operation and automatically turns the unit off after 6-minutes.Made from heavy-duty, high carbon steel for added durability, the LaserLyte® RTB-GL rear sight laser has a black chrome finish for corrosion prevention. A great benefit of the LaserLyte RTB-GL rear sight laser, besides the single-laser-fits-all-GLOCKS, is that the customer will not have to replace grips, internal stock parts or holsters. The LaserLyte RTB-GL rear sight laser is compatible with all Level 1 and Level 2 holsters including the BLACKHAWK! SERPA holster system.*Photo credit to midwayusa.com"
