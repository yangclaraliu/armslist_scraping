PLEASE NOTE THAT USED KITS CANNOT BE RETURNED OR EXCHANGED.   Advantage Arms conversion kits and their associated magazines are very high demand items.

You are not charged for a back ordered item and there is no penalty to you to allow your order to remain on back order until we are able to fill it in the order it was received. DO NOT USE STINGER OR ANY OTHER HYPER VELOCITY AMMO. DO NOT USE REMINGTON “THUNDERBOLTS” Over the years CCI 40 grain round nose MiniMags have proven to be the most consistent and reliable brand of ammo. Other brands tend to vary from one production run to the next, they may work fine one time, however, the next time you buy them you start experiencing feeding and cycling problems. If this happens, it’s more likely the ammo causing the problem and not the kit, in this situation you should try another brand of ammo. Recommended Ammo for the following kits: 17-22, 19-23, 26-27- CCI MiniMags (40 grain round nose not hollow points), Remington Golden Bullets 550/525 round Bonus Back, CCI Blazers. 20-21, 29-30 - CCI MiniMags (40 grain round nose not hollow points), Remington Golden Bullets 550/525 round Bonus Back, CCI Blazers. NOT Recommended: CCI MiniMag hollow points, any Winchester ammo, any Federal ammo, Remington Thunderbolts, CCI Stinger or any other hyper velocity ammo. Note: The Remington Golden Bullets work quite well, however, you will get more light strikes and inconsistent loads than with the other recommended ammo.

I just added Tru Glo TFX Pro night sights on it a few days ago. The gun is in immaculate condition, and has had less than 150 rounds through it. The only reason I am selling it, is because I am funding a new 226R Legion. My gun comes with the case, two magazines, and everything it came with new. I also have the original sights that it came with. This version of the 226 has the accessory rail, and the new E2 grips. The E2 grip, is a single piece grip that doesn't use grip screws, wraps around the rear of the gun, and has a much enhanced texture to it. I am located in Pensacola Florida, right outside the back gate of NAS. I am asking $780 for the gun because the sights alone (which I do still have the packaging for) were almost $180 bucks alone. The best way to contact me, if your interested is through PM. I am not interested in trades at this time."

This YHM barrel features a 5.56x45mm NATO chamber for full compatibility with surplus mil-spec ammunition or commercial 223 Remington ammunition. Constructed of 4140 chrome moly steel, the barrel is Melonited for ultimate surface protection. The melonite coating provides a thinner surface than chrome-lining, so bore friction is reduced for better accuracy. In addition, melonite is harder than chrome-lining providing a longer wear life.   This barrel is an excellent choice for a general purpose AR rifle build especially in states that do not allow a threaded barrel. It is perfectly suited for use at the range, in a 3-Gun match, or in the field pursuing game.  - See more at: http://yhm.net/yhm-77.html#sthash.skDVLP6I.dpuf  This YHM barrel features a 5.56x45mm NATO chamber for full compatibility with surplus mil-spec ammunition or commercial 223 Remington ammunition.
