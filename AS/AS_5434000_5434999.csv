Different grips size and finish available formaximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment.With choices from 2""to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.     340.077 RHINO 60DS Chrome ALL 357Mag 6""-15,2 cm 10""1/2-26,6 cm 6-1x19"" 0,94 kg-2,06 lbs    $1019.99WILL SHIP EMAIL OR CALL WILL SHIP EMAIL OR CALL 314-252-0GUN WE ARE NOW OPEN COME SEE US TUES-FRI 10AM-6PM, SAT 10AM-4PM LOCATED AT 2745 HIGH RIDGE BLVD SUITE 6 HIGH RIDGE, MO 63049.

The PLR-22 and SU-22 will accept many of the same accessories as the PLR-16 and SU-16 including the slings, stocks, and compact forend. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and the front sight is adjustable for elevation. An integrated picatinny rail on top will accept a multitude of sighting options.
