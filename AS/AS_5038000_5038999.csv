These are quickly rising in value, and fewer are becoming available. In my opinion, this is one of the best 10mm's out there. The ONLY reason I am considering trading this, is I had to give up multiple guns in a trade on a Python which left my safe a little bare ! Condition of this firearm is great, I am the 3rd owner and it has been well taken care of. Please don't ask for a trade value, do your homework. No lowballs, I will not even respond."

This is a Tikka rifle dated 1932. Bolt has the correct ""wings"" that correspond with the hex receiver for tight lockup and a great trigger. Numbers match on this rifle. Also has the correct 27"" heavy barrel associated with these guns complete with original cleaning rod. Bore is a little dark but the lands are still very sharp and crisp. Only real issue is a small gouge above the trigger on the stock which appears to have occured some time ago. If you know your history and your Mosins, you know this is a true collectors piece.

To have this done and the results are a milled norinco AK 47. It is no longer a mak 90. This AK is the same quality as a Polytech. The only difference is the price. Sorry for any confusion.
