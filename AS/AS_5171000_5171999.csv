The .22 caliber Walther/HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense. Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Walther, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries. The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

Therefore, I have decided to sell my beautiful Sig P226 in 9mm. I bought the gun used in 2000, love it, but have shot it very little. It has primarily been a gun cabinet queen. Right now, I don't think I have fired the gun at all in about ten years. However, every year, at least once, I have broken it down, cleaned it,  and oiled it. The gun is in superb condition - like new. There is no finish wear either on the slide or the frame. The gun had been fired very little when I bought it and has probably had about 50 rounds shot through it in the entire time I have owned it, certainly no more than 100 rounds. I do not know the year it was made, but it is stamped ""Made in W. Germany"" so it was certainly made before the German reunification. I have always loved the gun, and it shoots like a dream. But, truth is, the double-stack configuration is simply too big for my hands. Time to let it go. The gun comes with two 15 round mags and three sets of grips - beautiful rosewood grips from Hogue, rubber grip panels from Hogue, and a rubber wrap-around Hogue grip with finger grooves. The rosewood grip is very nice to look at but not so great to shoot with (my opinion), but the Hogue rubber grip panels are fantastic. As best I can remember, the Hogue rubber wrap-around grip has never been put on the gun. It has the 3-dot sight system. The gun comes in its original plastic case with owners manual written in German. I will also provide a generic Sig owner's manual in English which covers the P226 as well as some other Sig models with similar design and controls.  Believe me, this is a very lgihtly used gun in like-new condition. You will not find a better P226 except one that is brand new. I own a lot of handguns including several Sigs and this is the sweetest shooting gun of the lot. If you are looking for a very good quality full-sized 9mm, this is it. I will ship to your FFL dealer and the cost shown here includes shipping. I can provide more photos, but they really do not do the gun justice. This is a jewel."
