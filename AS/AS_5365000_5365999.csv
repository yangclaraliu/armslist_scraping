Leupold revolutionized range-finding with Leupold RX series of digital rangefinders, providing accurate aiming information matched to the ballistics of your bow or rifle. Also, Leupold incorporated True Ballistic Range technology into the Leupold RXB-IV digital laser range finding binocular. Not only do you get the advantages of a Leupold 9x binocular, you get capabilities you won't find in any other binocular, period. Leupold RXB-IV Digital Laser Rangefinder Binoculars can calculate more than just the straight line distance to a target. Its inclinometer also factors in the angle up- or down-slope to the target, as well as your rifle's or bow's ballistics. Then the Leupold laser rangefinder-binocular provides rifle hunters using Leupold Ballistic Aiming System reticles or bow hunters the equivalent horizontal distance to the target. In short, you'd aim using the True Ballistic Range, not the straight line distance. Rifle hunters can also choose an MOA adjustment or a holdover point for accurate aiming. Leupold RXB IV Binocular Digital Laser Range Finder is included Leupold Alumina BXL filters improving contrast and reticle visibility in difficult lighting conditions. The Leupold RXBIV Digital Range-Finder also includes a digital compass, and is threaded for Leupold Alumina accessories.

Quite frankly the gun is too much for me. I'm a new gun owner and I can't handle the recoil from this gun. Therefore I'm seling this gun that was only used for maybe two hours. I have decided to buy a 22 instead. The gun will come in the original Glock block that includes three magazines along with extra grips. As an added bonus, I have also installed the pinky extensions on the magazines which can be removed if they're not to your liking. I paid $570 for this gun brand new last week from Academy Sports in Lake Mary. I will sell the gun for $499. Needless to say the gun is in 100% perfect and flawless condition."

The pistol features a very low bore axis that forces the recoil back instead of up allowing you to stay on target and send follow up shots down range on target fast!!!  This pistol  comes with 3 extra mags(25$ a piece only available from diamondback) and original case. The DB9FS is an inexpencive general use pistol.  I feel that it is a superior firearm to the SD9VE in the same budget field.  I got in on these some time ago and actually have 4 of them total, Im letting this one go because I am buying a house and could use some extra cash flow.  I will also throw in a pistol light, a holster if I can find it(might be packed) and any ammo I have lying around for it.

The frame is high tech aluminum alloy which brings the weight down 1/2 lb. to just 26.5 ozs. unloaded while providing the same 5906 reliability so popular with law enforcement. Recoil is less than full size polymer frame pistols enabling enhanced follow up shot accuracy even though weight is only slightly higher. I'm a range shooter and simply have a ""blast"" consistantly nailing 2"" target squares at 50 feet.   The stainless slide with a 4"" barrel and Lo-Mount Novak 3 dot sights as well as the high capacity 15 round double stack magazines are interchangeable with the 5906.    The action is called Traditional Double Action (TDA) which describes a longer 1st shot trigger pull which cocks the hammer, and single action short crisp trigger pull on subsequent shots.    An ambidextrous safety / decocker is featured for convenience and ultimate safety especially when keeping a round chambered.   This pistol for sale has a 2/01/1994 manufacture date. It's been well cared for as you can see. There is little finish wear and few noticeable scratches. The internals are excellent and the recoil spring is new. This is a handsome pistol you'd be proud to own.   You simply can't wear out a 3rd Gen Smith and they just keep going up in price.    Included are one 15 and one 14 round S&W Hi-Capacity magazines, a brand new soft case, and a box of 124 grain range ammo to get you started. Email or call / text Bill REDACTED."

By far the sweetest shooting Kimber I ever had the pleasure of using, it shoots just as smoothly as my Wilson Combat CQB does. My research tells me this is all hand fitted and on a series 70 platform with no Schwartz safety and is considered a series 1 example. I contacted Kimber and they told me these are very highly desired pistols because of all the manual attention put into it. It has night sights, 20lpi front checkering, and an ambidextrous safety. It also has some special kind of melted treatment done to it. Please look up the pistol on the Internet for all specifications. I purchased this as an investment as I was told it would go up in value. Some Kimber fans told me I could get about $1500 for this pistol in such pristine condition. I'm asking the same amount I put into it, $1285 + shipping. I do not have a local FFL that does transfers. Please make sure your FFL will take firearms from non FFL holders. Shipping with insurance to your FFL is about $85 via UPS. I will take a bank check but if you want to use PayPal, you must pay using the ""friends & family"" feature. If you would rather use the ""goods and services"" option, kindly add 4% to the total amount (shipping fee included). I will ship the same day as I have both a copy of your FFL and cleared funds. Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks for looking!!"
