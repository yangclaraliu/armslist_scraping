Sig took their time on this one and the 551A1 is the rifle that the American market wanted all along.  This rifle is almost like a product improved AK-47 Type rifle with the rotating bolt and long stroke gas piston.  The 55A1 uses the original Stgw-90 rock in magazines and has a melonite coated barrel. The finish is a grey cerakote that is very close to the original Sig 550 factory finish in color and appearance. These fine rifles are no longer in production by Sig Sauer and are rapidly becoming collector items.   This rifle also has been upgraded with the excellent MFI 550 Type Diopter sights w/fiber optic inserts, Manticore Arms POST, and an original Swiss Stgw-90 sling. The MFI Sights sit lower than the Sig USA sights at the level established by the Stge-90 / Sig 550 series of service rifles and are extremely fast to acquire.  Used in VG+ condition with minimal marks from use. Brass rash at ejection port and some dings on the front sight housing are visible. Internals are clean and smooth operating. No corrosion or pitting. Overall in really nice shape.  It is about as close to the Swiss Stgw-90 that is in currnet Swiss issue today that you can get in the USA without paying $10K for one of the few Semi-Auto versions that are floating around.Full album link:  551A1 Enhanced"

The gun had a professional trigger job done by Bill's Gun Shop (Zev Tech 2.5 pound connector with stock springs, polishing and trigger over-travel stop installed, stock connector included). This gun could easily be converted to 40 S&W by simply replacing the barrel with a Lone Wolf standard Glock 35 barrel ($100) and a Glock 22 40 S&W Mag. This is why I chose the Lone Wolf Glock 35 slide instead of the 34 Slide so that I could quickly and ecconomically convert to 40 S&W some day.  It comes with the factory case and manual, 2-17 round magazines, and the Leupold Delta Point 7.5 MOA Dot Sight (with manual and adjustment tools). This gun is extremely accurate and reliable and is very fun and easy to shoot. It is in very good condition and the Leupold Delta Point works great. Buyer must have a valid PTP or PTC. I am mainly looking to sell for cash,  so I am not interested in trades at this time. Please email me your phone number and I will be happy to respond to any questions or offers."

I love the way it feels in my hand, and carrying it is easy because of its dinky size and light weight. This stainless mini-1911 pistol is one of the best, most accurate concealed carry pistols on the market. It has G10 polymer grips, a 6+1 round capacity and a 2.72"" barrel. It is only 5.5"" high by less than 4"" long and weighs about 16 ounces with the magazine. Has thumb safety where the slide can move back and forth with the hammer cocked and the safety on. Recoil is minimal with standard .380 loads.  These pistols are hard to find in the California versions.  I removed the rear sight and added a red laser with a replacement rear sight.  It works beautifully. Comes with 1 magazine, mini-holster, lock, and original plastic case."

This rifle has less than 100 rounds through it and is in 100% condition. Here is whats included:1. MVP Flex in 7.62x51 I purchased for $950 before tax at Cabela's in 2015. The best price I could find was a starting bid of $679.99 + $25 for shipping on Gunbroker. 2. Flex Hunting Stock (NIB)I purchased for $69.99 before shipping. The best price I could find was on Amazon for $54.99+$9.95 shipping.3. Oversize Tactical Bolt Knob (NIB - installed)I purchased this for $49 + shipping4. TacVector 10-40x50 AO Rangefinder Scope (NIB - installed)I replaced the cheezy 3-9x40 scope that came with the rifle for this 10-40 scope that I purchased in 2014 for another rifle but never installed it. If my memory serves I spent somewhere in the neighborhood of $180 for the scope.5. Boyd H-Series Rifle Case H-48 (NIB)I purchased this at Cabelas for $179.99 + tax in 2015. The best price I could find was $168.86 on Amazon. This is not your normal cheesy Plano case.6. CCOP Folding Bipod (NIB - installed)I purchased this positive lock bipod as it gave the most solid stability compared to the spring loaded telescoping bipods.7. UTG TL-BPad1 Swivel Stud Picatinny Slot Adapter (NIB - installed)This was needed to install the bipod and also adds a picatinny rail for mounting other goodies. I believe I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 for this and the bipod.8. CAA m4 cheek risers (NIB - installed)Purchased in 2015 for around $30. They are the same price now.OK so typical of us gun owners I spent alot of time and money on something that has been parked in the safe. I have somewhere in the neighborhood of $1500 invested in this but want to move it to finish another project gun. First $775 takes everything!!

Practically brand new. All original factory. Less than 100 rounds through the barrel. Comes with a cleaning kit, cleaning rod and dis-assembly tool, which are all stored behind the flip up metal butt plate in the stock. (see photos). A very soft shooting .308 semi-auto, thanks to the heavy duty and ultra reliable M1A action. Caliber 7.62X51MM NATO (.308WIN) Length 37.25"" Front Sight XS Post w/ Tritium Insert, .125 Blade Barrel 16.25""; Twist 1 In 11""; RH; 6-Groove Carbon Steel Weight (with Empty Magazine) 8.8 lbs. Rear Sight Enlarged Military Aperture .135 w/ MOA Adjustment For Both Windage and Elevation Magazines 1 - 10 Round, Parkerized Steel Stock Black Composite The world of tactical rifles forever changed in 2004 when Springfield Armory® introduced the M1A SOCOM 16. 7.62NATO power in a package this small was previously unthinkable. Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16′s unique design. Comes With:A short piece of picatinny rail, that goes under the last two inches of the stock near the barrel, if you want to connect a light or laser, bipod, etc. See ""Versa Pod 150-807B Conversion Accessory Picatinny Rail Mount M1A and M14 (Socom/Synthetic Stock)"" on Amazon. Also comes with a cleaning kit, cleaning rod and dis-assembly tool that is already contained in the metal butt stock, which I bought extra and added. Also comes with (1) Colorado-legal, very nice 10 round parkerized steel magazine that originally came with the rifle from the factory. Nice and compact for hunting, doesn't stick out much. I think the cleaning kit and dis-assembly tool was probably $30 and the picatinny accessory rail, made specifically for this rifle so that you retain the sling swivel, is $70 on Amazon, so some nice extras thrown in to make this an even better deal. Already priced to sell. Original from the factory, it has a piece of picatinny rail on top to mount optics, but it is NOT the heavier and bulier setup of the SOCOM II, with all the heavy rails on the sides. Still looks like a traditional M14. I have seen people add wood stocks and leather G.I. sling to make it look even more like a traditional M14. Heavy-duty iron sights and the tritium front post glows for a nice sight picture in low light. It would make an excellent hog hunting rifle. Very quick to the shoulder. If interested, purchaser agrees to pay transfer fee through licensed firearm dealer in Denver metro area. This rifle is FOR SALE only; not interested in trades. Colorado residents only please - I don't want to deal with shipping. Thanks for taking a look."

[RAC], model MLE 1907-15, made by Remington.   As far as I can tell, it is the 8mm Libel cartridge which you can still by ammo for.  It still has the original 31"" barrel length with the bayonet attachment studs on the bottom of the muzzle.  Most of these you find have the barrels cut back shorter after the war.  The rifle still has a lot of bluing intact.  The bore is shinny, rifling is sharp and not a spec of rust in the bore.  It still has the flip up, long range sight as well.  For a seasoned collector or just someone wanting a nice piece of history, this would be a great piece.  I have not shot it, but the bolt and trigger function smoothly as they should.  Ammo is easy to find online.      These rifles were made by Remington in the USA and then shipped to the French to fight the Germans in World War One.  I inherited this from my father and thought I would pass it along to someone more interested in antique military rifles.  He took immaculate care of his guns so rest assured, this rifle is in great shape for its age.   Feel free to call or text with any questions, 205 5two7 nine713.  I have more detailed pics I can send.  The add only allows one picture."
