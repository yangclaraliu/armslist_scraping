The muzzle brake from Witt was machined to specifically fit that barrel. S&K Insta Scout Mount with picatinny rail. Also a Hi-Lux 2x7 LER scope is included. All of that is mounted in the Archangel FDE Stock with detachable magazine. The bolt was bent by "" The Boltman"", if you are familar with Mosin's you know this guy, did an awesome job on the bolt. The entire gun has been Duracoated black, looks sharp. This gun will shoot 1.5"" groups at a 100 using PPU ammo. The scope needs to be re-boresighted, I took it off to mount on a M-38 of mine, I will throw in some ammo to do that. The price I am asking is more than far for the rifle, I have a lot more invested in the gun than the asking price. With that being said I am pretty firm on the price, little wiggle room, but lets not be stupid. I don't need to sell this gun, so it can sit, not giving it away. All low ball offers will be disregarded and I AM NOT interested in any trades at this time, unless you have a DPMS Gen 2 Recon in .308...then we can talk. I will meet in the Columbia area for a FTF, but will travel a short distance but no more than 30 minutes from Columbia. And questions drop me a line, or more pics. Thanks for looking."

The 6.5 Creedmore is a great round which offers considerably less recoil then a .308, less wind deflection and elevation too then the .308. Plus, at 1000 yards it has 20% more energy then a .308.. It is a low recoil, flat shooting fast rounds which is popular in the long distance competitions.The gun cost me                          $900 Upgraded stock:                          $400Detachable mag system and mag  $300Muzzle break:                              $120Bi-pod:                                        $80Total into gun:                              $1800Asking $1195 OBO .

The Specialist is one of the newest additions to the Dan Wesson stable. When police departments approached CZ to build them a more reliable, durable 1911 to replace the ones they had been carrying, they developed a model just for them. The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense. A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in .45 and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant’s special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears CZ's popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium dot in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front. The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there. The Specialist ships with two 8-round magazines with bump pads and is available in either a matte stainless finish or our Duty Black finish, which makes for an especially hardy pistol that scoffs at everyday wear and tear.MSRP:  $1870YOURS ONLY:  $1426.00Ask us about in store gun financing !!!!!!!

I literally got this in the mail yesterday, but decided on a different style holster instead. Retention is ideal, this is literally brand new. This is a custom color, making this a $70 holster. That said, $50 is instant $20 savings. Please let me know if you have any questions, and email or text with any offers! REDACTED Thank you for your interest! NOTE: Holster only, G43 not included"

A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.PRODUCT SPECSCaliber: .380 ACPLength: 5.26”Height: 3.75”Width: .750“”Barrel Length: 2.80”Distance Between Sights: 4”Weight (unloaded): 8.8 ozTrigger Pull: ≈5.5#Magazine Capacity: 6+1 RdsUPC: REDACTED33"

836,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5273836,For Sale:  Old Webley WP 320 Pocket Revolver,"Toledo, Oregon, Oregon Coast, Oregon",$ 500,"Listed On: Friday, March 25, 2016",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a very old Webley and Scott LTD model Wp320. According to the official Webley page, they were discontinued in the 1930s. It also shows the serial number range but strangely, this one has a number that is 96 higher than the highest one listed. All numbers match on this old gal, even on the back side of the grips. Overall finish is quite good but does have some pitting on the cylinder. This thing has been sitting in a night stand drawer for about 6 decades that I know of. Before that though I do not know the history. The grips are perfect. The cylinder probably needs to be retimed if you want to shoot is a lot but it does lock up and fire as it should. The bore is excellent. Values on these things are all over the place. Most seem to bring 600-800 at auction although the Blue Book of Values shows it at only 400 dollars at 60%. Other than the pitting here I mentioned before the blueing is quite nice. No gouges, scratches, chips, etc. All markings are bright and very easily read. The only ammo I have left for it is a partial box , 38 rounds, of Remington 82 grain .32 Long Colt lead. I have fired it 5 times and it functioned as it should but that is as far as I have gone with it. I don't think any actual .320 ammo has been produced since the 1930s. I am selling this for a family friend who has owned it for well over 60 years and has not fired it in all that time. It just sat in a drawer by her bed. We are looking for a cash sale but feel free to offer up trades. If it is something that I can use myself I will keep it and pay her for the Webley. She is in her 90s now and no longer has a need for this or any other guns for that matter. Thank you for looking. Armslist only allows 3 pics but I can take as many as you want and send them to you upon request."

Leupold 2 piece scope mount and rings (MSRP $110).  Barrel is free floated (see picture below).
 I spent lots of range time developing hand loads for this rifle.  Best round for this particular rifle is the Nosler .30 Caliber 150 gr Ballistic Tip and 42.5 gr. of VintaVuori N140 powder.  I will no longer need the hand loads I still have and they go with the rifle (50 rounds plus case) as they are tailored for it.  Amazingly, the second most accurate round I have fired out of this rifle is PMC Bronze 147gr.  It’s a fairly inexpensive round good for target shooting or varmint hunting.  And the handloads should last you a long time for hunting bigger game.  This rifle is easily capable of sub MOA groups at 100 yds.  Below is a 3 round group the last time I shot this rifle (ignore the flyer to the left).  And that was with the PMC ammo, not the hand loads.
This rifle has an integrated muzzle break…. It makes it much loader than a standard .308 Win.  The bonus is the triangle shaped barrel has more surface area so it dissipates heat faster.  The muzzle break reduces recoil (about the same recoil as a .243) and greatly reduces muzzle jump so follow-up shots are faster.  I have put about 250 rds through it and there are no dings, scratches, etc. anywhere on the rifle."

I believe just around 7000 were ever produced until Colt came out with the Peacemaker. Originally, it was chambered for .44 Rimfire, but at some point long in the past, it was professionally converted to shoot .44 Russian, and at the same time had the barrel shortened to 4 5/8 inches as well as having a new front sight installed. All the serial numbers seem to match, and the revolver is still in perfect time and mechanically functions as it should. The only thing missing is the ejector. I've never cleaned the finish from this revolver, only rubbed it down with an oiled rag. This gun was used and carried, and the finish shows it. It also comes with an antique handmade buffalo leather holster, made specifically for this revolver and is over 100 years old.  It was owned by a friends Great great grandfather, who was a Wyoming rancher. Not looking to ship at this time. Would prefer a local sale. Price is $1500 obo for the revolver and holster. Thanks!"
