This combo is a Mossy Oak camo package. It includes 3 barrels and has a “thumb through” stock.The original barrel handles 2 ¾, 3, and 3 ½ inch shells. It is smooth bore and features the vented ribbed bead sights and screw in choke. About 29 inches long.The second barrel (turkey) handles 2 ¾, 3, and 3 ½ inch shells. It is smooth bore and features fiber optic front and rear adjustable sights and screw in choke. About 24 inches long.The third barrel (deer) handles 2 ¾ and 3 inch shells. It has a rifled bore and features a Bushnell Sportview 3-9 x 32 waterproof scope. This barrel is designed to use slugs for deer hunting and is about 21 inches long. The vast majority of deer harvested during deer/gun season are taken well within range of this shotgun.This is three guns in one. New, the original gun and barrel runs $450. The turkey barrel is an additional $250. The deer/slug barrel runs an additional $350 without the scope. The total value of the gun and extra barrels is $1050.Throw in the scope, 2 cases, matching camo sling, and my asking price of $650 for this is a very reasonable deal.This gun has been kept in great condition. The only exception is slight wear on the stock…the camo is slightly wore off in one area. It’s very minimal. No rust or pitting, clean and ready to go.A great choice for home defense, turkey hunting, duck hunting, trap shooting, or deer hunting.I am selling this because I do not use it. I would prefer to sell outright but may consider trades.  You can contact me directly 2six2-484-80six1"

The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome."

I picked this up in a trade and have no use for 2 j-frames, appears to have a low round count and has minimal wear. It has a hammer so it can be shot in double action or single action. The single action pull is super light. Is rated for .38 special. Has keys and original brass from factory. Looking to get 500. I will include 20 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense and a BlackHawk! IWB holster. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I am open to anything firearms related besides .22 Rifles and shotguns. Mainly looking for some reloading equipment or guns."

I can include brass, wax bullets,primers and gun cleaner necessary to shoot cowboy fast draw.  the second gun is the Ruger Bisley Vaquero with either white synthetic grips or the more common wooden grips.  the Bisley will better fit the grip of a larger hand and has a lower hammer curl.  it feels slightly heavier than the New Vaquero but otherwise has the same dimensions and fires the same caliber, 45 long Colt.  The Bisley will come with the same accessories as the New Vavuero.  Both guns are a pleasure to shoot, extremely accurate and exceptionally pleasing to the eye.  The New Vaquero is priced at $550.00 or, the Bisley is priced at $675.00 as described.

Will ship to FFL or meet locally. The Beretta 21A Bobcat is chambered for .25 ACP (6.35 mm) ammunition. It has a simple blowback operation, with a single- and double-action trigger mechanism, and exposed hammer. It has a magazine release button in the left side grip, located between the grip retaining screws. The frame is made out of aluminum alloy; the slide and barrel are carbon steel.It is fitted with a frame-mounted, thumb-operated sear-locking safety, which also blocks the slide. This can be applied with the hammer fully down, or cocked. The hammer has a half-cock safety notch. There is an inertia type firing pin design.One defining feature of this pistol is the 'tip-up' barrel. The barrel pivots on a pin under the muzzle so that the chamber may be loaded with the slide in the closed position. It is released by a lever on the left side of the frame, above the trigger. This simplifies loading, unloading, and checking load status. This gun was produced in the USA during the mid 1980's."

Albert.  OVERVIEW: Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged. KEY FEATURES: Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% Our softest-shooting pump gun ever Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes Sling swivel studs built-in Includes Modified Rem Choke."

This is one slick long range rifle. Scope dialed in right on target. Has a 1in group at 200 yards. Experienced shooter could probably tighten up that group up a little better than me. It is has 0 wear and tear. Shot less then 100 times. Great rifle for target/hunting. Extensively cleaned every time after being shot or stored for long periods of time. If you have any questions just call me any reasonable time. Gabe at REDACTED

Call or text 316393595 zero. Sometimes your requirements call for added versatility in a tactical rifle. Enter the SOCOM II. It brings you all the compact power, performance and reliability of the SOCOM 16 with the added capability of a rail system. The SOCOM II has a quad-rail that will allow you to mount whatever accessories your application requires. Maybe you need a light, laser or vertical foregrip – there’s ample space for all of these. Co-witnessed night vision and low-magnification optics are commonly found on rifles in this class, and the extended rail option gives you plenty of room for this. The SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle. The SOCOM II is the next step in the evolution of the powerful, compact tactical rifle.
