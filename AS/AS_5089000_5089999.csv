Excellent lockup, trigger is quite light and crisp with 0 creep in single action. The previous owner definitely carried this one because it has a bunch of small dings and very small scratches along the barrel/frame, but there is no rust anywhere and the bluing is actually really good with just a little holster wear near the muzzle. Most importantly, it's not dinged up where it counts (internally!), so its accuracy is outstanding. The bore is shiny clean with strong rifling and no pitting. I've treated it well in the few years I've had it: I verified the internals were proper with a gunsmith a while back, and I keep the barrel and chambers clean between range sessions. I just don't shoot revolvers as much anymore, so I'm cleaning out the safe and hoping to send a few lonely guns to good homes that'll appreciate them hahaI'm in Green Hills FYI only until next weekend (1-31) so the clock's ticking. No trades please! Thanks for looking!"

Sorry!) It is a singl-action, hammer fired semi-auot pistol with an aluminum frame. The two short magazines are original to the gun and hold 8 rounds; the longer one is a Triple K aftermarket mag that holds 10 rounds. The longer mag is sold for the Models 76 and 101 but works fine in this gun; it has only been used once. This gun has been Duracoated by a previous owner. the slide is okay, but the finish on the barrel is very sloppy. This has no effect on functioning. In fact, the best group I've ever shot with a .22 was with this gun. The truth is I don't really want to sell it, but need to finace buying something else. My loss is your gain!NOTE: This is NOT one of the Berettas for sale on Gunbr*ker that come with a fake supressor attached. I bought this gun in exactly the condition you see here.Any sale must go through an FFL dealer. I use Dragon Arms in Kearnysville, WV, but will drive a reasonable distance to one of your choosing AS LONG AS it is a store-front business, not some house out in the middle of nowhere."

Selling a Beretta .22 with everything pictured (except the box of ammo. Sorry!) It is a single-action, hammer fired semi-auto pistol with an aluminum frame. The two short magazines are original to the gun; the longer one is a Triple K aftermarket mag that holds 10 rounds. The longer mag is sold for the Models 76 and 101 but works fine in this gun; it has only been used once.This gun has been Duracoated by a previous owner. The slide is okay, but the finish on the barrel is very sloppy. This has no effect on functioning. In fact, the best group I've ever shot with a .22 was with this gun. The truth is I don't really want to sell it, but need to finace buying something else. My loss is your gain!NOTE: This is NOT one of the Berettas for sale on Gunbr*ker that come with a fake supressor attached. I bought this gun in exactly the condition you see here.Any sale must go through an FFL dealer. I use Dragon Arms in Kearnysville, WV, but will drive a reasonable distance to one of your choosing AS LONG AS it is a store-front business, not some house out in the middle of nowhere."

Rather than be stuck with a bunch of useless parts, I decided to finish the build and I am happy I did because I now have a gorgeouse rifle. Now that the build is finished, I don't have room to store her so she is looking for a good home that would treat her well and shoot the hell out of her. 7.62 x 39 is an amazing round and is incredibly cheap as well.

It has been mounted on the gun you see in the pictures (Less than 100rds fired) but I've decided to rebuild it with a different setup. The NEA stock does not come with a bolt, just their proprietary carrier, but I am including a brand new C158 bolt as well as firing pin, cam pin and firing pin retainer pin. This makes the setup complete and can be put directly on an AR and you're ready to go. Any questions feel free to ask. Local pickup in Lexington. Email the above link or text 85nine.96seven.64zero9Description of stock from websiteThe CCS has been designed with the professional in mind allowing for quick deployment into the firing position. The CCS is a 2 position stock and can simply be pulled into the fully extended position without the need for manipulation and collapsed by depressing the locking mechanism. The CCS is made out of 6061 T6 Aluminum, 4140 steel and a durable polymer buttplate to ensure its durability in the harshest environments. The aluminum components features a matte black Cerakote finish and the steel components have been treated with ARC+ Nitriding giving an added layer of corrosion resistance and durability. Composite butt plate. The CCS comes as a complete drop-in unit containing stock, stock adapter, buffer tube, spring and modified full auto bolt carrier/buffer. The CCS is compatible with most mil spec AR-15’s."
