Originally designed and released in 1991 this cartridge was the first to include a pre-scored jacket. It also included a reverse taper design which allowed it's signature talons to be released perpendicular to the bullet upon impact. The black color of the bullet comes from the oxidized copper jacket and the LubaLox coating which was new for Winchester at the time. LubaLox protects the rifling of the barrel as well as provides lubrication for the bullet while traveling the length of the barrel. It is still used on many of their cartridges today minus the black color. In all Black Talon was cutting edge technology for it's time, thee best hollow point on the market. After a few mass shootings Black Talon proved it's effectiveness but in an unfortunately negative light. Without even being on the market for two years Winchester decided it was in the company's best interest to pull the Black Talon line in 1993. this is $60. each box of history.

I purchased this pistol new roughly two months ago from JJ Gun Supply and have a receipt as proof of purchase. After carrying this firearm for the last two months I have decided to switch carry pistols to something that is more conducive to environments I regularly carry in. I have never shot the pistol and it is in factory fired condition with VERY minor wear on the side of the trigger guard from the holster. Having said that, I'm also including a SAS Customs carbon fiber kydex holster. The holster is set for right hand carry with 22 degrees of forward cant, an adjustable tension device, and is reversible between inside and outside the waist carry. Also included is a Pearce grip plug and a full box of Hornady Critical Duty ammo. The above items new after tax set me back $686 and the cost breaks down as follows: Glock Pistol $540, Grip Plug $5, Ammo $25, Holster $75. As previously stated I am interested in acquiring a new carry pistol and will sell this as a package deal for $500 firm and I will also listen to equal value trades (trade value is higher) for a concealed carry 9mm pistol. Buyer must meet in Mason, cash only, all local and federal laws apply, and buyer must present state issued photo ID at time of sale (fellow CCW holders take priority). If you are interested in purchasing please respond to ad and I will get back with you as soon as possible. Thanks for looking."
