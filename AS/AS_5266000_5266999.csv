We all know what these pistols sell for new, so if you want a brand new pistol you can spend about $75 more than this one. However, if you want to save some cash and buy a pistol that is good as new then this is a good deal. This pistol looks unfired and includes everything that these come with straight from the factory.I'm not desperate, if I kept this pistol forever I wouldn't care. If you've got $425 to spend and are interested you won't be disappointed. If you don't have $425 then keep looking, you might find one cheaper, but it likely won't be in the same condition as this one."

The best of them is Gewehr 98, rifle which was unveiled in 1898.  This was to become was a primary rifle of German army until the end of World War II. Advantages of Mauser rifles, while many, have the following outstanding features: The reliability of the bolt mechanism, and the precision workmanship that went into each and every weapon. These rifles were successfully converted into “sports and hunting” models which are still in widespread use today. Besides it was possible to shoot much stronger than standard 7.92 x 57 ammo. Reliability of the Mausers bolt locking system depends on three locking-lugs. Two in front lock the bolt socket on barrel inlet (prior to the rounds entry into the bore) and one in the rear of the rounds opening. It was standard four movement bolt. This system is uncomfortable for most riflemen to get used to – he must move whole arm to reload rifle.  A better solution was introduced in Lee-Enfield rifle, where the rifleman used only his wrist to reload the weapon. That’s why Mauser rifles never achieved the high firing rate of the Lee-Enfield rifles; those results were obvious on the battlefield when compared to the Lee-Enfield and the M-1 Garand rifle."

All of the custom work was done by professionals.  It has the HK LEM Trigger that is as smooth as glass with a fairly light pull (best guess around 5 lbs) and short reset. The slide, interior and all metal parts are coated Robar NP3+ - if you are not familiar look it up - its an extremely tough and durable coating that not only protects the inside and out from rust and corrosion, but it makes it a breeze to clean each time you shoot (dirt comes off very easily).  It has Robar NP3+ coating on all 5 factory HK Mags (about $80 each), and both the hreaded 5"" barrel and stock barrel (matching serial number to original box, test shell, extra seals for the tactical barrel) and the HK flash supressor. The lower is Cerakoted OD Green. I have a Hogue slip-on rubber grip as seen in the pics which can easily be removed for a narrower grip. It has Meprolight Tritiumnight  sights (three dot), and a factory (Trijicon) mounting plate for a Trijicon RMR sight (the Trijicon is not included as I use it for other guns - shown mounted in picture). It has around 1200 rounds through it, but is in imacculate shape. Factory box with manual. Custom Stipple job and shaved/bobbed mag release paddles.  The gun and all the mods totals around $ 2500. I'd put the trade value around $1600, and would sell it outright for $1400. Trades considered but very limited in what I'm after and would prefer an outright sale. FFL transfers ONLY. No exceptions. WCA in Factoria or North End FFL preferred"

It is designed to completely replace the legacy the chinstrap and internal pad system, giving the operator a state-of-the-art helmet suspension system. The ACH Occ-Dial is taken straight from the popular OpsCore FAST Helmet line. It is an entire system developed to provide the most comfort, stability, customized fit, integration, and impact resistance of any helmet suspension system on the market. The Occ-Dial has an innovative fit band tensioning device that provides a firm, yet pliable individual fit to varying size heads. This adjustable circumferential fit band allows for precise customized fit.The ACH Occ-Dial system is capable of full integration with ear-pro and communications headsets. The fit band easily unclips from the forward hard foam impact pad, allowing the headset to “thread” between the fit band and helmet shell. This provides a fully integrated solution with maximum comfort. The fit band is tightened around the head by turning the knob dial located in the back. The fit band also adjusts the vertical position of the helmet.The system is completed with a series of Velcro-in impact pads. These two-part pads feature a closed cell memory comfort foam with a durable impact layer base. They are impervious to environment conditions and will not freeze. Each set comes complete with six ¾” pads and three extra 1” pads for a custom fit. The system meets the US Army ACH Specification: Chistrap Retention and Non Ballistic Impact Protection.The OpsCore Occ-Dial is a welcome upgrade to the legacy chinstrap and pad system. It is completely adjustable and customizable, offering the operator the most comfort of any suspension system. The innovative fit band system is the heart of the unit. It does away with all hotspots created by the legacy pads and its integration with comms equipment is unsurpassed. Add in the all-important OpsCore Head-Lok style chinstrap, and the ACH Occ-Dial is practically a must-have upgrade.Please note: The ACH Occ-Dial will not fit the side-cut TC-2001 model ACH/MICH Helmet."

THIS IS NOT TRUE. I WILL ship USPS. There is no way, that I can find, to change the ad. This is a weakness of this site.Used twice. Like new condition. Everything required for a scope mounting project with professional results. Kit contains Alignment Rods, Lapping Bar with Handle, Lapping Compound, Level-Level-Level, Thread Locker, FAT wrench with bits, hard case, and a Scope Mounting DVD.Wheeler Engineering FAT Wrench: A hand driven, click/clutch style torque wrench that is very useful for applying the necessary torque to most firearm and firearm accessory fasteners. The FAT Wrench features a thick ergonomic handle, a standard 1/4"" drive tip, and can be used to apply torque from 10 to 65 in-lbs at 5 in-lb increments. Common uses include, but are not limited to; installation of scope ring and base screws, action screws and trigger guard screws. With proper care and use, the FAT Wrench will provide a lifetime of reliable service. Includes 9 bits and a square drive adapter. Includes a Leupold/Buehler windage bit, #10 flat blade, #11 flat blade, #32 flat blade, 3/32"" Allen, 5/32"" Allen, T10 Torx, T15 Torx, T20 Torx, and a Square drive adapter bit.Scope Ring Alignment: This kit improves scope mounting two ways. First, the short bars let you know when the front ring is in perfect alignment with the rear one. Second, lapping the inside of the scope rings will reduce or eliminate any shifting of the scope inside the rings and will also remove machining marks that can scratch the finish on the scope. This is ""State-of-the-Art"" scope mounting and will provide you with confidence that the job has been done right. 1"" and 30mm kits include 2 alignment rods, lapping rod with handle (8"" steel shaft, plastic ball handle) and 1 oz jar of 220 grit high quality silicon carbide lapping compound. The combo kit comes with 2 alignment bars, 2 lapping shafts one 1"" and one 30mm. Properly aligned rings create more surface contact with the scope tube to keep scopes in place during heavy recoil. Misaligned rings cause stress on the scope tube, which can dent the tube, distort the reticle, and cause adjustment problems. Scopes will need to be sighted in following the use of this kit.Level-Level-Level: The simplest, most accurate scope leveling system ever devised to level your scope as you mount it on your rifle. The magnetic base in the rifle level bridges the bolt raceway, allowing you to position your rifle almost perfectly level. The second level sits on top of your scope cap allowing the the reticle to be leveled. Once the rifle and crosshairs are level, tighten the rings and the job is done. Works with practically any bolt-action rifle. Set includes two levels."
