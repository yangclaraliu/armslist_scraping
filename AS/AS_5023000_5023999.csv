177,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5023177,For Sale:  AR15 80 Lower Jig by Modulus Arms,"Northeast Side, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 165,"Listed On: Monday, January 4, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Get the latest Heavy Duty Jig From Modulus arms with an indefinite lifespan with the Drill Bits and Carbide Cutter included. HUGE SAVINGS TO YOU $165.00 for all.

Traditional 80% Jigs use the fire-control area to align and center the Jig. Variations in the width of the lowers and inconsistencies in the forgings prevent this from being a repeatable place to locate the Jig. Other Jigs are incompatible with many different brands of lowers and do not account for manufacturing deviations and billet design differences. The result is poor fitment, improper location of machining features, sloppy fitment with upper receivers and the potential for non-functional rifles. Competitor's so called ""Universal"" Jigs do not solve these issues.
The Brand New Modulus Arms Heavy-Duty Jig takes a different approach, using standardized dimensions to locate and center the template. The Modulus Arms Heavy-Duty 80% Lower Jig uses the standard locations of the front take down and buffer tube mount to locate the Jig, resulting in a Jig that is compatible with any lower receiver, guaranteed.

At Modulus Arms, we have solved these lower receiver differences and applied them to our Heavy-Duty AR-15 80% Lower Reciever Jig. We have the most accurate, fastest, easiest, most durable and universal jig available. 

Key Features of the Heavy-Duty Jig:

Solid Steel Side Plates: Solid High Strength Alloy Steel Side Plates. We went above and beyond the competition and rather than using aluminum or even steel bushings we decided to make SOLID STEEL side plates.



Solid Steel Drill Template: Solid High Strength Alloy Steel Drill Template. The Heavy-Duty Jig has an increased thickness Drill Template that is made of SOLID STEEL. Oblonged holes and replacing pieces is a thing of the past.



Solid Steel Router Template: Solid High Strength Alloy Steel Router Template. Every wear surface of the Heavy-Duty Jig is made from High-Strength Steel. No more worn out templates or melted aluminum.



Easy and Fast Assembly: The Router Template and Drill Template are now held down with ONLY FOUR SCREWS!. This makes changing configurations for milling and drilling a breeze.



Larger Area Router Base: The Router Base is now MASSIVE! It is almost twice the size as the standard jig and is almost a full 3/8"" thick.



Universal Compatibility: Use of standardized AR-15 upper dimensions to locate and center the Jig results in universal compatibility and more accurate machining.

225,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5023225,For Sale:  AR15 80 Lower Jig Heavy Duty Brand New Design Top Rated,"Northeast, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 165,"Listed On: Monday, January 4, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is the number one rated jig brand new used once. You will get all the drill bits and the Carbide cutter included with it. Save a TON OF CASH!!!

Traditional 80% Jigs use the fire-control area to align and center the Jig. Variations in the width of the lowers and inconsistencies in the forgings prevent this from being a repeatable place to locate the Jig. Other Jigs are incompatible with many different brands of lowers and do not account for manufacturing deviations and billet design differences. The result is poor fitment, improper location of machining features, sloppy fitment with upper receivers and the potential for non-functional rifles. Competitor's so called ""Universal"" Jigs do not solve these issues.
The Brand New Modulus Arms Heavy-Duty Jig takes a different approach, using standardized dimensions to locate and center the template. The Modulus Arms Heavy-Duty 80% Lower Jig uses the standard locations of the front take down and buffer tube mount to locate the Jig, resulting in a Jig that is compatible with any lower receiver, guaranteed.

At Modulus Arms, we have solved these lower receiver differences and applied them to our Heavy-Duty AR-15 80% Lower Reciever Jig. We have the most accurate, fastest, easiest, most durable and universal jig available. 

Key Features of the Heavy-Duty Jig:

Solid Steel Side Plates: Solid High Strength Alloy Steel Side Plates. We went above and beyond the competition and rather than using aluminum or even steel bushings we decided to make SOLID STEEL side plates.



Solid Steel Drill Template: Solid High Strength Alloy Steel Drill Template. The Heavy-Duty Jig has an increased thickness Drill Template that is made of SOLID STEEL. Oblonged holes and replacing pieces is a thing of the past.



Solid Steel Router Template: Solid High Strength Alloy Steel Router Template. Every wear surface of the Heavy-Duty Jig is made from High-Strength Steel. No more worn out templates or melted aluminum.



Easy and Fast Assembly: The Router Template and Drill Template are now held down with ONLY FOUR SCREWS!. This makes changing configurations for milling and drilling a breeze.



Larger Area Router Base: The Router Base is now MASSIVE! It is almost twice the size as the standard jig and is almost a full 3/8"" thick.



Universal Compatibility: Use of standardized AR-15 upper dimensions to locate and center the Jig results in universal compatibility and more accurate machining.



Safer and Faster: The Modulus Arms Heavy-Duty AR-15 Jig accommodates the use of a router for safer and faster machining and only needs a  traditional handheld drill.



More Accurate: The Depth Gauge included  takes the guess work out of finishing your lower receiver minimizing the opportunity for mistakes.



Professionally Engineered Design: The Modulus Arms Heavy-Duty AR-15 Lower Receiver Jig is designed by a team of mechanical engineers with decades of experience and CNC machined to tight tolerances.

I wanted one, but ended up buying 2, so I now have one I don't need. Shotgun is in excellent condition. Price is 250 OBO. See below regarding trades. From the Manufacturer's Sight.... Tracker II Slug Gun Maximize your distance and accuracy. At H&R, we offer a broad range of tack-driving rifled slug guns that can cost less than an accessory slug barrel for many repeaters. They’re unfailingly dependable, easy to carry and exceptionally accurate out to the farthest reaches of shotgun range. Our single-shot action’s strong lockup and stout build creates an inherently precise platform. But another major contributor to their ultra-tight grouping capability is the Ultragon™ Rifling. It uses six oval lands and grooves without sharp corners like traditional rifling. This system imparts stabilizing spin on your slug without distorting the sabot jacket or exterior of your slug, leading to a better gas seal, higher velocities and more consistent flight characteristics. No nonsense. Just pure deer-dropping performance. A lightweight fully rifled slug gun featuring adjustable rifle sights. Its walnut-finished hardwood stock has sling swivel studs and a recoil pad. Available in 12 and 20 gauge."

We also purchased the synthetic stock/forearm system for the gun so the stock could adjust as he grew.  So this gun is very versatile - can be used as a hunting gun, turkey or home defense.

It is 7 rounds plus 1, but with the Benelli you can ride one round on the carrier which makes it 8 plus 1. I only fired 20 rounds through it in order to make sure there were no problems while under warrantee and to make sure it worked smoothly with the added mag extension. I then cleaned it and put it away. I didn't feel I could say NIB because I had test fired it. Everything is included just as new, plus the original mag tube that was replaced It comes with two (2) additional choke tubes and wrench. I do not shoot 3-gun but heard that that it is a very sought after shotgun because the inertia bolt system is the fastest and the Benelli reliably shoots all types of ammo. Not considering any trades."

Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

It has been fired but is in like new condition. There was not many manufactured and it is difficult to find one. I purchased this one at an estate sale and it was still in the factory box.RUGER PC9The Ruger Police Carbine is a pistol caliber carbine designed as a companion to the Ruger P Series pistols. As of 2007, Ruger has discontinued production citing low demand. It is a semi-automatic carbine using a blowback action. The Carbine uses the same ammunition and magazines as the Ruger P Series 9mm and .40 S&W caliber pistols.Both the PC9 (the 9mm version) and the PC4 (.40 S&W) are patterned after the highly successful Ruger 10/22 carbine. The Carbine is intended as a shoulder weapon for police use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well. The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available (for example, in his/her patrol vehicle) as a shoulder weapon if needed. Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol (see internal ballistics). The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol.The Carbine has some unique design features. The action is a simple blowback design, which requires a fairly massive bolt to handle the pressure of 9mm and .40 S&W. To prevent the gun from being too unbalanced by the large bolt, the bolt consists of two parts; the main body of the bolt is fairly light and located in the receiver, while the other part is just a weight located under the forend of the carbine. These two parts are held together by strong, rigid steel bars. The combined mass serves to hold the breech safely closed during firing, while keeping the center of gravity forward, so the gun handles well. Another unique feature is the bolt lock. Since blowback guns of these calibers require heavy bolts, the inertia of dropping the gun can cause the bolt to come partially open, rendering the gun unfirable until the bolt is manually closed all the way. To prevent this, the Carbine uses a lock that locks the bolt securely closed so that a fall will not dislodge it. A slight pressure on the trigger or on the bolt handle, however, will disengage the bolt so that it can move for firing or clearing the action.In addition to caliber, the Carbine also comes with a choice in sights. The standard model uses notch and post sights, while the GR models are equipped with ghost ring sights. The ghost ring sights cost more, but they are generally considered better for defensive purposes, as they allow faster sighting under poor lighting conditions plus a longer sight radius for greater potential accuracy. The Carbine also has Ruger style scope bases built into the receiver, allowing optical sights to be easily and securely mounted."
