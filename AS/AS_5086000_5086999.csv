Now if you dont know about Pelican Cases, look them up online and see what you have been missing out on.  I have personally seen a 5-Ton LMTV (Miltary Transport Truck) run completely over one of these cases with all tires, in a gravel parking lot, and it barely left a scratch on the case and didn't even disturb the two M4 Rifles inside. When I was in the U.S. Army we only used Pelican cases for all of our high dollar aircraft avionics, radios, etc. and also for all of our rifles & weapons systems and they still continue to only use Pelican Brand cases to this day.  None of the contents in the photos are included. Only the protective foam inserts and the actual case are for sale. I only used the contents to show what all it will hold.

So naturally the Z7 became my backup bow.  Well when Mathews came out with the No Cam, I sold the Heli-M and bought the No Cam.  So the Z7 remained my backup bow.  After the 1 season I used the bow, I cleaned it, waxed the string and stored it in it's case.  i take it out periodically to check the mechanisms and oil/lube if necessary and wax strings if necessary so nothing dries out.  It is a wonderful bow for beginner to expert.  And IMO an all around perfect hunting bow.  It has a shorter axle to axle height for tight spaces or heavy brush/timber. perfect for tree stand, pop up blind, or ground blind/stick blind. Perfect for a spot and stalk or whatever else you might do while hunting.  It's not heavy, and shoots flawlessly.  The buck I shot with this bow died 10 yards from where I shot it from, which was a 45 yard shot so It is deadly accurate and has a lot of energy behind it.  It shoots quiet and I didn't notice any vibration when shooting it.  I want to sell/trade because I don't use it and someone needs to.  It's too nice of a bow."

Both firearms come with the factory box, paperwork, 2 safety keys and 2 twelve round magazines. The PT111 is lightweight at 22 oz, has a polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, which makes the newly designed Millennium G2 ideal for a concealed & carry handgun. The Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment! I watched a 22 minute thorough review on this firearm, on YouTube by hickok45, and this is definitely a quality and dependable gun to have, without breaking the bank! It has similar features to the Glock, including the easy and & fast way to field strip it, and has similar weight and dimensions to other Glocks, like the width and weight of the Glock 26, and the overall height that is similar to the Glock 19.....................There have been a few upgrades made to these 3 guns, which include FULLY POLISHED BARRELS, POLISHED FEED RAMPS, SILVER LETTERING and CUSTOM STIPPLING! Stippling was added to the sides of the frame, at the thumb areas, as well as to pinky extensions on all magazines! These custom touches make the guns look GREAT and the stippling helps substantially with gun control!...................I am asking $350 each (obo) but I will make you a better deal if you buy both of them at the same time, so make me a fair offer!"
