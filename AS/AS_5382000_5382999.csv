I'm going to be moving out of state and liquidating my gun collection. This one isn't one of those I need to get rid of but if it finds a good new owner that will take care of it as well as I have, I won't loose too much sleep over it. It's taken care of me and luckily I've never had to use it except for at my local shooting range. I just put brand new Duracell batteries in the laser as of 4/11/2016.I do do have other handguns and shotguns in my collection I'm looking to liquidate if interestedThank you and God Bless."

Normally the bead front sight was reserved for target models, but some were equipped based on availability of parts, as these were manufactured during war time. Serial #318xxx Bore looks good, no pitting anywhere and riflings are defined. This Smith and Wesson is in excellent condition for a gun that is 100 years old. Just a real treasure to have.  ------------------------ Some History:
Production of the .455 Mark II Hand Ejector Second Model began in 1915 and continued until 1917 with serial numbers following on from the First model starting at serial number 5001 and continuing on up to serial number 74755. Although for various reasons, as stated previously, there are some Mark I's numbered in the early part of this serial number range including those made by the using up of old parts. In total there were 69,754 Mark II .455's produced.
The Canadian Government purchased 14,500 directly from Smith & Wesson and in addition 1,105 were made for the commercial market after completion of the British contract. The rest went to the British Government.
When these guns were sold off as War surplus some were converted to more popular calibres due to the unavailability of the .455 ammunition, especially those that went to the United States. The two usual conversions were to .45 long Colt by lengthening the chambers and then either the cylinder was shortened or some metal was removed from the recoil shield to allow for the extra thickness of the rim on the cartridge case. The other conversion was to .45 ACP by shortening the cylinder and using .45 ACP in half moon clips or .45 auto rim ammunition. -------------------------- Just a beautiful, and perfect shooting gun. Very accurate, a must have for any smith and wesson collection. All transactions are face to face in the Tulsa area. Prefer text or email. nine18-four02-zero854"
