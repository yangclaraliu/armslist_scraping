The Sandman Ti™ is your huckleberry. With its direct thread attachment and titanium tube it’s the perfect fit for your precision rifle, or even for dedicated use under your AR pattern rifle forend. The Ti has the class leading solid weld Stellite® baffle core and detachable front cap, just like the rest of our Sandman Series. The exterior is finished in Cerakote® for ultimate durability. Like all of our products, it is backed by a lifetime warranty. Proudly made in the U.S.A. DEAD AIR ARMAMENT™ IS NEW, AND BETTER. It was founded by Mike Pappas, and if that name rings a bell, it’s because Mike co-founded another silencer company back in 2008. Among others, Mike is also teamed up with silencer designer Todd Magee. Mike and Todd have set out to build the best suppressors on the market. There is no substitute for experience. IT’S IN THE DESIGN. Look at any Dead Air Armament™ product and you’ll see attention to detail and aesthetic choices driven solely by engineering performance. No gimmicks or short cuts – just pure performance. As Mike puts it: “I’m finally building the no compromise suppressors that I’ve always wanted to make. No corporate bottom lines. The only thing that matters to me is how it sounds; And the Sandman™ sounds awesome…” IT’S IN THE MATERIALS. There is no substitute for materials and no shortcuts with Dead Air. Every Sandman™ baffle is 100% Stellite®. They cost three times more than stainless steel and they work better than Inconel® under the hardest use and conditions. As for the tubes, we could have used the material that most of our competitors use, but instead we went with high-performance precipitation hardened stainless steel because lightweight strength does not come cheap. Only with the Sandman Ti do we forgo the use of high-performance stainless steel and that’s because we use Grade #9 titanium. Why do we do it? Because our precision rifle direct thread suppressor is designed for professional law enforcement applications. The old adage “close only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades” could not be truer when a professional has to make an accurate shot in difficult conditions. IT’S IN THE MANUFACTURING. Design and materials are part of the equation, but there is no substitute for thirty years of manufacturing excellence and that’s what BPI® brings to the product. Every Dead Air suppressor is manufactured in Lawrenceville, Georgia by highly trained Americans intent on manufacturing the best suppressor on the market. Our standards are simple, “good isn’t good enough” and if a product comes off the line not up to par, then the can gets canned. It’s that simple.   Specifications:  Rating: Multi - Up to .300 Win Mag Length: 8.2” Weight: 16.8 oz. Diameter: 1.5” Finish: Cerakote body. Made in the U.S.A.    Please note that the sale of suppressors is restricted:  Suppressors must be picked up locally or shipped to a Licensed NFA/Class 3 Federal Firearms Dealer in your state of residence. Your FFL must e-mail their license to us before we ship the suppressor, email: REDACTED. All local transfer fees and taxes are the responsibility of the buyer (we do not charge a transfer fee on our end). Suppressors for sale in the USA only. Texas residents may pick up the suppressor at our office in person after the required paperwork is completed. Texas State residents must pay sales tax on purchases."

If you need a lightweight carry revolver then look no further! The streamline, lightweight, no snag design with no hammer makes it ideal for carry and conceal. This weapon has been shot rarely and cleaned maticulously after every time it put rounds down range. With the .38 you also have plenty of knockdown and still light even with the full load of 5. The S&W J-Frame has become the most popular small frame revolver on the market. With the Crimson Trace laser you add the accuracy and intimidation factor of a laser. The grip was over $300 by itself but have come down about $50 since.I am primarily looking for trades of equal quality and value preferably an auto. I am a Glock fan so that would be a safe bet but willing to entertain any trades that are interesting. REDACTED text or call at a decent hour please, if you have any questions."

As you can see in the pictures the gun is in great shape-especially the wood (I dont see as many of these with laminated wood anymore), it has a mirror bore, blueing is around 95%. I bought the gun for myself mostly for snakes and such and my 11 year old shoots it occationally, personally I really like it and Im not in a rush to sell or a bind to let it go - its just a good solid, light, dependable not to mention versitle gun. Let me know if your interested, cash only, no trades. Thanks."

Then you may be interested in this. I have a gently used Browning X-Bolt Varmit Stalker rifle in .204 Ruger. The rifle has only been fired approx 60 times and has always been cleaned and lubed after any handling. Comes just like you see it, no nicks on the stock, no marring on the bluing. The scope mounts are already installed, you just provide the scope.Whether you're calling coyotes or administering high velocity lead poisoning to prairie dogs or ground hogs, the X-Bolt Varmit Stalker is an excellent choice for the conscientious varmit hunter.This model also features a deluxe Inflex Technology recoil pad and sling swivels. If you are looking for a hard core bolt action rifle that you can rely on, in the rugged areas and inclement weatherconditions hunting deer, elk, varmits and the like, the X-Bolt is your rifle. The three lever Feather Trigger system is probably the most comfortable, simple trigger on any bolt-action rifle onthe market. There is no take-up or creep and very little over-travel.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).Fixed Night SightsManual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Safety2 18RD Magazines91152REDACTED26"

I still have the original hard case it came in, the manual and two 10 round magazines. Mags still have the factory stickers on them, although a little worn. It is a double action/single action with a manual safety that also is a decocker. Magazine release is ambidextrous. This is a metal framed gun, but the frames are made from aircraft grade aluminum. Not as heavy as a steel gun, but not as light as a plastic framed gun. If you look these up, you'll see that they are known to be extremely reliable machines that will eat whatever you feed them and go ""BANG"" every time.I had another P94 in the past, but the slide on it looked like a brushed stainless. It doesn't show color correct in my pictures. For some reason, this one's slide looks a little more grey, like titanium, which to me makes it look (dare I say) more tactical. The pictures do not show how nice it is if you ask me, and bothe frame and slide are darker toned than what the pics show. Also, you'll want to check out The Hogue wrap around grips they sell for this model as I think they really transform the looks and feel of the gun (had them on my last one and LOVED THEM!)I bought it used for $425 and have since put 200 rounds through it without a single issue. It will shoot any S&W .40 ACP you put into it. Even the cheap, aluminum cased stuff. Well maintained!I would like to get as close to what I paid as possible, but am open to offers. Just go easy on me (please hold unrealistic lowball offers) I know they sell on here generally for about $400-$425. I will also consider partial cash with a trade. I like 9mm and .45 mostly now, but am open to others (no rifles or shotguns please) What do you have?"

Included it the sale are 19 mags 6 Tapco 30 round and 13 factory steel 35 round. I have had this gun for around 6 months and haven't shot it so it's time to sell it. Overall it's in great shape and has been back to Century for the upgrades. I am the second owner, the guy I got it from really liked it and said it shot great. Now a few notes about the mags....(1) 5 of them were altered to fit another gun and will need to be fit for this one, 14 of them are good to go.(2) Colorado laws will be followed, I will pin the Tapco mags out of the kindness of my heart but the steel ones will need to be sent out of state (on your dime) or forfited.(3) If you are active duty military or law enforcement with ID you may have all of them unaltered (inform me before we meet at FFL). (4) Mag kits are not legal so don't ask! If you want a milled AK pattern rifle but in a common U.S. caliber this is the one for you.

This allows an immediate change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.
