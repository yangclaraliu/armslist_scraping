SOCOM snipers have been using the 300 win mag for years as one of their go to platforms and now this year 2014 the U.S. Army has officially adopted the .300 WM as their next generation sniper caliber. The US Army has adopted it for their new versions of the M24 SWS and as such a new emphasis was placed on making it an effective cartridge for 1500 meter engagements. The 300 WM is an outstanding cartridge for military sniping but as you might imagine it offers a lot of power and penetration which limits its role in Law Enforcement. The Secret Service does use the .300 WM, but they're situation is rare and unique and they do not typically have to be concerned with hostage situations. They just need to insure that the possible assassin is stopped and the .300 WM is a good caliber to do that. The .300 WM is also a great round for going through media in order to hit the target. With the new heavier loads the .300 is very capable of extending well past 1400 meters reliably. Prior to standard adoption Special Forces and Marine Force Recon prevailed upon Surgeon rifles for numerous custom platforms which are in use today."

Frame and magazines have color fill.  The gun looks great! I know a few guys that have these and they absolutely love them, but I need to sell mine. The Taurus PT111 Millennium G2 comes with the factory box, paperwork, safety key, sight adjustment key and 2 twelve round magazines. The PT111 is lightweight at 22 oz, has a polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, which makes the newly designed Millennium G2 ideal for a concealed & carry handgun. The Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment! If you are unsure on this one, check out the video on YouTube by hickok45 and you will see that this is definitely a quality and dependable gun to have, without breaking the bank! It has similar features to the Glock, including the easy and & fast way to field strip it, and has similar weight and dimensions to other Glocks, like the width and weight of the Glock 26, and the overall height that is similar to the Glock 19.....................Like I said, this is BRAND NEW and I have NEVER FIRED IT! There have been a few upgrades made, including a FULLY POLISHED BARREL, POLISHED FEED RAMP, SILVER LETTERING and CUSTOM STIPPLING! Stippling was added to the sides of the frame, at the thumb areas and really helps with gun control!...................I am asking $300 (obo).  ONLY SELLING TO FUND A NEW BOW FOR A KID (not my own kid).  Let me know if you have questions.  Not interested in any trades unless you can give me a Genesis Original Bow (custom colors), 6 arrows (custom color), bow case and a NASP target.  417-818-6one66"

""On paper, it’s clearly the most advanced lever action rifle on the market. The rack based operates more smoothly than a typical Win 94, and the bolt locks up solid enough to fire powerful cartridges. The detachable magazine is faster to load than a tube, and it also enables further flying pointed bullets vs the flat or hollow point ones required by tube magazine lever action rifles. The rifle is also easily scoped, something more difficult with a traditional top eject lever action. The Browing BLR combines all the great handling and fast firing of a lever, but reduces most of the negatives that usually come with one. "" The Hunting Gear Guy.
