Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. Ultra-SafeUltra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home DefenseDesigned to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with FeaturesLoaded-with-FeaturesThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.Easy-to-MaintainReliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame."

It was purchesed in November and as never been shot. If you are not familiar with the 380 Concealed Carry model it is not like the standard Thunder .380, this piece a bit smaller and lighter but has a 8 round magazine instead of the standard 7. The grips are contoured for fingers, the beaver tail has been shortened a bit and the decocker and slide release are lower profile so they are less likely to catch on clothing, etc. It out-performs, out-features and out prices all others in it's class. The Thunder 380 CC has become a leader among concealed carry handguns by earning a reputation of reliability, accuracy and durability. Extremely compact and strong, the 380 CC’s quality design and engineering provide the shooter enhanced balance during those critical seconds. Features like the loaded chamber indicator, extended capacity magazine and slide sights make the 380 CC a perfect CCW sidearm. At just over a pound, you won’t even know you’re carrying it. Possessing attributes of more expensive guns, the Thunder 380 CC is truly a personal protection “Best Buy”."
