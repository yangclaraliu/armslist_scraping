Product Description Finally available for public consumption is the much anticipated Scorpion sub-gun. Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. 2016 models now feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability. The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. Starting at just $849, it’s a whole lot of bang for the buck. https://youtu.be/8XAYsYwZGxIThe CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax.

The Chameleon .308 from Huntertown Arms is an affordable titanium exterior suppressor with stainless steel baffles. Specs below are as per manufacturer's website. Lifetime warranty. This is an NFA item and requires an NFA trust or LEO notification/fingerprints. Trusts available for $175. Please call Randy or Ben at the shop for details. The Chameleon series of rifle suppressors provide low weight, hearing safe centerfire rifle suppressor for the .30 caliber platform (up to .308) that can be easily maintained and repaired. It does not disappoint. The Chameleon core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Chameleon core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core. Chameleon baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.

The triggers are smooth, bolts move freely, sights are straight and wood is very nice. They contract Mossberg to make the barrels so the threads are clean and the flash hider is concentric.This really is a very nice gun expecially at this price point.

The Super Blackhawk is similar to Ruger's standard Blackhawk model in that it has a solid cylinder-frame made of premium modern steel, and uses all coil springs in the mechanism that retain their power for ultra-durability (instead of leaf-springs). The robust Super Blackhawk features an all-steel grip frame to add weight and balance the sidearm, and the grip is slightly longer than that of the standard Blackhawk to provide a solid grip and disperse recoil over a larger area. The back of the trigger guard has been squared off to give more room for the shooter's knuckles to protect them from punishing recoil. The hammer spur on the Super Blackhawk is lower and wider, and the trigger is wider as well. An unfluted cylinder is also featured to add weight and withstand high-pressure .44 magnum loads. Common to all Ruger Single-Action Revolvers, the Super Blackhawk uses Ruger's patented transfer bar ignition system that provides an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge, allowing the shooter to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. The traditional western-style grip pattern of the Super Blackhawk is known for aiding in natural pointing characteristics, enabling shooters to instinctively draw and shoot, as well as stand and take fine aim. The rear sight is click adjustable for both windage and elevation, and is protected by integral frame topstrap ribs. The front sight is an improved Partridge type that provides a good sight picture, and allows for snag-free withdrawal from holsters. The Ruger Super Blackhawk Single-Action Revolver represents a great value in a big game hunting or target-shooting sidearm. Made In USAManufactured 1979 per serial number history.  Never been fired!  Mint Condition!"

As you will see, this gun is in museum grade condition. It would be impossible to find another one such condition. This gun was part of an HK collection from a collector who bought it new in 1993. That collector went into retirement, and liquidated some very rare guns last summer. I purchased this gun from him, within hours of it becoming available. This gun has spent the last 23 years in a time capsule. A climate controlled capsule. Rarely handled, let alone fired. Even the mags have never been loaded (hence the photo detailing the mag follower). Everything about it is as new as new gets. When I took ownership of it last summer, I continued its preservation with a climate controlled safe of my own. As tempting as it is to handle and admire, I’ve done my best to avoid doing so. Mainly due to the extensive storage preparation required after handling. Heck I’ve even avoided touching/opening the factory box it comes in. I doubt one could find a 23 year old gun box without scratches, as if it was manufactured yesterday. To preserve everything to my utmost ability, I bag sealed the box, then foam wrapped the bagged box to eliminate any chance of the box getting scratched.  So to the HK collector out there, here is your chance to have a pristine example of the factory nickel P7M13."

The barrel had the blue finish removed since I bought it and it hasn't rusted. It shows very little signs of wear. It is very rare because it was built in 1994 and brings a factory “all steel” hammer; thus making it very hard to break off. It’s a great gun!
