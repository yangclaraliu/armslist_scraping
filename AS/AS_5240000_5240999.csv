Would primarily like a full size M&P45 or a CZ97 in trade plus cash.  Might consider other quality handguns in 45 (Glock, XDm, etc), but I'm not interested in 1911's.  Might also consider other Sigs in 9mm (not interested in 40's, sorry) or a CZ75 or one of its derivatives (not interested in the P07), or possibly other handguns in the same caliber plus cash depending on what you have.  Could add cash myself if you have something of higher value.  Not really interested in any long guns at this time, sorry.If you'd rather buy I'd sell it for $800 firm with two mags.  For an extra $100 I can include five more for 7 total magazines.  Cash prices are firm, I'm in no way desperate to get rid of it, just looking to try something new.If interested feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers or questions, texts will get the fastest response from me. PS: I may not be able to respond to offers until this afternoon, but will respond ASAP if interested. Thanks!"

'DIGS', Delayed Impingement Gas System puts the recoil system up front over the barrel where it naturally pushes the rifle back down on target instead of up into your shoulder. 'MIS', Manifold Injection System forces expelled gases through the bolt carrier making this the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world. The Para TTR won Shooting Illustrated Magazine ""Golden Bullseye Award for Rifle of the Year"". These rifles were manufactured by Para USA in Charlotte, No. Carolina. 
THE  Para Tactical Target Rifle with its DELAYED Impinged Gas System™ (DIGS™) gets you back on target faster than any other rifle of its kind. The recoil spring is over the op-rod so there is no “twang” in your ear as your head rests on the rifle’s stock while the bolt cycles between shots.
 
Having the recoil system up front over the barrel puts it where it naturally pushes the rifle back down on target instead of up and into your shoulder.

It is a bird gun with the 26"" barrel. It has a +2 magazine tube extension installed giving it the ability to hold 7+1. This is how it was when i purchased it. I cant say enough about the quality of this gun. Ive never had a failure to feed. And it shoots anything from 2 3/4 to 3 1/2"" shells. Thanks for your time."

Cleaned OCD-style, barrel, cylinder face, yoke, frame, internals, etc.If you're like me, you don't want to pay for accessories you wouldn't necessarily put on yourself, I get that, I do. But this is the ONLY gun I've ever put Crimson Trace grips on, as a practical accessory. The short range and minimal sights made it a good idea in my eyes, and the grips are dialed in to approximately 20 feet. BUT, even though the grips were bought new only a month ago, I'm valuing them at $75 (price included in total price).TULSA AREA ONLY please! NO TRADES please! Thanks!"

Not for sure where one model starts and one ends. The gun predates marking the model. But it is in that line. It has been shot little and the bore is very nice. There are places on the outside of the barrel, near the end where the bluing has started to wear.  There are also places on corners that are starting to get rust/patina (I can't tell the differences).  I have tried to show the spots with pictures but can only upload one so would be happy to email others.  It is a 5 inch barrel with 4 screws showing. Was told you would want to know that. Also all 4 spots show the same serial number: barrel, grips, frame, cylinder. Again was told you would want to know that. I am not looking for a trade and can only sell to a kansas resident who is legal to own a firearm and would sign a bill of sale. Please ask if I can we anything.Thank you."

It is based on the Smith & Wesson Model 60 platform.This vintage Rossi M88 38 Special was bought new by me in what I remember to be the latter part of the 1980's from Murf's Guns in Duncan. This Rossi is in excellent condition, having thirty rounds fired through it in the approximately thirty years I have owned it. I bought it, fired fifteen rounds of a fifty round box of ammo through it, cleaned and wiped it down, and stored it and the ammunition in a climate controlled area until I took it back out in February. I bought new ammo and fired fifteen more rounds through it before firing the rest of the old box of ammo and some new stuff through my new S&W 442. This Rossi is a great little shooter and, being heavier than my 442, was more accurate comparing the fifteen rounds from each gun."

I originally bought this gun because of my fascination with the early Paris ASP and Devel modifications to first generation S&W automatics, and their influence on early CCW pistols. The 669 incorporates some of the advancements of the ASP and Devel customs: shortened grip and slide, smoothed surfaces and aggressive trigger hook.  It is a DA/SA, double stack, 9mm with 13 round capacity and slide mounted safety/decocker.  The 669 was originally designed as a concealed carry weapon for the law enforcement market during the early 1980s.  While CCW has come a long way since then, this pistol remains a reliable carry piece and unique throwback for Smith and Wesson collectors.  Comes with 3 magazines, (2 finger extension and 1 flush fit).  Since rebuilding, I have put very few rounds through it to test function, and it has been a safequeen since.  Price is $475, which is well below what I have into the gun. Transfer will have to go through an FFL somewhere between SW Pittsburgh and Washington, choice is up to you.  Thanks!The only trade I am interested in is a vz61 Skorpion in .32 ACP with wood grips (Czechpoint preferred)."

It touts an interchangeable barrel system which allows you to precisely set the cylinder gap, and has the revolver signature of craftsmanship, the recessed cylinder. These revolvers were a departure from S&W's regular production guns by the grandson of its founder. Same great reliability, but these guns had features like interchangeable front sights, solid wood grips, a wide choice of barrels that the user could exchange, and a much improved double/single action trigger pull. The .357 magnum is arguably the best personal defense caliber ever developed, and this gun carries 6 in a safe compact package that easily converts to a long range target pistol. This particular offering has the 2 1/2"" and 8"" barrels, and the necessary tools for making the switch. I'd be happy to show you how to change them over, it takes about a minute. I have had this gun for about 5 years, but I've only fired a few cylinders of .38's through it. Wonderful, dependable example of what many believe to be one of the best revolvers ever made in America. The previous owner was a private detective, so both barrels show some holster wear, and the finish is intact with light scratches from the same. I'm listing it with both barrels and tools for $600, but I'd sell the gun and either barrel for $500. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions, and I'll answer them as best I can. Additional pictures are available if needed, armslist will only allow me to post one. Thanks for looking!"

I purchased the gun on 02/26/2016 from Buds Gun Shop as an impulse buy. I have fired 50 rounds through the gun with zero problems. The gun has not been registered with Springfield yet so the lifetime warranty is still good for who ever buys it from me. The gun comes complete with all paper work and purchase receipt.  e all-new 4″ Lightweight Champion™ offers a longer four-inch barrel that presents increased sight radius and more practical accuracy. Let’s not forget the extra velocity the longer barrel adds to any given cartridge. Better yet, the EMP® 4″ offers an extra half inch of height, providing plenty of room for a strong and positive grip. The EMP® 4″ is loaded with extras like a fiber optic front sight and two-dot, low-profile combat rear sight for effortless target acquisition. Ambidextrous safety levers, a match-grade barrel, and Posi-Lock™ grip texture to the front strap add extra high value benefits for the serious shooter. Not only is the new EMP® 4″ a controllable gun, it packs ten rounds (in 9mm) plus one more in the chamber. That’s in a slender single stack pistol, not a thicker double stack design. In fact, the new EMP® 4″ offers the same reduced grip circumference that made the original so successful. Looks aren’t everything, but the Cocobolo wood grips and two-tone forged stainless steel slide and black anodized aluminum (9MM) or Carbon Steel Black Armory Kote™ (.40SW) frame make the EMP® a looker sure to turn heads at the range. But you know it’s what’s under the covers that counts. While the EMP® 4″ might be the perfect carry gun, it’s new size makes it ideal for home defense, concealed carry or a little fun at the range. Pick one up at your local gun store. You’ll feel the difference - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/1911-emp-4-lightweight-champion-9mm/#sthash.KjfzAOai.dpuf"
