This is not a pre 64 but deserves as much attention because of its condition. I'm not sure if this rifle was ever fired....there are no marks on the loading gate from sliding a cartridge, the bolt face looks very clean, the bore looks like brand new as does the wood and bluing on this rifle. I have seen more marks on a brand new rifle right out of the box from the factory than this rifle shows. Serial number shows this rifle being produced in 1972 when it was still Winchester, NEW HAVEN, CONN. This is a regular model 94 with a 20"" round barrel, two barrel bands, factory front and rear sights complete with hood and elevator. Straight pistol grip, walnut stock with no holes for swivels. Unfortunately there is no box for this beauty but it's still a great addition to your Winchester collection. There is a light mark on the left side of the receiver on the inside screw just above the front portion of the loop. It is completely circular around the outside of the screw. Overall a nice find whether it be to shoot or collect. I'm sure it is a better rifle than the thousand dollar model they offer today. No box or paperwork with this rifle. Buyer pays $20 for shiping"
