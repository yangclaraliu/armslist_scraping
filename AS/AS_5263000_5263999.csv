Adapting the design to fire the standard .303 round led to the Rifle, .303 Pattern 1914 (P14), a design fed from a five-round internal magazine. With its prominent sight protection ears on the receiver, ""dog-leg"" bolt handle and ""pot-belly"" magazine, it was distinctive in appearance. The action was essentially a Mauser design with some Lee features and optimised for rapid fire, with the action cocking on closing, a feature highly valued by the British Army with its emphasis on riflemen highly trained for rapid fire, but less valued in other armies, such as the US or Germany, where cock-on-opening designs such as the M1903 Springfield  and Mauser 988  were preferred. Cock-on-opening actions became more difficult to operate when heated by rapid fire as the effort to open the bolt had to overcome the striker spring to cock the action as well as unsticking the fired case from the chamber. The P14 was an advanced design for the time, and was said to be the most advanced service rifle of World War I. The P14 featured an aperture rear sight adjustable to 1600 yards and a 300yd battle setting protected by integral and prominent 'ears' on the receiver bridge. There were also volley-fire sights similar to those on the SMLE fitted to the left side of the weapon for use up to 2600 yards. The bolt had a Mauser type claw extractor and two forward lugs; there was also a rear safety lug formed by the base of the bolt handle sitting in a recess in the receiver. Much faster and smoother to operate than a Model 98 Mauser, the bolt was well-supported throughout its travel and the camming action on opening and closing the bolt facilitated ease and speed of operation. I have personally refinished both the stock and metal to original 1914 configuration.  Rifle has been test fired.  Bore is rated very good +.  $700 firm. Shipping available with valid C and R or FFL."

I received this brand new in case Springfield XD9 4"" Full Size Service Model 9mm pistol from my local gun shop last week after ordering it online. It is the ""essentials"" package which includes the Springfield XD9101HC 4"" Full Size Model 9mm Black pistol, two 16 round stainless steel magazines, bore brush, gun lock, plastic Springfield case, and manuals. This gun has never been fired since coming from the factory. The warranty information has not been registered with Springfield. 
I love the Springfield pistols, with the only reason I am selling this one is to purchase a new XDS 9mm that is more to my liking as far as size. 
From the Springfield website: ""The XD® 4″ Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD® 4″ Full Size has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD® 4” Full Size is the original XD® offering from Springfield Armory®, and the most basic XD®. This is the XD® that started it all.
The XD® 4″ Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4” Full Size. Where you point is where you shoot.""

A little info about the bow. 
 
 
Black Widow bows are unique in design and very complex to build. Just the handle alone has up to thirty-seven glue lines (depending on the model) and requires as many man-hours to build as do most complete traditional bows being made today.
Lightning fast limbs are tapered and tillered as only Black Widow bowyers know how. The result of all this effort and expertise is a legendary bow... a Black Widow bow...whose smoothness, stability and speed will amaze you. As one of our satisfied customers put it, “It’s the only custom bow I’ve ever had, and I’ve had about all of them, that has everything I want. It’s fast, smooth, stable and beautiful too. And all in the same bow!” ... That about says it all.
Back in 1982 Ken Beck bought Black Widow Bows. It was the 25th anniversary of the company and he designed his first Black Widow, the MA. MA stood for Maple Anniversary because it was made of Maple and it was the 25th Anniversary. 
In the late 80s, When the MA II Greybark was getting popular, Ken Beck and crew made a target / field bow called a TA, or Target Anniversary. Much longer Riser with additional stabilizer inserts in the horns. it was offered in 64, 66, 68 inch lengths. This model fell by the wayside, thus not even the forms exist today."

According to the barrel code BO it was manufactured in December 1924.
 
The gun over all is in good mechanical condition. The stock was cracked but repaired. A common problem for this model. My great uncle fitted a sleeve on the end of the stock. The forearm is good with no cracks. The stock has the original butt plate. The metal does not have much finish left, but the gun is all original.

A little history about the Remington Model 17
 
In 1915 John Browning patented a pump-action shotgun with the following features: hammerless, under-loading, tubular-magazine, bottom ejecting, and takedown. This design would eventually become the Remington Model 17. Manufacturing rights were sold to Remington Arms shortly after, but due to the production efforts of World War I, Remington was unable to begin manufacturing until 1921. Before production began John Pedersen made alterations to the design, with more changes made later by G.H. Garrison. It was manufactured between 1921 and 1933.
The Model 17 was a trim, 20-gauge shotgun that served as the design basis for three highly successful shotguns: the Remington Model 31, the Ithaca 37 and the Browning BPS. Additionally, features of the Model 17 were also incorporated in the later Mossberg 500 and Remington 870."

$320 firm in cash.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or will ship for $20 more.  Thanks for looking!"

With a wider chamber, it allows you to fire anything you want, but does sacrifice some accuracy when comparing to your PTR SC. These were made as close as possible to the original HK91’s in fit and function(including ammo tolerance, kickback and accuracy). In testing, we have seen that the G.I. will fire almost anything, including tar sealed ammo."

I received this brand new in case Springfield XD9 4"" Full Size Service Model 9mm pistol from my local gun shop last week after ordering it online. It is the ""essentials"" package which includes the Springfield XD9101HC 4"" Full Size Model 9mm Black pistol, two 16 round stainless steel magazines, bore brush, gun lock, plastic Springfield case, and manuals. This gun has never been fired since coming from the factory. The warranty information has not been registered with Springfield. 
I love the Springfield pistols, with the only reason I am selling this one is to purchase a new XDS 9mm that is more to my liking as far as size. 
From the Springfield website: ""The XD® 4″ Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD® 4″ Full Size has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD® 4” Full Size is the original XD® offering from Springfield Armory®, and the most basic XD®. This is the XD® that started it all.
The XD® 4″ Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4” Full Size. Where you point is where you shoot.""

816,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5263816,For Sale:  DELUXE REMINGTON-KEENE BOLT ACTION SPORTING RIFLE,"VA, Virginia, United States","$ 2,300","Listed On: Saturday, March 12, 2016",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,no type,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Very rare Special Order Deluxe Remington-Keene Sporting Rifle, 40-60 Marlin Caliber, 24 & 1/2 inch Half Octagon Barrel, Fancy Walnut Stock, Extra Fine Checkering, Pistol Grip, Plain Front Sight, Combination Open and Peep Rear Sight, Case Hardened Cocking Lever, and Buttplate with a Trapdoor, with a Cleaning Rod Cavity in the stock. No visible serial number on the exterior surface, however, a three digit number is stamped inside the trapdoor of the buttplate. In my estimation, which is inline with a professional appraisal, this rifle is all original, with the possible exception that the hammer fly might or might not have been removed at the factory, enabling the rifle to come to a full-cock upon each cycle of the bolt, like that of the Model 1878 Experimental Rifle, rather than half-cock like that of the Model 1880. Condition in my opinion is NRA Antique Fine to Excellent considering that the hammer fly might have been removed at the factory. The action is strong and very smooth. The screw heads are mostly perfect with but a few showing evidence of the slightest use. In my estimation, the metal finish ranges in quality from a bright blue to a rich patina mix of varying shades, coupled with scattered light freckling mostly on the octagon part of the barrel with some on the hammer. The hammer retains most of its case colors. The trapdoor of the buttplate automatically snaps shut upon attempting to close it manually. The wood finish also shows the lightest of scattered handling marks. There is a very thin crack in the wood that starts at the rear of the upper tang and curls about 5/8ths of an inch to the edge of the checkering as pictured. The crack is possibly due to the over tightening of the tang screw, and it gives every appearance of being superficial and insignificant when it comes to the extra solid wood to metal fit and function of the rifle. Bore: Excellent. All in all, this is a very rare and well cared for special order rifle according to its features and the information contained in reference material including Remington catalogs."

876,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5263876,For Sale:  DELUXE REMINGTON-KEENE BOLT ACTION SPORTING RIFLE,"VA, Virginia, United States","$ 2,300","Listed On: Saturday, March 12, 2016",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,no type,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Very rare Special Order Deluxe Remington-Keene Sporting Rifle, 40-60 Marlin Caliber, 24 & 1/2 inch Half Octagon Barrel, Fancy Walnut Stock, Extra Fine Checkering, Pistol Grip, Plain Front Sight, Combination Open and Peep Rear Sight, Case Hardened Cocking Lever, and Buttplate with a Trapdoor, with a Cleaning Rod Cavity in the stock. No visible serial number on the exterior surface, however, a three digit number is stamped inside the trapdoor of the buttplate. In my estimation, which is inline with a professional appraisal, this rifle is all original, with the possible exception that the hammer fly might or might not have been removed at the factory, enabling the rifle to come to a full-cock upon each cycle of the bolt, like that of the Model 1878 Experimental Rifle, rather than half-cock like that of the Model 1880. Condition in my opinion is NRA Antique Fine to Excellent considering that the hammer fly might have been removed at the factory. The action is strong and very smooth. The screw heads are mostly perfect with but a few showing evidence of the slightest use. In my estimation, the metal finish ranges in quality from a bright blue to a rich patina mix of varying shades, coupled with scattered light freckling mostly on the octagon part of the barrel with some on the hammer. The hammer retains most of its case colors. The trapdoor of the buttplate automatically snaps shut upon attempting to close it manually. The wood finish also shows the lightest of scattered handling marks. There is a very thin crack in the wood that starts at the rear of the upper tang and curls about 5/8ths of an inch to the edge of the checkering as pictured. The crack is possibly due to the over tightening of the tang screw, and it gives every appearance of being superficial and insignificant when it comes to the extra solid wood to metal fit and function of the rifle. Bore: Excellent. All in all, this is a very rare and well cared for special order rifle according to its features and the information contained in reference material including Remington catalogs."
