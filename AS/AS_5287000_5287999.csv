In other words, I will require a CCW(gun permit) to even purchase from me. This laser is one of the most powerful hand held laser you can buy! It was an impulse buy about six months ago and since it just has been taking up space in my safe. Honestly, I am too darn scared to play with the thing. It comes with many warnings with blinding you or someone else as the most dangerous. I put the batteries in three times and turned it on for a couple seconds each time and that's it. The third time was to take the picture you're seeing. It comes with changeable heads for different patterns which I do not know what they are, lol. Rechargeable batteries, charger and red safety glasses. This is how dangerous it is, when I put the batteries in this morning and turned it on, I knew it would burn whatever it was touching however I didn't realize how quick it would burn something. I placed a thick plastic case where the laser was going to touch and by the time I snapped he picture which was really fast it was melting the case! By the way, it is legal and can be purchased online right now for a heck of a lot more. It is in the highest classification of lasers and it shoots a beam miles away! These lasers are on lawmakers agenda to outlaw due to the idiots pointing them at aircraft and probable should be banded, heck, I won't even play with it. So, if you're a careful adult with a permit that wants one of the most powerful handheld legal laser pointers, reply to this e-mail and I will get back to you."

Hauck Single Shot Rifle which is a custom build on a Swiss made single shot folding lever action. Mr. Hauck was a master gunsmith and machinist who lived in the Arlington, VT area and built custom rifles starting in the 1940's. In the mid 1950's he patented a single shot action and produced a small number of rifles built on his action which are highly regarded by some collectors today. Information about Mr. Hauck and his rifles may be found on the internet. The rifle being offered for sale is not his patented action but appears to be a Swiss produced action and is different from a Martini action in that the lever hinge pin is forward of the triggers. The barrel is stamped "".219"". This is either a 219 Zipper or an improved Zipper or a 219 Donaldson Wasp. There is no serial number. The rifle exhibits excellent craftsmanship and wood to metal fit is excellent. The rifle has double set triggers, Neidner style checkered steel butt plate, and a scalloped grip cap. The overall condition of the bluing is excellent and the wood shows a few very light handling marks. The barrel is 26"" long, measures 1.085"" at breech then tapers down to 0.780"" at the muzzle. The screw heads are perfect showing absolutely no signs of ever having been turned. The rifle comes with a Fecker 12x scope and mounts. This scope is a high end scope from the 30's until the late 50's/early60's. The wood is a mid grade walnut in 90+% condition with a few light marks. Bluing on the gun itself is at 95% with some wear showing on the inside of the cocking lever and the bottom strap of the pistol grip. Blue on the scope is at 95% and it comes with the original screw in caps. CONDITIONS: Not for sale where prohibited by law. It is your responsibility to make sure you can legally own this where you reside. Will not sell/ship to NYC or surrounding counties. No sale or shipment to California. SHIPPING: I am not an FFL so I ship FFL to FFL only. A copy of an FFL is required and may be mailed with payment or emailed to me or my FFL. Shipping for this item is $75.00 which includes the cost of insurance. PAYMENT: USPS money order preferred but will gladly accept personal checks, non-USPS money orders, and bank checks. Payment by USPS money order will result in immediate shipment, other forms of payment will have to clear my account first. RETURNS: No return unless there is something wrong with the item that I did not see. No one is perfect and while I thoroughly check things out, it wouldn't be fair to arbitrarily hide behind a no return policy if there's something wrong that should have been noticed. QUESTIONS: Please email any questions you may have. *** ADDITIONAL PHOTOS LINK: https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipN9-y8MSUmM8lzpygVMz0WDWZbu4TXyCmoySGCr"

A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V-shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenges of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition.Armalite's great .50 has been refined, with smoother action, attractive new bolt stop, and even greater strength than the original AR-50.

Just recently got a call from the FFL and he had one last one with a lower parts kit installed and upgraded stock with QD sling point. I was told people are trying out different mag releases like the saiga mag release, cmmg mutant release, etc which is cheap. All that holds it is a roll pin. This is obviously a project but this is the only Rhino lower in Colorado. This is the final price drop.I spoke with a company that makes uppers that are compatable with the AK magazine and this lower. I will send you all that information if are interested in buying"
