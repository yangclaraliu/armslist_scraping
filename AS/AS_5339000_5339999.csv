The new SRT was designed by SIG SAUER® to deliver the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset 60% shorter than the standard DA/SA. This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertail grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite Stainless comes equipped with SIGLITE® Night Sights and the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long."

At 20x, you'll have the superior clarity needed to positively ID targets, and the generous range of windage and elevation adjustment gives you the accuracy and precision you demand at even the most extreme distances.The Leupold Index Matched Lens System delivers superior resolution from edge to edge of the visual field - even at 20x - along with peak image brightness and optimal contrast. Leupold engineers specify different coating materials for each lens surface in the riflescope, based on the lens' index of refraction, placement and function, layering each coating to eliminate reflections and maximize light transmission.Every feature was put in place for one purpose: to help you get the maximum advantage from your rifle, whether you're hunting or in competition. Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments.This Extended Range/tactical scope is an excellent choice for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association - men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more - rely on the accuracy and durability of these Leupold scopes.The Mil Dot reticle provides accuracy of range estimation for hunters and target shooters. With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to use. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots, and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target.With the reticle in the front focal plane of the ER/T, the reticle magnifies with the image so you can estimate range using Leupold's Mil Dot reticle at any magnification setting.Other features for the Leupold mark 4 ER/T M5 FFP Rifle Scope include: 30mm maintube; tall adjustment dials; 1Mil Elevation, and 1Mil Windage adjustments; 70-MOA of both windage and elevation adjustment. Side focus parallax adjustment for fast, easy parallax focusing from 50 yards to infinity, from any shooting position. Flip-open lens covers are standard issue with each Mark-4 ER/T riflescope."

Pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. Feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. Lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. Cross bolt style safety. Pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. Includes an under Picatinny rail and top Picatinny sight rail. Sling loops are built in and a basic sling is included. Soft rubber butt pad. Weighs 6.9 pounds with a 26.1 inch overall length. This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG."

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

There is one small hairline crack also on the left side where it meets the receiver. Has no affect at all on the function and you would miss it if you weren't looking to find it. The barrel was re blued at some time a long time ago and is marked with ""CYL"" which is faint. The mag tube is parkerized and the receiver appears original with nice patina. The forend is 3 screw and appears original to the gun. There are no military markings that I can find. This gun is capable of slam fire ( although I have never done that). These 97s were used in WWII by both the Army and Marine Corps. Hitler's troops were scared to death of anyone that carried one and had a bounty on the head of anyone that did.

 I purchased everything this past fall and the gun saw just three trips to the range. Everything is like new and I still have the packaging if needed.
 
 Specific items:
 
 STR Stock (mil-spec) - the included plastic bullet is pretty mangled, a screw driver is better for the install anyway MOE K2 Grip XTM Rail Covers - 2 sets, which would be eight total sections XTM hand stop MOE Trigger guard
 
 Possible inclusion (not in picture): Stealth Gray MS4 sling (quick detach model) like new also.
 
 Retail on everything is right around $150 ($210 with sling). I would like to ask $115 for the furniture or $150 for the furniture and sling.  Shipping/Insurance can be negotiated.
 
 Paypal or cash in person (NoVA).
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions. I'd prefer to sell as a set.
