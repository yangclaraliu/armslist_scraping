Quite possibly the most accurate factory rifle ever produced, and extremely rare & hard to find. This is an absolutely fantastic piece in matte stainless with a gorgeous laminate stock. I’ve been thinking about selling this one for a while- I’ve had it a long time so I’m OK with letting someone else have some fun with it so I can fund a new project. Sakos have the smoothest factory action you will ever feel. It has a .270” no-turn neck. 1 in 12 twist. 23.75” barrel. Round count is around 600. The bore is excellent & cleans very easily. It’s in pristine condition, except for a small ding on the lower rear portion of the stock. I did glass & pillar bed the action. 5 round detachable box magazine- most of these you’ll see (if you ever see one) are single shot, the repeaters like this one are even more rare. This will come with a set of 30mm Sako Optilock rings & bases. With this I have shot a 50 round grand aggregate (25@100, 25@200) in a benchrest match a couple times at 0.5 MOA. The trigger is set to a very crisp 18oz. I can provide load development notes so you can get right to work. I remember the day I saw this rifle for sale, my jaw dropped because I was looking at a unicorn! Buyer pays FFL transfer at RMGC. Asking $1750 cash only, in Grand Junction. I’ll throw in some fire formed brass with a full price offer. I have more photos upon request."

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel.

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m.The weapon comes custom engraved from Sig with the 160th SOAR logo engraved as pictured.
