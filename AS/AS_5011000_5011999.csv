I am selling my Sig Sauer Patrol Swat 556.  I am currently in the process of building three other rifles and I do not ever use this one.  It has less than 200 rounds cycled through.  If you are looking at this rifle, you know the Sig name and the quality surrounding it. I am looking for $1150/obo.  Brand new this rifle is $1400 but good luck finding it because it is rare and people hang on to them for their reliability and ""work no matter what"" functionality.  Please have a CCP or a pistol purchase permit to show me so i know i am not selling this to a wacko.  Thanks so much.

Email me or respond to the add. 

FYI= this rifle is CA compliant and doesn't have a flash hider. The stock is ""fixed"", but can be ""unfixed"" to be made fully functional.

The Tikka® T3 Lite Bolt-Action Rifle is an innovative, well designed, lightweight hunting rifle, that shoots accurately and functions flawlessly. The T3 Lite uses a 2-lug bolt with a 75° lift that cycles smooth as silk. The 75° bolt lift aids in keeping hand and gloves away from the scope and speeds the cycling process. The bolt disassembles quickly by hand into four major components; it has a recessed face, a plunger ejector, and a Sako extractor. A single stage adjustable trigger breaks crisp and clean, allowing hunters to make quick, accurate shots under field conditions. The coldhammer-forged stainless steel barrel, free floated to the synthetic stock, provides superb accuracy and maintains its point-of-aim in changing weather conditions. A single column polymer magazine feeds reliably, and facilitates in loading and unloading the rifle. The well-designed, ergonomic stock and sleek receiver make the T3 Lite easy to carry and quick handling. The Tikka T3 Lite Bolt-Action Rifle features integral rails on the top of the receiver that accept Optilock™ bases & rings, and is also drilled and tapped for Weaver-type bases."

This rifle started as a Remington 700, and now is a custom built F Class Precision rifle. It is built left handed so that a right handed shooter can manipulate the action without removing their dominant hand from the grip and trigger. This action was chambered, blueprinted, and threaded by Arnold Dew: Larry Vickers personal gunsmith with over 20 years experience. Ask anyone who the best gunsmith around is, and no fail his name will be given. I will attempt to list all the parts, but I know I will miss something: Douglas Barrels Air Gauged Chromoly 30in bull barrel. 1.5in at the receiver, 1.25 at the muzzle with AD Customs indexed Brake MDT Tac 21 Chassis with 20 MOA top rail XLR Industries Heavy Duty butt stock drilled for MonoPod 1911 style pistol grip (which accepts any custom 1911 scales) GG&G Extreme Duty Bipod Timney Calvin Elite .8-1.5lb trigger Burris PEPR scope mount Nikon Monarch 8-32x50ED M BDC 2 x Accuracy International 5 Round Mags This rifle shows very light wear as I have only put about 100rnds through the bore, and she has always been transported in a Pelican Case. From the beginning, I've easily had Sub 1/4 MOA at 100yds. Only time it's been outside that was because of shooter error. She has less recoil then an AR, and I have videos to prove it. I'm only selling her because I have too many hobbies going, and don't have the time to shoot it enough. I have well over $5000 invested in the rifle alone aside from the glass. I am not in a hurry to sell it. Thanks for your interest. Call or text with questions, or for more photos. 724-Seven6Six-6151"
