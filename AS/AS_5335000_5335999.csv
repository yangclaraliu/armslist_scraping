Carried a little bit. Has a small amount of normal wear. I disconnected the magazine safety so you can fire the chambered round without the magazine. Spring is included if you want to reconnect it. I, personally, think it is pointless.I've experienced only a few failures when breaking the gun in, but no issues now - even with Tula ammo. For some reason some Bersas do not like it when the grips are too loose on the gun. This is a more recent model, so there should be no issues with the internal spring breaking like on earlier models.This gun conceals well and shoots well. I'm just consolidating all my handgun calibers to 9mm right now, so I'm selling my other guns.Comes with 2 mags, one is an 8 round mag. Comes with a holster as well."

Taurus makes some cheap pistols and rifles, however, this is NOT one of them. With the pressures each round creates, it can't be.  It is built like a tank and my Ruger Blackhawk 44 Mag kicks just as hard, but different.  The Raging Bull kicks more back instead of up becasue of the vents, which makes for a clean and easy follow up.Asking $740 cash.Also, have 150 premium hunting rounds that could go with it for a little more.  Look up videos on you tube about the 454....it is one BAD round."

This barrel coupled with the Choate Ultimate Sniper stock make for a heavy rifle with little recoil.  From there I added the Harris bipod, Timney adjustable trigger (1 1/2-4lbs) w/safety, Leoupold VX-2 6-18x40mm adjustable objective LRV Duplex Recticle Scope, Leoupold rings, and Leoupold scope covers.  This rifle shoots extremly well!  Included with the sale is the factory stock, stock x-mark trigger, different size stock pad for adjustable link of pull, different size cheek rest, hard palno case, additional bipod with stock barrel, and 3 boxes of rounds.  I also have the empty shell casings from all the rounds that have gone through this gun (less than 50 rounds!).  Honestly I built this gun for fun since i have expereince with long range weapons in the military, but just don't have the time nor the land to go out and shoot this bad boy.  I'm not in a position where I absolutly have to sell this gun so please no low ball responses.   As noted I would consider trade for nice 1911.
