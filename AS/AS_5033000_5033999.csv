I am firm on the price, shop around this is cheaper than anyone is selling them for.  No shipping....don't ask.Here is the description from Arsenal.The SAM7K-03 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K-03 is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K-03 pistol is ideal for sport shooting, self-defense, and for pistol hunting. The SAM7K-03 adds a new chapter to the best pistol of its kind in the world. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7K-03 pistol receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receivers are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each SAM7K-03 forged pistol receiver starts out as a blank and requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is very complex and time-intensive, but with our meticulous attention to detail, we deliver a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability. Summary: SAM7K-03 - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, Sig Sauer pistol stabilizing brace, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. FEATURES Sig Sauer’s SB15 pistol stabilizing brace 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier and double-hook trigger Cold hammer-forged barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber Side rail for scope mount (does not fit KV- 04SP, KV-04, or SM-13) Peep rear sight Ambidextrous safety lever Accepts any mil-spec magazine with 5, 10, 30, and 40-round capacity The Sig Sauer’s SB15 pistol stabilizing brace is a veteran-designed aid that is made to improve the single-handed shooting performance of a pistol. By using the operator’s forearm, it provides a stable support to reduce felt recoil and minimize accuracy-robbing spin and shift. The stabilizing brace sits on the receiver extension, and the flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the brace to be custom fit to any user. The receiver extension has a water proof storage compartment with a sealing threaded cap. It is accessible when the brace is removed or pushed all the way forward."

It has a small stain in the blueing on the right side of the receiver, (not rust or pitting) It has been there since the day I got it and never got any worse it is just there. The only marks you will find is where the scope mounts were, no big deal just impressions where the mount was. Filled the factory tapped holes with the original screws. I cannot find any other flaws on this gun. The marks you see around the breakdown bolt are grease, I keep them coated with Du lite when not in use. I do have another 39A listed here on Armslist also.

Built in 1956. This gun is absulutely beautiful. I did have it re-blued a few years ago from ahlmonds and they did a fantastic job, it wasn't bad at all, no rust or pitting but just wanted this gun to be perfect so I had it re-blued. If I would not have said anything you probably would not have known it.  I just had this one out to the range this fall and it is a tack driver. The only marks you will find is where the scope mounts were, no big deal just impressions where the mount was. Filled the factory tapped holes with the original screws. When I had it out this fall it jammed 4 times when ejecting a shell out of 100 rds. When I looked it up on the net it referred to it as the Marlin Jam, and tells what it needs to fix it. They refer to it as a factory flaw that was never corrected.when ejecting a shell, Or maybe the ammo I was useing, never had a Marlin do this before. I cannot find a flaw on this gun. The marks you see around the breakdown bolt are grease, I keep them coated with Du lite when not in use. I do have other 39A Goldens listed here on Armslist also. To obtain these years ago I had to pay a premium price for them which reflects what I am asking for them today. Please no keyboard cowboys, Price is firm, I do not entertain offers over the internet. Must be a Mn. Resident and I will need a copy of your drivers license. (you can black out the numbers if you like) I just need it tho show who bought this gun. $700. Cash only.

I've only shot about 50 rounds through it and I've cleaned it up to look like new. Comes with the stock holdster, gun case, etc. The reason I'm selling it is because I've also got a Bond Arms Mini and I'm just scaling back. This gun is not to be confused with the Ranger, which does not have the removable trigger guard. Also to note, this is the latest version of the Ranger 2, which has a machined out trigger and a fatter/grippier hammer.
