However, for those that like to do thier buisness on a single page...Included in this sale/trade: 1x Remington 2020 Digital Optic System (DOS) factory mounted and zeroed on a Remington 700 SPS Tactical AAC-SD                                        1x waterproof/Dustproof/Shockproof SKB i-Series Hard Case with Factory Molded custom cut foam inserts.                                        1x Bipod 1x Bore Snake 3x Snap Caps. 4x Batteries 1x Charging cradle w/cable.                                        Also gun lock, Remington 700 manual, and 2020 PDF print-out manual.The Remington 2020 is an all-in-one ballistic calcualtor. The system has a built in Laser Range Finder, Thermometer, Barometric Pressure Sensor, Inclinometer, Cantor Sensor, Compass, Video Camera and Microphone w/2Hour Hard Drive, Target Speed Calculator, and Wi/Fi Server with Password Protection. I have the code. All this is tied into a state-fo-the-art Ballistics Computer built as a partnership between Remington and TrackingPoint. The Laser Range Finder works out to 750yrds. The Ballistic Computer works out to 500yrds. The scope has a Heads Up Display(HUD) with all this information displayed. Pressing the Tag button with mark the calculated/desired point-of-impact. The crosshairs will then move from this Tag to where your current point of impact is with an arrow guiding back on target if the Tag is out of screen. Once on target, the crosshairs will go from blue to red. Just exersice the proper trigger control, and the round will end up on target. The system can even track a moving target without loosing its Tag. The only thing you have to input is wind speed with an easy Left-Right button on the scope. So, just point, tag, shoot, hit, and repeat. The Remington 2020 retails for $5,575. Now, this would also include 300rds of ammo, which I do not have. Sold it already. So there will be a substancial discount. $5,575 Retail Price.-$1,000 Used gun discount.-$  600  No ammo discount.-$  400 ""Charging for the namebrand"" discount.------------------------------------------------------ $3,575 Sales Price.As I stated before, medical bills. So, I want as much cash for this deal as possible. I am willing to entertain certain gun trades as long as there is cash involved. Multiple gun trade is acceptable too, but they will have to be some cash involved, or have a collective value equal to mine and be something that I can either sell later, or can't live without. I like speciaty items, precision firearms, and rare or hard to get firearms. I could trade outright if your trade is around the same price range, but it would have to be something I can't live without. I will respond as proptly as possible to all offers. I am willing to travel a good ways for a good deal. I will not cross state lines, obviously. If I accept your offer, I will provide you with more information as to where I am and how we can meet. I may be willing to ship for the right offer. Price is negotioable, but not by too much; see discouts please. No low-balling, obviously. Thanks."

Also included is a brand new, Trijicon RMR 9.0 MOA green dot sight. This one does not use batteries, but a combination of fiber optics and tritium for day and night sighting in all lighting conditions. I have mounted this sight and will bore sight in in on request, but it has not been used and is factory new other than being mounted. It cowitnesses with the stock, suppressor height three dot sights. This would make an excellent range, carry and home defense pistol, especially for someone with fading eyesight, and Comp-.Tac makes an excellent concealed carry holster for it (among other makers). I also checked with Garrett Industries, and they can also make a Silent Thunder holster to accommodate it with the RMR for concealed carry. The trigger on this pistol is light, smooth and crisp! I ran the gun through its paces in one range session with another optic, firing 200 rounds of various target and self defense ammunition without a single malfunction of any kind. I then cleaned it and put it away.  I am asking $1100 or the best, REASONABLE offer. I am not looking for trades at the moment, as money is tight and I am going to be putting a few more guns up for sale in the next day or two. Terms: All laws to be followed. Three day waiting period and FOID check required. FTF sale only in the SW or W suburbs of Cook County (LaGrange, Countryside, Lyons, Brookfield, Bridgeview, etc.). Thanks."

The Scharfschützengewehr 82 (SSG 82) or ""Sharpshooter's Rifle, 82"" is a rifle chambered in the 5.45x39 built in East Germany at the end of the Cold War for use by East German special police units.
Very little was known about this weapon and very few examples have been imported into the west, with importer Centuary Arms having imported around 600 at the turn of the century. There has been much speculation as to why this rifle was built and which company built it.
The SSG 82 actually has been specifically designed for use in the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) to stop the import of police sniper rifles from non-socialist countries and military sniper rifles from socialist countries"

Some people have said that the 935 is designed to only cycle 3"" to 3'1/2"" shells but I have only shot 2-3/4"" standard loads 8 shot through this and have never had one single cycling issue!
Anyone looking to make this into a full-on race gun will need to put in the extended lifter as this thing does thumb-bite if you're in too big of a hurry.
 
I literally hate selling this one but times are tough. Runs like a sewing machine and one of the softest shooting 12ga I've ever fired. Great condition, a few minor scuffs. 
I have the stock mag spring end-cap too.

462,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5190462,"For Sale:  BCM 16"" LW Mid-Length Upper","Middlesex County, Connecticut, United States",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, February 28, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Selling a barely-used BCM Mid-length upper sporting a 16"" lightweight profile barrel with A2 sight tower and AAC Blackout FH. I've put less than 300 rounds through this upper, but am selling it now to help pay for a custom hi power project.  As you can see from the photos, it has very little wear on it, which makes sense given the fact I took it to the range twice. It has never been run hard, and I used it so infrequently that it was cleaned after each outing. I'm selling the upper as pictured, basically stripped except for the included handguard and a BCM Gunfighter mod 3 medium latch charging handle. To make this a fully assembled ready-to-go upper, I would be willing to include a complete BCM FA BCG with it, as well as a black magpul rear BUIS, in which case I would raise the asking price to $525.00.  I am willing to sell the upper with any combination of these components, so just ask me about a different configuation and we can probably work something out price-wise. To that end, I'm willing to negotiate a little, but be aware that I'm in no hurry to sell this upper, and therefore am not willing to just ""give it away"". Given the almost-new condition, the BCM charging handle, and the awesome AAC muzzle device (which works really well) I think 400 is reasonable.If interested, an in-person cash deal is highly preferable. Though I've never had issues with paypal transactions via Armslist, I'd rather not ship a large item like this even though it's a ""non-firearm"".  Also, I feel that a legitimate buyer might want to actually inspect the upper themselves in person. Thank you."

A fully multicoated optical path and phase-correction prism coating allow the StabilEyes VR binocular to transmit a bright image that is color faithful and rich with contrast. Nikon''s Vibration Reduction (VR) system stabilizes the image by adjusting the binocular''s prisms inside a gimbaled housing?allowing up to 5� of motion compensation on each axis. The image stabilized view improves image sharpness and can minimize eye fatigue commonly experienced during long-during observations. This configuration from Nikon''s StabilEyes binocular series has two stabilization modes; On Board mode is optimized for viewing from an unstable viewing platform such as a moving vehicle. A 13mm eye relief and Turn-and-Slide eyecups with multiple click-stop positions can provide a comfortable viewing distance for almost any viewer. The 14x magnification and 16 ft minimum focus distance equip the 14x40 StabilEyes VR for intermediate to long-range viewing tasks. In addition to the image quality rendered by fully multicoated optics and VR system, the StabilEyes VR binocular features a nitrogen-filled housing that provides fogproof and waterproof performance."
