From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.   The WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for any shooter.

DAVIDSON'S Online Registration    For the discerning shooter who appreciates Italian design and craftsmanship. The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.   The WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for any shooter.

It can be used as a standalone launcher, or can be mounted underbarrel on virtually any platform with the right adapter. I bought this a few years ago and have only fired it 3 or 4  times. I love it but I don't have anywhere to shoot it so it just sits in my safe. It's in exceptional condition, very clean with almost no signs of wear. I'm not looking to make a profit here, just want it to be enjoyed by someone who can use it and get a few dollars to put towards another toy. $249.00 takes it and $10 ships it anywhere within the United States (CONUS) within 24 hours of receiving funds. PayPal preferred and I will ship it either USPS 2-3 Day Priority Mail or UPS 2-3 Day.   I also have 6 brand new .37mm .45ACP High Performance Screw Apart Shells from ReloadableShells.com. As far as I know, there are none better, these are as good as it gets when it comes to reloading. I'll include as many as you want for $20 each. A little cheaper than they sell for but the shipping is free so all in all a pretty good deal. These may sell by themselves and may go quickly."

Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.

They are both Brand New in their respective boxes with all items/paperwork as originally included, only factory fired. I ordered and bought two of these, one for my niece and one for my nephew and needless to say my sister and brother-in-law were less than impressed which is why they're for sale.   I will only sell face-to-face and require a bill of sale to be signed. I prefer a buyer who has a Wisconsin cc permit however allowing me to see your drivers license and sign a bill of sale will be acceptable. I'm asking $425 each, obviously no taxes or background check fees are required so this is a very good deal. The pictures shown in this listing are not the actual pistols, I took these pictures from the Internet because I'm posting this while I'm at work. If you want and or need any other pictures please ask, I will take them when I'm back at home.  Obviously the two pistols I'm selling are identical to the ones shown in this listing! The ONLY trades I will consider are either Colt ""modern"" double action revolver's, Ruger No. 1 rifles and or Kimber or other ""higher-end"" 1911 pistols.  Be sure to include your name and phone number when inquiring, if you don't I will NOT reply. If this ad/listing is still posted at least one of the pistols is still for sale, I will remove the ad/listing when both pistols are sold and I have money in hand.  Thanks for looking!"

SOCOM had a specific requirement for a free float M203 solution and Daniel Defense responded, designing a revolutionary product to meet the government’s need. The Daniel Defense RIS II allows the individual operator to free float the M203 grenade launcher without additional parts. As importantly, special tools are not required to mount the M203 grenade launcher. This was accomplished by integrating all of the needed parts to free float the M203 into the rail itself.The Daniel Defense RIS II M4A1 FSP feature a cut out in the top rail to accomdate a standard front sight base on a carbine length gas system.The Daniel Defense RIS II free-floating Picatinny rail systems are designed to allow individual operator to quickly, and without special tools, mount M203 Grenade Launcher and precisely mount SOPMOD accessories to host weapon without effecting point of impact.
