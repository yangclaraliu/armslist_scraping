Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 Nato Bullpup ever developed. Upon firing, the patented, dual-extractor system pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also one of the safest Bullpup ever developed becasue the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62mm Nato caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included. Barrels on current models are 18"" long; a longer barrel length of 24"" available as the hunter variant. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with their A2-style flash hider. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel assembly. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from optics and sight systems available on the market. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with Nato style bayonets including their own Folding Bayonet, and many more.SpecificationsCalibers  Carbine  Weight Unloaded (No Magazine)  8.1 lbs  Length   26""  Barrel Length   18""  Magazine   10 or 20 FAL  Practical Range  600m"
