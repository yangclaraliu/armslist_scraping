$350 cash firm to buy it out right, Or four hundred in trade value, As a lot of guys think that there trades are worth more then they are. ( NO ) Bows, Crossbows, or Black Powder,,,,,,,, As I am mainly into ( Pistols, Revolvers, And military style Semi-auto Rifles ),,,,,,,, Also no Bryco, Jennings, or Hi-point pistols, I may consider a Hi-point 45acp Carbine Rifle with a little bit of cash added in unless it has a lot of extras with it.
 
So just let me know what you have and we can go from there. The worst I can say is ""No Thank You"" if it is something that i do not like or want, I am not in a hurry to get rid of it, And just seeing what is out there. Also you must be willing to come to my location, As I have been burned a few times waiting on people to show up at place and time that I let them choose and they endded up not showing up."

Many Smith & Wesson and other enthusiasts say this model is the all around best made, most reliable 9mm, all metal semi-auto that S&W ever made. This one is the very desirable first year issue (1997). The alloy frame and slide are in great shape and the serrations on the front strap and trigger guard are a nice touch and make it easily holstered and drawn. This comes with three (3) original magazines (hard to find). 1 flush and 2 with finger extensions. Also Hogue grips pictured and originals. I got this from the original buyer and the mags don't even show signs of being used, perfect condition. Case is perfect and no scuffs etc. adds to the original look and appeal. This gun has always been a stored item. Great for concealed carry. Please note this gun is worth about $600. If you offer a deal that is less than close to that amount, you are not being realistic. I will not ship and only face to face meet, need Ohio ID for my protection. If you know these, you know they are getting hard to find and in this condition especially. Specifications: Action: DA/SA Length: 6.75"" Barrel Length: 3.5"" Height: 5.0"" Weight: 24.8 oz.

My father returned from WW II with this sweet, old pistol. He probably picked it up from someone in the French military. After WW I, France asked manufacturers in Spain to create a carry gun for its military. Dozens of Spanish factories built guns of this design.

For the complete story on these guns, see:
http://www.reenactor.net/units/151ri/weps/ruby_pistol.htm

This gun was made by La Industria Orbea, Eibar, Spain. That's what the fading etching on the side of the slide indicates (above the ""CAL 7.65"" marking). Beneath the right end of the slide is a stamped ""IO"" inside an oval. That indicates the gun was made by Industrie Orbea. The same logo appears on the bottom of the clip, which shows it is original.

At the base of the handle are stamped two stars, ""**."" This indicates the gun was used by the French military.

At the back of the slide is an engraved ""TC"" that looks like the logo on the caps of the Minnesota Twins. I have diminished its appearance with a dose from a Gun Blue Pen from Birchwood Casey.

The gun comes with an authentic military type holster with the flap over the gun and a pocket for the clip. I am also including the hard plastic case in which it is set for the photo. For a local sale, I will include about 1 1/2 boxes of .32 Auto ammo.

I also have for sale a brown leather holster my father usually kept the gun in. It's vintage, from Brauer Bros. in St. Louis. Those go for about $40 on eBay.

I just took the one photo because I wanted to get this uploaded as soon as possible. I will take more if someone requests them.

Asking price is for local pick up. If I have to ship it to your FFL holder, the cost should be an additional around $45. That's what it cost when I shipped a pistol last month."
