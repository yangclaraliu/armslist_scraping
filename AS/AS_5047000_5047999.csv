It is a German metal frame. After I purchased it from its original owner, I immediately sent it to the Sig Custom Pro Shop and had the stainless slide bead blasted to a perfect and like new finish. I then had all internal springs inspected and replaced as neccessary,then converted to a DA/SA action, added a De-cocker safety lever, upgraded the standard trigger to a SRT trigger function, put brand new OEM Sig Rosewood grips with stainless screws, Siglite night sights, and also not to mention equipped with a brand new Lasermax Guide Rod Red laser kit, which is the only NATO approved guide rod laser out there. It has NOT been fired since it came back from the Sig factory, and prior to that, still maintains a low round count. I am the second and probably the best owner so far. This Sig is just an awesome gun, not only with its high accuracy and smooth as silk shooting capabilities, but it is also a real gem to look at. I have over $1200.00 in this Sig.

I'm told those are repairable. If you know old Rugers, you know how hard it would be to find another....the ivory handled pistols were only produced in tiny numbers. They are the rarest of the early Blackhawks. This has never been touched and was never converted to the rolling bar mechanism. I'm mainly interested in selling, but would accept a partial trade or two.....a G43, AK, AR, Shotgun or something else interesting. Feel free to ask any questions you may have. Of course, all applicable laws must be complied with."

She is around 12 weeks old. Has all vet paper work and worming. I bought her, and just plain do not have time for her. She has spent most of her time in a cage for the past 2 weeks and it upsets me. It is do to my life style. Yes I made a mistake. I will not let her go to a bad home, puppy mill or anywhere I feel is worst than she has it now. We give he all our attention when we are with her, and unfortunately, we have had very little time to spend with her. We love her and that's why we are trying to find her a new loving home. I have all the paperwork, except for the AKC Breeding rights paperwork. I am taking a loss, but I would like to recover some of my expense, and there will be a $1000 re-homing fee, or $1400 in trade. If you would like the breeding rights it will cost you an extra $500 and should be able to get the same day or following. The lady I bought her from lives on the south side of South Bend and has them in her possession, and that's who you will pay the $500. I have no plans on breeding her so I did not pay for them. Our dog loves to play and is close to being house broken. I don't need help re-homing her, and yes it sounds to good to be true. This is a bit tough on me so please don't waste my time. This is not a scam, if you don't have the money, or trade listed, please don't waste my time I can be reached at 574-606-6969 call or text. I have a few more pictures if you would like to see. Thanks and have a good day$1400 in Trades- Newer CRF 80, or Kawasaki 110, high end firearms, or $500 and a high end fire arm. No junk, and if I get a bad feeling about you or your household, I will not re-home her with you."

The weapon was engineered in the United States by an independent firm called ""Crossfire LLC"", about which I know nothing, and by SACO Defense out of Saco, Maine, than part of the General Dynamics Weapon Systems and now in all intents and purposes known as SABRE DEFENCE. The weapon was built in 7074-T6 aluminium (much like the US M-16 assault rifle), and sported polymer parts. Feeding was via STANAG magazines (for 5'56mm/.223R, with M16-style controls and mag release) and via a large feeding port on the left side, for the 12-gauge shells; on the left side there also was a selector to switch from 12-gauge to 5'56N/.223R (hence why it was called a ""Select-fire weapon""; not 'cause it was full-automatic in nature, but because the shooter could carry it with both calibers chambered and choose which one to use according to the situation)."

It has been used hard in the field so the paint is heavily worn and some has flaked, but I've always stripped and cleaned the gun frequently throughout season. Duracote or Cerakoted and it would be like brand new. Bore is clean and shiny, as it's had a bore snake ran through it after most hunts. The gun has been well maintained. I also replaced the original recoil spring and magazine tube spring with Wolff Performance Springs. The gun runs flawlessly. I have the owner's manual, 4 chokes, choke wrench and benelli case. I also put a Sims Limbsaver recoil pad on it. This is about half the price of a new SBE."
