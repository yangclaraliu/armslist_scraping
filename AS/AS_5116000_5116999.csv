It is in overall good condition with a great bore. The import-mandated safety fell off long before I got this pistol (those safeties were not original to the pistol, so they were very frail), so there are a couple of holes where that was attached. The left grip is a bit loose with a crack that is still very solid. The finish is good, with a little wear around the edges. There are a couple light scratches as well. I have only fired it once since I got it a year or so ago. It has been very well maintained by me. It's a very nice, solid gun. These haven't been imported since 1994, so they are a bit harder to find than Romanian or Yugo Tokarevs. I have a C&R so I can ship. You can text me at 256-four31-four25seven.

I've had this rifle about a year and it hasn't left the safe. I had hopes of putting a suppressor on it for hog hunting. Didn't happen. I have a few other projects I need to get finished. The previous owner said it had +/- 1000 rounds through it. He sent it to a gunsmith, had the barrel shortened to 14.5"", welded a pws brake on it, blasted, re-parkerized, and re-painted it. He said he had the bolt polished because he used brake cleaner on it and the paint came off. The numbers do match the rifle, so it is Arsenal. It has the Tapco G2 trigger and Tapco pin plate. It has not been fired since the work was done. Doesn't even have the safety lever mark on it. The only thing missing is the front sight drum, or holder. I had it at one time, not sure where it is? I do have the front sight tip. Included with it are 6 Tapco mags and a metal one of unknown origin. Has 2 Arsenal pistol grips, an extra recoil spring and guide, a top cover of unknown origin, and a Kvar Warsaw length buttstock. May entertain trades, but looking for a PWS complete upper in 7.62x39. Price is OBO. I live in Santa Fe, near Galveston. Will travel within a reasonable distance.  I can send more pics, upon request. Thanks for looking. Any questions let me know."

The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.Price is firm.Not interested in Trades!

See link below for manufacturers website with instructions to change over if you have a Commercial buffer tube.Comparable to the Magpul CTR collapsable stock but with more features.The Rogers Super-Stoc™ (commonly called the Super Stock) is the ultimate refinement in AR/M4 stock technology. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. Our stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle."

The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free."

They are made in the same factory, but Saigas have a certain number of parts in their unmodified “Sporting” configuration. They are considered imported because they have more than 10 imported parts in them. As such they are held to 922(r) compliance.You can convert it to a pistol grip (unsporting) configuration, but you have to take out some Russian parts and replace them with American made parts. If you want to use high capacity magazines, convert the weapon to pistol grip configuration or use a flash hider, it will then be considered unsporting. You will need to swap out parts so that you have no more than 10 imported parts in it. It will then be considered a US made firearm and 922(r) does not apply.This is an unmolested, untouched, unconverted Saiga with all Russian parts that is ready to be converted. Manufactured by Izhmash (now Kalashnikov). Less than 100 rounds since new. I always planned to convert it, but never got around to it. I'm looking to get in to something new.
