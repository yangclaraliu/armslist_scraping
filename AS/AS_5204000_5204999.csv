This is a beautiful AK-74. She is all Bulgarian except the receiver (new, US made), barrel (new, US made), trigger (Tapco G2 trigger group), and magazine (Tapco polymer 30 round mag). That's 8 US parts, so it is fully 922r compliant.  The metal has been recently completely re-parkerized and the furniture has been refinished in a nice Bulgarian Burnt Sienna (remember that color from the giant Crayola boxes back in the day?) Finished her off with a very nice mil-surp bakelite grip. This rifle is extremely smooth and shoots awesome! It definitely shoots as good as it looks. Comes with the mag and a box of 5.45x39 rounds.  I am in Twin Falls and asking $750. I do get over to Boise to the West and Idaho Falls to the East quite a bit, so I'm not opposed to a road trip for a serious buyer.

Xtended Twilight Lens System

Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens SystemÃ¢ï¿½Â¢. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens SystemÃ�Â®, using LeupoldÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½sÃ�Â® index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you wonÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.

DiamondCoat 2

Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2Ã¢ï¿½Â¢, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance weÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.

2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing

While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ technology pioneered by LeupoldÃ�Â® Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton weÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

Generous Eyebox
The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high power, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight pictue that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.

Blackened Lens Edges
Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical perrformance.
Twin Bias Spring Erector System
Super Fast-Focus Eyepiece
3:1 Zoom Ratio

Dual Use
Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All LeupoldÃ�Â® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4Ã�Â® Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes. See overview of each product for more detailed information on hunting, shooting, and competition applications.

It will come with twp p-mags.I have ammo as well, just not sure how many rounds currently. Let me know if you're interested in that and I'll take a look. This rifle has been fired less than 100 times, maybe three mags worth. My husband and I are moving to a state that doesn't allow them, so it must go. I'm asking quite a bit less than what this rifle and its parts are worth. Email if interested. Cash only please.

For those familiar with Sig's 556 line, the MCX is much like an evolution to that line. The 556 requires a proprietary lower (and the upper is serialized instead of the lower) but it is a short stroke piston system. The advantage to the MCX is that it will run on a regular AR-15 lower. The MCX has an ambidextrous safety, mag release, and charging handle. The MCX is designed to allow quick caliber changes between 5.56mm, .300 Blackout, and 7.62x39 (requires a different bolt as well). The MCX has a short stroke auto regulating gas operating system, modular rail system, and uses a standard AR magazine. It also has a nickel boron bolt and bolt carrier.

Here's what this package includes:~.223 Wylde Barrel/upper~Mag Tactical Magnesium Lower~Fab Defense 7"" Quad Rail~Rail Covers + 3 different sets~Magpul CTR Buttstock~Magpul MOE Pistol Grip~Magpul PTS Angled Foregrip(Works amazingly well for a chinese knockoff)~Magpul Rear Flipup Sight~3 Magpul Gen 3 Pmags~60 Rounds of Ammunition~And depending on the offer, my Eotech 512 a65(Honestly, I'd rather keep it, though because I love it)Approximate trade value: $1,100, will accept $900 cash for the rifle. $1,200 with the sight.... Maybe. lolNow, a little about this rifle. I've shot approximately 400 rounds through this bad boy without a hiccup. The thing shoots like a dream, especially with the Eotech. Also, the fact that it's so incredibly lightweight due to the magnesium lower is also a huge plus. You can literally hold the rifle with one arm and shoot it if need be, but with nearly no kick whatsoever. If you've ever owned or held an AR-15 you'll be impressed by the weight of this rifle. I actually had people from my local gun shop trying to buy my lower when I got it in and assembled it. Now regarding the .223 Wylde barrel, if you do some research you'll come to realize that it's definitely a good thing to have. AR-15's were already an accurate platform, this barrel makes them even more accurate and will take any loading you shoot through it."

It has a U.S. Optics Scope mounted with Badger Ordinance rings. This whole set up has been a safe queen with less than 80 rounds fired through it. It will come with bipod pictured, 6 magazines (four are brand new) and a box of 300 plus rounds of Lake City 7.62x51 NATO Ammo. Specific details are listed below.RifleI purchased this Colt Modular Carbine new, during one of the first production runs. It’s serial number places it as one of the first 2000 made – if that matters to anyone. It is chambered in 7.62x51 and can be converted to fire 5.56 by removing the upper, installing a mag-well adapter block, and placing a complete 5.56 upper on the rifle. I have taken it to the range 4 times since I have owned it and cleaned it after every session. It has less than 80 rounds fired through it. It was transported in a case by itself to and from the range and stored in a safe the rest of its life. It is very clean. I do not have the adapter block for converting it to 5.56 (it was not available during the first production) and this sale does not include a 5.56 upper. The rifle does come with 6 magazines 4 of which are new in the package. It also comes with the bipod pictured. The bipod has been modified to allow smooth later movement while keeping the legs planted. OpticMounted on the rifle is a U.S. Optics Scope Model MR-10mil 1.8-10xT. I believe this is one of the best optics you can buy. It has a lifetime guarantee from the manufacturer regardless of owner shipand comes with a warranty against any damage that makes it inoperable. You send it to them and they will fix or replace and send it back to you. The Optic comes with U.S. Optic lens covers and Badger Ordinance Rings. Badger Ordinance rings are a great quality and very stout product. The optic has been cared for the same as rifle, it is very clean and in excellent condition.

Over the years, it has gone through several modifications, each time becoming more efficient and reliable. This version has the improved tri-grip texturing on the handle and thumb slide for more positive purchase. The Ultratech's spring remains in an ""at rest"" position at all times except when deployed. This ensures that the compressed spring will not become fatigued, assuring users that when the knife is fired, it will operate effectively. Ultratech can take many different forms; it can be topped with a standard machined aluminum top or a piece of carbon fiber. The Ultratech's light weight, one handed open and close action, slim shape, and scalpel sharp blade make it a one of a kind knife, only available through Microtech. This knife has proven time and again that it can withstand any obstacle.
