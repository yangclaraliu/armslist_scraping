Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability. The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block. Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes."

It has never failed to function regardless of what I have fed it over the time I've had it. It's not a safe queen but it is in great condition. It has all of the original papers and such as it should. It has 3 factory magazines one with the finger extension. I can provide more pictures if needed. But only to those who are serious about the gun. All local laws apply, you must be able to leagally purchase a handgun in Ohio. Ccw permit holders go to the top of the list. Thanks for looking."

All offers are welcomed and will be reviewed. Blake-REDACTEDI purchased this PK380 for my mother as a surprise because she said she wanted the Walther PK that shoots a 380ACP. So being the son I am without doing any research, I got to the local gun shot and bought the Walther PK380. When I gave it to her as a present I shorty found out she was referring to the Walther PPK. I put it in my gun safe for a couple months before deciding to take it to the range on my off day and that's when my respect for this firearm blew my mind. Talk about accurate and ease of shooting with MINIMAL recoil! This gun truly imressed me but I still couldn't get my mother the like it because it's not the same as the movies. When it was purchased from Gainder Mountain, the 3 year warranty was purchased as well but I've yet to have a single malfunction even with cheap ammo. i have never had any feeding issues, jams, misfires or any issues what so ever. Out of the box it came with, one magazine, a plastic tool to help field strip (not really needed but, it does make like easier. Lock for your gun, all the owners Manuals, cleaning tool, and of course the case. To field still the gun is surprisingly easy and even though you can read how to take it apart in the books provided, it's pretty self explanatory. The next owner of this firearm will appreciate  how meticulous  and OCD when it comes to care and cleanliness.  I wil NEVER shoot not even (1) round throug the firearm and not clean the entire gun. I am more of a gun collector because I work 6 Days a week from 7:30am until at earliest 9:00 pm. My schedule doesn't allow for me to go to the range as much as I'd like to. For peace of mind, I am the only person who handles, shoots, and cleans my fires arms. They are all kept away securely in my gun safe. Unfortunately I need to sell if not all, most of my guns to move my family to Florida. My grandfather who raised us was diagnosed with throat cancer so we will be able to spend as much time as we possibly can with him."

This is a Model 547 9mm Military & Police. What makes this revolver different from all other Smith & Wesson revolvers are the special mechanical features incorporated to enable it to fire standard 9mm Parabellum ammunition without the need for auxiliary ""moon clips"". This is accomplished by means of a special extractor which grips the rimless cartridge cases, and a special pin in the breech face located above the floating firing pin which moves forward with the hammer to position the cartridge fully forward in the chamber at the moment of primer strike. This revolver is built on a round butt K-frame with three screws. It wears a 3-inch heavy barrel with non-shrouded ejector rod. Designated a ""Military & Police"" revolver, it features fixed service sights. Overall condition is excellent and completely original. The bright blue factory finish rates about 98% overall with a cylinder turn line..........NO TRADES PLEASECONTACT ME @      redenn56@outlook.com"

I have also been using Armslist since there was an Armslist. I am an active duty US Army Military Policeman currently on special duty assignment in Southern California. I came from the 4th Infantry Division in Fort Carson Colorado where I served for over five years including two 12-month tours overseas to both Iraq and Afghanistan. I was a gunner, assistant gunner, team leader, squad leader, unit armorer and squad designated marksman. While in garrison I competed in many soldier boards winning a Division/Post Quarter board, as well as Runner-up Soldier of the Year (FY 2010), I also competed in a post-wide marksmanship competition placing third behind two SF soldiers from 10th Group. I attended many schools such as First Responder/Combat Life Savers Course, Modern Army Combatives Course, Short Range Marksmanship (CQM/CQB) Course, Long Range Marksmanship (LRM/SDM) Course, and I attended the US Army Sniper School MTT in 2010.I have been an Army recruiter at the Lakewood Army Career Center, Long Beach Recruiting Company, Los Angeles Recruiting Battalion for over 2 & 1/2 years. While on recruiting I have maintained a 4.0 GPA while pursuing my Bachelors in Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement Administration from Colorado State University Global Campus; I have nine classes left to graduate. I have completed the 18.6 mile Norwegian Foot March Insignia ruck march, and earned the Gold award (highest) of the German Armed Forces Military Proficiency Badge and Schützenschnur.
