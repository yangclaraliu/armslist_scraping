I paid a little more for what it is currently going for on their website but I am willing to match the price. I am looking for a new Daniels Defense so would be willing to trade plus me throwing in a little more cash. Comes with 1 mag, weapon wipe, RRA case, manual,warranty etc. I AM WILLING TO SHIP!!If you got any more questions just feel free to reach out, more than happy to help answer!"

Just because it is made by Norinco does not mean its a bad gun. Ive shot it a few times and have never had a problem. The safety has been taken off and the hole filled.

The Supervision night vision device is different from other standard systems in that it uses digital technology to amplify ambient/infrared light, displaying a black and white image as opposed to a green one. Even compared to the most advanced traditional Generation 3 devices, Supervision offers superior clarity, resolution and range. Additional features include a reinforced housing, 2-8x zoom magnification, high resolution display, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, hand strap and carrying case.  Weight: 20 oz. Technical InformationNotes:•This monocular uses digital technology, a sensor powered by a signal processor, to pick up ambient infrared light•The display is a black and white high resolution image•The manufacturer states that this technology exceeds military-grade generation 3 night vision devices•An automatic gain control with three presets allows adjustments from twilight to dark night•Housed in a water-resistant polymer casing•Weighs 20 oz•Rechargeable lithium-ion battery and AC charger are included•The battery is removed from the monocular to charge it, please note that the battery may not be charged when the monocular is shipped, so it will require charging•When the monocular is powered up, the display will show ""INIT"" for a few moments as the circuits run a diagnostic check, this is not a defect•Includes carry bag and hand strapSpecifications:•Resolution 1280 x 768 pixels•Minimum illumination 0.0003 lux•Magnification 2x to 8x zoom•Focus 2 ft to infinity•Diopter adjustment +2 to -6•Field of view 525 ft at 1000 yds•1 year manufacturer's warranty
 
SuperVision Compared to Gen 3 PVS 14 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGnKWLHMN_U
 
Xenonic Inc. have already will start shipping what they call the most powerful night-vision scope in the world (that's what they say). SuperVision is a digital viewing system that uses a highly sophisticated and sensitive CCD sensor (380k pixels), which can digitally process information into a sharp clear picture on a high resolution display.SuperVision scope's performance exceeds even the best Military Grade GenIII Night Vision Goggles. Some pluses for the Xenonics Scope: higher clarity, better resolution and further range. It's also offering a 2 x to 8 x zoom magnification, something that was not achieved by the pack of night vision goggles manufacturers. Military-grade night vision actually requires you to install a 3 x magnifier which only gives one level of magnification at the expense of greater bulk and weight. At only 20 ozs., SuperVision is powered by a lithium-ion rechargeable battery (110 V charger included) .The big problem is that the SuperVision looks like a tiny astronomical telescope that can be used only if you hold it with one hand. So, there's no way you can mount it on your helmet or your gun. Don't worry though! It comes with a hand strap so there's no need to try finding your pocket when silver bullets are aimed at you. Just let it hang and use the effective no hands strategy, eh? But if you really want to face Predator, better stick with the Military Grade Generation 4 night vision goggles.If you want it, look for more info from SuperVision authorized dealers as soon as Xenonics Holdings Inc. touts that their piece is out.

From the factory: RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward- ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The  patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon  firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the  barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only  26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths.  Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to  existing Bullpup rifles."

I was originally going to bring these 3 with me but I've decided to let them go to a good home. I am very meticulous about the upkeep of all my guns and these are no exception. I will sell them individually upon request but I thought it would be easier to list them as a package deal. I don't go to the local shooting range very much and as a result, all 3 have seen 100 rounds at the most very most shot through them. The Ruger LC9 is one of my personal favorite out of the collection and was bought for ""summer carry."" I've added a red laser mounted on the right side. It comes with 2 single stack magazines that hold 7 and features the pinky extension. Has brand new batteries for the laser as of  4/11/2016. Chambers 9mm. Price: $475.00 The Ruger Ruger SR22 comes with 1 magazine and Chambers the 22LR. This has been an excellent pistol and was intended for the local range since 22LR is very inexpensive. Price: $280.00Thd Taurus Millennium chambers 9mm and comes with 1 (12 round) magazine. It is double stacked so they are all near same size even though this one holds the most. I will say this one always makes me smile when I shoot if for how light the trigger is because it helps for better accuracy at the range. Price: $300.00They have all treated me very well and in return, I've done the same. I know they will make someone very happy and I hope the next owner will appreciate the condition I've kept them in. I have never experienced any type of malfunctions with any of them. For any questions, please feel free to contact me directly. Thank you and God bless."

NOT MINE!:INCLUDES ALL THE HOLSTERS PICTURED 3 SETS OF GRIPS, kIMBER NIGHT SIGHTS 3 MAGS 2 BOXES AMMO AND SELF DEFENSE AMMO ... ALL INCLUDED!!!CALL OR TEXT JIM @ REDACTED $600 FIRM!The Ultra Carry II from Kimber is accomplished with Kimber’s usualattention to detail. Weight of the pistol is 25 ounces, accordingto Kimber’s own stats, putting it at over three quarters of a poundless weight than a full size 1911. The weight factor is important,because in many ways we’re talking about a more compact version ofa Commander size pistol. The Commander, when it was originallyintroduced by Colt, had an aluminum alloy frame.
There was much chest beating about aluminum alloy frames holdingup, but aluminum alloy frames have proven to be quite acceptablefor hard duty with a heavy caliber pistol.
Barrel length is where this pistol is quite radical. The barrel isonly three inches long, making it 1-3/4 inches shorter than aCommander and a half-inch shorter than the Detonics CombatMaster.Magazine capacity with the pistol is a full seven rounds, as intraditional 1911 pistols.
Overall length of this pistol is 6.8 inches. The slide is stainlesssteel and the trigger is match grade aluminum. The added length inthe grip in order to accommodate seven rounds allows getting theentire last three fingers on the grip frame.
Danny and I both shot the Kimber Ultra Carry II using Federal 230grain Hydra Shok ammunition. I did my best shooting of the sessionwith the Kimber and this did not surprise me. In my hands, it shotslightly to the left, which is a chronic problem with myshooting.
My group was nice and tight. It should be remembered that I wouldsometimes test fire more than thirty 1911-style automatics in asession, so that even with my lackluster marksmanship, I tend to dobetter with a .45. Danny is also a good hand with a .45 and got abetter group than mine, both of us well within the parameters setfor the test. The pistol was quite pleasant to shoot and perceptionof recoil was not a factor.
Kimber recommends that, with the Ultra Carry models, the recoilspring should be changed every 1800 rounds. I had asked one of mycontacts at Kimber about swapping recoil springs as often asrecommended in their manuals. It was made clear to me, as I hadassumed, that once you hit the magic number of rounds you shouldn’texpect catastrophic spring failure. Instead, Kimber views this as away to ensure there will not be spring failure. That certainlymakes sense.
Sights on the Ultra Carry II are fixed and extremely rugged. Theyare left black and, if this pistol were mine, I would add whitemarkings on the sights to assist my older eyes. The thumb safety issingle sided, but extended, and the grip safety features a beavertail. The beaver tail amply protects the web of the hand. TheKimber Ultra Carry II is a classy looking pistol and performedquite well."

This gun wass fired exactly 95 rounds (coincidentally as many as the mags hold) at the range, cleaned,cased and kept in climate controlled environment.
