Still has about 11 months manufacturer warranty left!Reason for selling: decided to get a C39V2 milled receiver gun that looks identical, so no point in having 2. Highlights are: nitrided barrel, enhanced RAK1 trigger, Magpul Zhukov handguard and stock (folding, collapsible), side scope rail, magazine dimples, made in USA, pretty good gun.Comes with: Gun, 1 Magpul magazine, original box, manual, original receipt,Here's a really thorough review of this gun (without the same furniture): https://www.gunsamerica.com/blog/the-new-american-made-ak-the-ras47/The Zhukov furniture is $200 if you were to buy it yourself and install it.For this gun, you would expect to pay ~$800 + shipping + FFL transfer for this, so my price reflects a savings. I am just trying to recoup my $$$. The price is break-even for me and firm.http://www.atlanticfirearms.com/component/virtuemart/shipping-rifles/ras-ak47-rifle-magpu-zhukov-detail.html?Itemid=0"

Federal law requires a shotgun to be of at least 26 inches long with a barrel of at least 18 inches. This particular shotgun is 28 inches long with a barrel a little over 20 inches. It is NOT an SBS, AOW, or NFA item under federal law and completely legal to own. It is a .410 with a three inch chamber and I have fired .45 LC cowboy loads through it. I chopped it down to make it a handy little backpacking snake gun. I'm not going to lie, its seen better days. But mechanically it is sound and shooting it feels like a pellet gun recoil is so light. Might make a fun project gun for refinishing wood and metal. I want to get into other things though and in turn need to thin the herd a bit. Can meet anywhere in Clay County.

It has a flat blade bayonet rather than the spiked bayonet and cycles just fine. I've put a couple hundred rounds thorugh it and it did jam a couple of times but that is to be expected running cheap steel cased Tula ammo.

Selling my 4” service model Springfield Armory XD40 S&W and the complete Springfield package. It is a very nice and well taken care of pistol with a low round count and has been stored in my climate controlled gun safe when not at the range. The Springfield package is everything shown (Case, XML mini light, XD dual belt holster, XD magazine speed loader, XD belt holster, three magazines, pistol lock, original cleaning brush and all original Springfield manuals).
Additionally, I have a Blackhawk (LT) CQC carbon fiber belt holster and paddle holster; along with 200+ rounds of FMJ range ammunition if interested.
The only reason I'm getting rid of it is I'm consolidating handgun calibers and this is my only .40S&W.
