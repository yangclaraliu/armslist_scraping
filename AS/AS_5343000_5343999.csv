We bought it to grow with my son as he aged. It is a well taken care of gun, cleaned after each use. Actually, it was used about 2-3 times per year for dove/duck hunting. We also purchased the synthetic stock/forearm system for the gun so the stock could adjust as he grew. So this gun is very versatile - can be used as a hunting gun, turkey or home defense.  The gun is currently in the wood stock mode but we have the synthetic stock and foream to go with it as part of the sale as well. They are in good shape too. In addition, we can throw in our 20 ga. shells - both bird shot, steel duck shot and buck shot. Great, solid and reliable gun! Priced fairly according to our research/comparables across the country but will consider reasonable offers. Desire local transaction. Thanks!"

418,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5343418,For Sale:  ITT AN/ PVS-14 Night Vision Monocular (F9815) MIL-SPEC PVS-14 Special Forces Kit,"Bryan/College Station, Houston, Texas","$ 3,750","Listed On: Saturday, October 15, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"New in metal mil spec container and outer crate, opened to test and verify.  Never mounter on a firearm.
 
ITT AN/ PVS-14 Night Vision Monocular (F9815) MIL-SPEC PVS-14 Special Forces KitFor the swapmeisters out there, I'm not looking to enhance my collection, if I was open to swap the ad would have said so.If what you are wanting to swap me you don't have hard offers from a dealer or pawn shop for $3,750.00 minimum, I'm not interested in a swap, if you do, sell your stuff bring the cash and buy this.Sorry but no swaps other than cash.This is actual mil spec, not some hand selected tube that was rejected for mil use because of cracks/fissures in tube surface (not ends so image isn’t affected) that means those units will fail after 3,500 recoils of your weapon.
With those you will pay $3,000 for a new tube and $500 to install (weapon mounted on those is excluded from warranty).
No such exclusion on mine from ITT/Excelis.
Mines real mil spec and it has to meet impact and shock loading exceeding recoil on a M16, M4 or AR15 with 5.56x45.
That’s part of the mil spec.
Not that you'd abuse your weapon, but if you lean your weapon against a fence or tree to climb over a fence or drop it (does happen), glass is fragile (what did you think the tube was made of) and impact does crack or break it.
That’s what mil spec cost more, commercial doesn't require work under any condition regardless of treatment, mil spec does.
So a little more upfront or a lot more when your night vision with a huffer-puffer “hand selected tube with a cert that’s just like mil spec” fails because it was a mil spec reject because of surface cracks in the tube.
The PVS-14 night vision monocular is the all-around best multipurpose monocular available. Helmet mount or head mounted, the AN/PVS-14 allows the user to retain their night adapted vision in one eye while viewing their surroundings through the illuminated eyepiece of the PVS-14.
The new battery housing completes the perfect package by allowing the user to power off the unit when in an upright position and power on when flipped down. An additional benefit is its ability to be weapon mounted behind most sights such as Trijicon ACOG, Aimpoint Red Dot Sights (excluding H-1) and L3 EOTech Holographic Weapon Sights (excluding 512, 516, EXPS2-0 and XPS2-0) among others.
It can be used with the BlackOptex Zero Lens. By use of this collimating device the AN/PVS-14 is placed in front of your normal sight instead of behind it. By use of this you don’t have to re-zero your normal sight when you remove the night vision or when you use it. This saves you an immense amount of time, grief and aggravation.
This allows the user the ability to user their PVS-14 both as a night vision monocular for increased mobility and as a passive short range weapon sight. ITT Night Vision, the world’s leading producer of Generation (Gen 3) image intensification devices, offers the highest performance image intensifier tubes available.
ITT’s Gen 3 F9815SLG (MX-11769) Pinnacle image intensifier tubes used in this unit.
ITT’s MX-11769 Gen 3 18-mm image intensifier is completely self-contained with an integral high-voltage power supply. Equipped with automatic brightness control (ABC), this power supply provides constant output image brightness as light levels increase. It also provides bright-source protection to guard the tube against exposure to high levels of light. It features Auto Gating power supply and variable gain that is user adjustable.
This isn’t some home brew or tube replacement making claims of being the best available. This is an actual unit built by ITT to the AN/PVS-14 military specification.
This was not taken/purchased by the US government as evidenced by no contract number being showed on the photograph of the placard on the device. If a unit shows a contract number on the placard on the device run like hades because the odds are that device is stolen government property.
I have a paper trail to show who I purchased it from and when I purchased it.
This item:
From placard and shown in photographs.
Mfg Ident: 13567
Cont. No.:                              
NSN 5855-REDACTED
Serial No: VWXYZ
Contract number is blank none shown because order was initiated by the US government but when produced and ready to create placard and ship the lot produced wasn’t taken/purchased by the US government.
Serial number is a 5 digit serial number not shown in the photographs or listed here to protect me.
There are approximately 500 AN/PVS-14 manufactured by ITT/Excelis like this one that were part of an order that was initiated by the US government but when produced and ready to create placard and ship the lot produced wasn’t taken/purchased by the US government.
There were 80,000+ AN/PVS-14 AN/PVS-14 manufactured by ITT/Excelis.
That’s 0.625% fairly rare.
With no contract number shown there is zero risk that anyone can claim that this unit is stolen US government property or that you would lose it.
It seems that there are units out there that are stolen and have a contract number shown, is saving a small amount money worth the risk of having it seized, facing criminal charges for possessing stolen US government property and a criminal record showing a federal felony.
New, never used in original Mil Spec metal case.
I haven’t had time to use this toy since I purchased it.
All night vision export is regulated by the U.S. government and subject to United States Export rules and regulations. Valid export licenses may be issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce or the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, in accordance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), Title 22, Code of Federal Regulation 120-130.
I do not obtain export licensing for this item.
This item is subject to ITAR requirements. You must be a U.S. citizen or Lawful permanent resident (green card holder) to even look through this device let alone buy it.
I require authenticatable proof that you are either a U.S. citizen (US passport or US passport card works best) or Lawful permanent resident (green card holder) (your green card works best). If you can’t provide this let’s not waste your or my time. You must complete the ITAR paperwork.
Not trying to be difficult but that’s the law and beyond being the right thing to do because of terrorist or countries not favorable to the US trying to buy this equipment I have no desire for a Felony criminal record.
Other units available:
Generation II: $2,200.00-$2,600.
Generation III third party/Home Brew: $3,200.00-$3,500.00
Generation III real Mill Spec actually built by Excelis as a mill spec for a contract but not taken by the US government and not some third party (who can’t produce/claim mill spec because they aren’t a government contractor for this item (absence of a manufacturer identification number)). $4,200.00-$4,600.00.
I’m asking $3,750.00
Or make reasonable offer (worth more than a Generation III third party/Home Brew).
This isn't a fire sale nor is anyone desperate.
Additional photographs available.
Cash only, small bills.
If you are outside of my area and we can’t meet face to face, we would need to find a third part that can handle the ITAR requirements first and in their presence permit you to verify that the unit works and functions properly. The issue of payment will need to be worked out.

Black Optex Zero Lens For PVS-14 Part Number: 11Z014For the swapmeisters out there, I'm not looking to enhance my collection, if I was open to swap the ad would have said so.If what you are wanting to swap me you don't have hard offers from a dealer or pawn shop for $1,250.00 minimum, I'm not interested in a swap, if you do, sell your stuff bring the cash and buy this.Sorry but no swaps other than cash.
The Zero Lens is an optical alignment adapter that enables the use of night vision monoculars (NVM) in front of day sights to add nighttime engagement capability with no zero shift. This configuration is more efficient and user friendly than when the night optic is mounted behind the primary sight. Front mounting allows the operator to maintain the same shooting position, muscle memory, and eye relief with his primary sight. And when installing or removing the night vision capability there is no need to ever re-zero either your day sight or the night vision monocular. Think of all of the time and grief that will save you. Instead of having to zero your day optics every time you want night vision and all the time that will take away from doing what you want (sure isn’t zeroing your day sight now is it), you won’t hesitate for any reason to use night vision whenever you want or need it. Your buds will be holding you up having to re-zero their day optics every time they switch between night vision and day vision, but not you.
With the appropriate mount, Zero Lens™ can be used with NVM's such as:
PVS-14
PVS-18
MUM-14
Thermal PVS-14
to add nighttime capability to:
Electronic Sights
Optical Scopes
Video Cameras
The standard quick detach mounting system enables rapid installation and removal, allowing easy transition of the NVM between handheld, helmet mounted, or weapon mounted use as needed during operations. Once set, the Zero Lens™ will maintain alignment between the adjusted NVM and the day sight when it is re-installed.
The Zero Lens™ is a rugged, non-electronic, compact device that adds capability to your existing inventory of optics at a fraction of the cost of adding new standalone systems.
The Zero Lens is an adapter that enables the use of a night vision monocular (NVM) in front of electronic and non‐electronic optical day sights to add nighttime engagement capability without physically modifying them.
The Zero Lens is a non‐electronic, compact, and rugged optical alignment device that allows the user to compensate for any zero shift that might be caused by the NVM.
Once set, the Zero Lens will maintain proper optical alignment between the NVM and the daysight when removed and then re‐installed on the weapon.
The quick detach mounting system enables rapid transition of the NVM between weapon‐mounted, helmet‐mounted, and/or handheld use as needed during operations.
Zero Lens enhances your current inventory of equipment at a fraction of the cost and training requirements of adding new stand‐alone night vision sights.
This passive system counters an enemy force’s ability to detect active IR laser pointers and illuminators.
Includes:
Hard carrying case

I drilled the vent hole (the guns are shipped without the holes drilled) and it shoots fine. I've fired it a handful of times, not blanks but patch and ball. It's a great entry level flintlock but I can't really justify owning it. I don't have anywhere I can shoot it. I'd rather have cash to put towards a motorcycle. I'm throwing in about a dozen flints, 20ish round balls (.735 diameter). The bore is bright and shiny, I've taken good care of it. There are 2 small scratches on the stock by the buttplate. I'm asking for $500, price is firm. I'm also open to centerfire pistol trades (Glock 17/19/22/23) etc or AK-47/AK74s.Text me at 434-907-56-four-zero.
