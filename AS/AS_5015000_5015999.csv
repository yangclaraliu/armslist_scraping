This rifle has the Hogue grip, two-stage competition trigger, Magpul Rifle Stock with storage compartment and 24"" heavy fluted barrel($1,200).  For a 24"" heavy barrel, the weight is not too bad on this one, there is fluting under the free float tube as well.  Nikon P-223 3-9x40mm BDC scope($200).  Nikon M-223 XR mount, this model has a 20 MOA incline built into the base for long range shooting($100).  Everything would run $1,500+ new after any tax, shipping and/or FFL fees.

$1,300 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.  Will also sell just the rifle for $1,100, the scope for $150 and I'll keep the mount.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal and the value is there, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now and am needing some tires in the next month or so.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.

Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or I can ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

Includes: 2, 15 round mags (Keepshooting.com) and 1, 30 round (not very reliable) magazine.

Approx 400 rounds run through the gun by me. A couple small dings in the wood stock (see pics), but wood is crack free and looks very nice. 
Currently setup in the Choate adjustable stock, since it gives a longer length of pull for better cheek weld and sight picture than standard wooden stock. Can easily put back the original wood stock, as no modifications were made to the action, barrel, trigger group, etc.

The serial no. under the rear sight reads: 154338 The 3 is hard to see, but I think its a 3. Didn't want to drift off the rear sight to check. The barrel stamp near the front sight reads: ""Inland Manufacturing Div, General Motors, 2-44""
My father purchased it in Aug 1965 from Normount Armory out of Oregon, and was distributed from Rock Island, IL. I have all the original papers that will go with the gun.

Shoots great! The 15 round magazines feed very well, and this gun is very accurate with iron sights.
Asking $800 and will include 350 rounds of Tula (steel case) that feeds great in this gun ($775 without ammo)

Trades are considered for ONLY: .308 bolt gun, prefer threaded barrels (Rem 700 AAC, Savage Model 10 heavy barrel w/ scope etc)
FTF only prefer South Bend/Mishawaka, but can go as far west at Lake Co, as far east as Fort Wayne, south to Kokomo for the right deal

Marketed as a 'youth' rifle, but im an adult and shoot it just fine! Very comfortable. Bought it as a backpacking survival type rifle as its very light and compact , yet VERY robust.  Has that infamous CZ accuracy. No scope included. 

This is by far the best quality .22 youth rifle on the market!  Comes with 5 rd mag and single shot adapter. Ive hunted squirell and other game with it, its in almost new condition still. Always transported in case and cleaned. I take very good care of all my guns. 

Great bug out kit, survival, truck gun, youth gun etc!

Trades only!  Bought for 350$ new less than a year ago!"
