Now you may be asking why there is no Yugoslavian Arsenal Stamp on it. Well, the yugoslavians were producing the  Mauser in the 50's and we're selling them to the highest bidders for contracts (even if the contracts were with warring parties) if the guns got  captured the Yugoslavians did not want the other parties to know they were supplying guns to whomever. This rifle came from a batch that was meant for a contract with Egypt, but the Egyptians never paid so they were crated up and put the market. $550 obo. Trades considered. Can do personal sale if wanted. If the right gun is offered in trade and makes me moist I can put money on top."

Since it is the last of my revolvers, with it also goes a holster that can be used either right or left handed, two speed loaders (model 10-A if you need that info), belt pouch for the speed loaders, 100 rounds of FMJ .38 special ammo, and 192 rounds of .357 mag ammo.
