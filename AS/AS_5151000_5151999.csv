This gun is very nice & shoots great, with a very low round count.(under 30) Great size for carry & conceal since it's a subcompact, packs a big punch(similar to a 45acp) but is smooth with light recoil, & very dependable like a glock should be. No permit required, simple bill of sale. Thanks for looking."

Only the M70AB has the complete 1.6mm reciever with the RPK tougher rear trunnion, while THIS M70AB2T only has the tougher RPK rear trunnion.  It makes for a lighter underfolder.

It has not been fired or been carried so it is perfect New condition. My main interest is self defense and so I've decided to let the .25 go in favor of more powerful guns.Super easy to conceal in a pocket. This model has a tip-up barrel for loading so it's not necessary to rack the slide! Taurus handguns have a key lock system that is built in to prevent firing without the special hex key. Will only show to individual who presents a valid Wisconsin CCW permit.
