Other than that, the gun is a beauty. I'm selling this gun with its original box which came with 2 magazines. I will also throw in a nice light brown outside holster with a magazine holster attached, 100 rounds of .22 ammunition, a caring case and a tool that makes taking the gun apart a lot easier. There is nothing wrong with this gun, i am only selling it to help pay for my bills. I like to be very safe and would want to meet at any Wayne county police department for the exchange. I'm open for negotiation, but please no lowballers. Cash only."

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.
The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.
The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is available in your favorite calibers – 9mm, .40SW, or .45ACP. It’s time for you to get serious about winning. It’s ready. Are you?

It is an M&P9 Full Size, with the following modifications: -ATEI Top & Side serrations (melonite finish after cutting)-ATEI Trigger job, including pin safety plunger, new sear, reset kit, etc.-DFC stippling around entire grip, plus front frame flats-DFC Magwell bevel & trigger guard relief cut-DFC Beavertail removal (note in pics where part of the inner frame is showing through the polymer, it's been like that since it was almost new and in no way affects the performance or ergonomics of the pistol)-Ameriglo Hackathorn night sights (red front blank rear)-M&P45 grip retainer (allows for lanyard attachment) It also includes a TLR-1 weapon light (glass is clear, no breaks, etc., batteries still good), and a Raven Phantom holster with IWB loops attached. Also have 4 magazines for it. Round count unknown, somewhere in the ""a lot"" area. Still shoots straight, isn't so loose it rattles when you look at it wrong and the bore is bright with strong rifling. Stippling is a little worn but still very effective and probably perfect for those who want the extra grip but not feel like you're wearing a belt sander. It's been used a lot but never really abused and it's still got a ton of life in it. Looking to get $600 OBO, I'm located in Lyon Township and do make it around the Metro Detroit area a bit. Buyer must have purchase permit or CPL. I can take credit cards through Square if that is your preferred method of payment (will add roughly 3% to total to cover fees) or as always cash is king.http://i.imgur.com/8UyfOpc.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/TKH03Re.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/kA40cfJ.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/HdLr5FY.jpg"

Everything is in great shape, functions perfectly as you'd expect from a 10/22, but I haven't shot 22 in years, priced to sell.  I believe I have less than a brick of ammo through it.  Rifle is in our name so must be willing to sign a bill of sale and or show Oklahoma ID or license.  The original wood laminate stock is included in the sale (and is nice and could easily be converted back to factory).  Close to $500 spent all together.  Firm at the asking price of $350.  Really not interested in any trades unless it's worth the $500 I have invested."

Anyway, I contacted KelTec and they said for $95 that they would replace the barrel.  I was going to do it but never got around to it and probably never will. I dont have anything in mind for a trade, so throw some ideas my way and we will see what happens. I can send additional pictures upon request.I will make up the difference if your trade is worth more.*I have had questions concerning the rifles functionality and as mentioned above, it functions as it should. I have also included a new picture showing my mess up. I would be interested in knives like Esee 6 (partial serrated), Hoffner, Benchmade, etc... + or - cash"
