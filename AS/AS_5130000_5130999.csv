It had about 40 rounds through it before I sent it in to Taurus last May.  As I said, there was a recall on the earlier model and so I called to make sure my model wasn't a recall-- and they offered to take my G2 in to check it out anyway.  I decided that was a good idea given how ""iffy"" some Taurus's have been know to be-  free factory check-up-- I sent it to them.  I got it back in July and they sent it back with two brand NEW mags and paperwork certifying the pistol is in perfect working order!But I have not used it since; I didn't even remove thier barrel seal since getting it back.  I am just not using it, nor do I ever think I will and so I'm selling it off here for what I know this clean, certified pistol is worth to those who understand ""peice of mind"".The Talon grips were put on at the gun shop by a pro-- so they are straight and perfectly fitted to the pistol.  This is a must have upgrade for any CC gun since you won't slip if you have to make that draw (which is the whole point).  Of course the warranty transfers to the buyer and is ""lifetime of the firearm"" (no receipt needed, I know because I lost mine and they still took it in last year, so you just can't beat this warranty!).The pistol comes with it's origional carry case, everything it came with new (keys, brush, paperwork), two NEW mags, and documentation for the service and certification from Taurus last summer.I paid $250 for this pistol, FFL fees of $25, $25 for the Talon grips and $25 shipping to Taurus for the check-out = $325 plus some time invested.  So I'd hope to get al least an offer here for $260 since it's practically a new pistol, with new mags and you KNOW this Turus will have NO problems (and that is worth something to anyone who has had the hasle of a bad gun they bought new-- it does happen sometimes-- especially on cheaper guns)."

This rifle is the descendant of the British Lee Enfield chambered in .303, and was in fact manufactured with many of the same machines but built in the Ishapore factory in India. These rifles saw action throughout much of the Cold War, and helped to defend Indian Province from both China and Pakistan. This rifle come with both a great history and:-A replacement synthetic Monte Carlo Stock in Black.-Matching numbers on the Receiver, Front site post shroud, and the magazine which is usually lost.-1 Detachable magazine with a 12 round capacity.-The original war scarred walnut stock.-and 60+ rounds of 7.62 x 51 (NATO)* This rifle is not without its share of damage though it is entirely cosmetic and shown in the pictures above, though they add to the appeal and patina of a true war rifle. The firearm functions flawlessly, the bolt chambers, fires, and extracts rounds smoothly, and quickly. The weight is more balanced than most of the surplus rifles of its day, and with the smooth bolt it is possible to make accurate follow up shots with little difficulty. The bore is in excellent condition and will consistently drop a pop can at 100 yards or a deer out of your favorite blind. You are able to fire either 7.62 Nato rounds or .308 win through this rifle, though it seems to prefer the Nato rounds.*The synthetic monte carlo stock advertised with this firearm retails for $80-100, and is easily exchanged with just a few screws. The synthetic stock is perfect for the woods and gives you the comfortable feel of the Monte Carlo stock we are all used to.*I am asking 375 OBO for this package deal but will consider other offers. I currently live in Owenton, KY but I am able to meet in any of the surrounding areas on most days with notice. Feel free to email me at REDACTED if you have any questions about this firearm. * I am not willing to utilize an FFL service at this time, but will for the right offer."

Manufacturing for this special edition revolver ended in January 2011. I purchased the gun new and it has never been fired. There are only 1,000 of these that were manufactured by Ruger and engraved by Talo.  When Ruger manufactured these 1,000 revolvers they put the lettering and numbering, things such as SP101, 357 Magnum and such, in different locations than the standard SP101 because of the engraving. Thus makes these 1,000 revolvers different and unique than all other SP101's.  Comes with the nicer Ruger Logo Grips that is original to the special edition deluxe gun. Never fired with box. Price for the revolver is $650. Price is firm.  Must be a Kentucky resident with a valid Kentucky Drivers Liscense. Prefer if you have your Kentucky concealed carry. Thanks and hope to hear from you. Located in Bowling Green. If this ad is up the gun is still for sale."

Barrel pin was broken by previous owner,  about 75% intact. All original parts will come with rifle: feed throat, ejector spring, recoil spring, hammer spring, lifter, firing pin.Rifle likes to run Federals and not so much Winchesters.  With that in mind, you shouldn't think of this rifle as 100%.  Might need some tweaking/work.   Must have valid North Carolina driver's license and sign bill of sale.Send me an email if you have any questions."

Ooowee mama! I have owned many quality Ak variants (and many crappy ones) to compare this to. Let me tell you, this particular rifle is of exceptional build quality. From everything I can see; the rivets are strong and flush inside the receiver and out, the sights are straight, the front trunnion aligned perfectly, there is no ""bolt hold-open"" hang up, and the overall condition excellent. There is no corrosion on the internals (just a bit of carbon from the 200 flawless non-corrosive rounds fired through it by the previous owner). The builder is Waffen Werks. Yes, I know, they have a bit of a bad rap on a few of their rifles that were spit out with lower quality. Unfortunately that is the way things go with reputations. If there are a couple lemons out of 1000 good ones, those couple are all you will hear about. In this sample's case, no need to worry. Comes with one magazine, Sling, and soft case.The only reason I am getting rid of it; I just have too many AK variants. This was the last in, so it will be the first to go. YES I will accept TRADES. 850 is my value on it, let me know what you have.
