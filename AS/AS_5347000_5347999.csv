This is a pretty solid looking brake but doesn't suit my philosophy of use. asking 20 bucks, you meet me where I chose.Trade considered for rifle powder in a sealed container, or large rifle primers.This advanced Muzzle Brake / Linear Comp. offers a sleek custom look as well as enhancing performance & accuracy.  Unlike traditional ""muzzle breaks"" the SAA Dragon's Head Linear Comp. features five ports facing down range to keep muzzle blast and noise away from the shooter and by-standers.  Older, traditional muzzle breaks like the ported or baffle designs direct gases and energy (and noise) back towards the shooter as well as those near the shooter.  This is one of the best muzzle brakes we've tested, reducing muzzle rise by keeping recoil directed in-line (""linear"" compensator) with the axis of the barrel (""bore axis"").  This significantly reduces recoil & muzzle rise for quicker & more accurate follow-up shots.  The SAA Dragon's Head also gives a flush look to bull barrels.  (Pic:  No, the complete upper isn't included)    Black parkerized finish     1/2x28"" Threading    Designated for .223/5.56 Caliber    Adds about 1.5"" to the OAL of your barrel (2.14"" OAL)    No use of a crush washer required    .936"" diameter    Made in the USA"

No rust, pitting, cracks, scrapes, gouges....just a little bit of honest use. This scarce Belgian Browning comes with 2 magazines- (which can run around $300 each) plus another one that needs a little 'coaxing' but I'll throw it in as a bonus & you can work out the details yourself.May possibly trade for Silver, or ???....or cash plus trade.

Up for sale is a beautiful 1898 Krag-Jorgenson rifle.

The bore is pristine; clean with no pitting and good rifling. The metal finish has turned to patina, while the wood looks to be in good shape with the original finish. The rear sight is a 1902 variant. Serial number dates the rifle to September of 1900. This is a great example of the nicest US military rifle with a bolt as smooth as glass. The sling on the rifle is an M1 green web sling. Also comes with a brass muzzle/front sight cover and the stock oil bottle.  The rifle will also come with a Lee reloading die set, and 80 pieces of brass.  I am looking to get $800 for the whole package. Or $700 simply for the rifle.  Or trade for a Ross Rifle, genuine Mosin sniper rifle, PTR/C-308 rifle, Arsenal AK.  PM if interested. I'm located in NE Philadelphia, but spend most of my time up in Bucks."

Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard.

This beauty is back up on the sale block! The purchaser decided to pass on it. From what he told me, some of the smaller parts had been refinished (such as the trigger and other straw colored pieces). While he was impressed with the quality and how well it matched (he was here in the office examining it), he passed because of the refinishing.        With that information, I'm going to lower the price! Going to repost the original information as well:       A 1917 DWM Artillery Luger! As you can see in the pictures, I tore this beauty down all the way to the firing pin and the numbers match internally and externally. The ONLY number that doesn't match is the magazine. What's cool though is, the magazine has the older style wooden knob on it.   This Luger does have wear, as you can see, but the patina on those areas adds to the beauty of this hard to find and amazing piece of history. It cycles just as smooth as you can imagine as well.       If you've been looking for an artillery Luger, you won't find one at a price this low."

Everything that was included from the factory will come with this sale as well as original guide rod and recoil spring and factory soft carrying case. In addition if you need any .380 FMJ brass cased ammo, I have several hundred loose rounds from several manufacturers i.e. Federal, Blazer, CBC, PMC, for $35 per 100rds. It would cost $575 to purchase these items retail if you could find the OD Ruger which is discontinued and nearly impossible to find so I am looking for $400 or best offer. No major or minor problems with this gun, I just bought something different for the wife so I need to sell this one.
