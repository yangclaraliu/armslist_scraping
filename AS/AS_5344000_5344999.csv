Function and fit and finish has been perfect with no reliability problems. It has had no permanent modifications done to it, it has been refinished to the current ""battle-worn"" look. I did this by putting on a layer of paint and then using mineral spirits to remove it. It still has the factory Parkerization and the handguards have been changed out to fit the look(original polymer and an aftermarket quadrail are also included). The dust cover is a Texas Weapons Systems Dogleg Gen II Yugo model that allows for easy mounting of optics and in no way permanently modifies the gun. I have three mags with it two 30's and a 20 and can sell you my remaining ammo at a good price. Overall this has been a great rifle that is perfect for hogs, deer, a range toy or most anything, simply selling to fund purchasing a battle rifle. Accuracy has been pretty consistant at 2moa at 100 yards with wolf 123gr HP."

The accutrigger is set for a little over 2 pounds, but can be adjusted very easily. The rifle is in great shape, it hasn't been shot a lot, 3 boxes at the most, and I've still got a full box that comes with the rifle. Here are a few little known facts about these rifles. The accutrigger short actions have the fasted lock time in the industry at 1.6 milliseconds, about 50% faster than any bolt action on the market today. Faster lock time means better accuracy one of the reasons why savage makes the most accurate gun out of the box. The barrel is also free floated. Now the 7mm-08 is an often overlooked cartridge in the world of today's super magnums, but it's performance and habitats can't be overstated. W.D.M Bell, professional elephant hunter, killed 988 elephants with a 7mm Mauser. The 7mm-08 is the modern short action equivalent to the 7mm Mauser. The ballistics of this cartridge are simply amazing considering the felt recoil is about like a stiff 243. At 550 yards, with 140 grain ballistic tips, it's still packing over 1000 ft. Pounds of energy. There are very few hooves animals in the world that can stand up to a beating like that. Now that I've worn your ears down to nubs, it's price tag time. Buds has these for 766 cash price. The best deal i can find on the scope was 190. The extended mags, now hold your breath for this one, were 90 bucks each. I know, crazy right? Whats worse, is that they are no longer available. Mounts, bases, and ammo I won't even calculate. So, as new this rig would run about 1100-1200, depending on taxes and ammo prices. Now I'm not so young as to think I could get that out of it, so I'm not even going to try. What I would take for it is 900. I'm also open to trades, especially when they got the words Smith and Wesson and 3 or 4 inch revolver somewhere in it. I'd really like a nice 41 mag or 44 mag, but the 45 colt and 357 are still mighty fine trading guns. Let me know what you guys or girls got, and as always, cash is king."

It's been an all time favorite of mine and has never failed me at the range after just a mere round count of 300. It shoots wonderfully and accurately, it's always been a treat. It handles like a CZ, since the design is based off the Czech's; it has a very strong solid feel to it and the grips allow a natural pointing angle. It has a great double action / single action feel, very clean break and a light pull afterwards that invites double taps. These things are sturdy and know how to take a beating, however I've never abused it and have always cleaned and lubricated it after every session; it was essentially my target plinker of choice. I must say... the Israelis know how to craft a fine firearm.One modification I've done was to sand down the front of the trigger for added friction while shooting gloved. I have smaller hands and found it helpful.   Here's what you get:  Baby Eagle II Full size 9mm, Steel frame with pictanny rail system 2 Original 15 round mags (mags will hold 17 without feeding problems) Original Box with Cleaning kitVersacarry Holster34 rounds of hollow point defense ammo  I'm asking $575 or best offer"

It came from the factory this way (they have the regular wood RAS47, then a regular Magpul one, then a Zhukov Magpul one; which is what this is). These AK's are 100% made in the USA and are great quality. I just bought this one from a guy but I'd really like to trade for something else. The gun has only had 30 rounds down the barrel. Other than a little mark from the safety going up and down, it is in new condition.This gun retails for $800 and up new (the guy I bought it from paid over $900 for the gun alone), and this one comes with 3 magazine repair kits, a nice vertical hand grip, and a small rail that can be used to mount the hand grip or whatever else you would want to mount on the gun. You can make a cash offer but I'd rprefer to trade it.Stuff I'd trade for: Older S&W or Colt revolvers, 1911s, a .308 rifle, an M1 Garand, a semi auto 7.62x54r, maybe a different AK or SKS plus cash. I'm open to other stuff too. I could add cash if you have something real nice. I'd even trade for US made tools, ammo, glass blowing stuff, welding supplies, performance big block ford parts. It doesn't hurt to ask but do not offer me a gun that's worth $500 and expect a straight across trade! I like this gun a lot and if I don't get any good offers, I'll keep it.Email or call/text REDACTEDThank you!"

Please do a google search to check prices before wasting both of our time and low balling me. I am not desperate to sell this hard to find and seldom seen rifle. Also, this model has the much more desirable Monte Carlo stock... not the thumbhole.

If you've been looking for one of these for a while now is your chance to have one."

Model: 1867/96 Military Rifle Serial Number: 61301 Year of Manufacture: The rifle was made in 1882 and converted to centerfire in 1896. Caliber: The rifle was originally chambered in 11.44mm Rimfire. It has been converted to 11.7x51R Centerfire. Action Type: This single shot rifle has a rolling block action controlled by a lever on the right side of the breechblock. Markings: The left side of the receiver is marked with a “Crowned R” in script, and “M-1867”. The left side of the barrel at the receiver and the belly of the buttstock are marked “61301.” The upper tang is marked “Kjobenhavns Toihuus 1882” (Copenhagen Arsenal). The top and left side of the barrel at the receiver, the upper tang on the buttplate and all three barrel bands are marked with a Crown. The comb just in front of the buttplate is marked with a boxed “GC” inspection mark. Barrel Length: The barrel is 35 3/8” in length. Sights / Optics: The front sight is an inverted “V” blade dovetailed into a rectangular base on the barrel. The rear sight is combination sliding elevator ladder sight screwed to the barrel. It has a very long ladder, typical of the sights used in the 1896 conversion, when these rifles were withdrawn from front line infantry use and issued to coastal artillery units. When the ladder is folded down, a “V” notch at the base of the ladder is presented. There markings of “150” and “250” on the left side of the sight base for use as a sliding elevator when the ladder is folded down. When the ladder is folded up, a “V” notch is presented at the top center of the slider and another is on the far left of the slider. The rear face of the ladder is marked from “3” to “14” for use with the middle “V” on the slider. The front face of the ladder is marked from “15” to “21”. There is a thin round disc mounted to the left side of the middle barrel band that we think is a front sight for use with the “V” notch on the left side of the slider, and is for use with the markings on the front of the ladder. Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are two piece smooth walnut with a straight grip. The buttstock has a steel carbine style buttplate and the forend has a steel nose cap and is held with three barrel bands. The forend extends to within about 5” of the muzzle and is grooved on its underside for storage of a cleaning rod (included). There is a small brass marking disk inlet into the right side of the buttstock marked “HL”, “*” and “97”. There is a sling swivel inlet into the belly of the stock and another on the bottom of the middle barrel band. The stocks show oil staining around the metal parts, in old bruises and along the top of the comb. The buttstock shows several dings and bruises and a drag line down the right side at the front of the comb. The forend shows several deep bruises on the left side at the receiver and several more lighter dings scattered over its length. The LOP measures 12 13/16” from the front of the trigger to the back of the buttplate. The buttplate shows wear at the heel and toe with several tiny dings and handling marks. The buttplate is in about Very Good condition. The stocks rate in about Very Good condition. Type of Finish: We think the barrel and receiver were originally blued. There is no finish left. Finish Originality: The finish on the barrel and receiver are original. Bore Condition: The bore is mostly bright, turning slightly gray at the muzzle. There is moderate wear in the rifling. There are a few spots of light erosion a few inches from the muzzle. Buyer pays $20 for shipping"
