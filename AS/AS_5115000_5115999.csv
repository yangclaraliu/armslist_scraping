This is Crye Precision's ballistic lightweight helmet offering passive cooling through the two-piece shell design. This helmet was purchased from Tactical Night Vision Company (www.tnvc.com) in February last year for a deployment, and did not end up being used or transported. It is in like-new condition and includes the original manual.It came standard with and includes genuine Crye Arc rails with bungees, Ops-Core H-nape harness/chin strap, and the Crye velcro kit for the AirFrame has been applied to the helmet, for use with IR strobes, counterweights, and patches. The chin strap includes a black fleece cover (removable) for comfort or going over your sweet tacticool beard. Two of the Crye ""hit pads"" were replaced, one with a standard USGI 3/4"" pad in the rear, and one with a sweat-blocking, wraparound style pad in the front. The Wilcox shroud on the front of the helmet fits into the three-hole pattern that the AirFrame is drilled with at the factory, but could be mounted on another helmet with a single hole, since the shroud has four holes and is designed to work in this way. The shroud is designed to interface with other Wilcox night vision mounts and arms and includes a self-retracting retention lanyard.The AirFrame exceeds the fragmentation rating of the ACH/MICH and weighs 20% less, and keeps the wearer much cooler and is more comfortable. The AirFrame is currently issued to Tier 1 Special Operations Forces and has seen extensive action down range. Its awesome features combined with its increased ballistic coverage and weight savings make it ideal.NO international shipping, not for export. Buyer must conform and agree to the same guidelines as in the ""Waiver & Export Restrictions 2013"" terms of sale document by TNVC."

There are openings and hardware to mouht the safe OR a the openings can be used to run a steel cable through and wrap around a large and/or heavy obect. It also has an alarm after too many wrong codes or can be set igher or lower in sensitivity to movement of the safe. At highest a nudge will set the alarm, first just a slow beep occasionally, but if the code or key is not used it becomes constant. The alarm is optional to set. It's made of 16 gauge steel with foam padded inside. A divider creates a second shelf. 2 full size handgunds, 3 magazines for each and 50 round booxes of HST HP ammo fit easily and with the ammo out 3 full size handguns and magazines is easily done. A subcompact could also fit easily, it's fire resistant for a certain time, plugs in for power with a 9v back-up in case someone thinks unplugging will stop the alarm. Even if the 9v back-up dies, there are 2 emergency keys to the case. These can be used in conjunction with the code, so even if they find out the code, the lock will still prevent access. The tamper indicator will let you know to change the code. A tamper indicator is also a feature and will let you know when erroneous codes are tried while you were away and know someone was trying to get in. It's a double steel deadbolt lock on the safe. The best vault for the money by far. Can be opened quickly in the dark, but I find taking one out at night ready to go in a safe configuration is best."
