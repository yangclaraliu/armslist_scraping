Approximately 100 rounds fired through it. If you are not familiar with this pistol, it is one of the smallest 9mm pistols out there. It weighs 14 oz empty and 22 oz when loaded with ten in the magazine and one in the chamber.  It is 5.6 inches long, 1 inch wide and 4.3 inches high. It is a double action only(DAO) pistol which means no safety is installed or required. The magazines hold 10 rounds each and you can purchase S&W magazines that hold up to 15 rounds that will fit this pistol. I also have the hard case and lock it came in. I also have a  a factory belt clip you can attach so no holster is needed. If you want a holster, I have a Versacarry holster you can have for $15. I also have a trigger shoe you can install which will make the trigger wider and more comfortable. I did not find it necessary. I have two magazines and they are equipped with grip extensions to allow your ""pinky"" finger a place to hold on to. I have gone through the pistol and buffed any rough edges on the frame and slide and polished the feed ramp.  It now shoots better than a new one.This pistol has a cult following. Although it is an inexpensive pistol, many people swear by them. I recommend you go to the Kel-Tec forum and read about the P-11. It is a small pistol with plenty of firepower and it is easily concealed for self defense. In fact, it will handle +P ammo for real stopping power.  I am not interested in shipping the pistol so we would have to meet someplace in the Texoma area where we will complete a transfer paper I have drawn up to protect one another. The only reason I am getting rid of it is my wife bought me a new S&W I had been admiring. Actually I hate to sell it but I only need one small carry pistol. Go on-line and read about the pistol. You can spend more money but what you buy will not give you any more firepower. I require cash only. If interested, send me your telephone number and I will call you.  NOTE:DUE TO FEDERAL GUN LAWS, I CANNOT SELL TO A PRIVATE PARTY IN TEXAS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A TEXAS FFL.  Sorry about that but I am sure we can arrange it."

GUN OWNER’S THAT HAVE THEM, KEEP THEM. T.C. Kennon was from the Stone Mountain, GA area and in the 60’s and 70’s was known as “THE MAN” when it came to gunsmithing and benchrest shooting. He was one of the original founders of the Gate City Gun Club that later moved and became the South River Gun Club. The early club was mostly benchrest shooters. His guns are known for extreme accuracy. He was an extremely gifted artist. He designed all the guns he built, and he did all the detail work by hand. The stock of each gun had to be just right for any gun he built. Each gun meant something to him to have it the perfect way he designed it for his guns. T.C. Kennon was an Atlanta Police Department officer for 30+ years. He and a friend started their own gun shop and the original name of their shop was “Kennon and Key’s Rifles”. Unfortunately, his partner, Marion Key, was killed in the line of duty and T.C. was wounded and retired from the Atlanta Police Department in the 60’s. He passed away in 1985. I am very proud to have owned this gun since the 80’s and fired it at the range a few times along with all my friends that wanted to shoot this rare and beautiful gun. This is a hell of a gun that will make a good addition to anyone’s gun collection. Good luck for each interested bidder, I wish I had one for all of you.

Beretta brought back in many people's opinion the best Model 92 pistol they ever made… ……the 92G series. This model is hard to find and law enforcement, etc love this model. Ready for Use in a Split Second Decocker-only means that in the 92G, the slide-mounted lever (safety-decocker in the 92FS) only decocks the hammer. Different tactical shooters demand different features, and some who carry concealed or for duty feel the need for a double-action semiautomatic pistol that only features the decocker without manual safety. This is especially the case if the handgun is part of a system that includes--for instance--striker-fired pistols, which traditionally lack a safety lever. In this manner, shooters may employ a single training routine without worrying about introducing additional motions such as disengaging the safety before firing. With the 92G, tactical shooters who favor a lightning-quick unholster-point routine that does not involve any other actions have the answer to their wishes."

I'm sure S&W would gladly accept your $50.00 for a 'letter of history' on the pistol, or you can simply call S&W and have them run the SN, and get the history for free, like I did. Serial Number THB9434. Date of Manufacture is 12/21/1992. Manufactured to specific specifications as per the government contract with S&W. This pistol was manufactured as a FBI/POLICE issued S&W 1076 10MM. This S&W 1076 was issued to the Virginia State Police. The pistol was returned to S&W for post production updates. All updates were performed by S&W technicians. S&W has documentation of all updates on file. Has 2 dots stamped under the decocker lever. Has the latest updated trigger play spring. Has a U stamped on the bottom of trigger guard. Has an O & P stamped on the barrel. This is the latest barrel from S&W. Has a highly polished feed ramp. Has night sights. Has Palm Swell Grips. Has crosshatch checkering. Will fire with out magazine (unique feature for the FBI/POLICE issued pistols), and is labeled as such on the slide. Has the number 20543 embossed on the right side of frame grip (under the grip). Apparently placed there by the Virginia State Police. After the FBI and other Police departments, downgraded to the 40S&W (short&weak, and others), some of these pistols came available on the civilian market. Only 13,805 (civilian & Gov't models combined) S&W 1076's were ever produced. The Government (specific features as listed above) 1076's, are scarce. I just happened to be in the right place, at the right time to obtain this piece of handgun history. Only reason I'm selling the 1076 is too fund some other firearm interest.

I have only fired three rounds through the gun to zero the scope. I had ambitions to start hunting larger game but I only hunt small game and never used it. The gun has a black synthetic, skeletonized stock and Mossberg's proprietary Marinecote finish. The trigger is nice and crisp with no take up. It has a detachable 3 roundbox magazine. I am including 137 rounds of Federal Power Shock ammunition( 7 boxes minus the 3 rounds). I am also including a 3 x 9 scope and mounts."

It offers great stopping power in a small package that fits easily in your pocket, purse, or one of NAA's many holsters. The Guardian 380's design is based on NAA's best selling Guardian 32ACP, which was introduced in 1997. Over the years, NAA has made many subtle improvements to the design, based in part on the many suggestions they received from their customers. The result is an extremely high quality gun that's convenient, reliable, and very effective."
