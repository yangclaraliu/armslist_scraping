$450 firm in cash.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland/Mesquite area or will ship for $40 more in TX.  Since this is classified as a pistol it has to go UPS Overnight, I will require payment up front, of course(I've been a paid member since 2009), and copy of your FFL's license before shipping.  Thanks for looking!"

So much so, Gerber Legendary Blades uses it in their logo. First introduced by Gerber in 1966, and advertised directly to our troops in Vietnam, the Mark II quickly became a runaway best seller. When Gerber wanted to create a knife that would celebrate their 7 decades of knifemaking, a special Mark II fit the bill. To celebrate 70 years of American made cutlery, they have updated this classic pattern with one of the best knife steels on the planet: CPM-S30V. Gerber has combined the wasp-waisted blade with the most sought after of all Mark II handles - the grey ""cat's tongue"" grip. This finish is created by a proprietary process applying stainless steel particles to the die cast aluminum handle. In the hand it feels much like fine sandpaper, and the result is a grip that is not only non-slip, but good looking and durable as well. The sheath is classic Mark II style, and made from black leather. Knowing full well that many of us will never carry such a beauty in the field Gerber has created a beautiful display box which will be included.Knife Weight: 7.8 oz. (221 g.)Sheath Weight: 2.4 oz.

It is made at the same factory that Beretta used to make their 92 back in the day. And by popular opinion (you can do the research yourself), this gun is considered to be better on every level than the Beretta 92.

I believe this was unfired until I purchased it and a lot from as an estate. I shot this firearm 3 times. I made a YouTube video I will post a link at bottom if it will let me. There's marks and one of the barrels where it looked like somebody had clamp vise grips down the barrel screw in so you can remove them for easy cleaning but two of them are kind of tight. The half-cock works good unless you pull the trigger the hammer will drop if pull trigger on half-cocked but hammer will not drop by just pushing on it when on half-cock. This gun is a lot of fun to shoot you loaded with .350 ball and patch. I shot this after repair on handle silver pair held up good this little thing has a bit of a kick.
