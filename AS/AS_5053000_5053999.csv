I will consider trades only if it's a good deal and the value is there, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.
Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

I love the feel of this pistol, but I'm not enamored with the trigger.  It's a light double action only, similar to the HK LEM trigger.  It was designed for law enforcement use as a carry pistol, with nothing to snag in a holster and a smooth constant action trigger.Ideally I'd like to trade this for a full size PX4 in 9mm with standard SA/DA trigger and a slide safety, or a Gen 3 Glock 19. I shot it for the first time a couple of weeks ago and it's very accurate. It's essentially brand new. but I finally found my way to Livermore to fire it since USI is closed - 20 rounds total through it. It's off list, and doesn't even appear on Beretta's website, because as mentioned above it's usually sold to law enforcement. It's designation is the Type C (constant action), also know as ""slick side"" because it has no external safety. The pistol comes with everything that it was sold with - case, doc, two mags, backstraps etc.If you don't have anything to trade but would like to buy it the purchase price is $650."

I purchased the kit from Ohio Ordinance Works in I think 2009. It is of course US made, sold to Israel, converted to 7.62x51 caliber, then sent back to the US, demilled and sold on the US market. It was sold to me as one of their ""A+"" or best quality kits. 

Most of the smaller parts are covered in cosmoline and packed in thick plastic bags. I did not open the bags for the pics for fear of losing something but I guarantee all the required parts are there. 

In addition to the bare kit, I have the following extras:
1) Two extra barrels, caliber 7.62x51, with rifling clean and sharp, with a few very small spots of very light rust. 
2) Trunion guard, stainless steel. 
3) Starter tabs, a total of 30. 
4) KMP trigger
5) Rivets, correct for the kit, made by Black Bear Mfg. 
6) Linking machine, made by Ohio Ordinance Works, dusty but brand new. 
7) Approximately 11,000 links, all new, Israeli made, will fit .30-06, 7.62X51, and 7.62X54R
8) Anti Aircraft sights, with mounting hardware specific to the 1919A4. Originally from a WWII German Machine gun. 
9) Emory Crankfire adapter for Browning 1919A4 machine gun. This is the 6 lobe version, no longer made after Mr. Emory died. 
10) Right side plate. Rivet hole pre started. ATF eventually ruled this as more than 80% and banned them but I got this before the ban so it is grandfathered in. 
11) Misc tools, including the wrench, timing gauge, bolt hold open, etc

The links are stored in eight ammo cans. Seven are 50 caliber ammo cans and there is one 7.62 ammo can also. 

Everything except the linking machine and the links is stored in a 1960's era German military surplus wooden storage box that fits everything like it was made for it. 

The Emory Crankfire adapter is designed to allow you to fire a semi auto BMG at a full auto rate legally. There are copies, but this is an ORIGINAL Emory Crankfire adapter. They apparently stopped making them when Mr. Emory passed away and sell (when you can find them) for over 1000 dollars. 

The boxes are somewhat dusty from storage but the contents are clean, dry, and rust free. 

Shipping is VERY expensive. At the least I suspect it would cost at least 200 dollars to ship everything in multiple boxes. You are welcome to come and pick it up if you like, or I can deliver a reasonable distance for a fee. Ideally I would like to meet you in a semi public place. I can sign a bill of sale if you like but it is not necessary. I live in North Carolina, about 30 miles east of Charlotte. 

My cost, incurred over the past 7 years, is 3885 dollars. I've tried to look up the replacement cost of everything today and it would be AT LEAST 5200 dollars. That's not including the cost of the Emory Crankfire adapter, as I could not find one available and am going by memory. 

I will entertain all serious offers, but DO NOT LOWBALL ME. I will sell separately, but obviously would prefer to sell everything together. 

I am selling this because I want to, not because I have to, well that and I realized how much it would cost me to shoot this thing!!

I will consider partial trades. I will consider anything but am interested in:
