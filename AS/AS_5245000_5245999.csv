But Shell size, along with powder charge load, purpose use waddings, primers, any size lead or steel shot as well as multiple crimpers and crimping styles depending  on the load, and is most conducive to your purpose, in whatever you could need or require,  all while being able to produce  shells very rapidly for yourself without having to worry about availability and at a much cheaper price.  Weather its for Home Defense or Trap/ Skeet shooting; This is hands down the best reloader I've ever come across.  It's mounted on a platform for stability and easy access to set up anywhere and it also has the option with this model of buying the automatic pneumatic loader, right now I just have it set up with the polished wood platform and oversized pull down bar.  It works great and has multiple features to change out the type of shell that you're wanting to reload and size along with powder load. I have extra  bags of high end Waddings, several powder charges die cases around 14 to 20 I believe, two charge bars different weights, primers, and around 50 pounds of lead BB's in 8 shot which lead makes it great for small bird and skeet but you can switch out to steel shop anytime you want. It also has extra charge bars powder casings and extra shell design crimpers. This model can be suited to change any type of shotgun shell that you would require the di presses that I have currently have are for 20 gauge. The the current setup now with the crimp presses in place result in better crimping then you find on new ammunition.  Super easy to use anyone can figure it out in a matter of secondsEXTRAS LEAD BAG OF BB'S 2 CHARGE BARS SEVERAL DIESBAGS OF WADDINGS PRIMERS EXTRA SHELL CRIMPERSOVERSIVED HANDLEMOUNTED SECURELY ON PINE BOARD (for convent use)20 GAUGE DIES Also has box stacker for easy loading boxes of shells  I'm willing to hear out trades on many items  just send them over  I'm willing to do trades straight across or Part cash part trade,  on my end of the deal or yours depending on what you have in mind Will trade for:  I'm willing to hear out trades on many items  just send them over  I'm willing to do trades straight across or Part cash part trade,  on my end of the deal or yours depending on what you have in mind"

$700 for the package or $520 without the CTC grips, I can put them on my 5"" model.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  Maybe the XDM 45 5.25"" Bitone model with good night sights, might consider the black model with good night sights and a little cash on top.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

Here's the story:The bike was running when I got it but had some serious oil leaks and was just dirty. I stripped it to the frame, cleaned parts, sanded and painted the frame, and replaced multiple parts. I put it back together and now it will not start and I can't figure out why and I'm leaving for school soon. It cranks freely, and even starts on a warm day with starter fluid and full choke. It will rev and idle fairly well, but if you turn it off and let it cool, it's the same story. Here's what I have done:-cleaned and replaced gaskets and orings for both carbs-replaced oil pan gasket-replaced and set ignition points and condenser-replaced battery-replaced spark plugs-replaced various orings and gaskets around the cylinders-replaced missing gas cap and removed most of the rust inside the tankNow for the bad: -still leaks a little bit of oil around left cylinder head when running-leaks a minor amount of gas on left petcock-left exhaust burns oil when running-some wiring problems (turn signals don't work. may just be the bulbs though)-Exhaust pipes have lots of rust-tank has multiple dents and scratches.-headlight doesnt really fit in the headlight housing (is either missing parts or or is the wrong headlight)-forks need oil-and of course the big one is that is does not startIt has good compression, spark, and the timing should be close enough to start. My suspicion is that not enough fuel is getting to the engine. Now I know you're probably offended that I want $1800 for its current condition, but these are hard to find and getting increasingly popular, especially with the cafe racer crowd. I'd be willing to trade for another motorcycle as well."

This is the Standard Model M1A with 20” GI barrel dropped into the Sage EBR Mod 0 stock. This is the rock solid setup that the U.S Military used to repurpose many of the M14 rifles that were in storage and bring them up to a modern platform with increased accuracy.This M1A EBR features an adjustable stock and adjustable cheekpiece, pistol grip, and plenty of picatinny rail space for added gear. Included with the stock is the Sage Detachable Cantilever Sight Base (DCSB) that provides an absolute rock steady solution for mounting a scope to the rifle. (The scope pictured is also included with the sale). The attached scope is a Nikon Monarch 3 4x-16x BDC reticle and has been sighted in at 100 yards.A few internal upgrades to the rifle were also added such as a Sadlak Op Rod Spring Guide and a SEI Muzzle Brake. The combination of the muzzle brake and the EBR stock produces almost no felt recoil and allows for very quick follow up shots. This rifle is very accurate, typically producing 1 MOA goups, and has been my favorite hog hunting rifle. However I am now looking to sell it for my next project.

Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest! The main handguns page, the Classic Custom features the following:  5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy. Weight: approximately 40 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted. 25 LPI checkering on forestrap and mainspring housing. Special mirror finished slide, with 50 LPI serrations on back of slide to match serrated adjustable sight, top of slide is flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI. Traditional ""square cut"" cocking serrations on rear of slide only. Adjustable rear sight buried deep into slide, cross dovetail front sight. Two-piece guide rod for smoother cycling and easier disassembly. Mag catch with Oversize 40 LPI checkered button."
