This is Crye Precision's ballistic lightweight helmet offering passive cooling through the two-piece shell design. This helmet was purchased from Tactical Night Vision Company (www.tnvc.com) in February last year for a deployment, and did not end up being used or transported. It is in like-new condition and includes the original manual.It came standard with and includes genuine Crye Arc rails with bungees, Ops-Core H-nape harness/chin strap, and the Crye velcro kit for the AirFrame has been applied to the helmet, for use with IR strobes, counterweights, and patches. The chin strap includes a black fleece cover (removable) for comfort or going over your sweet tacticool beard. Two of the Crye ""hit pads"" were replaced, one with a standard USGI 3/4"" pad in the rear, and one with a sweat-blocking, wraparound style pad in the front. The Wilcox shroud on the front of the helmet fits into the three-hole pattern that the AirFrame is drilled with at the factory, but could be mounted on another helmet with a single hole, since the shroud has four holes and is designed to work in this way. The shroud is designed to interface with other Wilcox night vision mounts and arms and includes a self-retracting retention lanyard.The AirFrame exceeds the fragmentation rating of the ACH/MICH and weighs 20% less, and keeps the wearer much cooler and is more comfortable. The AirFrame is currently issued to Tier 1 Special Operations Forces and has seen extensive action down range. Its awesome features combined with its increased ballistic coverage and weight savings make it ideal.NO international shipping, not for export. Buyer must conform and agree to the same guidelines as in the ""Waiver & Export Restrictions 2013"" terms of sale document by TNVC."

As the first pistol equipped with a firing pin lock, the P99 AS combines the advantages of the traditional Double Action System with Single Action Anti-Stress trigger. The P99 provides the shooter with a user-friendliness previously found only in hammer fired pistols. The anti-stress trigger makes the P99 one of the world's safest firearms by preventing unintentional ""reflex"" firing in stressful situations. The decisive innovation: When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot, not only in the double action trigger mode, but also in the single action mode. The trigger travel is .551"" long in the anti-stress mode (at 4.4 lbs. trigger force), preventing inadvertent firing. On all subsequent shots, the trigger travel is reduced to .314"" (at the same trigger force) and this permits firing in rapid sequence, due to the quick reset of the P99 trigger. The P99 AS is equipped with a decocking button to safely decock the striker. It acts as an automatic safety and is integrated directly into the slide to prevent snagging on clothing even if the gun is drawn quickly.

(100 levels of output!) * Piston Drive (PD) design makes the light more compact than lights with traditional clicky switches. * Switch reliability is greatly increased over traditional switches. * Electronically controlled switching - no spark generated from the piston contact since the microprocessor switches on the light AFTER the piston makes contact. This eliminates the risk of explosion in a flammable environment! * Electric current passes through the piston on the INSIDE of the light. No current is passed through the outside shell, which is hard-coat anodized. * When the light is off, the microprocessor draws very, very little power - between 0.1-0.4ma (0.2ma typical). For example, one 2000mah cell would last about 416 days! * Instant access minimum & maximum brightness - very simple user interface. * Extremely compact size and lightweight suitable for Every Day Carry (EDC). * As with all NiteCore products, they use tough, imported 7075 military-grade aluminum! * Mil-Spec Type III Hard Anodized finish - no bare aluminum exposed, making it more durable. * Aggressive knurling over most of the surface - maximizes grip. * Resistant to impact from dropping in accordance with US MIL-STD-810F. * Waterproof to IPX-8 standard. * Broad-voltage fully regulated circuit, compatible with standard primary batteries as well as protected li-ion cells * Uses a highly efficient Cree R2 LED lamp. * 145 lumens at maximum output. * Extended runtime on low (3-5 lumens) * Metal reflector with optical grade coating. * Impact-resistant optical lens with anti-reflective coating on both sides * Able to tail-stand to act as a candle."

Another great Colt DCF has for sale that is in pristine condition. Colt Python 4” Royal Blue with Colt rubber grips manufactured in 1978. This Colt is in mint condition and as close as 100% as you can get. This is a true collector Python as Colt did not manufacture many in this design. This beautiful Python comes in original box with all paperwork but the end flaps are missing. We usually only deal with Pythons with original box with end flap attached, but this Python was in such 100% mint condition we could not pass on this wonderful revolver. If the end flaps were attached on this origimal box, thsi Python would be priced $600-800 more. It does not get any better than this Python if you are looking for a royal blue Python with these factory pachmayr with Colt emblem. It would be impossible to improve upon this Pythons condition and this Python has about faint of a turnline as you can get on a Python with it being so faint you can barely see it. This Python is as close as it gets to new. The finish is so dark and so amazing, it was very difficult to capture the sheer beauty in this Colt so if you do purchase it, all you will say is WOW when you open the box and have your first look at this Python. Please let us know if you would like any other pictures of any part of the Python to review as it is that good. Step back into 1978 and buy a new Python and be the envy of all of your friends and display this amazing Python at the top of your collection. Shipping is $25 to your FFL.

Now available in 4-12x40 with BDC 600 reticle, the new P-223 makes any AR rifle more effective at longer ranges. The P-223 4-12x40 comes in matte finish and is built with Fully Multicoated lenses. For the first time, one riflescope provides a choice between two different methods of bullet drop compensation. One way to compensate for bullet drop at long ranges is by using the BDC 600 reticle with open circle aiming points and hash marks from 100 to 600 yards. The BDC 600 reticle was developed specifically for the trajectory of the.223 Rem./5.56 NATO round with 55-grain polymer tip bullet and is most effective when used with Spot On Ballistic Match Technology. The other way to compensate for bullet drop is by using Nikon's Rapid Action Turret system that allows shooters to dial in their distances and hold the BDC reticle's horizontal crosshair directly on the target. Distances as far as 100 to 600 yards can be dialed in, making the Rapid Action Turret system a quick and easy option for long range shooting."

This system eliminates the venting of hot, carbon-laden gases into the receiver and bolt carrier group, thus eliminating the intensive cleaning regime of the legacy rifle. It also means the bolt carrier group and associated springs are not subjected to the searing heat of the tapped gasses, this being one of the major causes of small parts failure. This translates into carbines that are far more reliable than the legacy direct impingement carbines regardless of user maintenance. Another benefit of our short-stroke gas-piston system is the improved handling characteristics of our weapons over the direct impingement legacy weapons. Recoil is lighter and muzzle rise is greatly reduced. Amazingly, this is accomplished in a carbine that is ergonomically identical, weighs almost the same, and retains 80% parts commonality with the legacy direct impingement carbine.Standard Nicor-Treated Barral rated to 20,000 rounds. Length barrel is 16 in, with a 1/7 in twist (six lands, right twist) barrel with a ferritic nitrocarburized surface conversion which covers the barrel, inside and out, as well as the piston components. Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier for unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and permanent lubricityKey Additions: Inforce WML HSP (Weapon Mounted Light), 200 Lumen Output, 90 Minute Run Time, Momentary On Only Activation SwitchMagPod replaces the floor plate of the PMAG and turns the magazine into an effective monopod! It also functions well as an extended grip when pulling the magazine out from the pouch.B.A.D. LEVER® - BATTERY ASSIST DEVICE – AR15/M4: Designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch, the B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.Viking Tactics Sling: The VTAC Sling is instantly adjustable, allowing you to adjust shooting positions with ease.

That is the minimum for almost every suppressor. It is a Mid length gas with a .076 gas port. This is an amazing shooter and the only rounds through it were for testing the A5 system and also Car systems with different buffers. Exaclty 70 rounds through this barrel. Comes with DD gas block and tube. This is probably one of the best feeling/shooting barrels I have shot. It does run up to H3 on the Car system and A5H4 on the Vltor system with 5.56 ammo.

This pistol was so accurate, that it pushed my legendary SIG 210 9mm to the selling block several years ago. I don't shoot that much any more, so I just decided to see if some other gun enthusiast might be interested? I don't need to sell any of my guns, so my asking price will be my selling price. This gun is still like new and comes with everything that it came with from the Custom Shop when I ordered it. $1750 CASH or multiple pistol trades with “boot” or AK-47 variants with “boot.” Please no junk or anything that you can't sell already on your own.This gun is for the person that wants only the “BEST.” When ever I decide to sell one of my high end guns, I offer the following: Come take a look at my gun, and if you like it, I will give you up to 60 days to sell your gun or guns to come up with the remaining balance. I am a gun enthusiast and not a gun dealer or collector.The Pro-Tek I begins life as a CZ 75 Compact D PCR pistol. Once it is turned over to the custom shop in Mesa, Arizona the transformation begins! They completely de-horn the pistol. They replace the original rubber grips, and blend a set of textured aluminum grips into the frame, so that the fit of the grips is perfect. This lessens the width of the pistol from 1.34 inches in its original PCR configuration to 1.14 inches in the Pro-Tek I version. The slimmer grip frame seems to accentuate the curve of the back-strap as it melts into your hand.The slide is given an octagonal cut with a flat top, and this completely changes the lines of the pistol giving it a streamlined appearance. This pistol also has excellent three-dot night sights. The rear sight is a low profile wedge type, that is adjustable for elevation.The de-cocker has been cut back to make it less obtrusive without sacrificing its function or ease of manipulation by the shooter. CZ’s competition hammer is also installed on the Pro-Tek I model. The slide is given an anodized Bronze/Gold finish, and the aluminum frame is manufactured with a glossy polycoat finishAll of the controls (de-cocker, slide stop lever and magazine release) on the pistol are in easy reach of your right thumb. The magazine release button is slightly extended but smooth and de-burred; when it is activated the magazines fall free. The magazine well has been beveled to augment the process of recharging the pistol with a fresh magazine. All in all, there is very little they didn’t think of to attain their goal of making the Pro-Tek I the ultimate CCW pistol. This gun has the smoothest DA trigger pull that you will ever experience on any gun, and the SA trigger pull when cocked, breaks like my Custom Les Baer 1911.As wonderful as this pistol is to hold and look at, the best experience comes once you hit the shooting range. Whether you are shooting standard or +P loads the Pro-Tek I handles recoil beautifully. The grip frame spreads the recoil evenly across the web of your hand and between the textured grip panels and the beavertail the pistol stays centered in your grasp. Between the recoil handling aspects of the pistol and the short reset trigger, it sure makes for easier and accurate follow-up shots.As far as accuracy goes, if you like all of your rounds to produce one gapping hole in the target then you will like firing the Pro-Tek I.Take a look at the factory supplied test target."
