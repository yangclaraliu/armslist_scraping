Quality holographic optic. The price is $425 FIRM (for those of you unsure of what this means, it means I'm not willing to negotiate the price) and I AM NOT interested in trades (this means cash only). For those interested please feel free to text REDACTED.The following description is from EOTech's website: The XPS2 is the shortest, smallest and lightest EOTech model holographic weapon sight available without night vision. Its size and weight make it convenient for hunters and law enforcement*** officers to carry.It is also fast and runs on a single 123 battery. The compact, single-lithium-battery configuration leaves more rail space than ever for rear iron sights or magnifiers.This sight has the same body style as the XPS3™ model, but the XPS2 does not have night vision-compatibility.***Disclaimer: Due to the recent information that has come to light about some EOTechs having issues with POI shifts due to extreme temperatures- I WOULD NOT recommend that LEOs use this optic on their duty weapon. However, this optic has performed flawlessly on my AR at both indoor and outdoor sport ranges, and could be a quality optic on a gun used for recreation or hunting."

I got this gun on a trade a few weeks ago by a fella on here who knows his fireamrs. we traded straight up which i have no regrets. However as nice of a handgun that this is i am not a big fan of full size handguns. i am offering this on a trade for something practically. ONLY .22lr i am interested in would be a markIII or a buckmark model to lug around while i am running squirrel dogs. also interested in an AR10 or parts towards a build, BULK .40 or 5.56 ammunition bulk reloading powder for 5.56, a heavy barreled ar15. all assault rifles considered. depends on caliber. if you got something you think i may be interested or you want to make a cash offer ill entertain it. worst i can say is no. well, i could say a whole lot worst than that but i wont!!! Has a hard case and 2 wilson combat mags. Also i will add some brass and a set a dies if someone is interested in them. I have no problems keeping. Please dont lowball me with some bogus trades or offer to meet me or trade and then fall of the face of the earth!! INDICT HRC!!"

There is no real damage to this gun, only finish wear. If you were to refinish the slide or send it into Glock and have the slide refinished, the gun would look near new. The frame is in excellent condition. All internals including barrel are excellent as well. It has a polished barrel, grip plug, extended slide lock, steel guide rod, subtle Punisher slide plate, and a Ghost disconnector. All other parts are factory glock. The friction surfaces have been highly polished and this gun has what I consider to be a great Glock trigger. It's a real shooter, never malfunctions, and is very accurate."

Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol? The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S® is the first and only single-stack XD® from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 or 4.0 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it, and pretty soon you’ll forget it’s even there. The XD-S® Single Stack consistently astonishes and delights shooters on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The trigger on the XD-S® Single Stack feels more like it belongs on a target pistol than a carry piece. Shooters who are used to difficult, heavy triggers on deep concealment pistols will be astounded at the smooth, crisp XD-S® Single Stack trigger. Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."

When these first came out, Sig Sauer was sued by LWRC for patent infringement over their bolt carrier group which was very similar to that of the LWRC. I bought this rifle before I was exactly sure what I was looking for, other than a first generation. I later found the perfect one but decided to hang onto this until I had reason enough to part with it. I believe the first generations to be superior to the Genration 2, but that is most likely because of the torture test when they were initially produced and the design of the bolt carrier group. Round count is about 550, only fired Federal ammo through it.I am also willing to sell just complete upper assembly for $700.Pictures up this weekend."

The Classic SWAT is a semi automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m."
