1,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5166001,For Sale:  Own the last civilian supply of Spec Forces Bullets Globally,"NW Suburbs, Illinois, United States",$ 250,"Listed On: Saturday, February 13, 2016",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"How would you like to own the rarest, most restricted ammunition in the United States? A firm known as Accutec USA designed a very specific bullet for special forces, air marshals and government operators approximately 15 years ago. This product was known as the RRLP Ultra-Frangible bullet. It was designed for operators to achieve several goals: To be manufactured in all common calibers for special forces and operators in both rifle, submachine gun and pistol configurations. That it be non-toxic and contain no lead That it have proprietary coatings (patented) to reduce or eliminate barrel fouling That it penetrate effectively against threats That it frange to an individual fragment size no larger than 3 grains That it prevent lethal “backsplatter” ricochet to the operator at 5 feet distance That it is certified by the FBI ballistics lab for its intended purpose with gel tests That it be capable of being loaded in supersonic or subsonic configurations as deemed necessary by the engagement. The net result of these efforts was the creation of a marvelous ammunition. It appears Accutec’s business model was to sell to the government agencies directly and rumor has it that they made an agreement with their distribution partners at the behest of the government to never sell these products to civilians. This was likely done to keep the patented technologies from being reverse engineered by competitors or foreign nations. I wish to emphasize that there is no legal barrier to owning these bullets in the USA other than that there was no means to acquire them as the manufacturer never wanted them sold to the public. Things changed for Accutec as they decided to change their business model. Instead of manufacturing bullets, now you pay them a licensing fee as a nation-state and they provide the formula and design information under license to you so that places like Federal and Lake City can manufacture their technology for your operators and special forces teams for a set period of time or quantity. So in effect, Accutec stopped making bullets so there is no more supply outside the hands of their licensees that will NEVER let the product enter the hands of the general public. Around 2001 Accutec signed agreements with one US distributor that subsequently had a small pallet of these bullets available for their government clientele. That firm went out of business about 3 years ago. When 5/3 bank took management of the distributor they became the primary creditor and liquidated all remaining inventory. I personally acquired all the Accutec inventory and since I did not sign any agreements or consent to any restrictions on sale, Accutec and their designees have no control over how I sell or market the remaining inventory. Things went along swimmingly and I sold Accutec bullets for a year at a reasonable cost of $1.60 per projectile in most of the common calibers like .40 S&W, 9mm, 5.56mm and .38/.357. I also was selling them through retailers in the USA. Some of the clients that purchased the product included instructors for several well known US S.W.A.T teams and government operators. Then things went sideways: My suppliers were threatened with a lawsuit by the owners of AccuTec USA which caused us all to take pause, obtain legal advice and proceed accordingly. After much discussion with legal counsel we decided that the threat was baseless and that we were 100% confident that we had the legitimate right to do whatever we wish with the sale of Accutec ammunition as we are not bound by any agreements with Accutec. In the end we were right and we secured a release from AccuTec’s legal counsel, Nexsen Pruet LLC Intellectual Property Attorneys. Accordingly, we are now ready to sell of the last remaining civilian accessible stock of Accutec bullets available anywhere in the world. When this supply is gone, it will only be in the hands of government agencies and foreign powers that have signed agreements with the manufacturer. We have remaining: 5.56mm 87gr Projectiles .40 caliber / 10mm 180gr Projectiles .45 caliber 230gr Projectiles 9mm 124gr Projectiles The packages of the above are sold in bulk plastic bags that range in size from 250 count to 500 count packages. The pricing is as follows: .40, .45 and 9mm @ $0.40 per projectile plus freight. (and they are heavy, so minimum freight charge is $30.00) 5.56mm @ $0.80 per projectile plus freight. (and they are heavy, so minimum freight charge is $30.00) ***Note, I have only 6000 pieces left of 5.56mm so preference will be given to the larger order of this very rare commodity*** Each order will include a copy of the letter from Accutec’s attorney’s stating that they are legitimate product of Accutec. By purchasing these bullets you acknowledge that loading ammunition requires proper training and that you are solely responsible for the safe assembly of loaded ammunition and that you hold me harmless in all ways for this purchase and use of product. You also attest you are lawfully eligible to own reloading components and bullets in your jurisdiction.

So I originally paid $300 for this rifle a while ago. Without 7% sales tax included in the price. So I've added an extended mag release by the trigger guard and it has a base 10 rd mag included, but also includes the ruger bx25 mag I purchased and a soft gun case. Also included is a bulk ammo federal match grade ammo. You get all this and no sales tax for a flat $300. So if your you looking for a like new ruger 10/22 that looks good, is more accurate, and comes with extras this is probly the best deal you will find on here' only selling cause I need the cash.

(It is NOT the Thunder model, so yes it costs a little bit more but it's better thank the Thunder models because it's not picky with ammo meaning NO FTL, NO FTF, NO FTE, it has a lighter and shorter trigger, and it does have the factory Hogue-style rubber grip which is much better than what the Thunder models have. Therefore, price is firm.Very accurate and fun and cheap to shoot. Very light and short trigger. Includes 1 10rd magazine. Will ship to your FFL for $40. Local buyers will also receive 2 boxes of ammo. Trade options for local buyers."
