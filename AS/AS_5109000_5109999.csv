Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform.

The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally.

The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness.

The first group was noteworthy, but subsequent efforts were less satisfactory. I have owned and shot 44 magnums since 1965 and today it dawned on me, sadly, that it's about time for me to cut back a little. The recoil was getting to me.So, I have for sale a beautiful Smith and Wesson Model 629-3 Classic Hunter. The 629-3 Classic Hunter was a limited issue run of 2000 guns produced 1991. It is distinguished by the full lug under the barrel, a non-fluted cylinder and target hammer/trigger group. A Smith & Wesson expert will tell you that the -3 and -4 models are the most desired by model 629 shooters. They came along late enough in the series to have all the durability modifications that Smith came up with and were early enough to have none of the cast parts that tainted later models.This revolver also has a non-standard Patridge target front sight and semi-antique grips from a 1970 Smith & Wesson 44 magnum. The buyer will get the original sight and grips as well.I would really prefer to trade this gun for a 4 inch Smith & Wesson or Ruger single action revolver in 357 or 45. I might be interested in something else so try me, but I have all the autos I need and I'm not all interested in junk.The cash price is $900 and it is firm."

This was a package gun but the included scope wasn't very good, so I added a one-piece scope rail, new rings, and a very clear Vortex Crossfire II 3-9x40 with Dead Hold BDC reticle. It also has a Karsten adjustable comb w/ low profile hardware so you can be sure you have a perfect cheek weld every time. I notched it so you can remove the bolt for cleaning without having to lower the cheek riser. Included is a Picatinny rail adapter for the sling mount so you can run a rail-mounted bipod and a sling at the same time - is 100% removable, just mounts to the factory sling mount. She's a solid MOA shooter and prefers 150 & 180gr Federal ammunition. This is about as light and compact as you can get without sacrificing knockdown power. Makes a great mountain gun and is perfect for deer & elk. I'm only selling to make room for a custom LR build - can't bring myself to dismantle this rifle, especially after the camo paintjob. It needs to find a good home. Asking 550. Buyer pays transfer fees. Will trade for a long action Savage or 700 receiver + cash."

I purchased this rifle a year ago, put a Nightforce scope and a Geissele trigger on it and was able to shoot right at 1"" at 100 yards. This rifle is a shooter, with a spotter and Match Grade ammo, was able to hit a 19x24 inch steel plate at 1k yards. Not every time but maybe one out of every 5 shots. This is incredible since it only has a 16"" barrel. That was with 168gr SMK's, I know I could do better with 175 SMK's. I am selling it to purchase a true 1k yard rifle, if I could afford to own both I would. I shoot more for accuracy, not running and gunning so this rifle has been babied, has approximately 200 rounds of match grade ammo through it.

Currently it has a low impulse locking piece in it meaning I generally keep the ammo I run in it subsonic. For hotter ammo it would need a high impulse locking piece which are pretty readily available. The barrel extension is pinned over a 3 lug barrel. I have also changed out the trigger group with a clipped and pinned 3 position that is semi auto only. The bolt hold open works very well on it also.The finish on it does have some wear (pictures below) on it in certain places but generally it is pretty good looking.It has been a great rifle and functions very well.

Very reliable. It comes with one 10rd magazine(Ammo Not Included) Open to offers but the price is firm. Not in a rush to sell. Just tired of it collecting dust in the safe. Bought brand new so only one owner. Buyer must have CHP or PPP upon purchase. Not traveling too far. Thanks in advance!

I refinished the stock it had such a beautiful wood grain i didnt even color it i just used a golden sealer giving it a beautiful blonde color. the bolt is smooth and has been lightly polished no sticky bolt on this beauty. I have many man hours into this rifle and have fairly priced this rifle at $300. this is a great example of what a mosin can become.
