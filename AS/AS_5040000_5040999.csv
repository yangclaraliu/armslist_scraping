It had the triangle barrel and that was removed. The barrel now is basically a stock raw barrel that has had zero material removed except for being threaded on the end for the break. The stock was then machined out to except the new barrel.The gun was cryogenically treated shortly there after and then coated properly.I had this made simply because I could and I wanted something to play around with long distance wise, nothing serious. It shoots well and I have not gotten to see it's full capabilities. Sighted in first with a VX ii scope and then sighted in with a NC star scope. Both did very well out to 450 yards and that's where I've stopped. Total of 120 rounds.I am by no means a pro and I personally do not consider this a professional long range rifle. It is however, good enough to impress and also give you smile. This gun is heavy, you can watch prairie dogs blow up through the scope because it doesn't move much. Unloaded it is 25lbs It will be sold with no optics and no bi pod.Does come with three mags and all the 308 brass that I have plus a couple boxes of factory Federal."

The cobra grip is made from advanced polymer which is very strong and will definitely take a beating. The shooter can use different grip techniques and allows the user to have a secure and comfortable grip in any situation or position. It features a ridged front face that allows you to brace the rifle against a table or a wall and because it is ridged, it will prevent any sliding during the recoil kick. Another unique feature is the Cobra “hood”. It acts like a heat shield that will prevent the heat from going to your hands and gives your lead hand an ergonomic platform to use. The rear portion of the Cobra Grip can function as a hand stop. One advantage that the SI Cobra Grip has over its competitors is the friction lock design. Material has been removed from the center so when tightening the Main Screw, it will allow it to grip the rail system and thus preventing any wobbling due to lose fitment or over use of the grip. The Strike industries Cobra grip is slim and low profile which makes it very light weight. Shooters from all walks of life and different size hands can use the Strike Industries Cobra Grip without worrying if the grip is too big or the angle would be too aggressive that it would strain your hand. It is very ergonomic and economical. PayPal: For PayPal transactions please send us your PayPal email address and we will send you an invoice for the products you would like to purchase.

This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO’s “Over the Beach” test.

A 16” Nitride treated barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating aluminum forend. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up iron sights.
