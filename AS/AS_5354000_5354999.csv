With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ 75 B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well. CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.  All steel construction (except alloy framed compacts) High capacity double column magazines Hammer forged barrels Ergonomic grip and controls Unparalleled accuracy Slide-in-frame design for better recoil control 3 dot sighting system (Tritium night sights available) Smooth double action and crisp single action Extended service life due to advanced design and superior materials Firing pin block safety  Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols."

This safe is in excellent condition but is too large to make the turn in the stairs to my basement (just moved). So, my loss is your gain. This safe is big, 36"" wide, 60"" tall and 25"" deep exterior measurements. Weight is 640 pounds and the fire rating is 45 minutes. When I bought this safe Liberty still used the nice gloss paint on the exterior, current Classic safes have a textured exterior which is not as nice in my opinion. Since I bought it at Cabela's it has the large ""Cabela's"" label on the door. This safe has the S&G Low Profile Titan E-Lock for quick opening and the combination can be set by you.

That is not a stock photo, but one I took of the actual gun you will be buying, after playing with it in PowerPoint. I am selling it for less than you can buy them for at the cheapest online price you will find. Look up pricing, add in transfer fee, background check and taxes and you will see what a good deal this is on a new CZ.Comes in the original hard/foam lined case, with papers, lock and cleaning kit. 2 factory 10 round magazines are also included as well as some ammo to get you started. $525 Firm OR trades in full/partial with cash. This is a lot less than you can buy online once you also include the taxes, background and transfer fee costs. Sorry, but I'm not interested in rifles (unless really cool) or offers of less than $525. I will only sell to someone who is legal to own. You must be of legal age, not a felon, a Florida resident and show ID to prove it. Private sale with face to face transaction only (Will not ship). You must meet me in Orlando. Thanks!"

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system and is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.The KRISS Vector SDP is the Non-NFA semi-automatic pistol variant of the KRISS Vector platform. It features a short, threaded, 5.5"" barrel. A rear quick detach sling point assists with carrying the firearm. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector SDP are the Magpul MBUS sights, full length picatinny top rail and a Glock Magazine. Although this SDP maybe small, it still has the same capabilities as its larger counterparts and is civilian legal in most states.Operating System: Closed bolt, delayed-blowback patented KSV SystemCaliber: 45 ACPOverall Length: 16.75 in / 425 mmOverall Height: 6.8 in / 175 mmBarrel Length: 5.5 in / 140 mmWeight (unloaded): 5.9 lbs / 2.7 kgFrame Material: Advanced Metal Components/Advanced Polymer CompositeMagazine: G21 13rds/ KRISS MagEx 25      WAS $1429.99 NOW $1349.99 WILL SHIP EMAIL OR CALL WILL SHIP EMAIL OR CALL 314-252-0GUN WE ARE NOW OPEN COME SEE US TUES-FRI 10AM-6PM, SAT 10AM-4PM LOCATED AT 2745 HIGH RIDGE BLVD SUITE 6 HIGH RIDGE, MO 63049.

What you see in the pictures is what you get (Rail, crush washers, allen wrenches, 2 extra screws, 6 each 8-slot rails attached.) Pictures are of the actual item. If you would like more photos, email me and I'll send you some. This is an 8-sided rail with the top rail being integrated. The 6 other partial rails (attached) are removable and can be place elsewhere along the KeyMod rail. FREE FLOAT HANDGUARD --Hard Coat Anodized Aluminum --Ultra Light and Robust Design --1913 Continuous Top Rail --Innovative Keymod Modular Direct Attachment System --Steel Barrel Nut Includes: --Handguard --Barrel Nut --Mounting Screws --6 each, 8-slot rails (attached) --2 Allen wrenches --2 extra screws --2 crush washers BARREL NUT WEIGHT: 2 oz. TOTAL WEIGHT: less than 21 oz. with 6 each 8-slot rails attached Available in Black This hand guard was designed with the goal of being the lightest and smallest free floating hand guard option. The width of this hand guard before accessories have been installed is only 1.5"". This handguard is 15” in length. Box is cut/torn/crushed/taped, but does not affect the rail. The rail is NEW.The KeyMod system offers a mounting platform for a variety of (future) accessories and components. The days of the Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) are numbered. The future of the direct mountable accessory is here and now. The KeyMod self-contained components/mounting hardware index and V-block onto the platform, achieving a secured and accurate hold to the system, while separate lugs take the recoil force off the fasteners. The pass through attachment method eliminates the need for loose screws and backing plates that can easily be lost, or difficult to install. Another advantage of the KeyMod system over the 1913 system is the direct attach eliminates the need for the 1913 system as a ""middle Man"" thereby reducing weight and accessory off-set from the center of the handguard."

I will explain what all is included as well as the costs.S&W Model 642 Chambered in 38 Special +P (Can shoot standard 38 Special OR 38 Special +P). You can pretty much say it is brand new as very few rounds through it. Not a scratch, smudge or smear on it other than light roll marks on the cylinder. LOOKS BRAND NEW! This gun shoots VERY WELL! It is possibly the lightest revolver I've ever held. It is constructed of a stainless steel alloy. The hammer is internal, making for a snag free carry weapon. Gets in and out of your pocket or holster smoothly/quickly.It comes with the original box, paperwork, lock and first round fired. Also included is a brand new, never opened Hogue ""Tamer"" grip. The grip is designed to absorb recoil for those who want it to shoot softer. Also, a Wolff spring kit. I've already installed one, but there are a few more in the kit, as well as the original. The spring kit has reduced the trigger pull by a few pounds and a noticeable reduction in stacking. Makes for better target groupings! Again, you can play around with the remaining springs (takes 5 mins to install) to see what fits you best. I will also include the Desantis pocket holster as shown in the picture. This holster makes the gun dissapear in your pocket, imprinting as if you are carrying a cell phone. Lastly, I will include 100 rounds of ammo. 5 rounds of defense (+P hollow point) and 95 rounds of FMJ (round nose).OK, here's what everything cost me so you can understand how much you are saving: Gun $420, Wolff Spring Kit $9, Desantis Holster $22, Hogue Grip $22 and approx $30 of ammo. Total is $503. That is BEFORE taxes, shipping, background check and transfer fee ($75 for this, bringing total to $578).I will sell it for the price of the gun alone. So first person with $420 takes it! Please do not offer less than $420 as I'm already as low as I'll go (read costs above). May consider trades in full, or partial trades with cash from you. Not interested in trading up, not into rifles. Face to face private sale in Orlando only. I will not ship. You must be of legal age to own, you must not be a felon and you must be a Florida resident with Drivers License to show me. Thanks for looking!Text is preferable, or respond through AL.

The multi-configurable M1 variant of the AUG A3 platform is the latest generation of the venerated bullpup platform. Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver. The AUG A3 M1 boasts am overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions. The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger. The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire. The AUG A3 M1 stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic and are available in Black, Green, Mud and White colors. The rifle is available in either the standard version that accepts genuine Steyr AUG magazines or as a NATO version that accepts standard STANAG (AR) magazines.  - See more at: https://steyrarms.com/firearms/sporting-rifles/steyr-aug-a3-m1.html#sthash.1yGTjpmR.dpuf  Steyr AUG A3 M1, 5.56, 1.5x Optic, two magazines, MUD color.  Heckuva gun.  Barely used, 60 rounds shot.   https://youtu.be/E9zDTP0LZRwSorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this gun online at www.copsgunshop.net!"
