Self-loading pistol, blowback operation, miniature copy of Colt 1911 in .22 LR with grip safety. Identical to Llama III-A except for calibre.It is not a rare gun but not many .22s were imported into the U.S.  This one was old when I bought it back mid-late '90s at a gun show from a retired dealer, he got it from an old man who kept it in a nightstand for Thirty years or so. I cleaned it up and it functioned well, it was very accurate for several years until the extractor spring broke. It shoots but will not fully extract the shell. It needs a new spring behind the extractor before it will work again.Every thing else is fine, the finish is decent but it definitely shows its age, the grips are in great shape.again the extractor spring is broken and it needs to be fixed before this gun will function properly."

Your time is valuable and so is mine, so please include a # I can reach you at and I will respond quickly.

Great if you have a permit, but I personally think it more important that you know how to safely handle a firearm vs. seeing your permission slip from Big Brother to own one. They are not required for private sales in MN, but you will be required to sign a bill of sale stating that you are legally able to purchase and own a firearm and we will meet FTF for this transaction, no shipping. I am a former Army combat medic, can safely and legally handle firearms, and have done alot of private sales with people back on forth on here and various social sites through Facebook. My PTP expired shortly after I purchased this pistol and I haven't renewed it yet. If you require one to sell or trade, please keep that in mind before you offer me up a trade. Thanks much and stay warm! **Trades:** Always in the market for 9mm pistols.  Anything 1911 (plus cash on my end depending on pistol).

As such, it is a first generation model. Like many of its breed, it lacks the slide hold-open feature after the last round is fired which is common on early models of this manufacture. With its 4.5-inch barrel, the gun is 8.75-inches long overall, which makes it a fairly lengthy little popgun. There is a slide lock lever, that holds the slide closed (and is useful when field stripping), but nothing that will hold it open. The tall blade front sight is not adjustable but the rear target sight is drift-adjustable if needed, which it currently is not. These guns strip like a breeze. Simply remove the magazine, ensure the gun is unloaded, lock the slide, work the lever under the leading edge of the frame (just under the barrel) while sliding the barrel forward, then unlock the slide and push it off the full length guiderails the same direction. Reassembly is the same way. If you cannot strip this gun in under 20-seconds, you must not be trying. The magazine is a ten-round, single stack thin bit of steel that is held in by a heel-mounted latch rather than a push-button release. As a throwback to yesteryear, it came from HS finished in the same two-tone process that Colt used back in the 1900s that came from dipping a fully blued magazine body into a cyanide bath--which hardened the feed lips but also removed the bluing. (So note, that’s why old magazines often look like that). The gun values out in Fjestad and Peterson's guides at anywhere between $350-$450 depending on how you want to grade it. The cheapest (non-reserve) HS Sportking (thats not a Lightweight) on gunbroker right now is $350. With that in mind I will take $275 cash in the intrest of making a rapid sale."
