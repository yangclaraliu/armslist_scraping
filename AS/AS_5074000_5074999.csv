It's a 12 ga over and under, which comes with a browning hard case (Charles Daly's are similar to Brownings, this case is $200+ new).  It's got wood stock and forearm, with engraving on the action. The action works perfectly, I've never had a problem at all with the mechanics of the gun, and I've shot tens of thousands of rounds through it. I've had it for around 8 years, and shot competition for those 8 years. I sent the gun down to Briley in Texas, one of the best names in choke tubes, and had both barrels drilled and taped for choke tubes, and got extended 5 tubes for it: modified, 2 light modified (my favorite), improved cylinder, and skeet. They are lead only, as I never hunt with this shotgun. They are thin-wall choke tubes (what they put in when it didn't come drilled from the factory, so they don't have to take out a bunch of the metal in the barrel). To have this done, costed over 700 buck. I had it done by the best, and it was worth every penny. I had a kick ease installed on the gun and fitted to me by a profession gun stock carpenter, but several other people have shot it, and said it fit them great. The pad is awesome, not to sticky, not too smooth, and does a great job shock absorbing. As a competition shooter, I took very good care of it, took it apart and cleaned it almost every time I shot it, but it did have some issues when I got it. The forearm had a crack in it, which I had fixed by a professional gun stock carpenter, and he did a great job. You can tell close up, buries way better then a crack. And he fixed it GOOD, you won't have another problem with that crack. There's also some minor skuffs and scratches in the wood, and some minor sketches In the metal in unnoticeable spots, and if you look really closely in a spot or two, you can see where there used to be some super minor surface rust. Most people won't tell you all this, and so it sounds like it's all major stuff, but it's really not that noticeable."

Lot prices start at $48,500 for 38 acres and can be very negotiable for the right buyer (neighbor). Overhead or underground electric power is on some lots and can be brought in on lots where it is needed. Land is located on CR 44 (Big Hollow Road), 3 miles N/E of Lake Hattie, 6 miles east from National Forest and just east of Wild Horse Ranch. This land is ideal for those who want to park an RV or build a cabin and enjoy beautiful vistas with very few man made objects within miles. Personally, we are using it for a bug out when the SHTF along with being a nice retreat to target shoot and enjoy the solitude. We would be particularly interested in having like-minded neighbors that would appreciate a place to stock up and feel secure if/when the SHTF. We can build a cabin onsite using classic log building techniques .. our prototype cabin built last summer is shown in the pictures. We also have a sawmill and logs onsite, along with general construction equipment to get your property easily and economically usable for your particular needs. Please note that drilling for water is a hit and miss ordeal in this area, but you can easily haul your own water just like most everybody else living west of Laramie.  The City of Laramie also has two high volume water dispensing depots designed for rural residents. One depot is in Laramie and the other depot is at the water treatment plant which is 10 miles from the property. Bottom line is, hauling water and a cistern holding tank is far more economical and feasible for a getaway cabin. Water well, casing and pump is estimated to be around $20K and that buys a lot of water at $.25/100 gallons at the depots.I am a licensed civil engineer and have lived in Laramie 30 years. I have a local Laramie phone number and address. If interested, shoot me an email and include your phone number so we can talk about being neighbors. All pictures, with the exception of the ""big valley"" picture, are of the actual property available. The dirt road picture is of the private road that runs through the middle of the development. I look forward to hearing from you!"
