My mother has just been laid off and I've been forced to move in with her to help her with the mortgage, things around the house, and bills. To make the move easier, to help pay for the move and to help my mother with her bills, I'm being forced to sell this. This totally sucks even more because I just paid a moving company $250 to move this safe into the house I have just moved into. This is a Liberty Gun Safe, Tactical 24. I purchased this years ago and is in excellent condition. I have all the paper work, transferable life time warranty. This is American made, not a Chinese Stack-On. It comes with all the shelves, trays, hooks, and rifle rests. It has the black and anodized red 4 bar turn wheel, not like the new just cheaper plain latch. This has the electric key pad by S&G, not a standard combination dial. I paid $1159, for this. It also comes with a rechargeable dehumidifier, every few months you throw it in the oven to recharge it and throw it back in the safe.

I have extra  bags of high end Waddings, several powder charges die cases around 14 to 20 I believe, two charge bars different weights, primers, and around 50 pounds of lead BB's in 8 shot which lead makes it great for small bird and skeet but you can switch out to steel shop anytime you want. It also has extra charge bars powder casings and extra shell design crimpers. This model can be suited to change any type of shotgun shell that you would require the di presses that I have currently have are for 20 gauge.

Ive spent 6 mths looking for a G"" serial code g19 because during research this was the best year of the glock 19 reliability wise, steel locking block, no MIM parts, no FTF or BTF problemsI obtained a beautiful example that only had 1000rd or so through it. I sent the slide off to MoD1 customs to have front cocking serrations and the entire top angle serrated, for better purchase racking the slide, MoD1 installed the 10-8 rear sight and a fiber optic front which I changed to Trijicon HD yellow front. They then cerakote'd it in Magpul OD green, I then sent the frame off to Robar for their medium texture and undercut trigger guard, which is very aggressive, I put rubber talon grips on it so to carry IWB sometimes. I got this back several months ago and never carried it and it is also unfired since the work. Save yourself a lot of time money and effort into building one of these. My loss is your gain. It has stock internals, the stock barrel now and smooth g17 trigger as to keep it as reliable as possible, vickers slide release and mag release, Also a Spartan helmet backing plate, stainless steel pins ....no light spring bs or anything on it. Like I said no wear on the gun except some smiles on the barrel"
