A French MAS MLE 1949-56 rifle in original 7.5 mm (it's listed as 7.62 NATO due to that being the closest option available). It includes many of the accessories that most others for sale don't include and are pricey as well as quite hard to come by. It has the original 'night sight' tube that slides over the end of the barrel, original sling with original cleaning kit and fully functional, adjustable sights as well as the flip up grenade launcher sights.Here's a little bit of info about this rifle's history:The predecessor rifle was the French MAS-49; it was formally adopted by the French Army in July 1949. An improved version of the MAS-49 was the MAS-49/56; it was introduced in 1957 and incorporated lessons learned from service in Algeria, Indochina, and the Suez Crisis. The rifle was shortened and lightened to improve mobility for mechanized and airborne troops, and a knife bayonet was added. The MAS-49 built-in rifle grenade launcher was replaced by a combination compensator/rifle grenade launcher that fired NATO-standard 22mm rifle grenades. The rifle also incorporates an integral grenade launching sight that is attached to the front sight block and a gas cutoff that prevents gas from entering the gas tube from the gas port when firing grenade launching blank ammunition.This rifle is chambered in the original 7.5 mm; many were re-chambered at import into .308 and are considered less desirable. Even though this is a very collectable rifle, it's a very fun weapon to shoot and will surprise you with how modern and well made it is. This rifle is in excellent overall condition. Tight action, clean barrel, and nice rifling. The stock in very good condition (see pictures). Again, weapon is in original 7.5 X 54 (French) or 7.5 mm, and also has the original barrel length at approximately 20.7"". 3 original 10 round magazines included. This is a unique opportunity to own a fairly rare rifle in excellent condition and all the accessories included. Here's a little info about this very capable, but often overlooked caliber:The 7.5x54mm French rifle round was originally adopted for the French infantry to replace the aging 8mm Lebel. The French learned many lessons from World War I, and realized the need to adopt a more modern cartridge. In 1929 the 7.5x54 ammo cartridge was adopted by the French military along with the Mas 36 rifle.The 7.5 French cartridge served during World War II in various bullet configurations including ball, tracer, and incendiary. The bullet weight varies from 139 grain to 181 grain with velocities generally ranging from 2,700 feet per second to 2,600 feet per second. Although this round is older in design, it does features some impressive ballistics, especially when considering the round is not typically a shoulder bruiser.The round is capable of being an effective hunting cartridge at intermediate ranges, and is quite capable against medium to medium large North American game. The cartridge is particularly popular with military surplus enthusiasts, but not for the MAS 36 rifle, but for the MAS 49. The Mas 49 is an interesting semi-automatic, post-war rifle. In short, the 7.5mm French cartridge is an excellent cartridge that was an excellent wartime round that often gets overlooked.Included in the package are: rifle, 3 original 10 round magazines, original 'night sight' tube and canvas storage bag, 2 original magazine pouches (each hold 2 magazines), original sling with original cleaning kit attached and about 45 rounds of ammo (10 rounds of quality 'FOM' non corrosive, 20 reloads + about 15 rounds of Turkish corrosive ammo). Ammo is available for this rifle and I can offer you my cost for more rounds if desired.Thank youtags: CETME, HK91, FN FAL, .308Will trade for:Feel free to ask any questions and offer any trades or cash + trade offers. I own an extensive collection of fine weapons and have worked at a gun shop before so please don't bother me by asking a ridiculous amount in trade for what you have.I can transfer this to your local FFL for the cost of shipping, no extra 'handling or shipping fees'."

Below is what will be required and what will be done. Price will be a flat $25 with free shipping back to you. Required-Your AR trigger, disconnector and hammer.What will be done is quite simple in theory but does take meticulous work to really clean it up.What will be done-Overall function check on trigger jig for safety. If I find it to be unsafe I will decline work or offer to replace the defunct part. Safety is key.-All contact surfaces checked for burr's and cleaned up-Check for and get rid of machining marks from factory-End with a high gloss-smooth as silk polish on all contact points-Lightly lubed with Aeroshell 6 grease. I'm out of tiny sample grease contaniers at the moment that I would normally just send back to you.-This job will not alter any angles or remove any safety from the trigger assembly. It's amazing how you can turn a regular mil spec trigger into something a lot better for not a lot of money. AR trigger's usually all have machining marks that go AGAINST the normal pull on the trigger. Machining marks are bad enough;one's that go the wrong way are even worse.Please feel free to email me and ask any questions. I look forward to getting to work!"

I am not a trap shooter so I have very little use for it. It is a 12 gauge SKB 85TSS with a trap combo that includes two barrel kits (one 34"" unsingle barrel with adjustable rib, and the other being a 32"" over and under ventilated rib barrel ). In addition this combo brings a full set of factory SKB chokes and some aftermarket competition chokes totaling 11 chokes combined. The shotgun also features an adjustable cheek piece and an adjustable GraCoil recoil pad. It comes with accessories and tools (pictured) including a custom SKB hard case, a multi-choke wrench/tool, and a set of multiple HIVIZ sights in a neat holder. Needless to say this is a serious competition gun with everything you need to get started in the sport of trap, skeet, or bird hunting. The condition of this firearm is excellent to say the least. The wood finish is pristine, with only a few very very minor blemishes. The metal on both barrels and the receiver is in great condition (easily over 95%). It has only had one owner and looks like new!This shotgun is rare and hard to get these days since it is no longer made and most people hang on to theirs because of its high quality. SKB is well known for its great costumer service and quality products; my grandfather has always talked this gun up, you're getting a great premium package here!More pictures and info are available upon further request."

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45 ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of their choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size; (subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell-And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.SpecificationsItem Number  250F-45-B  UPC Code  REDACTED58  Caliber  .45 ACP  Action  Double Action Only  Trigger Pull  5.5 - 6.5 Pounds  Overall Length  8.0 Inches  Overall Height  5.5 Inches  Overall Width  1.4 Inches  Barrel Length  4.7 Inches  Sight Radius  6.6 Inches  Weight with Magazine  29.4 Ounces  Magazine Capacity  10 Rounds  Sights  Contrast  Grips  Interchangeable Polymer  Frame Finish  Interchangeable Polymer Grip Shell with Stainless Insert  Slide Finish  Nitron  Accessory Rail  Yes  Features  Interchangeable Grip Sizes and Calibers.

The seller said this was due to it being a school designation. ALSO not sure if that is true, just passing it on. Please let me know if you need additional pics or info. WIll ship. Thanks600 OBO"

Great for CCW. It comes with 3 magazines plus old faithful hybrid IWB holster($85 originally and only used three times), original box ( with key for safety) . This gun is in great shape and has only been fired about 500 times. It was bought locally. The magazines are hard to find and cost about $50 with shipping anywhere on the net(this gun only comes with 1 new). This is almost the exact same gun as the Bersa Thunder Ultra Compact. The mini-firestorm Line was discontinued because it was redundant to make the same gun in two models. Don't confuse this firestorm model with an inferior firestorm 1911 model made by another company. In fact, Google "" guns: Bersa Thunder fires 1400 rounds with no jams ""  this is all done in one sitting with extended mags. I hate to sell it, but I committed to selling this in order to buy a Kimber 1911.  The Nickel version is much more rare than the black or duo-tone. The holster is custom made fit, kydex and leather. IWB. I can do transfer with my local ffl at his shop, or if you have Sc CCW permit, we can meet at my house."
