The all new CCP (Concealed Carry Pistol) in 9mm Luger has an ideal combination of style, ergonomics, size, shape, accuracy, and ability to conceal comfortably. The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm.
With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster.
This CCP comes in stylish Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation.
This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface.
Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

One guy decided to email me letting me know he FINALLY made up his mind but he sold it.... The other is named Quinn and has the XDS 9mm listed for sale at $400 but DON'T WASTE your TIME. He can't make up his mind an something seems off about the whole thing. I'm thinking stolen.SO IF YOU ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO SELL I WOULD LOVE TO TAKE A LOOK WITH THE HIGH POSSIBILITY OF PURCHASE AS LONG AS IT'S NOT A SATURDAY NIGHY SPECIAL LISTED AT HK, SIG, WILSON COMBAT PRICES.THIS ISN'T MY FIRST TIME ON ARMSLIST OR THE WORLD OF BUYING, SELLING, & TRADING FIREARMS SO PLEASE DON'T WASTE BOTH OUR TIMES, THANK YOU.I know this post is kind of harsh but some of the people here are real annoying while very good at wasting time.

High quality Ukrainian PU sniper scope made in same factory as WWII scopes. 
This rifle is most likely a ""replica"" put together buy an importer. I have not sighted it in. The magazine has a feeding issue but everything looks normal so someone more experienced should be able to figure it out. 
Please note that a real deal WWII Mosin PU sniper rifle will run around $1000. Go on Gunbroker and check if you don't believe me. This is half that since it is a cool looking replica that you can shoot.
Low-ballers will simply be ignored.
