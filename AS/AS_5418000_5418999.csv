The serial number (1,61X,XXX) places the manufacture date in 1949.  It is an all-original rifle - no alerations (e.g. swing swivels, scope mounts, etc.) were made to the factory-issued condition, making it a great collectors piece and a fine shooter.Bore is in excellent condition  - crisp rifling with no visible signs of pitting. Bluing is ~85% with no surface rusitng. The only places showing bluing wear are the underside of the receiver where the rifle was typically carried (bluing worn down to a greyish color around the edges) and the side of the receiver where cartriges would be inserted (has some minor scratches - probably from a previous owner hastily reloading the gun).Wood is in great shape - no cracks, gashes, or anything liek that. Personally, I think it has the perfect well worn look - it looks liek it's been used but also carefully cared for.I also have a bunch of Remignton 30-30 ammo that could be included in a deal."

The Recce 5 (MOD 3) is the compact 5.56mm little brother to the Recce 7. It is one of the lightest most durable, accurate, and high performance 5.56mm suppressors on the market. The Recce 5, weighs only 14.5 ounces on it's own and a mere 16.3 ounces as a suppressor system with the included Taper Mount Minimalist Brake. The included Taper Mount ensures minimal and repeatable point of impact shift with only minor weight gain. The Recce 5 achieves out of this world sound performance vs its size. Utilizing our Patent Pending Efficiency baffle technology this compact suppressor drops SPL by 35db on a 14.5"" M4 while keeping gas block back to normal levels. To increase performance for military users a high efficiency low profile flash suppressor was integrated into the front of the suppressor. This feature reduces flash, providing minimal signature for the user in low light environments. Also new to the Recce 5 (MOD 3) is a tuned, Patent Pending baffle system offering the apogee of multi-caliber sound performance. Elite tactical units requested minimal flash signature and Griffin responded by developing a low-profile flash reducer integral to the suppressor. For users seeking a dual role suppressor that can run on both tactical carbines and precision varmint rigs this is the ticket. At 14.5 ounces the Recce 5 is extremely light on the end of the gun keeping your muzzle fast on target, and enabling fatigue free carry for extended periods of time. The Recce 5 is CNC machined, and TIG fusion welded for maximum thermal transfer and unparalleled strength and durability. Every component in the Recce 5 is manufactured from solid billets of strong, heat treated, high temperature corrosion resistant 17-4ph Stainless Steel. The Recce 5 suppressor has a precision bore ensuring maximum accuracy, as well as minimum, consistent, and repeatable POI shift. A Taper Mount Minimalist Brake is included making the Recce 5 a good value and a turn key suppressor system. Whether hunting your favorite game or rucking on a long range patrol the Recce 5 is the right tool for the job.

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.   The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.   The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.   The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

Based on the full size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases conceal ability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semi-automatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot two finger grip frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full hand grip frame. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate and highly concealable pistol.Survival Instinct3346 Mather Field RdRancho Cordova, CA 95670shop: 916-368-7372(text only)573-705-2198 Stephan916-595-6023 Larrywww.survivalinstinctguns.comsteve@survivalinstinctguns.comlarry@survivalinstinctguns.com"

Based on designs that were cutting edge a mere 150 years ago, similar models such as this one were used to great effect in the geologically recent campaigns of the Texas Revolution, and Mexican-American War of the 1840's.With the modern rifling in the barrel of this pistol, this model can be used to fire at satellites in space, with a near guaranteed 99.99% failure rate to achieve the target. At shorter ranges, there's a chance you might hit something. Or several somethings either on, near or completely opposite from your intended target.Other benefits include exercise. The mere practice of lifting this 520 pound pistol repetitively will give you forearms the size of Popeye's. In the event of a home invasion by pirates, this pistol can be fired up to once before reloading, used as a club in the meantime, then surrendered by your exhausted and trembling arms.Promag magazines will not function with this pistol. (Thanks again Promag!)  Firearm fires using the ""cocked hammer"" design (impressive!). Uses percussion cap thingy, not flint rock thingy, for ignition.Front loading ram effect allows for rapid reloading of this firearm...by 1800's standards.No powder or balls or other items included. (I don't have any and really I don't like any of you well enough to include them even if I did have any.)Asking $100.

The M22 brings you handling and performance that is closer to the modern defensive handgun than any other rimfire pistol. Designed for inexpensive high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern pistol practice.  The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a Lothar Walther match barrel, standard on all models, an extremely crisp, 4-lb single-action trigger and adjustable sights. The M22 is also the safest pistol on the market today with five safeties in every pistol. All ISSC M22 pistols are finished with our proprietary Ti-clad, including the Two-Tone M22. The finish is comprised of the same chemical properties used by automobile manufacturers for exterior auto paint. This finish guarantees not only a very strong and even application, but protects your M22 pistol from all the elements that might otherwise harm the finish, including water, cleaning residues, gunpowders and other toxic chemicals.
