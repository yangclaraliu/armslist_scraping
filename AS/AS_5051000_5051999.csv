THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semi automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate.
 
Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor.
 
The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m."

This Sig originally came new from the NH Sig factory as a ""dehorned"" or Sig Anti Snag (SAS) carry firearm. It has a stainless slide with beautiful “P226 SAS” engraved into the slide. It is a German metal frame. Since acquiring this P226, I have sent it to the Sig Custom Pro Shop and had the stainless slide “bead blasted” to a perfect and like new finish. I then had all internal springs inspected and replaced as necessary, then converted to a DA/SA action, added a De-cocker safety lever, upgraded the standard trigger to a SRT trigger function, put brand new OEM Sig Rosewood grips with stainless screws, Siglite night sights, and also equipped it with a brand new Lasermax Guide Rod Red laser kit, which is the only NATO approved guide rod laser out there. It has NOT been fired since it came back from the Sig factory, and prior to that, it still maintains a low round count. In my personal opinion, this Sig is just an awesome gun, not only with its high accuracy and smooth as silk shooting capabilities, but it is also a real gem to look at. It is my carry of choice. I have over $1200.00 in this Sig. I am asking $1,000 or Best Reasonable Offer. Must present a current government issued ID such as a drivers license, or preferred  “Canceled/Carry Weapon Permit”."

This Sig originally came new from the NH Sig factory as a ""dehorned"" or Sig Anti Snag (SAS) carry firearm. It has a stainless slide with beautiful “P226 SAS” engraved into the slide. It is a German metal frame. Since acquiring this P226, I have sent it to the Sig Custom Pro Shop and had the stainless slide “bead blasted” to a perfect and like new finish. I then had all internal springs inspected and replaced as necessary, then converted to a DA/SA action, added a De-cocker safety lever, upgraded the standard trigger to a SRT trigger function, put brand new OEM Sig Rosewood grips with stainless screws, Siglite night sights, and also equipped it with a brand new Lasermax Guide Rod Red laser kit, which is the only NATO approved guide rod laser out there. It has NOT been fired since it came back from the Sig factory, and prior to that, it still maintains a low round count. In my personal opinion, this Sig is just an awesome gun, not only with its high accuracy and smooth as silk shooting capabilities, but it is also a real gem to look at. It is my carry of choice. I have over $1200.00 in this Sig. I am asking $1,000 or Best Reasonable Offer. Must present a current government issued ID such as a drivers license, or preferred  “Canceled/Carry Weapon Permit”."

This Sig originally came new from the NH Sig factory as a ""dehorned"" or Sig Anti Snag (SAS) carry firearm. It has a stainless slide with beautiful “P226 SAS” engraved into the slide. It is a German metal frame. Since acquiring this P226, I have sent it to the Sig Custom Pro Shop and had the stainless slide “bead blasted” to a perfect and like new finish. I then had all internal springs inspected and replaced as necessary, then converted to a DA/SA action, added a De-cocker safety lever, upgraded the standard trigger to a SRT trigger function, put brand new OEM Sig Rosewood grips with stainless screws, Siglite night sights, and also equipped it with a brand new Lasermax Guide Rod Red laser kit, which is the only NATO approved guide rod laser out there. It has NOT been fired since it came back from the Sig factory, and prior to that, it still maintains a low round count. In my personal opinion, this Sig is just an awesome gun, not only with its high accuracy and smooth as silk shooting capabilities, but it is also a real gem to look at. It is my carry of choice. I have over $1200.00 in this Sig. I am asking $1,000 or Best Reasonable Offer. Must present a current government issued ID such as a drivers license, or preferred  “Canceled/Carry Weapon Permit”."

This Sig originally came new from the NH Sig factory as a ""dehorned"" or Sig Anti Snag (SAS) carry firearm. It has a stainless slide with beautiful “P226 SAS” engraved into the slide. It is a German metal frame. Since acquiring this P226, I have sent it to the Sig Custom Pro Shop and had the stainless slide “bead blasted” to a perfect and like new finish. I then had all internal springs inspected and replaced as necessary, then converted to a DA/SA action, added a De-cocker safety lever, upgraded the standard trigger to a SRT trigger function, put brand new OEM Sig Rosewood grips with stainless screws, Siglite night sights, and also equipped it with a brand new Lasermax Guide Rod Red laser kit, which is the only NATO approved guide rod laser out there. It has NOT been fired since it came back from the Sig factory, and prior to that, it still maintains a low round count. In my personal opinion, this Sig is just an awesome gun, not only with its high accuracy and smooth as silk shooting capabilities, but it is also a real gem to look at. It is my carry of choice. I have over $1200.00 in this Sig. I am asking $1,000 or Best Reasonable Offer. Must present a current government issued ID such as a drivers license, or preferred  “Canceled/Carry Weapon Permit”."

It has been a good shooter, but I wanted to be able to scope my hunting handgun, and I just can't bring myself to having holes drilled into something like this. I have the original case although I am not the original owner. The manufacturer/importer is Interarms. This website doesn't offer that on the manufacturer list. If you are interested in more information on these guns, check out: http://www.singleactions.com/VADragoons.pdf  This one has the ""Don't tread on Me"" with snake logo, which is pretty cool.Sale is contingent on a simple bill of sale complete with a current and verifiable Wisconsin Driver's lisence or other positive legal identification. I hope that this does not offend you, and I have no intention other than to keep the bill of sale for my own files to cover my own ass."

American Tactical sets the new standard in polymer AR lowers by introducing the new Omni-Hybrid AR-15 lower. The new design is a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert. Designed to give extra strength in the high-pressure sections, the Omni-Hybrid surpasses military pressure and weight-bearing testing. This unique manufacturing process produces a lighter weight platform, with the total weight of the Omni-Hybrid stripped lower being 8 ounces, a ½ ounce lighter than a traditional aluminum AR lower. “The Omni-Hybrid lower has gone through all the pressure and weight-baring testing of a traditional aluminum lower with flawless results,” says Joe Calabro, Director of Marketing for American Tactical. “We feel like this new manufacturing technique will help set the standard for AR lower manufacturing.” The Omni-Hybrid stripped lower has an MSRP of $59.95, making it one of the most cost-effective multi-caliber lowers on the market today. Price doesn't include tax. Price is firm, no trades. Dealer sale , credit cards accepted (no fee). Visitors by appointment only. Located in North Phoenix.

Built with a solid stainless steel frame, with extra metal where it's needed, th The angle of the SP101's peg-style grip frame, with its cushioned rubber grip that has no exposed metal in the backstrap, makes shooting the sidearm comfortable and extremely controllable for a gun of its size. To withstand recoil from heavy 357 loads, a triple-locking cylinder is locked into the frame at the front, rear, and bottom so it stays aligned without getting sloppy over time. The Ruger SP101has a smooth double-action trigger pull, and a clean, crisp break in single-action. The rear sight is milled into the solid topstrap, and will never get knock out of alignment or interfere with drawing the weapon when the shooter is in a hurry. The solid frame of the SP101 has no side plate, and the revolver disassembles into integrated subassemblies with no tools, aiding to ease of maintenance in the field. As with all Ruger Double-Action Revolvers, the SP101 features the patented Ruger transfer bar mechanism that provides an unparalleled measure of security against accidental discharge—the revolver can be dropped directly on its hammer and will not fire without the trigger being pulled all the way to the back. The Ruger SP101 Double-Action Revolver is a solidly built sidearm that you can count on in both urban and outdoor environments. Made in USA. shoots  357 magnum and 38Third pic is actual. see here for hickock 45: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4PGOyvafwo  This is a solid pistol, and revolvers do not miss fire unless its a bad round and I've not seen a bad round yet with this one.  Hickock is correct, it has a mean kick when firing 357 magnum but that is greatly reduced with the longer grip. I can't imagine firing a 357 magnum with one of those light weight revolvers. This pistol is solid as a tank.  It's amazingly accurate for a snub as you see in the video.  I've included the original grip as well, which helps the conceal effort but if your like me and like the punch, i'd leave the longer grip on."
