DOLNE, SERIAL NO. 5222, CIRCA 1875 With fluted barrel-block, metal frame marked 'L. DOLNE INV. UR' on one side, folding trigger, folding knuckle-duster grip, and short locking bayonet with waved blade fitted to the left side of the frame.  1 9/26 in (4 cm) barrel-block.Serial #5222, 5 mm Pinfire, 1.5"" fluted barrel cluster.  This sinister looking Dolne marked pepperbox was the brainchild of Mr. Louis Dolne of Liege and combines a folding set of brass knuckles with both a six-shot pinfire revolver and a swing-out 2 7/8"" double-edged, flambard (flame shaped) blade.The spring latches for the knife blad and the grip are original and still lock firmly in place.  The revolver mechanism is fully functional although I have never fired it.These curious firearms were quite popular with the thugs and toughs of the late 19th century Parisian underworld, known as ""les Apaches"" for their brutal nature, and it was from them that these little revolvers received their familiar nickname.  This example is in good condition but looks fantastic and would make a great additino to any collection of firearms curiousities or gambling paraphernalia.The design dates from the 1860's, and is attributed to Louis Dolne.  The gun was manufactured through the end of the 1800's.  The gun operates on the principle of a pepperbox revolver using a pinfire action and incorporates a fold-over knuckle duster forming the grip and also a rudimentary foldout, dual-edged knife.Due to the lack of a barrel, the revolver's effective range is very limited, but since all of its component parts can be folded inward towards the cylinder, it was easily concealable inside a pocket.  It was common to leave an empty chamber with no cartridge under the firing pin to prevent shooting oneself while having it concealed in a pocket or bag, as the weapon has no trigger guard or safety.  This weapon is not able to be aimed precisely because of its lack of front and rear sights.  Despite its limited potential, the revolver proved deadly at extremely close range.Les Apaches (French) were members of a Parisian Belle Epoque underworld subculture.  Apaches were so called because of their alleged savagery was compared with that attributed by Europeans to the Native American tribes of Apaches.  The Apaches were especially associated with some districts of Paris: Belleville, La Bastille, La Villette and Montmartre which was also home to the famous Moulin Rouge dance hall and nightclub.During their heyday, the prospect of being mugged or otherwise assaulted by Apache gangsters was especially feared by members of the emergent bourgeois middle class.  Some of the gangs used a unique type of pistol which was named the ""Apache revolver"" or ""Apache pistol"":  a pinfire cartridge revolver with no barrel, a set of foldover brass knuckles for a handgrip, and a folding knife mounted right underneath the revolver drum for use as a stabbing weapon."

In addition to the two original gauges, adapters allow you to shoot 8 pistol calibers ( .380 , 9 mm , .357Mag/.38SP , .40 S & W, .44 Mag,44 SP, .45 ACP , .410/.45colt ) and two shotgun calibers (410 ga, 20ga), combining the flexibility of a shotgun and the power of a rifled gun. The choice of materials is the winning factor of X -Caliber ®: the whole structure is made of steel, but the weight of the stock has been almost eliminated. A metal caging encases a preformed polypropylene foam stock, with a very durable and thick weft, ensuring excellent comfort.Polypropylene (PP) is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications including automotive and furniture, abd is unusually resistant to mechanical stress and to surface wear.By simply pressing a lever , the rifle can be bent in two, reaching a total length of 18.5 "" - that is, the length of the barrel - to be easily carried in a backpack.All the details are studied to obtain maximum flexibility and practicality. The stock is ergonomic and has a housing for ammunition and the maintenance/cleaning kit. The front sight is optical fiber and the rear sight is adjustable in elevation and windage to fit the gauge used.

Very few military units are permitted to paint their rifles. Seal's used to spray paint their own firearms themselves but for the most part have them professionally done now. The HK 416 is available for SEAL and SOCOM use and has been standard equipment for some time. These units are available for civilian sale and are designated as the MR556A1 by HK but these upgraded versions are NON CATALOG items typically not offered for civilian purchase (but again you may buy this deployment package). The 416/MR556A1 per contract spec has had all internal parts NP3 PLUS coated and had their exteriors coated in Desert Tan Poly-T2. NP3 PLUS has a 1000 hour salt spry protection level per ASTM-B-117 and Poly T2 exceeds 1000 hours. This piston driven system expels all gases out front and literally gets wiped out with a cloth after use. By adding the aerospace contract coatings we do not oil the upper or lowers as the lubricity factors in NP3 Plus are stunning. We do routinely clean the barrels however. HK units have 16.1"" match barrels and are guaranteed sub moa, tactical upgraded charging handles, upgraded bolt systems (NP3 Plus), weep ports for water use, German G4 adjustable stocks with soft rubber recoil buttplate (swing out with storage), genuine HK German mfg rail covers. HK delivers these units with ""battle triggers"". Special Forces and SEALS replace/rework the battle trigger units with 4.5lb DDM units upon receipt. These custom run non catalog HK rifles also have 4.5lb trigger packages. Topped with the same scope used by your Special Forces the Leupold Mark 6 1-6. At 1x works as a red dot scope (illuminated) for CQB close quarter battle yet you can dial up to 6x for your 800 meter sniper shots. Military version waterproof, dustproof. Package includes the Sig Sauer MK25D. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs the fleets special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs"

If you live more than 40 miles away from Portland, we can arrange for you to have the rifle shipped to you via a FFL.With that out of the way...I have a great rifle here that I'm sad to part with. It's a Romanian WASR 10, in almost new condition. I've owned it for just under a year, and haven't had any problems with it whatsoever: the sights aren't canted, so it shoots straight, it goes bang every time when I pull the trigger, and hasn't had a single failure to feed or extract. I love this rifle, but as I'm moving to a state that doesn't allow me to own it, I'm forced to part with it. Included with the rifle are:- Seven (7) high capacity 30 round magazine: two steel Russian army surplus magazines, three polymer magazines, and two highly collectible Russian Izhmash and Tula Bakelite magazines, which can be found on the internet or at gun stores retailing from $35-$70 each.- One (1) Yankee Hill Machine Flash Hider that retails for $44.60- One (1) MOLLE double magazine pouch in Coyote Brown- 160 rounds of brass-case Yugoslav military-grade ammunition, sealed in boxes on stripper clips. This is arguably the best military 7.62x39 ammunition there is, and is in BRASS casings, not steel.- 40 rounds of Russian ""Golden Tiger"" steel case ammunition, on stripper clips. This is new production ammunition, also of higher quality than your average Wolf or Tulammo variety.- One (1) Russian wood forward grip, vintage 1950s.- One (1) standard wood stock set, if you don't like the forward grip.- One (1) standard cleaning kit.-One (1) Russian standard issue sling.I'm asking $799 for the whole package, which is about $100 less than if you bought a similar used rifle of this type and all the accessories and ammunition with it separately. Good luck!"

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a  ""Zero-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a  steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real  windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger  with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, five pound DAO  trigger pull.

The absence of removable pins and  tools makes field stripping easier than ever, and this pistol features real  windage-adjustable sights.

Like new, only 160 FLAWLESS rounds through (150 FMJ, 10 HP). One 10 round magazine. I'm the first owner. Gun is made in Austria - like that ""other"" brand :) - but with some differences. There are two manual safeties: one slightly forward of the trigger and the other is on the right side next to the takedown lever, operated by a key (included). And of course the trigger safety. The stock sights are a rectangular shape that you may not have seen before but it makes it easy to get your sight picture. Trigger is fantastic (IMHO).I'm only selling for $300. You can compare that to a current Gunbroker listing which is selling one for $425 (one 10 rd mag like mine), and that's before shipping, background check and FFL fees. I'm willing to pass this along to someone who's either curious about it and/or needs a good, reliable home/self defense gun. 10 rds of hollow points will come with the gun, manual and factory case.$300 firm. No shipping, no trades. Meet in or close to Navarre, Gulf Breeze or Pensacola. Bill of sale will be done, no exceptions. Let me know if you need to see more pics. Thanks for looking.P.S.- I will only deal with anyone who has the funds. If you tell me you'd like to buy but don't have the cash at the moment then I'll just move on to the next person who actually has the cash. Please don't waste your own time, or mine. Thank you."

Pls let me know if you looking for any particular type of ammo, I may have it and will sell for less than the big box sporting stores are asking. Thanks"

Before you get excited, it's not mint. . .Backstory: At some point a several-generations-previous owner left it in leather holster and pitted the sides of the slide and a bit of the frame. I bought this a few years ago, and worked on it a bit.I worked my way down through most of the pitting (with emory cloth on a surface plate) without lightening the roll marks too much. I've replaced the mixmaster collet bushing with a hand-fit wrench-snug EGW bushing, installed a Gold Cup sear depressor and spring, various other springs, rust blued the works, installed an EGW firing pin stop, and fit a Colt thumb safety. Function is perfect, never a hiccup, and more accurate than I.Now that I have a completed, refinished, Gold Cup, I realize that I really like a few modern features like beavertails, bobtails, combat sights, extended safeties, and stainless or bake-on finishes. Before I start grinding on this pistol to make it suit me, I wonder if anyone's interested in trading for a Springfield/Colt/etc with such features, or buying it outright.I don't have a good feel for what this is worth, but I'll start at $800, obo.Photo album is here: http://mindlabprime.blogspot.com/2016/01/nothing-to-see-here.html"

Read More   Shooters searching for incredible performance in a match rifle need look no farther than the M1A™ National Match from Springfield Armory®. The National Match is purpose-built for one thing: winning competitions. The list of features that distinguishes the National Match series starts with the fact that the action is glass bedded into the new walnut stock. This provides a rock-solid platform for the rest of the rifle – like the medium-weight National Match barrel. A crisp 4.5 – 5lb National Match tuned two-stage trigger will ensure you can place your shots exactly where and when you intend. The .0595” hooded rear aperture sight gives precise ½ MOA adjustments for both windage and elevation.

You’ll find yourself amazed at how enjoyable it is to shoot a pistol that’s so small and so powerful. In fact, you might end up spending more time at the range than you planned. The XD-S 4.0″ Single Stack turns Springfield Armory’s single stack XD-S platform into a mid-sized pistol. The sub-compact frame extends to full-size length when you insert an X-Tension magazine, adding capacity and controllability for your time at the range. Use a flush fitting magazine for concealed carry, and you’ll forget it’s there. Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. The .45 ACP is a cartridge that compromises nothing in the power department, and the XD-S is a concealed carry pistol without compromise. Put an XD-S 4.0″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable.""
