This rifle comes with the following: a great underfolding stock, Hogue pistol grip, Hogue foregrip and heat shield/accessory rails, 4 good polymer mags, one steel mag with spine, a tritium front night sight by XS Sights, an AK sight pusher tool, AND a Romanian 75-round drum. The rifle comes stock with a gas block/grenade sight attachment and built-in cleaning rod.There is some very slight coarseness on the finish of the dust cover for some reason, but it's not obvious and in no way affects the function of the piece.I just loaded some of the magazines today; there are about 90 rounds of Red Army Standard and 120 rounds of Brown Bear ammo also included.I was surprised by how accurate this rifle is, especially with the reputation AKs have. But besides being accurate, it's obviously incredibly reliable as all quality AKs are. She eats anything from soft points to hollows, and of course FMJ/ball rounds.Price is reduced to $735, and considering everything you're getting in addition to a quality rifle, I think it's a VERY fair price.By replying to this listing, you are telling me you're legally allowed to purchase this firearm."

Whether it’s a moving target, dangerous game at full charge, or a fast breaking tactical  situation at close quarters. When things are moving fast and you need to get on target in  a hurry, your sight has to work faster. No matter the lighting conditions, weather  conditions, or terrain, the ROMEO4 red-dot sight has you covered-—when it counts.  You can shoot with confidence with both eyes open, on target yet aware of the situation  at all times as it unfolds.

454,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5102454,For Sale:  The Urban Carry - Black,"Sanford, Orlando, Florida",$ 55,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 16, 2018",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"TO PURCHASE A HOLSTER CLICK HERE: The Urban Carry - BlackThe Urban Carry is a uniquely designed holster to comfortably carry your concealed firearm with any outfit for any situation. Size Chart: Click Here to Find Your Gun         The Urban Carry is proudly made in the United States of America with 100% genuine saddle grade leather.   Please Note: The Leather WILL NEED TO BE BROKEN-IN.  It takes about 5-7 days of wearing it for the firearm to fit comfortably in there.     To speed up the process use any kind of leather conditioner / oil to soften it up.  We recommend Bick 4 from Brickmore, and can be purchased here. We want you to be protected at all times. That's why the Urban Carry was versatilely designed to work with almost any outfit, for any situation. We have three priorities with the design, quick access, comfort, and complete concealment. The Urban Carry offers quick access to your firearm.  Simply pull the flap and the handle of your firearm is easily exposed. With only the magnetic flap exposed the only people who will know that you are carrying in an urban environment are the other people with an Urban Carry.  Our other main focus was to build the concealed carry holster for comfort. Most Inside Waistband holsters have the handle of the firearm on the waistline.  Any movement will cause the handle to push into your stomach, side or back while the barrel may push into your leg. This makes carrying a firearm uncomfortable for many people.  As a result many simply won't carry all the time. That's what we wanted to avoid. With the Urban Carry, the holster rides about an inch below the waistline which puts your firearm parallel to your leg. This way you have full mobility without hardly ever feeling your firearm. So long as your pants are worn comfortably (sorry, no skinny-jeans) then we are confident you'll be able to sit at a desk or your car all day without any discomfort from your firearm. The Urban Carry also has a place in the back to keep your concealed license, a credit card or some extra cash to make sure you always have that at hand. With this particular design it is very unlikely that you'll ever drop or expose your firearm or have it stolen. The Urban Carry is proudly made in the United States of America with 100% genuine saddle grade leather. Please Note: The Leather WILL NEED TO BE BROKEN-IN.  It takes about 5-7 days of wearing it for the firearm to fit comfortably in there.   To speed up the process use any kind of leather conditioner / oil to soften it up.  We recommend Bick 4 from Brickmore, and can be purchased here."

Size Chart: Click Here to Find Your Gun         The Urban Carry is proudly made in the United States of America with 100% genuine saddle grade leather.   Please Note: The Leather WILL NEED TO BE BROKEN-IN.  It takes about 5-7 days of wearing it for the firearm to fit comfortably in there.     To speed up the process use any kind of leather conditioner / oil to soften it up.  We recommend Bick 4 from Brickmore, and can be purchased here. We want you to be protected at all times. That's why the Urban Carry was versatilely designed to work with almost any outfit, for any situation. We have three priorities with the design, quick access, comfort, and complete concealment. The Urban Carry offers quick access to your firearm.  Simply pull the flap and the handle of your firearm is easily exposed. With only the magnetic flap exposed the only people who will know that you are carrying in an urban environment are the other people with an Urban Carry.  Our other main focus was to build the concealed carry holster for comfort. Most Inside Waistband holsters have the handle of the firearm on the waistline.  Any movement will cause the handle to push into your stomach, side or back while the barrel may push into your leg. This makes carrying a firearm uncomfortable for many people.  As a result many simply won't carry all the time. That's what we wanted to avoid. With the Urban Carry, the holster rides about an inch below the waistline which puts your firearm parallel to your leg. This way you have full mobility without hardly ever feeling your firearm. So long as your pants are worn comfortably (sorry, no skinny-jeans) then we are confident you'll be able to sit at a desk or your car all day without any discomfort from your firearm. The Urban Carry also has a place in the back to keep your concealed license, a credit card or some extra cash to make sure you always have that at hand. With this particular design it is very unlikely that you'll ever drop or expose your firearm or have it stolen. The Urban Carry is proudly made in the United States of America with 100% genuine saddle grade leather. Please Note: The Leather WILL NEED TO BE BROKEN-IN.  It takes about 5-7 days of wearing it for the firearm to fit comfortably in there.   To speed up the process use any kind of leather conditioner / oil to soften it up.  We recommend Bick 4 from Brickmore, and can be purchased here."

I purchased this rifle new in July 2013 and since then, it has been primarily used for NRA XTC matches (I did whack a hog with it this past November on a hunting trip to Oklahoma). The round count is about 2800 (don't have exact figures but I purchased 1000 pieces of brass when I first got it and I have about 200 rounds left that are on it's 3rd firing). The only thing non-stock about this rifle is that I swapped out the SAI extractor for a PB extractor. The stock has a few minor dings and ""brass kisses"" in the usual places. The bedding is still quite tight as I've only had it out of it's stock 3 times since I owned for yearly maintenance. This rifle is quite accurate and I will gladly share my hand load data with buyer if they so desire. (See other posts of mine to see grouping photos for various loads).I will post more photos this evening once I get home. Feel free to PM with any questions. Included:1. original plastic case & documentation.2. extra SAI extractor3. 10 round SAI magazineAsking $1700 + 1/2 actual shipping/insurance costs .

And the left side of the slide has the P38 designation, the s/n ""28xx b"" followed by the ""ac 45"" manufacturer code.Out of over a million P38s produced, Walther only produced roughly 31,000 P38s marked ""ac 45"" and very few of those returned from the battlefield - so they are far more rare than previous years when production rates ranged as high as 150,000 units per year. This is an authentic 1945 Walther P38 with all matching serial numbers on the frame, slide, under barrel and locking block. S/N: 28xx b. The alphabetic character following the s/n, indicates the manufacturing block or group of P38s. The ""c"" block of pistols were never completed due to the war ending, so the ""b"" block pistols, such as this one, were the last full block of Walther P38s. It is very reasonably priced for a nice condition late war very rare Walther ""ac 45"" P38 with a clean barrel and all matching S/Ns.  Refer to the attached photos and contact with questions.

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.
