Bike is like showroom condition considering its age. Has just over 20k but engine was completely taken apart and reassembled with upgrade parts including having 2nd gear re- cnc'd. Found out after purchase that 2nd gear was not working and that it's notorious on those models that they easily wear down and begin to slip. In actuality the entire bike has been taken down and re-built. All part including faring and rims are 100% original to bike. All brke pads and clutch cables and brake cables and windscreen are new. May need the carb cleaned out from sitting. Tires are new and have alot of life left. In all the bike is pristine and just needs to be road. It has a stage 2 setup with a Vance and Hines racepak. After market muffler that screams down the highway!! As said before I'm looking to sell but would consider a trade or cash and trade depending on what you have. Feel free to let me know all I can say is no. For a faster response please text or call me at REDACTED names Tommy. Thanks

The savage street by street combat in cities such as Stalingrad clearly showed that a carbine length weapon would better satisfy the needs of the Red Army. While the earlier Model 1938 Carbine seemed to fill this demand, the lack of a bayonet was seen as a grave deficiency in Soviet circles. The Soviet Union was winning the war against Hitler with shear numbers of men and machines coupled with mass of attack. While the concept of soldiers with bayonets advancing in gigantic formations seemed antiquated to the militaries of the West, this philosophy was still a key factor in the Soviet order of battle. A new carbine whose bayonet would reflect this doctrine was deemed in order, and the concept behind the Model 1944 Carbine ( M44 Carbine ) was born."

Lower offers or trades NOT accepted. Cash and face to face sales ONLY. The pic doesn't do it justice. 1896 Finnish M39 Valmet VKT Rare antique execellent condition. #6358X Barrel Date: 1944 - 85% Blue, bright sharp shiny bore, matching bolt, post war stock in excellent condition with a 1896 Izhevsk receiver. Manufactured by famous machine gun barrel maker Valmet. This M39 is an extremely rare legally defined Antique, that has been unfired since being re-arsenaled by the Finnish military. This is essentially a brand new, accurate and powerful rifle. Rifle comes with original wartime leather sling. Chambered in 7.62x54R.  Only around 100,000 M39 rifles were made.  One of the most accurate military bolt action rifles ever produced as they were required to shoot sub MOA. The M39's also have a number of variations and makers/manufactures as well as having quite a diverse history both in WW2 and post war Finland. These are great rifles to shoot and collect.  7.62x54R surplus ammunition is inexpensive and comparable to the 30-06 round, and is much more powerful than its little brother, the 7.62x39 round that is usually chambered in AKs and the SKS. This Finnish M39 Rifle has been protected and preserved for long term storage with cosmoline, which is still on the rifle.  When cleaned the rifle and stock will be beautiful. Weight: 9.5 lbs (4.3 kg) Over All Length: 46.75” (118.7 cm) Barrel Length: 27” (68.6 cm) Stock Length: 43.25” (109.9 cm) Groove Diameter: .310” Sight Radius: 22.75” (57.8 cm) Cleaning Rod Length: 24.375” (61.9 cm) Caliber: 7.62x54R ANTIQUE PRE-1899 FIREARMS Although your State and local laws may vary, any firearm with a receiver actually made before Jan. 1, 1899 is a legally classified ""antique"" and not considered a ""firearm"" under Federal law. This refers to the actual date of manufacture of the receiver/frame, not just model year or patent date marked. No FFL is required to buy or sell antiques across state lines-- they are in the same legal category as a muzzle-loading replica. With no ""paper trail”, many think of these as the last bastion of gun ownership privacy."

For those of you don't know, these were the first Norinco models to ever be imported into the United States in the very early 80's. These were actually banned from import because of the model was deemed to be too similar to ""AK-47"" which was banned from importation by the 1968 CGA. Very few of these made it into the country. From what I've read on the AKForum.net and AKFiles it appears less than 200-300 ever made it in the states. Not only does this have the benefit of being a pre-ban and legal in CT, but it is also a collectible. I'm headed down South for school and as much as I hate to, I must part with it to assist me in my moving. The rifle is all matching numbers and in excellent condition. The original bluing is largely intact, with only one small spot behind the pistol grip which was tarnished by some light surface rust. I removed said rust with paper towels and Rem oil. Other than that, it is in perfect shape. The rifle has less than 100 rounds through it and the bore is perfect."

I believe it is a police/army rework done in 1942. All serial numbers match including the mag. On the inside of the magwell, there are police markings that I believe were removed during the rebuild process for military use. The mag base is metal, with ""42"" and a military acceptance stamp. Reason for the military rebuild speculation. Most of the finish is still there and the grips are in excellent shape. The bore is a little dark, but the rifling is very strong. I can send more detailed pics. $1400. No trades please."
