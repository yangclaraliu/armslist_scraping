Space-age compounds applied with secret alien technology turn any gun into a sniper-quality weapon that you never have to clean and will always work. These treatments go by a host of names—some real, some made up—but one coating that actually delivers on its promise is NiB-X, otherwise known as nickel boron.WMD (Wynn, Mike & Duke) Guns is an industry leader in the application of NiB-X on firearms and firearm parts and works with several major manufacturers to treat their key component parts. NiB-X is often applied to the parts that are used hardest and exposed to the highest levels of carbon fouling. Several high-end manufacturers coat their ARs’ bolts and bolt carriers in nickel boron because of its inherent corrosion-resistant properties.Now WMD Guns has introduced an AR of its own, the Beast. All of its metal parts are completely coated in NiB-X for an extremely unique look and feel. This carbine-length AR is a semi-automatic, direct gas impingement system chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and loaded with a multitude of special features. But it’s the coating that stands out the most.Comes with one NiB-x steel mag and one Polymer Hexmag mag. 36"" Drago one gun case included!!!!!

I picked it up at Gander Mountain a few years ago with another rifle. I did not use this rifle at all since purchasing it. I alternatively used the other one I purchased the same day. So, I have never shot this rifle. The bore is in excellent condition. The rifle itself looks like it was used before Gander Mountain obtained it. Some of the stock has marks on it under the finish. The metal where the Tula star and date are looks as though the bluing has been worn away or is just not matching to the color of the trigger assembly.So, the bore is in excellent condition as I mentioned but the stock shows signs of wear. I've never fired it so I can't tell you if it is accurate. Upon inspection, the bolt looks brand new but still bears the same numbers as the rest of the rifle. The rifle comes with the bayonet.The price is $200.00 for the rifle or I would be interested in a trade for a pump action 12 gauge shotgun. If if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Thanks for looking."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno polymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com    The Daniel Defense DDM4ISR 300 joins our family of precision-crafted M4 Rifles.  The ISR takes advantage of the best characteristics of the 300BLK by integrating key components into one package, eliminating the need for two separate tax stamps.  While the rifle utilizes a 10.3” barrel, it is not classified as an SBR (Short-Barreled Rifle) because the suppressor is permanently attached.  The DDM4ISR 300’s sound suppressor is threaded and welded to the proprietary ISR Integrated Gas Block, bringing the barrel length to 16.145”.  While the rifle is at the 16” legal limit, the ISR’s integrated suppressor will require an NFA tax stamp.   This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.Using the tool provided, the ISR’s baffle core is removable for cleaning.  With the inclusion of the Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail (MFR) 12.0, it provides the shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability.  This rifle can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube.  In addition, the 3” Modular Picatinny Rail sections allow the end user to customize the rail set up.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com When Ambush Firearms decided to pull the trigger on the Ambush 300AAC Blackout, we had the hunter in mind.  Keeping with our philosophy of tailoring a rifle to the needs of the sportsman, like the 6.8, the 300AAC Blackout is lightweight, modular, utilizes a Picatinny Rail system and adjustable butt-stock.  Never before seen with the AR platform, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout fires 7.62 x 35 rounds while remaining compatible with the standard M4 Bolt Carrier Group and existing magazines. DETAILS Other features include the Cold Hammer Forged, 1:8 twist, 16” S2W Profile barrel and shotgun-inspired hand grip, and is available in Black or REALTREE AP™. Whether chasing after a wild boar or anticipating a 10 point mule deer, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout supplies ample knock-down power while reducing recoil. The Ambush Firearms 300 Blackout is designed to be shot suppressed and un-suppressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions.  The testing of the Ambush Firearms 300 Blackout firearms indicates that un-suppressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.  Although, through our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-suppressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation. MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION Precision crafted from the highest quality material available today with meticulous attention to detail, The Ambush Firearms 300 Blackout will prove to be the benchmark in the industry.

Has some scuffs and scratches but not bad and the bore is in great shape. I also have a older 410 single shot. I don't know the maker due to the previous owner starting the refinishing process and has taken all the metal down to bare metal. I was going to stain the furniture and make it a pistol grip and shorten the barrel but don't have the time or passion to finish it. It functions fine and shoots good. I would take $100 for the 16 gauge that will also come with 3-5 she'll boxes of good shells. I would take $80 for the 410. The 410 has a new butt stock cover that cost $26.
