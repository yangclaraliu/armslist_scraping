I may list this locally so first come by time stamp will get it. Oh it has had one box of standard velocity 130 grain Remington ammo put through it.Caliber is .38 Special and these are rated for +P ammo, though I have not shot any in it.

The market is saturated with DA 9’S so for one to be commercially successful it has to have some features to offer the consumer. Among them is a reasonable price and reliability. A good trigger and sights are other features that a consumer would look for. AEven an ugly gun with good features would endear itself to me rather then a pretty paperweight. One of the Ruger 9E Pistol features are is it is light and feels good in my hand. It has the typical 3 dot white sights which enables us to pick them up rapidly and a major plus in a defensive gun. The two-position safety is located near the back end and is awkward to release. I am not crazy about its position, as it isn’t the best place for rapid use. It is however positive and prevents the gun from going off accidentally. The magazine release is both very positive and convenient to use rapidly. The gun will fire with the magazine removed, which is a good feature in my view. It has a lug beneath the barrel, which will enable the owner to mount a laser or flashlight."

Drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned in polymer front sight. Black polymer frame and matte stainless steel slide. Textured polymer grips. One six round magazine. The union of advanced design, quality materials and proper construction makes Kahr the smallest, thinnest, most reliable full power compact pistol. A value that can't be matched. Reliability. Unless the gun is 100% reliable, all else is meaningless. Kahr pistols have proven their reliability in testing by Federal, State and local agencies. Size. Ergonomically, the Kahr compact pistol excels. The gun is easy to shoot well, and comfortable to carry for extended periods due to its thin profile. Power. Despite their diminutive size, Kahr pistols deliver full size ballistic performance. So, when it comes to protecting your life, choose the value gun. Choose the gun stamped KAHR. A value, unmatched at any price. Quality is never compromised in either the assembly or testing of a Kahr. Every Kahr pistol is made in accordance with the strictest international manufacturing standards, and is individually tested at the adjoining firing range. The development of the Kahr handgun involved numerous testing sessions during which 10,000 rounds of ammunition were fired through a single Kahr pistol. Each Kahr model has been extensively tested to assure the reliability, function, accuracy and safety of each component and of the final product. Any change in design has been rigorously tested to ensure absolute functioning. As a result of this exhaustive testing, Kahr has produced the most reliable compact firearm in the world today. We, at Kahr, have total confidence in the durability and long-term reliability of our Kahr pistols. I believe the CW45 would be an excellent choice for those fans of large caliber handguns who need–or just want–a lightweight, easily concealable, fine shooting pistol chambered for the most popular big bore pistol cartridge of all time. Whether you are a police detective, armed professional, licensed civilian or homeowner, the CW45 should be capable of doing whatever you want or need a pistol to doóat an economical price. (Paul Scarlata, Jab/Feb issue of Handgun Magazine) The designer's first priority for the Kahr pistol was quality, and that is the final product."

I ended up putting a red one on my recent build so I no longer need this one. Built around a 17-4 SS Melonite QPQ treated central selector hub, two lightweight 7075-T6 Hardcoat anodized selector levers can be configured to the users needs whether the user is right or left handed. Utilizing a positive 90 degree pattern, the selector requires the manipulation you are familiar with and have come to expect in the AR-15 / AR10 family of firearms. The long lever is intended for the strong hand thumb, while the shorter lever will not interfere with your strong hand trigger finger. The rebated weak side paddle is still long enough for positive function in those weakside firing applications. Attractive, durable, and affordable, the Griffin Selector kit is the perfect companion to your Griffin Armament Charging handle or favorite build. The Kit comes with a Torx T10 key"

The PredatOBR 7.62 was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 7.62x51 Rifles. The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely ""broken down"" and stored into the toolbox. The PredatOBR handguard has locking stainless steel QD lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the barrel nut from the receiver and pull the barrel assembly free from the receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 7.61x51mm, and feature rifling in a 1/10 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8x24. Like the OBR and PredatAR rifles, Larue Tactical has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true ""free-float"" barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day-night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy.The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable / detachable using a supplied tool. The rail sections are CNC-machined from billed aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.The PredatOBR's  Port Selector Technology (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.The Larue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o'clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system.SpecificationsCaliber  7.62x51mm Nato  Barrel Length  18""  Rifling Twist Rate  1/10  Barrel Life  10,000 (approximately)  Gas System  Direct Impingement with Larue PST port selector  Trigger  Larue MBT"
