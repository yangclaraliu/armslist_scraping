You can buy both for 1050 if they are both still available. Please text me at 260-46 seven-0 nine 73. I can answer any questions or send more pics."

I have almost all the recipts somewhere and if needed i can dig them all out. Spent over 1000$ building this and it was a fun little project but again, i just dont use it and see no point in making this beauty a safe queen. Was my second build and i actually but some money into this one and loved it very well. NiB BCG, Heavy SOCOM barrel 16 inch. Mid length Gas system. (which has always been my preference) magpul flip up sights are the only sights comeing with this build no optics. Higher end Magpul furniture, angled grip. 4 30 round magpul mags, and 1 20 round steel goverment issue. Any questions i can gladly answer. I might be interested in selling all my building equiptment with this too if you wanted to get into doing it your self and modding the parts out yourself.Has an anderson lower and that is the only thing on this that was ""budget"" build. Not that ive ever had any problems with any anderson products.Again spent over 1000$ on this building it and it comes with over 100 rounds so its good to go to the range the second you pick it up. 800$ cash and not a cent cheaper is MORE THAN REASONABLE so dont low ball me on this. Ill gladly get together all the packaging i got with it and put together so you can have all that too if you want.Thank you."

This rifle has been there, done that and shows use and wear, but is in good, solid overall shape. 

The receiver and bolt numbers match.  The stock and mag #s are indistinct due to wear, I can't make them out.  I want to remove the handguard tomorrow to photo and confirm barrel number and fluted knox form.  

Serial number M3305.  No.5 Jungle Carbines only have 4 numbers from what I've learned.
The Fazakerley jungle carbines ran from FE1 to FE1000 initial production, then with no letter prefix, followed by A1 to A9999 through Z9999, as cited on enfieldcollector dot com serial numbers page.

The carbine has an 800 yard rear flip up sight.  There's plenty of clearance under this rear sight, you can see plenty of daylight side to side under the sight, which is a result of milling & lightening of the receiver.  

I don't find any import marks, , which would mean it came in to the US before 1968.
if you're local feel free to come over, check it out and prove me wrong.

The barrel band is 8 "" in front of the receiver ring (Jungle Carbine copies seem to be around 10 3/4"" as on a No. 4 rifle).

For local face-to-face sale only in the Redondo beach and adjacent South Bay L.A. areas (Hawthorne, Manhattan Beach, Torrance ...)

Also will come with some range stuff like the ammo box with a little ammo in it and ears and eyes. I have only put a few hundred rounds through it at the range once, other then that I haven't shot it. So still practically new. Basically I'm selling so cheap because there was some customizations being done to it but only got half way. First there was some stippiling done to it but I changed my mind and wanted to put some talon rubber grip around it, so I started taking off the stippiling and light sanding to smooth it out. But I never finished and forgot about doing it. You could finished it your self or redo the stippiling or what ever you want. Or leave as it is if you want, feels fine. I also took off the finger grooves for a fuller grip, and added a finger notch under the trigger guard. Basically you will not find a gen 4 19 for 300 any where, so whether you were to continue with customizing or just left it alone, its a steal either way.  If you are interested you can't text me or call (although I prefer text) at REDACTED"

(Not on our approved list.) Carried this thing off duty for about 5 years almost everyday. I preferred it over the Glock 26 because of the ergonomics and extra backstrap safety.

Sometimes the production lines get it just right. I have had ZERO malfunctions with this gun and I don't know how many rounds I've put through it. I have shot several different loads, but mainly Federal HST. This gun comes with the original box, paperwork, brush, 1 16 round mag and 2 13 round flush fit with the finger extension, as pictured. I have an additional 2 16 round mags with sleeves for an additional $25 bucks each(They go for about $37 most places.). I also have a couple of holsters if you're interested at the time of purchase.I used to work in a hot climate so I bought the stainless slide to avoid rust. Especially when carrying concealed where one might sweat on it. The gun comes with Trijicon Night Sights (a little dim) and an extended stainless mag release. The original magazine release was rusting.The XD also features a striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, and internal firing pin block. There is also a rail for attachments. These things were originally made in Croatia and are built like tanks for YEARS of use. I have no complaints and like the extra heft for less felt recoil over other similar guns, especially with full power duty defense ammunition.*** I've gotten inquiries about disassembling magazines and transfers. I use a dealer in South San Francisco. I do not disassemble magazines. I do not tranfer high capacity magazines to non-law enforcement officers in California. Please do not ask. Know your local laws before inquiring.*** I will be happy to ship for an additional cost. I will charge actual shipping cost via UPS. Per their policy, they require overnight shipping."

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer.
