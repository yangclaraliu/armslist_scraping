Round count is approximately 300. Groups were in the .5 MOA range after barrel break-in...I haven't shot any more groups, but it makes shooting steel at a distance almost too easy. The inline recoil path design basically eliminates muzzle jump and the 70* bolt throw is awesome for scope-to-hand clearance. The adjustable trigger is really very good and is currently set to the low side of the range ~2-2.25 lbs est. The price for the rifle is 1200 and it will include the 5 rd AICS magazine pictured but not the bipod. Add 950 for the Burris XTR II 4-20x50 SCR MOA/MOA scope with illuminated reticle and Seekins Precision serialized, matched rings. Would prefer to sell the rifle and scope as a package at 2150, but will sell the scope & rings separately after the rifle sells. Hate to see it go after working so hard to get my hands on one, but I just have too many irons in the fire at this point."

This reloader comes with the following Dillon Precision Conversion Kits: Model # 21439 (300, 30-338, 308), Model # 21094 (308/30-06), and additional tool heads that were all purchased separately. No reloading dies with this machine as it did not come with them and this can be verified by Dillon's Precision Products, Inc., Blue Press book (as per the book reloading dies are sold separately). Also included is the manual and DVD to assist you in setting it all up. This is a package deal, and I do not need help in selling this reloader nor will I separate/ommit any of the items shown or listed. I will also not ship so local pickup only or I will meet you somewhere within a reasonable distance to Lincoln, NE. I am selling this for my Father and he is asking $650 OBO. Cash Only-No Exceptions. All reasonable offers (no lowball offers) will be considered.
Reloading with Dillon’s XL 650 (taken from Dillon Website)
Dillon’s XL650 is one of the easier progressive loaders in the world to learn to operate. Place a bullet onto the appropriate cartridge case in the XL650s shellplate. Lower the operating handle. The XL650 will automatically deprime and resize the case. It drops the next empty case to be inserted into the shellpIate, dispenses the powder charge, flares the case mouth, seats the bullet to its proper depth and crimps it tight. All automatically. All you touch is the operating handle. Lift the handle up. The XL650 will automatically rotate the shellplate to the next position, ejecting the loaded round into a convenient bin. It also pushes the next case into the shellplate.               
No Adjustments
Of all the steps in reloading, the adjustment of the reloading dies is the most critical. With the Dillon XL650s removable toolhead, your dies will stay in perfect adjustment. There’s no need to screw them in and out – even when changing calibers! The XL650 toolhead is held in place by two steel pins. There’s less to go wrong, less to remember."

Front sight is also painted flourescent orange, but is also removable. Ghost 3.5 connector is installed, and Pierce frame plug is installed.The original connector, will of course, be included.

Everything on the gun is original and it comes with the cardboard box with matching serial number label attached, Rossi instruction and safety manual, and Rossi safety warnings manual. This Rossi is in excellent condition, having thirty rounds fired through it in the approximately thirty years I have owned it. I bought it, fired fifteen rounds of a fifty round box of ammo through it, cleaned and wiped it down, and stored it and the ammunition in a climate controlled area until I took it back out earlier this month. I bought new ammo and fired fifteen more rounds through it before firing the rest of the old box of ammo and some new stuff through my new S&W 442. This Rossi is a great little shooter and, being heavier than my 442, was more accurate comparing the fifteen rounds from each gun.

What I was able to find:""The Wyoming Arms Parker is a single action gun somewhat similar to a 1911 Government Model. Two major differences, however, are the elimination of the grip safety and the use of a slide mounted rather than frame mounted manual safety. The Parker can still be carried with the hammer cocked and the safety engaged, but the slide can still be operated so it can't truly be considered ""cocked-and-locked"" when in this mode.""Wyoming Arms no longer produces this gun or are they still in existance. I received through a trade and the fit and finish look to be in very good condition. I don't have any 45's in my collection so I am selling it as it makes no sense for it to become a safe queen taking up space, it is best to go to someone whom will appreciate and use or add to their collection. It has one magazine, safety is on the slide, single action. Action feels smooth and trigger pull feels crisp around 4.5 to 5lbs. Listing for best offer as I have no idea on the value but I am not giving it away."

This thing is a riot and a fantastic shooter. It is in overall good shape with a couple blemishes pictured below from being stored in a holster (the blueing on the underside of the frame directly behind the trigger guard has wear and there are a couple small pits on the side of the barrel right near the .22lr identifier). The lockup and timing are good and it has no functional issues. I believe the previous owner used a lightened main spring to improve the trigger pull, it still reliably ignites most ammo but as always with .22lr some brands are finicky, any standard J frame spring will fit for about $8 if your stash of .22lr has particularly hard primers. Prefer to do my transfers at 1st Stop Firearms in Englewood."

Beautiful, unfired ""Safe Queen"".  I had Ed build it for me after shooting an increadible 1911 that he built for me.  What a fantastic gunsmith.
The rifle has a 16"" barrel, an increadible trigger (unlike any Ar trigger I have ever tried), and numerous upgrade.  A Trigicon 4x32 ACOG and a 6.5 MOA Trijicon RMR.  I have this optics set up on a couple of my other AR's (non-safe queens) and love it, allows shooting at distance as well as CQB range.
Considering that the optics retail for about $2,900, you are getting a Vanden Berg custom rifle less than the price of a low-end factory AR."
