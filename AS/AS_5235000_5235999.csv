The Model 1842 musket was the primary infantry weapon of both the Union and Confederate armies during the first two years of the Civil War.

This musket has standard bright barrel, lock and furniture and a black walnut, oil finished stock. The lock plate is marked: ""HARPERS / FERRY / 1847"" in three vertical lines at the rear of the hammer and ""eagle and shield / ""U.S."" is stamped in front of the hammer.

The value of the pistol lies in the details specified by Wiley from his life long firearm experience. The goal is to produce the most accurate and reliable carry gun out to the box. “Everything you need and nothing you don’t.” - Carbon Blue Steel Commander sized Series 70 fire controls Blue Aluminum Officers Lightweight Frame rear slide serrations - Special metal work by Pete Single. Front strap is checkered @ 25 lpi with a generous relief cut where the front strap meets the trigger guard (hi-cut to the max) so the pistol sits low in the hand. Average size hands should be able to get whole hand on the grip without the little finger hanging off the bottom. The relief cut blends gracefully from the checkering to the trigger guard. The heal of the frame and mainspring is generously rounded for comfort of concealed carry and shooting. The fit is very good. The magazine well is also fully beveled 360 degrees around with a long gentle taper. - 4.25 National Match barrel - Novak extra wide (.170) notch LoMount rear sight - Novak Brass bead front sight - Altamont “finger print” Tactical Oval grips round butt (altered for the short butt) - Controls---Mag catch safety beavertail---as on other Wiley Clapp 1911s - Original long trigger no holes - Right side of slide unmarked. Left side same as O4840 - Special serial # run: “0001WCC

Never really came, but now I'm ready to sell.$180 for rifle, cleaning kit.Case not included.ABOUT TEST FIRING: I'd prefer not, but let me explain. In an attempted sale, I let someone test fire who (without telling me of their intentions) wanted to ""try out"" a Mosin. They told me it kicked too hard and didn't purchase (obviously). If you are unsure about if you want a Mosin, talk to someone you know who has one or rent one if you can find a place, but I don't want to do that again. Wasted trip and having to clean a gun I didn't shoot was just very, very annoying. HOWEVER! I cannot stress enough that this rifle is safe to shoot with accuracy that is on par with other Tula 91/30s. Would be more than happy to meet at a gunsmith that does free inspections to have them assure you this rifle is safe. They are just -very- SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE, and DURABLE. No rust and proper headspace = good-to-goIf you find it absolutely necessary to shoot the rifle before purchase, I'll have to sell you ALL 20 rounds at a dollar a piece.-----Original description: Selling my 1938 Tula Round. Matching numbers, but no bayonet. Metal is in beautiful shape, no pitting. Safe to shoot, proper headspace, etc. Bolt is very smooth, you don't have to force anything, even after shooting for a while. Rifling is great, even I was able to get very nice groups from a standing position. It's in great condition, shoots wonderfully, fits many of the most desirable aspects, and this thing is ready to roll (no extra work required like those cosmoline-soaked internet-store mosins)."

This is the rock solid setup that the U.S Military used to repurpose many of the M14 rifles that were in storage and bring them up to a modern platform with increased accuracy.This M1A EBR features an adjustable stock and adjustable cheekpiece, pistol grip, and plenty of picatinny rail space for added gear. Included with the stock is the Sage Detachable Cantilever Sight Base (DCSB) that provides an absolute rock steady solution for mounting a scope to the rifle. (The scope pictured is also included with the sale). The attached scope is a Nikon Monarch 3 4x-16x BDC reticle and has been sighted in at 100 yards.A few internal upgrades to the rifle were also added such as a Sadlak Op Rod Spring Guide and a SEI Muzzle Brake. The combination of the muzzle brake and the EBR stock produces almost no felt recoil and allows for very quick follow up shots.This rifle is very accurate, typically producing 1 MOA goups, and has been my favorite hog hunting rifle. However I am now looking to sell it for my next project.

This is the BRM-S model with the nice notched legs for same length per leg and it swivels from side to side. I made a big mistake while looking at it thinking it was the prone model that went to 27.5"" and asked the guy about shooting from a sitting position and he said it was perfect for that... not so much... This is the model that is made to shoot from prone or from a bench only. If you are looking for the one that has the long legs to shoot from a sitting position this is not it. I thought I was getting a good deal but aparently not since it is not what I wanted. I took it out of the package, extended the legs and that was it. It did not even go on the rifle. I could not get the guy to exchange it as he said ""All sales final""... Nice. Well I am selling this for the same price I paid for it so someone who wants to shoot prone or bench, this is the one for you. No tax, no shipping just what I paid for it.I travel for a living across most of NC from Winston-Salem to Wilmington. If you are interested in getting a brand new Harris bipod I'm sure we can set something up and you can take a look at it and see that it is brand new. Thanks for looking."

This is a Remington 581 which was the more affordable version of the famous 541 - it has the same action but with a simple oak stock. With quality ammo I can print quarter size groups at 35 yards, I don't doubt that someone who is a better shot than I am can coax even smaller groups out of it at longer distances. The trigger is fantastic on this rifle, it's very crisp and there is zero take up and zero overtravel and pulls around 4lbs. The stock was refinished by the previous owner and it looks very good. Only issues are some scratches along the barrel and on the action (see update below).   Comes with a 10rd factory mag and a new 4x32 Cabela's Rimfire Scope.

Sounds familiar?I have a Glock 30S I recently bought new. It is complete with everything in the box - mags, loader, brush, tool, lock, both keys, docs, factory box. I just paid $579.95 for it. A couple of boxes of rounds went through it. I'm not used to taking it apart and cleaning it so I will ship it the way it is. Nothing at all wrong with it and my dealer has seen it.I'm in PA right next to DE and MD, and not so far from NJ. If it fits, I'll meet you at an FFL or dealer there.  My dealer is waiving the normal fee, which is about $50, and only charging actual USPS Priority Mail second day rate, which could be under $30, so it is realistic to ship.The gun is in the box, all locked up with the keys tucked in, ready to go. Feel free to ask me any questions. I have lived on line, spent twenty years in a ham radio store, ride a motorcycle, have a rescued lab and some cats, what more can I say... I want you to be satisfied.Thanks, take care and safe shooting!!"
