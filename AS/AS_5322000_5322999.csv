This gun is so much sweeter than the cheap 1911 garbage you see so often these days, grips Better and points better. Small amount of bluing wear on exterior, internals are excellent and it has hardly been shot. The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness. Whether you''re a competitive shooter, firearms enthusiast, or armed professional, the Witness product line can fill all your needs. Quality, value, comfort, accuracy and dependability. EAA Witness...No Limit ! European American Armory is proud to be the exclusive importer of Tanfoglio products in the USA."

That sounds big but this thing will chamber up to a 700gr in lead cast. I do not have a factory blue case but it will come with a new black hard case. Will trade for:Im really interested in quality AKs or ARs. Upper shelf 1911s will also be considered. AR pistol/SBR types are what I really want, or piston driven ARs.This set up cost $1500 new so it's $1000 cash or $1200 trade value. I won't respond to low ball offers.

The SureFire X400U-A-RD Ultra WeaponLight integrates powerful, high intensity 500 lumen white light illumination and high visibility laser aiming capabilities in one compact rail mountable package, an extremely effective combination for close to longer range engagements in law enforcement, military, and self-defense applications. 

A high performance LED generates 500 lumens of brilliant white light that is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a beam with a bright central area, providing greatly extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The X400 Ultra produces tactical level lightÃ�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark adapted visionÃ�Â¯Ã�Â¿Ã�Â½for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

The X400 Ultra's laser is located below the primary light, and its aiming adjustment mechanism uses Nylok screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The X400U-A-RD Ultra features our original high visibility 5-milliwatt / 635 nm red laser.

The versatile X400 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock system permits rapid attachment/detachment to either universal or Picatinny rails. Its integral ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional DG grip switches are available for use with a pistol, and an XT07 tape switch permits the X400 Ultra to be activated when attached to a long gun without altering your grip on your weapon. 

The high strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture.

This example is in 70% condition showing evidence of hunting use. These rifles are held in high regard by hog hunters operating in densely forested or brushy areas. It is light, handy, very quick handling and pointing. The extra barrel length really positively affects the terminal ballistics of the 44 magnum and the speedy semi automatic nature of follow up shots makes for a life saver when things get hairy on a hog hunt. This rifle is mechanically flawless and even deceptively accurate. This is also an excellent high powered low recoil youth rifle.

Also included are Obsidion Arms aluminum base pads. The Apex flat trigger makes the trigger pull nice and crisp. The Dawson Precision sights are easy to pick up targets at 15+ yards and the Obsidian Arms aluminum base pads are designed to resist damage from repeated mag drops. This gun is very accurate. I intended it for IDPA but haven't had time to compete and now I am working on other projects so I decided to sacrifice this gun since I don't keep safe queens. It was bought in Feb 2016 and only had 100 shots (2 boxes of ammo) through it. It has been cleaned and sits in the safe. This is a very reliable pistol with excellent reviews. 
Included with the pistol (what I paid):
Sig 320 w/ holster + 2 mags = $600 (holster not pictured)
Apex Flat Trigger = $45
Dawson Precision Competition Sights = $80
Obsidian Arms Aluminum Base Pads = $18/ea (x2)
In total everything plus taxes/shipping amounted to around $840. I am selling it for $550 which is a steal because it retails for around $600 without any of the accessories. I prefer cash though I am open to interesting trades or partial trades + cash. Trade value at around $700+ for New or Like New firearms. I am not interested in anything chambered in 40 S&W. To purchase you must be a U.S. citizen and a legal resident of Texas. CHL/LTC preferred. I am a CHL holder. Must be willing to sign a firearms bill of sale. I live near the Westchase area and am willing to meet halfway at a public space."

I think it has only fired 18 rounds. Rounds, mind you, not magazines. It is roughly the size of a Glock 19.  The pistol comes equipped with Talon grips. Like all Springfields, it has a trigger safety and a grip safety. Both must be engaged for the weapon to fire. Other safety features indicate whether the gun is cocked and if it has a round chambered. This version includes a holster, magazine holder and speed loader -- all of which fit into pre-cut slots in the very nice fired plastic case -- as well as two 13-round factory magazines and two 16-round extended magazines. (You only see three in one of the photos because the fourth doesn't have a space in the case.) If you can't take 'em down with 58 rounds, you probably shouldn't be shooting. Will sell for $425. That's $50 off my original asking price, and I haven't seen any others on here that inexpensive. I need to sell this quickly. Email me. Or text me at (FourOhFive) six5nine sixTwoAte5.  Thanks."

I have a Leopold FX-II 2.5x28mm Fixed Intermediate Eye Relief Scope. With the scope set forward on the rails you do not need to close both eyes to clearly see the crosshairs allowing you to stay aware of your entire field of view. It has an extra 5 round polymer mag with dust cover in addition to the 10 round aluminum mag that came with it. It has a padded shoulder strap included. I also have a Laser Ammo cartridge with .308 adapter and target that allows for dry fire practice at anywhere from 10ft to however far out you can hit such a small target. It is great for saving money on ammo. I also have the adapter to make the Laser Ammo cartridge so it will work with a 12guage shotgun if you like to practice your center of mass shots. The cartridge itself is made to work with 9mm guns. Although it will not cycle the slide, so a DA pistol or pump shotgun is best. I have a pack of batteries that are a fraction of what Laser Ammo charges and works fine, I believe I have about 54 of them left, so don't worry about running out of juice. It is a great value as all of the Laser Ammo parts together would cost around $300 realistically depending on who you get it through and it is really the best laser ammo. I did quite a bit of research on it. Despite all this if you don't want it, I will deduct $150 off the total price.I have also included 15 168 grain rounds, sufficient for hunting or blowing up small objects. I would prefer to sell this all together for the price listed, but to leave off the laser ammo if requested as I am sure I can come up with a use for it. Anyone who knows this rifle knows the scope that I have on it was practically made for it, it is sufficient for hunting and good for low light conditions where zoom scopes are harder to use. I do not want to leave the scope off this rifle as I do not have another use for it. Everything is in like-new condition, no scratches scuffs or significant use. I has had around 30 rounds put through it, I mostly used it with the laser ammo for dry fire practice which does not hurt the firing pin, as the round acts like a snap cap.I will meet you in person anywhere in the Atlanta area if you are a serious buyer, and cash only."

I have exceptionally maintained this Handgun! It had a mis firing problem but I recently stripped it down to the bone and cleaned thorough. I replaced the striker retainer pin and test fired 500+ rounds at everything weapons range. I did not have 1 misfire! The only reason I am even advertising this information is because I value truth. These guns will have a misfire problem if dry fired EXCESSIVELY! When I bought it from a gun show it was a display. Given that information I am sure it was dry fired quite a bit. I would be more than happy to meet at a range and let a potential buyer fire as many rounds as they please, on their dime! I am very confident in this gun!Includes: Handun, Case, lock, 2 mags (one extended), and 50 rounds of 9mm. Why I am selling it: I have recently come across a Glock 19 I would like to buy And need some money to put toward it. It's well over the price of this firearm! Pros: magazine capacity(17+1, 13 +1), trigger pull, conceal ability (3.3 in barrel), modification potential, accuracy(most likely going to sell my xds same caliber, same barrel length. I am way more accurate with the XD v's. The Xds. Make me a good offer!Cons: MY EDC is the xds and it is very light, with out a good holster and belt the XD w/ extended mag can be cumbersome. Gen 1 so no fiber optic sights. PRICE: Aquired for $500, Extended mag was $50 (Genuine Springfield built magazine), and the Galco holster was $80.

The internal hammer of the 642 eliminates the risk of the hammer getting snagged on clothing, holsters, or purses when drawing the weapon in a self-defense situation. The low profile, ramp front sight and the fixed notch rear sight also aid in snag-free presentation of the weapon. The 642 is double-action only, making it an extremely fast personal-defensive handgun to deploy in stressful situations, as there is nothing to remember to do except point and pull the trigger. The synthetic grips and inherently ergonomic design afford natural pointability. The Model 642 is built on Smith & Wesson's famous J-Frame, it has a 5-shot cylinder rated for +P .38 Special ammunition. Stainless steel and alloy construction resist corrosion caused by humidity and perspiration when the revolver is carried close to the body. The Smith & Wesson 642 Airweight Double-Action Revolver carries easily, deploys rapidly, and has enough firepower to handle any self-defense scenario.
