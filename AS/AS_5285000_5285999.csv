The gun is notable for its appearances in film, and is also the first compact Beretta pistol to feature several improvements commonly found in Beretta pistols for the rest of the century. The 70 Series improved upon the M1934/M1935 (and the later .22 LR offering of the same as the Model 948) in several ways. The swivel-lever safety of the M1934/35 was too difficult to operate one handed, so the 70 Series started out with the same cross-bolt safety as the M1951, but this safety was also difficult to operate with a single hand, and could also accidentally be switched on or off depending on the user's grip. After only a few years, the cross bolt safety was replaced with the thumb-activated, frame-mounted lever safety found on most Beretta pistols in the latter half of the 20th century, and indeed most single-action or traditional double-action semi-automatic pistols in production today, until the relocation of the safety to the slide with the Model 92S in 1983.As the replacement for the M1934/5 in Beretta's compact/medium pistol line, the Model 70 integrated the M1951's takedown lever, guide rod system, slide stop, and magazine release button in the lower part of the grip. The M1934/5 would hold open on empty due to the magazine follower blocking the slide, but removing the magazine would cause the slide to be released unless its safety was subsequently engaged (which would lock the gun open until switched back to Fire mode); this process was slow and cumbersome, which is why the slide stop improvement was implemented in the M1951 and later models of service pistols. The slide stop changed partway through the production run of the pistol from the same ""pedal"" style release as the M1951 to a round button at the end of the lever. A softer, longer curve that tapered up to the front of the gun was also added to make the trigger guard more sleek. Near the end of its production, the same thumb shelf of the 76W's left grip panel was added to the 70S. The magazines retain the spur at the front of the floor plate, common to both the M1934/5 and M1951, as is common for many pistols with a European-style magazine release (a hinged latch in the bottom of the grip against the magazine's floor plate), and also some compact pistols as a means of extending the grip surface while keeping the profile of the pistol small."

Anyone can purchase a New BCM upper and lower purchased seperately $785 Just purchased a slightly used DD  for $845 with full rail etc.   I cannot in good conscience buy your used colt or other rifle for the price of a new one, the market has collapsed and just because you paid a premium for it during the height of the panic, I cannot help you because you bought it at that time.  I am not trying to insult anyone but these are legit prices, your rifle is not worth more because it is your rifle or you paid XXX for it.  If you buy a car and use it and drive it off the lot you lose some 40% as it comes off the lot.  Clothes, cars and even houses are losing value in this market.  I understand your anger because you paid 2 or 3 times what something was worth because you thought they were going to ban it. But this is the market, and this is the situation we are in.  If you would like to sell your rifle for a realistic price and understand the market Ill be happy to buy it from you.Thanks for looking and have a great day."

C&R eligible. SN: 279.  ""The FP-45 Liberator was a pistol manufactured by the United States military during World War II for use by resistance forces in occupied territories. The Liberator was never issued to American or other Allied troops and there is no documented instance of the weapon being used for its intended purpose, though the intended recipients, irregulars and resistance fighters, rarely kept detailed records due to the inherent risks if the records were captured by the enemy. Many FP-45 pistols were never distributed and were destroyed by Allied forces after the war; most of those distributed were lost or disposed of without any combat use. The concept was suggested by a Polish military attaché in March 1942. The project was assigned to the US Army Joint Psychological Warfare Committee and was designed for the United States Army two months later by George Hyde of the Inland Manufacturing Division of the General Motors Corporation in Dayton, Ohio. Production was undertaken by General Motors Guide Lamp Division to avoid conflicting priorities with Inland Division production of the M1 carbine. The army designated the weapon the Flare Projector Caliber .45 hence the designation FP-45. This was done to disguise the fact that a pistol was being mass-produced. The original engineering drawings label the barrel as ""tube"", the trigger as ""yoke"", the firing pin as ""control rod"", and the trigger guard as ""spanner"". The Guide Lamp Division plant in Anderson, Indiana assembled a million of these guns. The Liberator project took about six months from conception to the end of production with about 11 weeks of actual manufacturing time, done by 300 workers. The FP-45 was a crude, single-shot pistol designed to be cheaply and quickly mass-produced. It had just 23 largely stamped and turned steel parts that were cheap and easy to manufacture. It fired a .45 caliber pistol cartridge from an unrifled barrel. Due to this limitation, it was intended for short range use, 1–4 yards (0–5 m). Its maximum effective range was only about 25 feet (7.6 m). At longer range, the bullet would begin to tumble and stray off course. The Liberator was shipped in a cardboard box with 10 rounds of .45 ACP ammunition, a wooden dowel to remove the empty cartridge case, and an instruction sheet in comic strip form showing how to load and fire the weapon. Extra ammunition could be stored in the pistol grip. The Liberator was a crude and clumsy weapon, never intended for front line service. It was originally intended as an insurgency weapon to be mass dropped behind enemy lines to resistance fighters in occupied territory. A resistance fighter was to recover the gun, sneak up on an Axis occupier, kill or incapacitate him, and retrieve his weapons. The pistol was valued as much for its psychological warfare effect as its actual field performance. It was believed that if vast quantities of these handguns could be delivered into Axis-occupied territory, it would have a devastating effect on the morale of occupying troops. The plan was to drop it in such great quantities that occupying forces could never capture or recover all of them. It was hoped that the thought of thousands of these unrecovered weapons potentially in the hands of the citizens of occupied countries would have a deleterious effect on enemy morale. General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff never saw the practicality in mass dropping the Liberator over occupied Europe, and authorized distribution of fewer than 25,000 of the half million FP-45 pistols shipped to Great Britain for the French resistance. Generals Joseph Stilwell and Douglas MacArthur were similarly unenthusiastic about the other half of the pistols scheduled for shipment to the Pacific. The Army then turned 450,000 Liberators over to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which preferred to supply Resistance fighters in both theatres with more effective weapons whenever possible. French use of the FP-45 remains undocumented. The OSS did distribute a few to Greek resistance forces in 1944. One hundred thousand FP-45 pistols were shipped to China in 1943, but the number actually distributed remains unknown."""

These were popular in Europe at the turn of the century and many were brought home by GI's from WWI&II. This Drilling or combination gun is in very good plus condition, its very solid and works perfect. The screws are all lined up just how they left the factory and none of them are buggered up, an indication that its not been fooled with. It has a unique rear sight that flips up when you select the rifle barrel and that also has a set trigger. Its chambered for the normal 8x57JR rifle cartridge, its not common but still available. The shotgun barrels have extractors and the chambers are 2 1/2's inches for the European size 16 gauge shot shells. So its a gun that has collector appeal for its uniqueness and originality yet its still very use able. No rust or cracks, it retains 90% of its original finish on both the metal and the wood. The bores are in excellent condition and its a solid shooter, the rifle barrel has a .321 bore. There is a very well made Trap on the bottom of the butt stock that holds 4 extra rifle cartridges, its factory and very well done."
