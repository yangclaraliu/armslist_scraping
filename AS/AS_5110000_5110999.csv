The Nitride process converts the steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered with it due to the uneven application of chrome inside a barrel's bore. This 16"" barrel features a 1 in 7"" twist and is threaded 5/8""-24 at the muzzle for easy installation of flash hiders, muzzle brakes, and/or sound suppressors. It utilizes the versatile carbine length gas system, a good choice for this cartridge if various weights and types of ammunition are to be used. Most subsonic and supersonic loads, fired from either a suppressed or unsuppressed gun, are compatible with this configuration. However, some subsonic ammunition may not always cycle reliably under adverse conditions or in a severely fouled firearm without a sound suppressor attached to provide extra backpressure. Barrel assembly includes a carbine gas tube, low profile steel gas block, barrel extension and locator pin. Specifications:Length: 16""Material: 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel                                                                                                             Contour: MediumChamber: 300 AAC BlackoutTwist Rate: 1 in 7""Chrome Lined: NoFinish: Black Nitride / MeloniteM4 Feed Ramps: YesMuzzle Thread Pattern: 5/8""-24Gas Port Location: CarbineNew in package, can meet at my shop in New Albany or will ship anywhere CONUS for $8.95. Thanks for looking."

MagazinesThe iconic bullpup-style Steyr AUG has been one of the most recognizable rifles in the world since its adoption by the Austrian army in 1977 and is now available for civilian use as the Steyr AUG A3 M1, a semi-convertible ambidextrous rifle platform with an adjustable short-stroke, gas-piston operation chambered for 5.56x45mm (.223 Remington) ammunition in stock 10-, 30- or 42-round magazines. The multi-configurable M1 variant of the AUG A3 platform is the latest generation of the venerated bullpup platform. Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is available in a Short-Rail version, a High-Rail version as well as an Integrated-Optic version with either a 1.5X or 3X scope. The AUG A3 M1 Optics version has a more traditional AUG scope tube with exceptionally bright and clear optical elements, modernized with the addition of three Picatinny rail sections to accommodate accessories like a close-quarters holographic sight. With 16 numbered slots, the High-Rail version was designed to accommodate the widest range of optic choices, and the 11-slot Short-Rail version was designed for use with a reflex sight or a longer-eye relief optic. The rail and optics platforms on all three AUG A3 M1 versions are interchangeable via the three base screws that thread from the underside of the top of the receiver.  The AUG A3 M1 boasts am overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG’s matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessly inside the receiver for unparalleled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions. The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject bolt and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger. The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire. The AUG A3 M1 stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic and are available in Black, Green, Mud and White colors. The rifle is available in either the standard version that accepts genuine Steyr AUG magazines or as a NATO version that accepts standard STANAG (AR) magazines.  - See more at: https://steyrarms.com/steyr-aug-a3-m1.html#sthash.1PJkDQrX.dpuf"

Took this in on a trade, and sadly at some time in its life, somebody decided it should be cleaned. In other words... the 200 years of patina are now gone. It is a great looking gun, both locks and triggers are super tight with tight half cock and no play, both work great. Apears to still have the original ram rod with brass end. Beautiful walnut furniture is in excellent shape showing no cracks or repairs. The checkering is there but not crisp. Unbelievably the stock has no dents or scratch's and has fantastic grain.  The only name on the gun is ""REAL TWIST"" between the barrels. If you need more pictures just let me know. Vintage hammer guns like theses sell at gun shows as non shootable wall hangers. The prices can vary from as low as a hundred bucks and up, depending on make and condition. Some of these guns are highly sought after and are still shot in vintage shotgun clubs by collectors. The muzzle loading SxS hammer guns are harder to find than the break open cartridge ggns too. I have pictures of proof marks if interested. Maybe somone out there can shed some more light on who the maker is or age??? The bores are in good visual shape. The trigger gaurd looks to be light colored brass?? as well as engraved forearm cap.  Great candidate for a restoration, or to It would make a beautiful wall hanger for the cabin or gun room. Asking $250. or trade for???"
