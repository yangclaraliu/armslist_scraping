Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

This is a ""last ditch"" model, exhibiting the level of urgency needed during the last days of the war. Rough wood, machine marks etc. This one  has an non matching correct type 99 bolt, but maybe its what they had laying around. Mum is defaced with a mark across it, but it is present. Looks to still have original grease in nooks and crannies. Shows typical age and handling, howver I would assume alot of this is just from the manufacturing. Have not shot it. Only issue i am aware of is the bolt stop center catch holds bolt from cycling. Can work bolt, it clicks fine but needs a good nudge to lift bolt. Probably a fairly simple fix, but thats about it.. It is complete but needs minor attention. , no shipping, I am in DELAVAN so you need to find where that is. Pricea are only rising on all WW2 guns! What ya waiting for? A chance to fill out that collection with one of the rarest arsenals in the Arisaka line."
