Only a few companies do this, and it's another reason I bought this bow.The bow has been tuned by Olde English near Tipp City, Ohio and is completely ready for hunting or target shooting. You could buy a Hoyt Carbon for this price and have nothing ready to go, or this bow and have everything for the same price. the main reason I bought this bow was the draw cycle. It's smooth as silk.

The draw poundage is 70# and thus it is set up at the IBO standard. When I changed from 28.5"" to the now 30"" draw length, it was tuned by Olde English Outfitters, one of the oldest and most established bow shop in the region. That was done in the Spring of 2015 and I have only shot it to test it since then.The bow has always been stored properly (always indoors in a bow case), has never been wet or dropped.

I purchased the rifle new in 1991 and hunted with it only there seasons before switching calibers. It hasn't been fired since 1996, and has been relegated to the safe ever since. Except for looking at it to clean it and write up this ad, it hasn't even been touched since 1998 when I last moved.This is a tremendous caliber, and is lethal to any animal on the entire North American continent. It has about the flattest trajectory of any big game hunting caliber available. Ammo is readily available at Walmart and virtually any outdoor sporting goods store.I've put very few rounds through this rifle.

The scope is offset from the center of the bore so the iron sights can still be used with the optic mounted, a nice feature.Rifle also has a modified Tapco G2 trigger group with slightly lighter pull, the trigger pull is fantastic and breaks tight and smooth. Only non corrosive ammo was run through this rifle to test the trigger and sight in the optic, less than 200 rounds.

It features a custom blue coated stainless steel beavertail frame and a two-tone polished slide. Other features include polished controls and walnut grips with jet funnel and the side faces of the lock are finely polished.

It has miles of MOLLE webbing for attachment of even more rifle mags, pistol mags, radio pouches, an IFAK, hydration carrier on the back, or whatever you feel like throwing on there.

A lot of the brass furniture is still in the rough, not polished. The bore looks good and the nipple threads are good. The stock is solid looking with no cracks, and has the 3-hole barrel tang. The older finish on the gun gives it a more vintage and antique look. If you want it to look more modern or newer, you will have to polish the brass and re-blue the barrel.

I did a bunch of trading and selling and finally got one.  The sad thing is, since I carry a Glock, I found that it was a very bad idea to shoot one style and carry another.  If I shot the 1911 at the range I was going to have to start carrying a 1911.  The mechanics are just too different and I'm going to get myself killed if I don't get rid of this.  I love to shoot it but it's got to go.  The other day I unholstered the Glock and was trying to flip off the safety.  It's a Stainless Steel Para Ordinance Black Ops double stack 1911, with rail.  Factory night sights, 5"" ramped barrel, skeleton match grade trigger, G10 grips, 2 Para mags, 2 Mec-Gar mags, case, paperwork and that stupid lock they are forced to provide."

Made by Colt Defense, it started out as a Colt factory short barreled rifle (SBR) which was sold to US Government agencies, Military, State law enforcement agencies, police departments and class 3/SOT dealers. Colt never released these as non-NFA registered rifles at any time so they are very rare. What makes this lower even rarer is that it has been DEREGISTERED from the ATF’s NFA registry and is NO LONGER CONSIDERED a class 3 firearm! It is now classified as a regular Type 01 rifle receiver and now built as a regular semi-auto rifle without any NFA restrictions or additional federal tax stamp. This particular receiver was originally sold to a class 3 Law Enforcement dealer as a whole rifle (SBR) and then was later deregistered. This model with these markings is the current Colt product for 2015 for all of their SBR’s and regular civilian rifles to include the model 6921, 6933, 6943, 6945, 6920 and 6940.
