A company named “Aero-Precision”. Aero Precision’s roots are deeply tied to aerospace, and their drive for clean, perfect engineering and machining stems from that. When you’re building something that will fly in the air, there is no margin for error. They take that same approach in the firearms industry. Not every manufacturer will have razor thin tolerance levels. Not every manufacturer will personally oversee the development, design and machining of every part that comes off the line. They’re not every manufacturer.  This is a multi-caliber lower, meaning that it can be used for either .223 Remington, or 5.56 NATO, more on that later.My barrel choice was a tough one. I decided to stick with the standard carbine length. After some research I decided on the Pickett’s Mill Armory 223 Wylde stainless steel barrel. Highly rated, corrosion resistant, and (allegedly) more accurate than a chrome molly barrel.  My next decision was trigger. The standard ar trigger is about an 8 pound pull, and feels gritty. I opted for the Velocity match trigger. 3.5 pound pull, and crisp solid action, nearly identical to a bolt action rifle. Another advantage is that it is a drop in solution. No springs, pegs, etc.Now, for the lower receiver parts kit. I opted for the aero precision safety, the Odin works extended bolt release, extended takedown pins, and the Odin works extended mag release. I have big hands and do not want to wander around trying to find any little buttons.  I wanted a comfortable grip that would accommodate different size hands. I opted for the soft over molded Hogue grip. The Hogue Overmolded pistol grip combines the durability of a fiberglass core with the comfort of rubber overmolding. Rounding out the lower receiver build I needed a stock and stock assembly. I went with a standard magpull stock, an aero precision tube and hardware, but went with something new for the spring. The JP Enterprises Silent captured spring system (SCS) adds several advantages over the standard spring. First, it eliminates at toy like springing scraping sound found in the standard setup. Secondly it eliminates bolt wobble, the difference can be felt when you pull the charging handle.. Solid and smooth. Thirdly, it reduces recoil significantly, and this level can be adjusted!  I already covered the barrel, let’s have a look at a handguard so we don’t get burned. There are hundreds of choices in this area. Having monkey arms, I wanted a long handguard and was shocked at the high dollar price tag these were asking for. Then I stumbled upon the FireTacSports 15"" Super Slim Keymod Free Floating guard. Free floating guards attach only at the upper receiver and the barrel. You probably also noticed my muzzle velocity reducer as well. This is the GRG competition muzzle break with sound forwarder.  Very versatile piece. You can remove the sound forwarder for a standard break, or have it on, and it pushes a HUGE amount of sound forward and away from sensitive ears. I did a standard low profile gas block and tube instead of a piston setup.Now for the bold carrier group. I was AMAZED at the different options out there! Phosphate, nitride, Nickel Boron, EXO Nickel boron, Melanite and the list goes on. I chose the Fail Zero EXO system. All critical parts are coated with EXO Nickel Boron technology that provides permanents “dry lubricity”, extreme durability, and increased wear and corrosion resistance. And a patented Nickel Boron coating will reduce friction and improve the overall performance. I was skeptical about this “Dry Lubrication claim, however after reviews, and YouTube videos I was sold. Ok, all the parts are accounted for, what other items were needed? Well, lube and grease. For the barrel, and MVB I used a Moly Lithium ($4 at Walmart) as that is what my research said was best. No carbon, just molly lithium. And for my safety, mag release and Bolt carrier group (lubricity be damned) firing pin etc I used a product called “Slip2000 EWL (extreme Weapon Lubricant)” Every site I visited said this was the ONLY real option, and it’s really cheap to boot!!"

This pistol was so accurate, that it pushed my legendary SIG 210 9mm to the selling block several years ago. I don't shoot that much any more, so I just decided to see if some other gun enthusiast might be interested? I don't need to sell any of my guns, so my asking price will be my selling price. This gun is still like new and comes with everything that it came with from the Custom Shop when I ordered it. $1750 CASH or multiple pistol trades with “boot” or AK-47 variants with “boot.” Please no junk or anything that you can't sell already on your own. This gun is for the person that wants only the “BEST” and can afford it. You won't find one of these in your local gun store.When ever I decide to sell one of my high end guns, I offer the following: Come take a look at my gun, and if you like it, I will give you up to 60 days to sell your gun/guns to come up with the remaining balance. I am a gun enthusiast and not a gun dealer or collector. I can make this statement, and that is, ""it will sell to the first person that comes and looks at it?"" The Pro-Tek I begins life as a CZ 75 Compact D PCR pistol. Once it is turned over to the custom shop in Mesa, Arizona the transformation begins! They completely de-horn the pistol. They replace the original rubber grips, and blend a set of textured aluminum grips into the frame, so that the fit of the grips is perfect. This lessens the width of the pistol from 1.34 inches in its original PCR configuration to 1.14 inches in the Pro-Tek I version. The slimmer grip frame seems to accentuate the curve of the back-strap as it melts into your hand.The slide is given an octagonal cut with a flat top, and this completely changes the lines of the pistol giving it a streamlined appearance. This pistol also has excellent three-dot night sights. The rear sight is a low profile wedge type, that is adjustable for elevation.The de-cocker has been cut back to make it less obtrusive without sacrificing its function or ease of manipulation by the shooter. CZ’s competition hammer is also installed on the Pro-Tek I model. The slide is given an anodized Bronze/Gold finish, and the aluminum frame is manufactured with a glossy polycoat finishAll of the controls (de-cocker, slide stop lever and magazine release) on the pistol are in easy reach of your right thumb. The magazine release button is slightly extended but smooth and de-burred; when it is activated the magazines fall free. The magazine well has been beveled to augment the process of recharging the pistol with a fresh magazine. All in all, there is very little they didn’t think of to attain their goal of making the Pro-Tek I the ultimate CCW pistol. This gun has the smoothest DA trigger pull that you will ever experience on any gun, and the SA trigger pull when cocked, breaks like my Custom Les Baer 1911.As wonderful as this pistol is to hold and look at, the best experience comes once you hit the shooting range. Whether you are shooting standard or +P loads the Pro-Tek I handles recoil beautifully. The grip frame spreads the recoil evenly across the web of your hand and between the textured grip panels and the beavertail the pistol stays centered in your grasp. Between the recoil handling aspects of the pistol and the short reset trigger, it sure makes for easier and accurate follow-up shots.As far as accuracy goes, if you like all of your rounds to produce one gapping hole in the target then you will like firing the Pro-Tek I.Take a look at the factory supplied test target.Will trade for:"

This gun is a smooth shooting MK1 model. All matching serial numbers ( frame, barrel even the original mag) and in perfect mechanical shape. Cosmetically it is 98% or better, and I am picky. Sights are standard MK1 and surprisingly easy to keep on target. The slide has been ceracoated and the cocobolo grips pictured are new and in perfect shape. If you are familiar with these, you know that these were special orders mainly to European police departments and highly collectible now. The light frame brings the weight down to a comfortable carry weight approximately the same as a Glock 17. The trigger is awesome and the mag disconnect has been removed, which is a major improvement on these guns. Do a little research before you offer, but if you are a collector or gun history buff, this is a chance to pick up a rare find. I took this gun to the range and ran 50 rounds through it and it is flawless. I love everything about the gun and unless I get a really nice trade offer, I will be hanging on to it. It is my only 9 mil and I am really thinking on consolidating calibers is reason for dangling in out here. This is the last gun that Mr Browning was actually working on until his death according to my research. A pretty unique firearm and as smooth as any modern weapon you would find. Similar alloy ones in this shape are bringing a very nice price when you can find them. Includes 3 mags, 13 rounds each. The original and two Mec Gar. No box etc. just the gun and mags."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZs corrosion resistant black polycoat finish. The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

I would never sell this gun If I weren't a student with children and on a tight budget. With 300 grain xtp handloads/H110 powder it dropped a 400+ lb cow elk in her tracks at 50 yards last August. Bang flop. It shoots about 3-4"" at 100 yards with handloads and a good scope. It seems to like all hornady xtp's and speer deep curls. It is in great shape and will come with the weaver scope mount and a set of hogue monogrips. The original wood grip is gorgeous and plenty comfortable until you start shooting the really hot stuff. The trigger has been reworked and springs have been upgraded. The trigger spring has been lightened to 30 oz, while the hammer spring has been beefed-up to decrease lock time and maximize accuracy. It's a real shooter. I apologize for the bad lighting in the second pic. The grip is much lighter than it appears in that photo. For an extra $150 I will be willing to throw in some ammo and reloading components/brass/primers/bullets/powder/dies/etc. This will include about 100 rounds of gourmet handloads xtp and deep curl handloads as well as .44 special plinker rounds. This gun is a beast and I wish I could keep it. Matt"

Please note the packaging at the bottom is open, but the magazine was seldomely used as seen in the photos. I have two of these magazines for sale at $85 each.Payment: I accept PayPal or cash for local inquiries. I'll gladly ship these at a flat rate of $5 (for one or both) to states where they are legally permitted.Description from Surefire's Website:The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. NSN: REDACTED183"
