I am looking to get 6500.00 out of it.. or consider offers or trade. if it is listed it is available.like I said earlier really enjoying wheel guns. and looking to expand my collection. but trades have to be fair. or have cash on your side to equal to.. i will not ship. if you want to make arrangments. i will hapily drop it off at any local gun store and they can do whatever you want. I will want to see id. just to verify that you are of legal age. and who you say you are. this is a great piece of history.. and will only go up in value

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier, and the by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. This results in significantly improved performance over gas-driven rifles. The Ruger SR-556VT features a target-style trigger with a short ""take-up"" stage followed by a crisp, light target pull, and it comes with three magazines. The lightweight, adaptable handguard with flattop receiver features a Picatinny rail that extends the full length of the handguard."

It is a functional transmission and works in all gears. NO MOTOR comes with the rail. You can go back with any type 1 air cooled VW engine, they are relatively cheap an easy to find. The metal side panels are simply screwed in and can be removed if you don't like them. Tires are in average condition, will need to be replaced but they do hold air.  You can also do a conversion where you can use a chevy ecotec motor or a Subaru engine of course you will need to buy the appropriate transmission adaptor to use these engines. I can point you in the right direction if you are interested The rail is complete with no rust just a paint job if you want it perfect! No title with the car, a bill of sale only. Asking $850 or best offer, will consider a pistol/firearms trade of like value but as usual Cash is King!  Please call or text David REDACTED.

Besides being light, small and concealable, it offers easy use, adjustable sights, an ultra-reliable low-recoil mechanism and a tough, durable finish that - with proper care - will give you a virtual lifetime of service.Comfortable to Conceal and Carry Weighing only 11.5 ounces unloaded, this double-action only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter you preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry-coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel / polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while tanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.Soft-recoiling and Absolutely ReliableThe Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads.

Its heart is a serialized modular chassis, meaning that the frame can be easily swapped to accommodate the user's preferences. Shipped with a storage case and two 6+1 stainless steel magazines (one flush, one with grip extension), the Pico features adjustable, quick-change sights with no gunsmithing required. It also offers ambidextrous magazine release, as well as a super-low-profile slide-release lever to keep the slide open when desired.

While not obscenely rare, the double stamped and ""MO"" marked 9130s are a good bit harder to find than a standard mosin. MO is known to be the Russian abbreviation for ""Ministerstvo Oborony"", or Ministry of Defense.More about the ""MO"" mark here: http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinMO.htmAll numbered parts are stamped with matching numbers (no electro pen). The barrel and action metal is in excellent condition with smooth, deep, dark bluing. Stock is in good condition with a few handling/storage marks and flaking varnish, as it typical of arsenal refurbed Mosins, and a non-structural crack at the left of the aft section of the receiver. Bolt cycles smooth. See pictures for more detail.The bore has strong rifling, a nice crown and is counterbored for accuracy. The trigger is smooth, but a bit heavy.Very clean. Little/no bluing wear. I have not fired it, but assume someone must have since it was refurbed, although I can find no evidence of it (no bluing wear, no powder residue, etc.)Comes with cleaning rod.I would normally list this at $350. Discounting to $275 since the stock crack can be glued, but is not perfect.$275 cash, which is less than what I have in it.For $350 total I will put it in a different 9130 stock that is not cracked. Personally, I would not bother with a different stock, but the option is available if you want.Not interested in trades or low-ball offers.Prefer face to face sale on the West side of Burlington, NC, but willing to ship to your FFL or C&R at your expense."

Of the 5000 Tikka barreled M39s only some made their way to North America, and fewer still remain unfired since refurb. Not the absolute rarest mosin ever, but most collectors I know have never seen one of these in person. Here is your chance to own one.1942 Tikka AZF marked M39 with Sako stock and fresh rearsenal:This 42 Tikka M39 appears to be fresh and unfired since refurb. The hex receiver has what appears to be the faint remnant of an imperial crest and two AZF ""Artillerie Zeugs Fabrik"" Austrian arsenal marks of different sizes. This implies that the receiver may have cycled through Austrian ownership more than once?I am unable to make out the markings on the bottom of the tang to ID the maker. Looks like a number 9... or maybe a 6, not sure what else, maybe a ""1"" or an arrow? See the picture and judge for yourself.The blueing is very strong and looks new throughout the rifle. In the barrel the rifling is bright and crisp with no wear at all evident. Since I received this rifle direct from the importer and it still had the remnants of the arsenal hang tag on it, I think it is relatively safe to assume this rifle had not been fired since being refurbished with the new Tikka barrel. The non-counterbored Tikka barrel is Finn matched to the bolt handle and stamped on the left side with ""7.62x53R"" (yes, that is a 3) , ""3600"" and ""SA"". According to 7.62x54r.net, the 1940's Tikka barreled M39s are an 8 of 10 on the rarity scale, so not your everyday Sako or VKT. :) I found the following at MosinNagant.net, which describes the Tikka flavored M39s :""Total production of the m/39 rifle during the wartime period of 1940-1945 was a total of 96,800 rifles. Total production total of the m/39 including post war modifications is approximately 102,000.A relatively new barrel marking for the m/39 rifle was recently introduced with the last import of these rifles. It consists of barrels made by Tikkakoski. These barrels carry the standard Tikkakoski marking of a ""T"" inside an inverted triangle enclosed in a circle. These barrels are originally m/91 barrels that have been modified to m/39 specifications. The barrels are shortened and recrowned and were used to replace badly worn or damaged barrels of m/39’s when they were re-inspected or passing through a depot level repair/refurbishment cycle. It is not known what depot performed the repairs but the total number of barrels used for this procedure is known-5,000. This makes the Tikka barreled m/39 quite a rare find. Those known and observed have all been in extraordinary shape indicating little use after the refurbishment. Many still exhibit the arsenal tag affixed to the barrel band.""The arsenal tag itself is missing, but the wire hanger and brass grommet with a small bit of the tag paper is still attached to the front barrel band side sling attachment point. I have shaken the box no less than 5 separate times hoping that somehow, magically, the arsenal tag will fall out, having just come loose in the shipping box. No luck.The main bolt serial number has been scrubbed. The magazine floor plate and butt plate have different serial numbers. The toe spliced Sako wartime stock has been sanded so the Sako cartouche is a bit faint, with the stock maker's cartouche just barely too light to definitively tell what who the stock maker was. The end of the stock and handguard have been trimmed back from the barrel so they don't touch the barrel (barrel is free floated!). The recoil lug bottom shim and tang shim are in place. Also interesting is that the receiver has been very nicely bedded. Of the 3 x M39 Mosins I have this is the only one that is bedded. You can see the stamps on the bottom of the receiver left impressions in the bedding compound.The cleaning rod has crosshatch knurling. The rear sight spring is plum colored. The front sight appears to be marked 7.6. The barrel is not counterbored.I don't need to sell this, so don't bother with low-ball offers.Might consider a trade, but it would have to be something special to get my attention. I am considering an offer to trade this Tikka M39 for either an M1 Carbine or M1 Garand.Prefer face to face sale on the West side of Burlington, NC, but willing to ship to your FFL or C&R at your expense."

My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $199 for a trust. This includes an initial in-person or phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Florida, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Arkansas and Texas and can assist with trusts in those states as well. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at 2ndamendmenttrusts@gmail.com to inquire about my services."
