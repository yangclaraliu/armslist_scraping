Because, at Spyderco, they practice the principle of C.Q.I. - Constant Quality Improvement. If they can refine and improve the ergonomics or cutting performance of an established model, they do it. This Para 2 has several changes over the classic version. The G-10 handle is narrowed at the end improving the ergonomics. The handle and blade have been profiled thinner; removing uncomfortable angles when in the closed position. It features a Compression Lock and an ambidextrous-friendly four way clip which carries tip-up/tip-down, left/right-hand and rests deeper in a pocket. This Cutlery Shoppe Exclusive version features a premium CTS-XHP full flat-ground blade, which is given a black DLC (Diamond Like Coating) finish. Spyderco has also lengthened the blade's tip and added additional surface jimping to both the spine and finger choil. Implementation of a new Bushing Pivot System generates fluid action and more consistent manufacturing tolerances. Larger lanyard gives more options for carry. Refinements to overall construction may not be drastic or even visible to the eye but from the G-10 textured handle to the CTS-XHP steel full flat blade, everything is sharper, smoother and guaranteed to provide performance and user comfort. This limited edition of 1,200 pieces is made in Golden, Colorado.   Carpenter Steel Company is enjoying a hospitable welcome from knifemakers and manufacturers. Well known for their performance automotive, aerospace, energy, medical, defense, and consumer products industries steels, they recently began offering high-performance blade steels. CTS-XHP is air hardened, high carbon and high chromium with corrosion resistance similar to 440C-type steels and with hardness qualities found in tool steel. Its edge retention, ability to be machined to a fine edge, and consistent heat-treatability make it perfect for this exclusive Sprint Run."

CPM-S30V Blade. Brand new in box.    Dealer Exclusive   We like the Osborne design Benchmade Rift so much, we asked Benchmade to build this special version just for our customers. Though their ""regular"" version is great with its 154CM blade, we kicked it up a notch and had these built with CPM-S30V steel The reverse tanto blade is ""hell for stout"" and with it full-belly blade is built for real world tasks. Blade action is smooth, and lock-up is solid, thanks to the AXIS lock system.  A couple years ago when we were asking what color options were available in the G-10, and when they showed us this orange/black we knew this was the one. The G-10 is textured for a better grip, which not only brings out the two color look, but is much more comfortable in your hand to use. The ""edges"" of the handle are also chamfered, which makes them even kinder to your hands and pocketes. Benchmade is building us two versions, one in satin finish, and one with their BK1 black finish."

This is the newer model Desert Eagle with the rail up top. It is a dream machine. It's brand new (got it a few months ago) and has only had 7 rounds through it. I'm selling it because I need space in my tiny gun safe and as much as I like to swing the big di*k around, I don't have the space for it. I'm selling it with: original MR hardcase, two magazines, 50+ rounds of Hornady hollowpoint ammunition, and a shoulder holster. It's a sweet rig and a ton of fun to shoot. If you've ever dreamt of taming the dragon and taking down a wild boar or bear with one shot, here's your chance! I can be text messaged at 262.573.8956 or emailed through Armslist's message thingy. Have CC permit or fill out paperwork, I'm not getting in trouble. I'm open to trades for a Rem 700 or other .308 doodads, although cash (and space in my safe) is my primary goal.
