It is a compact model with the FDE slide and night sights. This gun is almost brand new with zero wear on it. It's only had a few rounds fired through it and it functions 100%. These guns are almost entirely modular which means that you can change everything from the chassis to the caliber with the purchase of a few parts. I will be including 2 total chassis pieces (FDE medium and black small), two factory 13 round magazines (.40S&W/.357Sig), the original box, accessories, and paperwork, and a box of blazer target ammo. I'll also include a couple mags worth of JHP ammo as well.I will entertain cash and trade offers. Trades should be in good working order and above .22lr caliber. I'm not interested in any .22lr, black powder, archery, etc. I would like to trade for another pistol (9mm, 45acp, 357 mag, 44 mag, maybe some other calibers), shotgun (12ga only please), or semi automatic rifle. Please include pictures of your trade offer as well as details about it. I'm partial to certain brands (FNH, Sig, HK) but am open to all offers as long as the value is there. I am also open to entry level ar15s, ak47/74, and other rifles. I wouldn't mind having a decent shotgun either. I cannot, however, add any additional cash to a deal. I have another post which includes my Sig P320 as well as my HK USP45C to trade for a nice pistol such as a FiveseveN, Kimber, etc if you're wanting to make that kind of deal.Let me know what kind of offer you have an we xan go from there. Trade value should be in the $600 range. Cash asking is $575."

Every part has been meticulously selected by me to be Vietnam-era parts, including a non-cracked vented plastic hand guard, which are hard to find. There is also the 1959-style selector switch with arm installed that moves positions, though it is a ""dummy"" switch (THIS IS A SEMI-AUTO RECIEVER). Stock is USGI with crisp cartouche. Also comes with the correct M14 bayonet and scabbard. These are also hard to find! Not pictured is a USGI 20rd magazine which is also included. Less than 30 rounds fired through this gun.Bonus: for those wanting to shoot the thing but worried about ruining period parts, I will include a beautiful M1A stock plus wooden hand guard that can be swapped onto the thing for your range/hunting visits. Asking $2500, or will trade for a WW1 era 1897 Winchester Trench gun in good shape.  Please do not contact me with low-ball offers. Might be open to other trades, so long as the items are in the WW1 catagory; let me know what you have. For those that think the price too high, collectors of fine military firearms will know how expensive these items are that I have assembled, and I'm not making a profit selling at this price. This is as close to the real deal as you can get without a Title II form and tax stamp. Used as part of a weapons development timeline I had but selling to help fund my current addiction to WW1 arms for the centenary. Hope this finds a good home with someone who can appreciate it.Additional pictures available upon request. Thanks for viewing!"

Or a really long shish kebob for roasting a hole side of beef over the fire? This one's perfect.   Demilled British WWI P14 rifle, with an original bayonet and scabbard. This poor thing has a sad history. I found it welded to a gun shop sign (yes, welded). After cutting a deal with the owner, and many painstaking hours on a ladder with a dremel and hack saw, we got it down. Fortunately, before putting it up, the entire rifle had been shellacked, and after cleaning it up, it was in surprisingly good condition. With the help of my very skilled father, the only noticeable signs that it ever had been welded are a spot on the rear sight blade and on the barrel, where they used stainless steel flux to weld it to the bolts on the sign. But those spots are flush, and basically just bare metal spots, no material added. The bolt had been welded closed as well, but we were able to carefully cut that and fare it in with the normal contours of the rifle, so the bolt actually functions, and the hammer and firing pin fire, safety switch moves and works, everything. Follower and follower spring have been removed. The barrel was plugged with a rod through the chamber by the British military in order to make it a drill rifle (see the picture of the spot in the photos below), and all parts have been marked ""DP"" for ""drill purposes"". There are numerous stamps and markings on the receiver area (see pics). Rear ladder sights are intact and in good condition. The disc cutout where there would normally be a brass unit disc marking has been filled with a leather disc (this is how it was when I found it). Stock does still retain the mount for the rifle grenade sight on the left front side. Comes with an original British khaki web sling installed.   The bayonet is a functioning bayonet in good condition. There is some non-active pitting, but overall it's a very solid bayonet. Made by Remington in Nov of 1913, for the British, and stamped with the British crown and broad arrow. Comes with the correct British leather scabbard. Put it on the end of the rifle, and you've got a great spear. :-) Asking $320 plus shipping. I can ship, but it does require an FFL if you're out of state since the receiver is not cut. Thanks for looking!"

As far as I can tell by research, there were two main runs of this gun & caliber combo, one in 1989 and one in 1994.  This gun, with a BSS serial prefix, is probably from the 1994 run (I've owned it since 2003).  This one appears to have been slightly customized, as Mountain Guns usually came with a plain black front sight, not the red ramp sight shown. The 629-4 is the last version to have the hammer-mounted firing pin, instead of the transfer bar system of later guns, and best of all, this is pre-Hillary Hole. 
Gun is in excellent condition for being old enough to drink.  Bore is crisp and bright, there are no major scratches, dents or dings besides two small (< 2mm) ones on the trigger guard (see picture).   Top strap is essentially untouched by flame cutting.  Cylinder does have a visible drag mark. 
This revolver comes with the attached custom wood grips, a set of Pachmayr Decelerator grips, a Galco Phoenix PHX126 dual-position (strong-side or cross-draw) holster and a soft case.

The shotgun is in great condition and sports a Hogue rubber grip which is VERY comfortable and feels great in the hand. This weapon is perfect for home defense with an 18"" barrel which seems smaller due to the grip, so it is ideal for tight spaces. Capable of firing either 2 3/4"" (6+1) or 3"" (5+1) 12ga shells, I have a few cartridges I will be including to who ever decides to make a deal. These shotguns were made under contract with Mossberg so virtually any accessory that can be fitted on any of the 500 series will work smooth without a problem on the Maverick. *Serial no. was intentionally covered for pictures, Transfer can be completed anywhere in RI you please I will pay the fee. Sorry but this is not for cash sale, I am only interested in trading it for a xbox one.Thanks for Looking!"

These Saiga AKs are the highest quality AKs you can get an are now unfortunately banned from importation.  These are actually made at the Izhmesh military plant in Russia unlike other AKs!  All matching to include the original russian reciever and lined barrel!!  This wasn't cheaply and quickly converted by a random big retailer...this quality work was done by Meridian Ordnance which is one of the top AK47 custom shops in the country (look em up!).  Pistol grip, trigger work, no plastic caps used on the unneeded holes as Meridian welded all unnescessary holes (most conversion use plastic caps) up prior to a COMPLETE REFINISH...that's right all refinished so finish is 100%.  Also, instead of cheaply threading the barrel as most do they did the right thing and replaced the compete front site to get the ak47 threading without messing up barrel...big upgrade!  Takes regular AK  mags also.Everything about this rifle is quality and I'm taking a BIG hit on the price but because I need the money for something else I'm willing to sell for $800.  If you have any questions or need additional pics of anything let me know.**As a bonus I'll throw in a UTG dual rail side rail mount!!"
