Update - don't ask my bottom dollar - I won't respond - ""firm"" should tell you what you need to know. I will be going through Wausau and Eau Claire on Monday, April 11For those not familar with the DAK trigger, here is the description:DAK-(for Double Action Kellerman, after the designer of the system). When firing the pistol the first trigger pull is only 6.5 lbf (compared to 12 lbf for the standard DAO). After the pistol fires and the trigger is released forward the trigger has an intermediate reset point that is approximately halfway to the trigger at rest position. The trigger pull from this intermediate reset point is 8.5 lbf. If the trigger is released all the way forward, this will engage the primary trigger reset and have a trigger pull of 6.5 lbf. To engage the intermediate reset the trigger must be held to the rear while the slide is cycled, either manually or by the recoil of a round being fired.In bare-bones description, the DAK mechanism provides a hammer-fired full-length double-action trigger pull, with complete repeat-strike capability, that is notably lighter than other full-length DAO pull mechanisms. Developed by the engineers at Sauer in Germany, the new DAK trigger system delivers a smooth, consistent 6.5-pound full-length trigger pull that is much closer to the weight of a Glock than any conventional DAO but also has complete restrike capability without any pretensioning or prestressing of the internal firing mechanism. There is nothing magical about the design; everything is accomplished by simple mechanical advantages in the trigger/hammer linkages. The key is that the engineers were able to extend the ""leverage arm"" of the hammer from the pivot point (like sitting farther from the fulcrum of a seesaw) so that less force is required from the trigger while remaining within the existing dimensions of the P226 and P229 frames. Externally, the only visible difference between a SIG DAK mechanism and a conventional SIG DAO mechanism is that the DAK trigger has a slightly slimmer profile and the DAK hammer sits completely within the frame when at rest, while the DAO hammer protrudes slightly. Other attractive features include the fact that the slide must be locked back and the magazine removed to disassemble, and it can be disassembled without having to pull the trigger."

The Model 1877 was offered in three calibers, which lent them three unofficial names: the ""Lightning"", the ""Thunderer"", and the ""Rainmaker"". The principal difference between the models was the cartridge in which they were chambered: the ""Lightning"" being chambered in .38 Long Colt ""Thunderer"" in .41 Colt. Both models had a six-round ammunition capacity. An earlier model in .32 Colt known as the ""Rainmaker"" was offered in 1877. The one offered here is a Colt Double Action Lightning .38 cal Revolver Model of 1877 with a 3 ½” barrel. Serial number: 118168 manufactured in 1900. Original Colt letter included confirming serial number, Caliber, Barrel Length, and blue finish. Stocks not listed but are original to the gun. Traces of blue along with Patina fading to brown.

Looking to trade for quality firearms, no taurus, rossie, pump shotguns, or bolt actions. Open to almost anything for trades that are Firearms and Firearm related. Open to partial trades plus cash.I value it at around $950 because of the new night sights, holster and aftermarket grips."

to trade an arm and a leg and still have to have a gunsmith run a
reliability package to ensure function with defensive ammo. All in
all most people would pick up a 1911 and feel frustration
immediately because they just would not run unless you dumped a ton
of money into them. Enter Armscor. Armscor is a Philippine Company

components, and are offered at a fraction of the cost of their

It does not have the original case. Pistol functions fine and is a very nice carry piece since it is the pre-ii kimber that is a quality firearm.

Single lithium Battery (CR2032) Five Year Battery Life    The Trijicon Miniature Rifle Optic (MRO) is a reflex-style, sealed sight intended for use on rifles, carbines, and shotguns to provide fast target acquisition. It is designed to be used with both eyes open, providing the operator with maximum situational awareness. The large aperture and tapered light path maximizes the viewing area in such a small optic, allowing for fast target engagement – especially from non-standard shooting positions. Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot. The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments. The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools. Hard-anodized, forged 7075-T6 housing is fully sealed and waterproof, providing durability in demanding conditions.   Technical Information Magnification: 1x Objective Size (mm): 25mm Reticle: 2 MOA Dot Reticle Color: Red Eye Relief: Infinite Adjustment @ 100 yards (clicks/in): 1 click=.5"" Housing Material: 7075-T6 forged aluminum Battery: 1 CR2032 Lithium Battery (Included) Battery Life: 5 years of continuous use at day setting “3” (setting 5 of 8) at 70°F (21°C) Adjustment Range: 70 MOA Total Travel Illumination Settings: 8 Distance From Top of Mounting Rail to Optical Axis: (Height for models with included mount only ) Low Mount=0.985""; Full Co-Witness Mount=1.538""; Lower 1/3 Co-Witness Mount=1.663"" Length: 2.6"" Width: 1.7"" Height: 2.00"" (Without Mount) Weight:  4.1 Oz.

However, you have just voided you warranty and only have one slide now with a rmr on it. So instead you buy a slide or Xchange kit and send that in and end up spending a lot more money but you retain your warranty and still have a standard slide. This is what I did. This is why the price seems steep, but you get to have a seprate slide for your rmr and keep your warranty if anything was to happen down the road. I will speak to you over price if you have a reasonable offer. This is high quality top of the line custom work and optics though so keep that in mind. If you want the best, this is it.The slide was milled my mark housel at L&M precision. It is milled for the RMR and has custom front serrations milled into the slide. Also it is cerakoted with Sniper Grey/Graphite Black Cerakote. There are suppressor sights installed (ameriglo tritium in front, and standard black rear). The photo shows a standard sight, I have since installed the night sight.  The RM06 is brand new and was zeroed. I have only taken it out that one time, since then it has sat in my safe. I am selling because I need work done to my classic 4runner. If you currently have a p229 or M11A1 this will just slide onto your existing frame and will use your same barrel. $500 for slide alone, $600 for rmr alone. $1100 for the whole package. Slide comes with recoil spring assembly. Rmr comes with original box and hardware and the bottom cover. I take PayPal (easiest) or certified check or face to face. If you buy the whole package, I'll throw in an appendix holster made by Trex arms kydex. It is called the Sidecar. The holster is a little loose because I messed with the light channel. It Is made to use a Surefire XC1 Light. I would much rather sell this as a package deal."

The Commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own.

Xtended Twilight Lens System

Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens SystemÃ¢ï¿½Â¢. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens SystemÃ�Â®, using LeupoldÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½sÃ�Â® index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you wonÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world.

DiamondCoat 2

Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2Ã¢ï¿½Â¢, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance weÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½ve ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.

2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing

While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ technology pioneered by LeupoldÃ�Â® Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton weÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.

Generous Eyebox
The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high power, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight pictue that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.

Blackened Lens Edges
Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical perrformance.
Twin Bias Spring Erector System
Super Fast-Focus Eyepiece
3:1 Zoom Ratio

Dual Use
Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All LeupoldÃ�Â® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4Ã�Â® Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more Ã¢ï¿½ï¿½ rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes. See overview of each product for more detailed information on hunting, shooting, and competition applications.

It has great utility for any shooter, whose target ranges vary from close to mid-range. The HHS I provides a solution for engaging threats in close-quarter combat situations, then quickly transitions to a 600-meter targeting or surveillance situation. A quick switch-to-side (STS) mount offers simple, fast disengagement of the G33 magnifier. 
EOTech is one of the most trusted manufacturer of military and civilian weapon sights and accessories, and the HHS I is the perfect example of why. The HHS I combines the popular EXPS3 with the innovative G33 3X magnifier and Switch-To-Side mount. Both of these units work seamlessly together and offer quick-detach, locking mounts. The EXPS3 is among the most compact units available requiring minimal rail mounting space. When combined with the G33 magnifier the entire HHS I units measure a mere 8.1"" and requires only 2.75"" of rail space for mounting. When faced with variable situations the HHS I is the ideal choice with the ability to quickly switch from 1x to 3x with the flip of a finger. The G33 is held in place with a strong detent that maintains its perfect alignment with the EXPS3, and hold the unit out of the operator's way in CQB situations. Perfect for any situation, the HHS I offers 20 illumination intensities, anti-glare coatings with high light gathering capability, true holographic transmission for a parallax free optic that features a true heads-up display for shooting with both eyes open. Additional features of the HH I are Night vision compatibility as well as a ballistic BDC reticle matched to .223 ammunition.  This sight kit was sent to EOTech for all recall updated. As you can see I have the orginal case with warranty card and paper work. If you see this add I still have the sight."
