It has a great, nicely figured piece of walnut on it with checkering that is close to perfect, if not perfect. It was a safe queen when I got it and stayed one. The previous owner had the barrel glass bedded which caused a slight gap between the receiver in the rear and the stock (pictured). My plan had been to unglass bed it, as previous Model 66s that I have owned shot well enough as configured by the factory. The previous owner also had a strange one piece wedge piece as a scope base in the front that I removed. Both scope rings would have fit on this base with that single barrel point of contact…that will do nothing for accuracy. Probably why the last owner had it glass bedded?? When the new buyer decides on his/her scope mounting system, that wedge vacancy will be invisible…or a wedge can be procured to be placed back in that area. These are the only two issues that I bring to your attention and they are IMHO pretty minor. The recoil pad has been professionally replaced, and if you know Mauser 66s this wil not surprise you. The bore is excellent as is the stock minus a couple handling dings. I do not believe this rifle has ever seen the field...and has only seen a range infrequently. Those minor issues above place this rifle at hundreds below other Mauser 66s."

Japanese Type 99 rifle in the 7.7 Japanese caliber. From my research it was produced at the Toya Kogyo factory built sometime between 1939-1945. The mum is ground and it has the provisions for the anti-aircraft sight wings, but no wings (very likely it never had them). As is common, the bolt is mismatched. No indication of stock refinish that I can tell.
Chrome-lined bore is in excellent shape with sharp, clean rifling. The picture doesn't do justice to how bright it is, but you can tell it's sharp.
I've shot it and it shoots great. This is NOT a last-ditch rifle, perhaps a mid-war due to the AA sights being removed.

It has a nicely figured piece of walnut with checkering that is close to perfect. It was a safe queen when I got it and stayed one. The previous owner had the barrel glass bedded which caused a slight gap between the receiver in the rear and the stock. My plan had been to unglass bed it to correct that, as previous Model 66s that I have owned shot well enough as configured by the factory. The previous owner also had a strange one piece wedge piece as a scope base in the front that I removed. Both scope rings would have fit on this base with that single barrel point of contact…that will do nothing for accuracy. Maybe why the last owner had it glass bedded?? When the new buyer decides on his/her scope mounting system, that wedge area vacancy behind the rear sight will be invisible…or a metal wedge can be procured to be placed back in that area. These are the only two issues and IMHO are pretty minor. Bore is excellent as is the stock, minus a couple mild handling dings. I do not believe this rifle has ever seen the field...and has only seen a range infrequently. Those minor issues above is why I have priced this rifle at hundreds below other Mauser 66s you will find. I can only post one picture, so if you want more, email me. I will ship in a hard case after I get an FFL to know where to send it. Shipping will be $40. Any questions, send me an email. Rob, US Army (Ret)"

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com    The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com The new Daniel Defense DDM4v9 is designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications.  The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Government profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire.  The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The V9 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.   This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

The v9 Strength to Weight is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the salt bath nitride treated barrel assembly.

A polymer frame helps keep the weight Kel-Tec PF-9 down to 12.7 ounces.The trigger is a DAO design with a pull weight of approximately 5 lbs, and an automatic hammer block safety is present.

Next, they added a thinned down and checkered stainless steel frame, a flattened mainspring housing and completed the package with a wide but tasteful magwell.  The result was the Predator T-5, built in 9mm. It offers a single-stack high capacity goodness, with the additional muzzle weight of the integral barrel wafer, which helps control recoil. The lockup of the bushingless barrel to the stainless steel frame is nothing short of marvelous as is the accuracy the T5 is capable of. The thinned frame makes it easy to grip as well as to conceal.  Some dream of the ultimate 1911 with extremely low recoil but their dreams rarely go as far as the T5. Of all the things you can think of to do with a 9mm pistol, you can do them to perfection with the T5. And, you can do it in style."

This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com    The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 Lightweight, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 LW is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Lightweight profile barrel, making it almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://www.smallarmsales.com    The new Daniel Defense DDM4v9 Lightweight is designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications.  The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Lightweight profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over-travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire.  The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The V9 Lightweight is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip and is finished with Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™.

Toner stripped the HK units and applied a full ACU treatment; then off she goes to get high heat FDE/Tan Cerakote on the barrel and buttstock recoil tube (these pics were taken under intense LED lighting this is actually a non reflective finish). Separate tone HK EC1 stock with swing out buttplate and interior storage, HK mfg pistol grip with removable end cap and interior storage, beveled mag wells, full quad system with four sling attach points. Complete interior rejuvenation does not alter full warranty. The ""battle triggers"" have been removed and replaced with Tier One level trigger systems WHICH ARE NOT FOR NOVICES! This professional level trigger system HAS VIRTUALLY NO RESET (overtravel) WITH AUDIBLE TACTILE CLICKS AND 3.5LB RELEASE.. ok so what's that mean? This single stage system has minimal rearword travel before the disconnect and subsequent firing; as you allow the trigger to move forward and ""reset"" the movement is minimal. Once it hit's it's reset you can actually hear an audible tactile click allowing you to press and fire again.. really fast. Novices MUST KEEP THEIR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER AND KEEP THE BARREL POINTED IN A SAFE DIRECTION LEST YOU SHOOT YOUR TV. OR DOG. OR DOROTHY. REALLY. If you do not know how to utilize your reset system (on any trigger group with any weapons platform) you need to learn as it will enhance speed, accuracy, follow up shots, and safety. This system puts Geissele a bit down on the totem pole.. HK system is the pinnacle of piston development as described elsewhere. Ships in a HK issue matching tan soft case with two German MFG poly green mags not the practice mags shown in pics. You can actually ""build"" this yourself.. buy an HK MR556 new for around $2750 and ship it Jim Toner at TMT. 4-6 months later it will return with a parts, smith, and finish bill looking like this.. $466 for the ACU, $242 for high heat cerakote, another $575 to blueprint, fit/finish install JP trigger module system with range fire, $36 xtra mag, $68 upcharge matching HK bag, $144 shipping to three different states, total $4281"

Planned on using them for target as well as concealed carry (12 +1 capacity yet the feel of a single stack :) My wife currently carries a Taurus TCP 380.  After carrying mine she decided she prederred to carry the TCP as it is smaller and lighter. So hers is for sale. Never shot and brand new in the package. Check out the reviews for this gun. Thats what sold me before getting it. This is a quality and dependable gun to have, without breaking the bank! It has similar features to the Glock, including the easy and & fast way to field strip it, and has similar weight and dimensions to other Glocks, like the width and weight of the Glock 26, and the overall height that is similar to the Glock 19.  Save yourself the FFL fee, the background check fee and the taxes! Thanks for looking. Here is the description from the web:With its lightweight 22 oz. polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, the newly designed Millennium G2 is the ideal concealed carry handgun. Available in two compact models—PT 111 and PT 140—the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.Here are some features: Taurus Security System (TSS)sTaurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.   Loaded Chamber IndicatorTaurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.   Accessory RailFeatures the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories Here are the specs: Model: 111G2   Finish: Blue   Status: Available   Caliber: 9 mm   UPC: 7-25327-61060-1   Capacity: 12 +1   Weight: 22 oz.   Barrel Length: 3.2""   Frame: Compact   Action: SA/DA   Front Sight: Fixed   Length: 6.24""   Safety: Loaded Chamber Indicator,Manual Safety,Manual Safety,Taurus Security System,Trigger safety   Order #: 1-111031G2-12   Rear Sight: Adjustable-2 Dots"
