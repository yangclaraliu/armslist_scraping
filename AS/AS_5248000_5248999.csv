The Tavor is a superb rifle, with excellent design, ergonomics, fit/finish. ShootingSight has designed the ideal trigger to go with it. In chosing the best trigger for a battle rifle, we took a cue from the greatest battle rifle ever devised: the M1 Garand. The M1 has a superb 2-stage trigger. It is robust, but keeps the crispness and accuracy of a two-stage trigger pull. The M1 concept was married with tool steel, CNC machining, and aerospace surface coatings. The result is the TAV-D, a 2-stage trigger which is robust, smooth, and crisp.Features:· 2-stage, giving a predictable glass like break. · 3lb first stage, 5lb total pull· Machined from heat treated plate tool steel, for superior metal grain structure.· Housing CNC machined from billet aluminum and Mil-Spec hardcoat anodized.· Ultra hard / low friction surface coating allows lube free operation in dirty / tactical environments.· Polished and honed sear surfaces for butter-smooth pull.· Drop in trigger pack is fully assembled. No modifications needed.THIS IS A DEMO MODEL. This Trigger Pack has been inserted and extracted from a Tavor several times for demonstration purposes. Therefore it is sold as USED, not new. There is no box. I have several close up shots (pictures) if you would like to see them. Simply send me a message (email) and request them and I'll forward the photos to you. There are small, minute' marks on the trigger pack due to installation and removal. SAVE $$$$ The MSRP is $340.00, buy this one for $265.00 and save ($75.00)"

Unlike the other Remington 700's on Armslist for sale in this area. This rifle is actually an authentic build, meaning Leupold PRW Rings, Ring Lap Job, Scope leveled, Action Bedded, Barrel meticulously cleaned and maintained, all original parts with no cheap crap bolted to it.  I mean, I don't know what the hell those other guys are thinking by putting a Swarovski optic on a remington 700 with cheap 2 piece $10 scope rings but that's their choice. Don't purchase those other shade tree rifles, this rifle is set up to perform and can prove it with every group. I'm selling this rifle due to me having two of these set-ups with this one being my least favorite. This rifle could easily be a duty rifle, hunting rifle, target rifle, or a zombie rifle, your choice.

This may be true. However, the Finns also purchased hundreds of thousands of firearms at various times between this NEW M91 being made and the end of WW2. The SA in a box mark means the rifle was property of the Finnish Army, regardless of whether it was ""captured"" in battle, donated by a friendly state, stolen or purchased.This particular NEW M91 shows signs of the typical Finnish accurizing process, involving various shims under the receiver to free float the barrel.Not interested in trades or low-ball offers.Prefer face to face sale on the West side of Burlington, NC, but willing to ship to your FFL or C&R at your expense."

When Springfield Armory in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant - the M1A - available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past.The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck.

When Springfield Armory in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant - the M1A - available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past.The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck.

All metal gun with a 4 inch barrel.  Same dimensions roughly as a Commander 1911 but it is a little different than a 1911 as it is equipped with a combo safety/decocker and gives you a true double or single action trigger which is pretty smooth. It has the heft and balance of a nice 1911 without the expense. Nice car or nightstand gun which won't break the bank. Slide and frame finish are at least 90% with no rust or pitting and the high gloss slide is a sharp look. Walnut grips and 2 mags (8 rounds each). Prefer cash, but will look at all trade offers.

When Springfield Armory in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past.   The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability.   You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A is ready for its next mission.   Technical Specifications:   Model   M1A  Caliber    7.62x51mm Nato/.308 Win  Barrel    22"" 1:11 Twist, RH, 6 Groove Carbon Steel  Weight    8.8lbs  Length    44.33""  Stock    Highlander Camo Deposite  Front Sight    National Match .062 Blade  Rear Sight    Military Aperture .0690 w/MOA Adjustment for both Windage and Elevation  Magazine    1 - 10 Round Parkerized Steel   MFG# MA9113 SKU# REDACTED97"

The National Match is purpose-built for one thing: winning competitions.The list of features that distinguishes the National Match series starts with the fact that the action is glass bedded into the new walnut stock. This provides a rock-solid platform for the rest of the rifle - like the medium-weight National Match barrel. A crisp 4.5-5lb National Match tuned two-stage will ensure you can place your shots exactly where and when you intend. The .0595"" hooded rear aperture sight gives precise 1/2 MOA adjustments for both windage and elevation. The rear sight combined with the .062"" front sight blade gives the shooter precise target acquisition capability. A National Match recoil spring guide and match-tuned gas cylinder ensure that the rifle will operate with reliable accuracy. If you're ready for a rifle that will help you get to the top of the leader boards, consider the Springfield Armory National Match M1A.SpecificationsModel Number  NA9802  UPC Code  REDACTED22  Caliber  7.62x51mm Nato (.308 Winchester)  Length  44.33""  Front Sight  National Match .062"" Blade  Barrel   22""  Twist 1 in 11""  Right Hand 6-Groove  National Match Medium Weight Premium Air Gauged Stainless Steel  Weight (with Empty Magazines)  9.8 lbs  Rear Sight  Match Grade Hooded Aperture .0595 with 1/2 MOA Adjustment for Both Windage and Elevation  Magazines  1-10 Round Parkerized Steel  Stock  New Walnut"
