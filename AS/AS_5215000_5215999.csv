This rifle was built with an emphasis on accuracy by competitive benchrest shooter Pete Piper of Precision Barrel Work in Hempstead, Texas. The heart of this rifle is a 26"" Broughton 5c 416R Stainless Steel Match barrel with a 1:9"" twist rate. Broughton barrels are double stress relieved at the mill and triple stress relieved in the shop, pulled button-rifles, and hand lapped with a uniform land and groove diameter up to .0001"" from breech to muzzle. The barrel is straight fluted for decreased weight and increased heat dispersion, is threaded with a custom left hand helical muzzle brake fitted, and finally matte black cerakoted for a consistent appearance and durable longevity.
The receiver is completely trued, has a 1.070"" thread tennon, and is pillar bedded in an epoxy gel to extract maximum accuracy. A Jewell trigger set to ~2 pounds further enhances potential precision. The bolt body is spiral fluted for decreased contact area, increasing the smoothness of cycling, and lending a high end custom look.
This rifle features a McMillan Hunter stock with grip and forend checkering and a Pachmayr Decelerator buttpad. It has an olive drab green, tan, and black marbled matte finish.
This rifle is built on a used receiver, so I have technically listed the item condition as used, however it has it is for all intents and purposes new. Please feel free to email me with specific inquirie"

I'm not crazy about parting with it but am really interested in a 4"" Smith & Wesson 629 .44 Magnum now which is the only reason I'm considering selling it.  I would trade even for a Smith 629 as I've got about $250 of extras with it when counting the scope, mount, rings and Hogue grip.  I think the new GP100s do come with the Hogue already but mine had the rubber grip with wood inserts and I still have that grip that will go along with this revolver as well.  The scope is a Simmons Pro Hunter 2-6x32mm, not a real expensive scope but it's very clear and just read some reviews on it then read some on the Leupold and Burris.  I was planning on spending more on a scope when I bought it but after reading reviews they were so good on this Simmons and the Leupold and Burris had a few complaints about reticles shaking loose in them so I went with this one based on the reviews and have been satisfied with it."

I also set up payment plans on expensive items like this one so just email me and let me know what down payment and monthly payment you can afford and maybe we can put it on lay-a-way for you. This item is new, we are a licensed gun shop and we received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened. NOREEN BAD NEWS .338 Lapua !!!! Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots. The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot. This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action. The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action. The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system. The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus. The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA. Pictures show upgrade Picatinny rail forend, and optional Leupold Mark 4 8.5-25x50 w/ TMR and American Defense MFG scope mount and rings. www.onlylongrange.com Piston-driven semi-automatic action Effective to 1500 yards Accurate, powerful round Modest recoil Weighs just 13 pounds Receiver is machined from a billet of 6061 T6 aluminum 26” barrel (1 in 10” twist) Full-Length picatinny rail on receiver 5 or 10 round magazine accepts 300 gr bullets Full Custom muzzle brake The finish that Noreen utilizes is not Cerakote, so it may scratch and show wear more easily. The finish on the new gun you purchase may have scratches. Occasionally a new item direct from Noreen will have slight damage, and we can offer the additional option to have your new gun finished in Cerakote.

Scope rail.  Comes with factory deluxe carrying case.  AT-9 breaks down into small form to fit in case. Very portable. Three UZI 25rd mags.  Uzi mags are battle tested, been around for decades.  Used in several types of firearms because they are so reliable.  UPDATE:Someone asked how it fired, but since I had never fired it, I couldn't say.  So I took it down to the farm and ran a few mags through it.  No problems, not a single hiccup,  ran like a champ."
