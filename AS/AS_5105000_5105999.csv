I suppose it could be used to display a Maxim or a Browning or a Hotchkiss but I am not savvy enough on belt-fed weapons to know this for sure. The tripod itself is quite beautiful, they used a lot of brass when they made things back in the day. Someone has cleaned it up some. This thing made it through two world wars and several dozen smaller conflicts without being scrapped for brass somehow - I guess that makes it kind of special. There does not seem to be a lot of them left in existence. As far as I can tell, the only parts missing are the screws for mounting the data plate to the tripod unit. Might be a good find if you've had a Vickers you've been wanting to complete for display purposes and are squeamish about purchasing a replica or reproduction tripod. Pictures can be made available upon request. Shipping included."

The BCG and gas tube show some wear, but I am unsure what the round count is. I can shoot sub moa easily with factory Hornady rounds.....these barrels are highly desirable apparently. All of the LPK is still factory, so the trigger is fantastic! I had it painted stealth gray about 3 months ago, replaced the stock with a Magpul ACS, replaced the grip with a Magpul MOE K2+ (rubbery grip) and the quad rail with a 15' keymod. Although I didn't weigh it, it easily took 1-2 lbs off the previously heavy as sh!t SASS. New as from the factory they run $1350ish (street price). I'd like to get $1175 given the paint and other brand new parts on it.......if my math is right I'm taking about a $300 loss based on that (not your problem I know, just putting it out there) I truly had no intention of ever selling this one."
