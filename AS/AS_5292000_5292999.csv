Just recently got a call from the FFL and he had one last one with a lower parts kit installed and upgraded stock with QD sling point. I was told people are trying out different mag releases like the saiga mag release, cmmg mutant release, etc which is cheap. All that holds it is a roll pin. This is obviously a project but this is the only Rhino lower in Colorado. This is the final price drop.I spoke with a company that makes uppers that are compatable with the AK magazine and this lower. I will send you all that information if are interested in buying"

It has also fit my friends glock (can't remember the model) and TP9. The ends of the holsters are open, so they should fit long barreled revolvers just fine (never actually tried it though). Both of the actual holsters appear to be cut to the same size, as any of my guns work with either holster.The Mag holders are leather front and back, with elastic sides. All of my mags fit snugly in them: 1911 7 and 8 round, CZ P-09 9mm 19 round, and SW 9mm Shield 7 round. The snaps were sized to fit the larger mags (8 round 1911 and CZ) but as you can see from the pics, should work just fine with smaller mags. There is play with smaller mags, but they shouldn't fall out. Someone with the right tool could add another female snap onto the strap to make it ""smaller"".Here is the best thing about this holster: It is MODULAR. Each holster and mag holder has a normal belt loop on the back, allowing you to use it on a belt like a regular right handed holster (vertical). There are ""arrows"" cut out of leather that slide through the belt loops and then attach to the shoulder straps. At the bottom of the arrows are spots for the belt tie downs.Belt tie downs can be applied to both the mag and gun side of the holster, but don't have to be used. These allowed the entire thing to stay balanced when I wore my heavy 1911 on one side, but didn't want the mag holster with me, I just used a belt tie down on my mag side. If someone wanted they could use the two mag holders to do a set of mags under each arm and the pistol on their hip. If someone could come up with an extra set of shoulder straps, they would almost have enough pieces for 2 full holsters.WOULD WORK FOR RIGHT OR LEFT HANDED PEOPLEPics : http://imgur.com/a/1WW6ohttp://imgur.com/a/vxQpDI tried my shield in a holster for shits. It fits, and covers the trigger guard and it wouldn't come out, but it is WAY bigger than it needs to be. So it looks like these will fit 99% of guns.
