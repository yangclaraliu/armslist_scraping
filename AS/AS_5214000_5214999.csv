I don't know if that is close to street value or not. But I'm into it from a trade for $1200 and I think that is a great value for a solid semi custom factory rifle.   If you want the aero mount and the Vortex strike eagle 1-6 add another $380. They are both brand new. The bipod isn't included.

This gun comes with Glock factory night sights (still very bright), three 13 round gen 4 type magazines, factory case, paperwork, does not include any backstraps (unless you have Gorilla hands, you wont need them), and has the Pennyslyvania State Police emblem on the side of the slide.As far as I can tell from my research, these guns were used very little (or not at all) by the PSP and were promptly replaced by a different handgun. The Glocks were sent back to Glock for new parts replacement and were then sold to distributors for resale. There are supposed to only be around 1000 of these on the private market, so this makes it somewhat of a rare Glock variant.Overall condition is very good/excellent, with some minor wear marks on the right grip area and the top of slide (very light carry marks in a right handed holster) but it overall looks great and works 100% (have pics to prove how well it works and shoots).The price for the gun with everything it originally comes with is $650 cash and trade is around that price as well. I also have 77 rounds of defense, 150 rounds of fmj, and a IWB holster that I would sell with it for $120 (19 rounds Crit Duty, 19 rounds XTP, and 39 rounds of PDX1 defender; 100 rounds Federal FMJ and 50 rouds Perfecta FMJ).Total cash price for everything including ammo and holster is $770 OBO and Im pretty flexible on trades. Im happy with the gun, just bored and I dont really need to sell it so if you are looking for seller in distress, pass me up. If you are however looking for a solid gun for home defense or you collect Glock or Cop guns, this the one for you. Email me with offers, I have a smart phone so I can respond almost immediately. Below is a list of trade ideas (will take any offers into consideration as long as its not lawn furniture or your beanie baby collection), so thank you and have a nice day!"

At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb. The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip. The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16” barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine.

( The followers have no been cut in the EMAGS )I'm honestly just looking to get another Ak, newer run WASR, Serbian, caliber not specific.

Comes with a black (non-Smith & Weeson cas), and 100 rounds of 38S&W ammo. I've seen other ones just like this one,nickel, in same condition or better for more then im asking. THIS IS NOT THE 38 SPECIAL VERSION, THIS IS THE 38 S&W VERSION. My asking price for $400 is fair and firm. It's worth more. Not interested in a trade unless you have a glock to trade even for it, other than that, CASH ONLY. Do not contact me asking about other guns and mess. If you don't know about this revolver then research if before you contact me. This revolver is the real deal. FTF only. Meet in public place. No games. Must be 21. Must sign a bill of sale."

Also just had brand new strings put on and I haven't even shot with them yet due to not having time anymore which is why I'm selling it. Comes with a nice case and a new Buck Commander target(2'x2') that was only shot at a few times. The three arrows used for hunting are Beman arrows with Rage broad heads. Also comes with a Cobra quick release, Tru Glo sights, an Apache stabilizer, a Tru Glo drop away arrow rest and an extra whisker biscuit. Cash value $300-400 obo. Will consider trades and if the deal is good enough I'll also boot some cash with it. Mostly looking for a pistol but will consider other things as well. Thanks for your time! Price is also negotiable. located in Hurley MS"
