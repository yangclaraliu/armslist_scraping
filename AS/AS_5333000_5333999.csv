Beautiful amber shellac on the stock, original Soviet lens caps, black tabbed 1949 khaki sling. The stock is an actual WWII stock as well, with both the smaller cartouche denoting 1944, and the larger CCCP disc. Rear of the receiver is also marked with the ""C"", as common on the Izhevsk snipers. Metal is free of rust/pitting. Bore is like new, trigger and bolt are superb - rifle shoots like is should too; I've put 50rds of PPU down it to zero. (Small line of blue paint on thumbscrew/bracket as witness mark for tightness that can be removed) The glass on the Progress scope is crystal clear with no fog or moisture. Very sharp looking rifle full of history and that can shoot! Please contact me via email with any questions. Thank you."

Do you ever get tired of listening to your scummy left wing liberal friend talking his/hers pathetic rhetoric on stricter gun law?  Well I have two guns that will make them shut their mouths and move to Denmark.  For sale or trade is a 357 Smith and Wesson 586 and a plinker 454 Taurus Raging Bull.  Both of these beauties will make great concealed carries as you walking to your car from a long night of bowling.  Amaze your buddies as you wield these two beauties at the gun range or your uncle's back yard.  Guns like these don’t show up much on this site (Columbia Area), let alone as a package deal. Don’t let this deal pass you by.
If you are interested in these beauties then you have to be a South Carolina resident; you must be the proper age of owning these firearms; and you need CWP.  I will require a bill of sale (I will provide one).
The revolvers come in used condition and I am not use what the round count is for either revolver. They do fire, they split lead like two rabbits in heat.
I know everyone on this site is pretty proficient with technology and has a way to research the value of these guns, so I don’t have to waste my time with what I think they are worth.  Since every time I post a more then fair price, I always get someone trying nickel and dime me. If I am not interested, I will either send you a reply with ""No thanks"" or if your offer is so ridiculous I will have to forward your email to all my gun collecting friends to laugh at."

It has a scratch or two in the barrel above the gas block, and some marks in the brass deflector. It has the correct M110 gas block, and a URX II rail (a $700 rail), 20"" heavy 5R cut barrel, KAC stage 2 trigger, completely ambidextrous saftey. It's just missing the M110 SASS stock assembly, which I haven't been able to find since I bought it. A US Optics MR-10 with a MIL-GAP reticle comes with the rifle with M110 rings, a $2500 setup.This rifle is the real deal. It's not a clone. I'd like to sell the scope with the rifle for $5500. You'll be pretty hard pressed to find another m110, and you won't be able to get it with the scope for this price. I don't need to sell it, but I'd like to put the money towards a custom Spartan .300wm. I will consider some trades, like Wilson combats, or nicer AR's like Noveske's. Call after 5pm, text anytime.
