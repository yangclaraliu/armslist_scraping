Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

$1,060 firm in cash or may look at trades.I might consider trades, but only if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If it's not a good deal as far as the value goes, then there is no reason to offer it, sorry, just trying to save everyone some time.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal. Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns and bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Ammo in common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have PLENTY of ammo.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics to help, but I have nice scopes, Aimpoints and Eotechs just sitting right now for future projects.Ftf in the Dallas area and must be legal to own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

I can meet at a local ffl dealer in the area and it should only be 25-30 to transfer depending on location we decide on. List of upgrades/accessories included:1. Mission First Tactical Minimalist Stock. There's absolutely no wobble in the stock and it has a qd mount and sling option.2. Mission First Tactical Interchangeable Grip. This grip is more comfortable than magpuls miad grip and better looking in my opinion. Can also be changed into a slimmer grip for smaller hands. Also has custom storage container for batteries etc.3. Strike Industries Viper handguard with two magpul moe rails. One full length rail on bottom to attach foregrip of choice and one on the side. Comes with box and manual.4. Tacfire Light Brand new with box and manual. This is a quality light excellent for home defense.5. Mission First Tactical magwell Foregrip. Adds a lot of comfort to the rifle and has storage compartment.6. One HK made in Germany 30 round clear smoke magazine.

$1,260 firm in cash or better in trade.  
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal. 
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.
Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  Any all ammo deal would need to be a really good one as I have PLENTY of everthing.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or I can ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

Selling my interpretation of the holster and belt rig worn by Cullen Bohannon on AMC's series ""Hell on Wheels"". Complete with wide skirt, barrel sticking out the bottom, and brass buckle. This holster should fit an 1860 Army, 1858 Remington, 1851 Navy, or Single Action Army Colt, Ruger, Uberti, or Pietta. It should also fit a host of similarly-sized guns. The pictures show it with an 1860. 
The belt is 2"" wide and approximately 60+"" long. I left it blank without holes, so you can tell me your size and I can punch holes for you, or I can leave it blank and you can make your own hole.  If you're skinny enough, you can leave the excess belt length on and tuck it under like Bohannon does on the show.
Hand-made in the spirit of the Old West; this rig has been given an aged finished to look old and weathered, but it’s newly-made from thick veg-tan leather and topped with a custom oil and beeswax finish. Perfect accessory for cowboy action shooting. Holster only; the gun is not included! Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I do leatherwork as a hobby, so each piece is one-of-a-kind."

This is one of the most beautiful diamondbacks I have ever seen in almost new condition! No box but absolutely stunning. Colt introduced the double-action Diamondback as a deluxe model. It has a wide serrated target hammer, ventilated rib, fully adjustable target quality sights, and full-length barrel underlug. It is a 6-shot revolver with a swing-out cylinder and was available in blue or nickel finishes. Visually, the Diamondback resembles a scaled-down version of the Python. Because of the light recoil of .22 caliber ammunition, the .22 version of the Diamondback can be used as a training gun for novice shooters. It has also gained popularity with gun enthusiasts due to the inexpensive price of .22 caliber ammunition. In addition, the Diamondback was marketed to Law Enforcement agencies who did not allow the use of the .357 Magnum cartage."

Please take time folks, to study our auction photograph closely as they along with our detailed written listing will best describe this fantastic vintage collectable revolver. This is one of the early, and more desirable, pinned and recessed models. The factory fitted 3 ½ inch barrel is designed with a full length factory rib, or sight plain. The top of the barrel rib, along with the top of the frame, and the click adjustable rear sight all have a factory checkered pattern, or cross hatch pattern style finish, designed to cut down on glare from light when shooting. This designed feature is only found on the S&W Model 27 revolvers. The 3 1/2 inch barrel along with the six round cylinder chambers all have perfect bores, are chambered for the famous 357 Magnum cartridges, however this revolver will also chamber the .38 S&W Special cartridges, which are the same diameter, are interchangeable with the .357 Mag. cartridges, and are less expensive, with reduced felt recoil for more enjoyable target shooting. This beautifully designed revolver is factory fitted with the following options, a stationary quick draw serrated ramp style front sight, a fully adjustable square notch micrometer click rear sight, standard trigger, semi-wide target style hammer, and a very nice pair of S&W medallion Magna style Checkered Grips original to the revolver and correctly numbered to it. The grips have remained in great condition over the years, have nice sharp checkering, and have no chips, cracks, or flaws. This revolver is almost like new, still functions perfectly, has a nice smooth action, with a nice crisp trigger pull, and the factory applied case colors on the target style hammer and trigger are vibrant. This beauty has been amazingly well preserved over the past 48 years. The perfect fit and finish of the metal parts, along with the over-all factory original condition of this beautiful vintage Smith & Wesson Model 27-2 Revolver, would be near impossible to upgrade. To complete this very nice vintage package the revolver is still housed in the original Smith & Wesson two piece solid Silver border two piece blue box with correct matching end label still attached matching this guns specifics and serial number exactly, and the box has no exterior damage or repairs. This beautiful vintage revolver was found by the owners family in the rear of his gun vault, still wrapped in the factory supplied wax paper wrapping, and still housed in the factory shipping box as shown. There is no doubt that this beauty was well kept & maintained over the years by it's owner, which certainly helped to protect, and preserve it, and certainly adds to the over-all quality, and value of the revolver today. This is definitely one of the nicest packages you could ever find, and would be very difficult to upgrade. Also included inside the box are the original S&W factory shipping documents as shown in our auction photographs, including a Parts list, and the factory original cleaning kit, which consists of an aluminum cleaning rod, cotton bore swab, bore brush, and sight adjustment tool. What a fantastic vintage S&W Model 27-2 revolver, and if you are the winning bidder you will get it all, just like it was shipped from the factory 48 years ago. Most collectors and shooters alike will look far and wide to find another package that even comes close in comparison. This would be an excellent addition to even the most advanced collections, and also would make a fine investment. This is simply an absolutely great revolver!

It is a two piece modular system that includes (1) very effective high performance muzzle brake and (2) a ported Concussion Reduction Device (CRD) that attaches to the muzzle brake using a quick detach mechanism. The CRD has strategically placed side ports that allow the muzzle brake to retain its compensator functionality as opposed to brake shields that cover the brake and negates its function. With the CRD attached, recoil feels like a slight, straight to the rear push (it's a softer recoil feel, not the typical sharp kick). It is, of course, a compromise between reducing side concussion versus minimizing felt recoil. We believe we have achieved an optimal balance of sufficient brake/ compensator functionality (muzzle leveling effect) and side concussion reduction. The CRD has a quick detach/attach mechanism to allow you to easily switch back to a full brake whenever you.
