It is more true to the original in that the barrel is the correct length, and it has an extended AMD style muzzle break spot-welded on.

It is in very good condition with some minor finish wear on some of the corners as is to be expected if you are familiar with this variant.

I can include brass, wax bullets,primers and gun cleaner necessary to shoot cowboy fast draw.  the second gun is the Ruger Bisley Vaquero with either white synthetic grips or the more common wooden grips.  the Bisley will better fit the grip of a larger hand and has a lower hammer curl.  it feels slightly heavier than the New Vaquero but otherwise has the same dimensions and fires the same caliber, 45 long Colt.  The Bisley will come with the same accessories as the New Vavuero.  Both guns are a pleasure to shoot, extremely accurate and exceptionally pleasing to the eye.  The New Vaquero is priced at $550.00 or, the Bisley is priced at $675.00 as described.

Only permanent modification is a hole drilled through the reciever to accomodate a Magpul Zhukov stock which has been itself modified in order to accept the milled top tang that is still in factory position/condition. Milled receivers are at a different angle than stamped recievers, so while the stock is affixed permanently via a bolt into the receiver as well as the attachment to the tang, there was a small gap where you could see between the receiver and stock. There is a thin layer of epoxy that fills this gap and is used only to do so. All work has been completed by a gunsmith who works on AK pattern rifles. It is possible to reinstall the old stock which I will include, or to make other arrangments for a conversion to a stock using an ACE block or Ironwood designs stock. There is an attached Hogue grip, and bulgarian polymer forearm, as well as a bulgarian sling. Rattlecan paint job."

It is a rare gun imported from Turkey. Not a lot of people know about it because it is imported and not many places import them. Tisas is a company that provides Turkish military and police guns like Smith & Wesson is in the US. Although it is unheard of in the gun community it has been very popular in a lot of shows and tv series such as Psych, Burn notice, Continuum, Safe, Almost Human, Smallville, A walk along the tombstones, Arrow, Daredevil, Person of interest, and Backstrom. As far as the gun goes it is a double/single action, compensated barrel and slide, 4 16+1 mags and 1 20+1 mag for a total of 5 mags, professionally done stippled grip, OTB injection molded holster and and IWB nylon holster.

The P30SK completes the P30 full size series with a further first class defence weapon in an extremely compact design. In addition to it's reknown reliability, the P30SK is especially notable for its completely redesigned pistol grip ergonomics. The easily interchangeable grip shells (right/left) are a unique feature of the weapon. Together with the interchangeable back strap, this means that the pistol provides maximum configurability to any hand size - for both men and women. The standardised Picatinny rail according to MIL-STD-1913 at the front of the pistol grip provides greater flexibility when mounting additional tactical accessories. The P30SK is an ideal backup weapon for military and law enforcement users as well as for private security and bodyguards. In particular the compact design allows for a concealed and inconspicuous carry weapon.

A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide.  Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition.    Product Specs Item Number: DB9FS Caliber: 9x19MM Length: 7.8” Height: 5.6” Width: 1” Barrel Length: 4.75” Distance Between Sights: 6.25” Weight (unloaded): 21.5 oz Trigger Pull: ≈5.5# Magazine Capacity: 15+1 Rds UPC: REDACTED86"
