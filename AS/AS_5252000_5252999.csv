The rifle started life as a complete rifle factory built by Noveske. The previous owner purchased a different upper so he could shoot suppressed. I purchaseed the factory built upper from him and went to Rainier Arms, bought a Gen 3 Noveske lower and sent it for cerakote before I even picked it up. Lower was built with the same magpul furniture as comes from the factory on the rifle. Only difference is I went with a Spikes Battle Trigger over the ALG ACT (very similar). I also installed an ambi safety selector. There is zero rounds thru the lower and less than 100 thru the upper. It is in 99% condition. You would be hard pressed to even tell that it has been fired.

From Manufacturer: The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. The Nano's modular structure, ergonomics, and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed and its sights are user adjustable with a 1.5mm hex-wrench and your fingers."

I'm selling a Russian SRVV Jet Brake for AK pattern rifles with the 24x1.5mm RH threads(Arsenal). Will work with 7.62, 5.45 and 5.56 rifles. Takes the recoil of the 7.62x39 down to a level comparable to a 5.56/5.45, and absolutely eliminates muzzle climb. Only has about 50 rounds through it (not that it matters), and I have just finished soaking it in rem-oil for a few hours to remove any residual carbon. Threads and finish are in perfect condition, but it's a chunk of steel. What can you do to it? Selling because I have way too many brakes, and actually have a second Jet brake so I really don't need another.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."
