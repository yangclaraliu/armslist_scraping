This results in a pistol that is suitable for concealed carry or operating where a light is needed – and it doesn’t sacrifice any capacity.Pick up a Champion™ Operator®, and you’ll find that it’s a feature-loaded expression of the classic 4 inch 1911. The beavertail grip safety, flat mainspring housing, Lightweight Delta™ hammer, extended ambidextrous thumb safeties and extended trigger give you all the ergonomic advantages you want in a carry pistol. The 3-Dot tritium combat sights mean that the Champion™ Operator® is ready for any conditions. A carry gun also has to be reliable. Thanks to the lowered and flared ejection port, fully supported ramped match grade barrel and proprietary dual-captive recoil system, the Champion™ Operator® is guaranteed to perform when you need it most. And the Armory Kote™ finish will keep it performing for years to come.You can carry the Champion™ Operator® with you all day, appreciating its smaller size and standard capacity.

A new Kershaw knife is included in this set.   Charter Arms has made for itself a niche in the gun market, offering affordable handguns that work. Nothing fancy or exotic about the Patriot, but it is a good solid revolver that is reliable and accurate enough for social work and small animal control at reasonable ranges. Charter firearms are built in the USA and come with a lifetime warranty.  The Patriot is a solid-frame revolver and as such doesn’t have a removable sideplate, a design that provides additional strength. It is constructed completely of stainless steel, and the 4-inch barrel features a full-length underlug that not only protects the ejector rod from damage but also dampens recoil. The one-piece barrel/lug/sight assembly is threaded directly into the frame for rigidity and strength.  The front sight features a high, ramped blade, and the groove on the frame topstrap that serves as a rear sight is generously sized and squared off. When combined, they give a fast, clear sight picture, which can’t be said about some snubbies on the market.  The stainless steel cylinder features a three-point lockup: a wide, spring-loaded collar on the ejector rod engages the front of the frame; a stud on the rear of the ejector rod locks into the recoil shield; and the cylinder stop positions and holds the cylinder in place.  The system works. When the cylinder on this Patriot is locked up, there is no discernible wiggle.  The patriot can shoot 327 Federal, 32 S&W, 32 S&W Long and 32 H&R Mag rounds.    BRAND: Charter Arms    Features:   Charter Arms .327 Patriot Caliber: .327 Federal Magnum Capacity: 6 Barrel length: 4 in.

It has matching serial numbers on the receiver, magazine, forearm and bolt. It has an excellent 25 inch 5 grooved bore with bright and sharp lands. The headspace is good on a 0.067"" armourers gauge with a No '3' bolt head. The firing pin protrusion is 0.045 inch. The action is very good, tight and clean. The metal shows 99% of the blue finish with a little wear on the edges. It has a good BLO finish to the walnut stock with no cracks or major dings. The butt stock is stamped with the serial number of the scope it was set up with (1890 over another which is illegible). The scope mounts are original with no indications of the screws being re-locked (piened). The scope was produced by REL (Research Enterprises Ltd) with excellent optics and adjustments, complete with original leather lens cover with the broad arrow marking (maybe British as most Canadian equipment was marked C broad arrow). This appears to have been refurbished. Some witness marks of usage on the tube from the leather scope cups are present. The REL scopes were thought by some to be superior quality to the British scopes. The Brits may be excused as they were being bombed during production by the Germans. The wood forearm and hand guards are dark walnut wood. The rear hand guard has a arsenal repair applied at the rear. The butt stock is lighter in color and is stamped and painted with numerous numbers. The cheek piece appears to be of oak wood. This rifle has seen service in the Far East WWII theatre (India) from little patches of green paint on the metal which they used as a secondary protective. It has a serialized standard ten round magazine. This excellent condition is commensurate with one of the WW II Enfields' which has seventy years service.

The gun is built on a complete Smith and Wesson M&P lower with a complete Troy Alpha Upper Receiver.The gun features a chrome lined, free floated 14"" Barrel (with the Troy Medievel Flash Hider it brings the barrel length the the legal 16 inches) I believe the BC is melonite coated as well.  The rail is a Troy Aplha 13"" rail with the built in pop up front A2 sight with a fiber optic sight post and a Tritium Dioptic rear pop up Troy sight. I have 2 Mag-Pul polymer picatinny rail sections on the gun, one is holding a magpul foregrip and the other a Fenix TK32 flashlight (which is optional for an additional $100, the flashlight is heavy but worth it. it has settings for 10, 130, 400 and 900 lumens with a max distance of 437 yards and a red/green/blue LED option. I have only used the flashlight twice, once while putting batteries in it for the first time and last night when I took the photos of the gun)The rifle also features a hogue overmold grip, magpul 1-point sling mount, and a Troy butt stock with battery storage. The rifle comes with all orginal accessories, 3 10-round Troy FDE battle mags and 3 30-round Magpul P-Mags with a mag coupler, and 200 rounds of 55gr  5.56 FMJ.The lower has 250 rounds through it but the upper only has 150 through it. This gun shoots like a dream, it has next to no recoil, is easy to handle but it a lot louder than any other AR I have shot, with the shorter barrel it will produce a fire ball with each shot. I have only taken it to the range once but when I did I wanted to test the chrome lined barrel out, so I put an entire beta mag of Tulammo (surplus steel cased ammo) through it, not a single jam. I have $2,200.00 invested in the gun but am only looking to get $1600 for it. I am also willing to trade for the right rifle. I am looking for something semi-automatic in .308 Winchester, specifically a M1A (scout, loaded or National Match) a FN SCAR-17, any H&K rifle or a .308 AR.(Armslist will only allow me to post 1 photo of the rifle. I can send additional photos upon your request)"

833,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5137833,For Sale:  The Sharps Balanced Bolt Carrier Group (BBC),"Simi Valley, Los Angeles, California",$ 199,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 16, 2018",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Original SRC Balanced Bolt Carrier Group.  THIS BCG HAS A LIFETIME GUARANTEE, NO RECEIPT NECESSARY!!!! IF IT BREAKS, IT GETS REPLACED FOR FREE!The Sharps Balanced Bolt Carrier (BBC) is precisely machined from S7 steel which then undergoes our proprietary heat treatment process. The BBC is finished inside and out with NP3®/NP3® PLUS to minimize the need for lubricants, to aid in smooth operation and to make clean up a breeze. The BBC has the SRC logo machine cut on the side of the carrier which is visible when the ejection port door is open. It fits standard AR-15/M16/M4 rifles chambered in .223/5.56mm, 25-45 Sharps and 300 Blackout calibers. With a long history of innovation Sharps Rifle Company (SRC) has done it again!After developing the most technologically advanced AR-15/M16/M4 bolt in the world Sharps felt compelled to develop a bolt carrier unit to complement it. We began by identifying what the shortcomings were with the traditional AR-15/M16/M4 bolt carrier. We identified two primary issues. The first being the rotational camming of the carrier during the unlocking portion of the operational cycle. The second being the canting of the bolt carrier group upon firing due to the gas pressure exerted to the gas key which naturally causes the front of the bolt carrier group to rise and the rear of the bolt carrier group to be pressed downward during its rearward travel. Armed with this knowledge our team of innovative engineers set about to correct those shortcomings. We used computer design technology coupled with real world testing to address both of these issues. When the process was completed we sent the resulting prototypes to a broad spectrum of professionals who use their rifles hard for their personal evaluation and feedback. Their observations were then incorporated into the final design resulting in the new SRC Balanced Bolt Carrier (BBC). The Sharps BBC is precisely machined from S7 steel which then undergoes our proprietary heat treatment process. Finally the BBC is finished inside and out with NP3®/NP3® PLUS to minimize the need for lubricants, to aid in smooth operation and to make clean up a breeze. The BBC has the SRC logo machine cut on the side of the carrier which is visible when the ejection port door is open. It fits standard AR-15/M16/M4 rifles chambered in .223/5.56mm, 25-45 Sharps and 300 Blackout calibers. Superior Corrosion Resistance Every Balanced Bolt Carrier Group is coated with NP3®/NP3® PLUS, an electroless nickel-based finish. This process co-deposits sub-micron particles of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), commonly known as Teflon™, for self-lubricating corrosion resistance. NP3® PLUS offers far more corrosion resistance for marine and other hostile environments. NP3® PLUS gain up to five times as much corrosion resistance over standard NP3® and up to 10X more than regular electroless nickel!"

It is designed to accept 50 loaded rounds directly from any common 50 round ammo manufacturer box or from aftermarket 50 round plastic storage boxes. Simply align bullet tips and dump a box of ammo into the Mag Charger. The ammo is automatically aligned without touching a single round. Once filled with ammo, insert any AR magazine into the Mag Charger just as you would into a rifle. Then actuate the plunger back and forth loading 5 rounds per stroke as the spring loaded ammo carrier automatically advances aligning the next five rounds until magazine is fully loaded. The entire process of filling the Mag Charger with ammo and loading all 50 rounds into two magazines takes less than 15 seconds. An Ammo Transfer Tray is included to invert ammo that is positioned in boxes with the bullet tips oriented down or to stage bulk ammo for dumping into Mag Charger. Highly durable Polycarbonate construction, compatible with.223, 5.56 and.204 ammo. Patent Pending."
