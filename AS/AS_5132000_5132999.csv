It is a Universal Firearms Overwing O/U 12gauge shotgun. It was made in Italy and is a pretty little thing. I purchased it from an estate sale. When testing it out I discovered that it needs some work. The bottom barrel occasionally fires when the barrel is closed. If you are handy with gunsmithing or know someone who is this is a really cool gun. The barrel is ported and what shots I took with it I honestly could not miss at the trap range.

I have 5 factory 16rd magazines as well as a promag extended mag that holds about 25 rds reliably. I also have a extra factory magazine holster because I bought it after buying 4 more magazines for the gun. Also has a stick on talon grip wrap ideal for solid purchase of the pistol when shooting rapid fire or one handed. It's in like new condition as I am the original owner and I have not fired it much. It has spent most of the time I've had it inside my humidity controlled safe because I get more enjoyment out of shooting my milsurp rifles. It has always been thoroughly cleaned and oiled after each and every of the few times I've shot it. I'm most interested in trading for milsurps mainly because that's what I collect and spend most of my time shooting. Not interested in your hipoint and cash. I won't accept other handgun trades unless it's a ww2 era pistol or it's a decent berretta m9 or 92fs or a Springfield 1911 or 1911 from another respected manufacturer. This will make a great carry gun and a gun you can put thousands of rounds through with 100% reliability. Springfield xd series in my opinion puts shame to any factory glock with the features and accessories they come with right out of the box. If you disagree take both apart and compare them side by side and you'll see what I mean. Buyer must sign bill of sale stating they can legally own a handgun and the details of our transaction that we will both have copies of. I will also ask to see your ID. I check email quite often and I will reply asap with interest or a decline to your offer. $600 in trade value but I'll take $500 in cash for all of it (not including ammo). Do the math, buying all of this brand new will cost over $800 with tax and every thing is in like new condition. Prefer sales/trades to ccw holders but if not that's where the bill of sale and me seeing your ID comes into play. IF YOU'RE READING THIS IT'S STILL FOR SALE WILL REMOVE WHEN DEAL IS MADE."

Today's X-Bolt rifle inherits the strongest, most note-worthy features of its predecessors. The X-Bolt White Gold model has a Monte Carlo stock. This feature is recognized as the comb steps sharply down toward the heel of the buttstock, allowing more contact between the recoil pad of the stock and the shooter's shoulder. With this design, the recoil of the fired shell comes directly back or in-line with the stronger part of the inner shoulder, making the rifle more pleasant to shoot, especially when a long day at the range is expected. The White Gold's beauty is really on the inside, in how it shoots and what makes it so accurate. The three-lever Feather Trigger system is probably the most comfortable, simple trigger on any bolt-action rifle on the market. There is no take-up or creep and very little over-travel. This is the kind of trigger serious hunters and shooters demand. Next is the superb free-floating barrel with target Crown, then triple-checked for interior finish, straightness and air-guaged for total uniformity. No doubt, this rifle has it all. Looks, handling and most important, dead-on accuracy.

This Luger was turned in to the ultimate Match Target shooter sometime back in the 1930’s. The work was completed by the Legendary Target Barrel maker Mr. Du Mond of “Du Mond Manufacturing” (1930-1940). Du Mond gave this Luger a Custom heavy Luger Carbine barrel, and made the rear sight adjustable. If you ever wanted the ultimate Luger for Target shooting, this is it. Someone spent a lot of cash and time on this Navy Luger.This Navy Luger was worked on sometime in the 1930’s by Du Mond. You could only get this work done by sending your pistol to DuMond Manufacturing (1930-1940) From what I have learned, very few Luger pistols have these heavy custom Carbine barrel. There are only 6 known DuMond barrels for the 1906 Colt. I’ve never seen another Luger like this one.I found a few references to Du Mond barrels. 1) In “Pistols, a Modern Encyclopedia” by Henry Stebbins. His co-author Bert Shay describes ordering a Dumond barrel and sights for a 1903 Colt .32 ACP in 1945. Mr Dumond was deceased by the time that book came out in 1961, so information on the Gorenet will be lacking. Here is a video of a 1903 Colt w/ DuMond Barrel, found it interesting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LnTxQg-5fM2) Du Mond barrels were custom order only and I believe JACK O'CONNOR spoke of having a Springfield barreled with one. Elmer Keith mentioned liking them. Dumond died in 1943 or 1944 and the business was sold to someone, but they couldn't make a go of it. I have heard he made the majority of his barrels for rifles.This is no ordinary pistol. This Luger was customized by one of the best (legendary) Custom Target Makers of his time, Mr. Du Mond. This 1920 Luger was almost new when DuMond (1930’s) made this a target pistol.Could only upload 3 photo's, can send more.Will consider trades of equal value + -** I believe this has Sold, will remove when transaction has completed **"

I love buying and trying new things so I'm willing to sell or trade.  I already have another .45 so this was more of an impulse buy. Ha!  One thing to note about the gun is I scratched the small top back area of the slide with my wedding ring. I applied a textured durra coat and polished it only on that area. It looks great now but just wanted to state that. I also show a pic of that in my listing. The rest of the gun is almost mint.  Comes with two mags, two different sized grips with tool, lock and paperwork. You'll love the striker fire trigger!  Only one box of 50 has been put through it. Cash wise I'll take $450. Trades I'm interested in a Ruger 1911 Stainless, Tactical Rifle with scope, Sniper Rifle with scope, Ruger LCP plus cash, AR, big 80's Arcade Machine, Vintage Star Wars items, or anything fun.I will not take, Honda or any brand generators, cats,  rims, Barbie collections, naughty services, sewing machines, direct tv satellite dishes, concert tickets or anything else clearly dumb...........  But offer anything else.

The barreled action has been cerakoted black. It has an aftermarket Sharpshooter Trigger installed, fully adjustable and comes with the manual on how to use it. It also has 2 piece picatinny scope base. It will come with a hard case as well. The gun is in excellent condition, it only has one small scratch on it thanks to a local gun shop attempting to mount a scope on it for me. It will also come with a set of Redding Dies, 50 Remington unfired brass, and a full box of Berger 168gr VLD hunting bullets. I acquired this gun 2 years ago and never fired it. A year before I had a 300 win mag built by Louisiana Precision Rifles and I always said once I got it lined out then I would start on this one and it just never happened. It is taking up space in my gun room and it's time for it to move on and something else to move in. According to the man I purchased the rifle from it is an absolute tack driver and it has a low round count. There is $2800 in the rifle but acquired it for less than that. $1800 or I am open to possible trades. Gun is located in Ruston, Louisiana.

In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there.

Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use."
