Consists of:  Civil Air Patrol Uniform Blouse with Slacks  Confederate Air Force Short-Sleeved Shirt with embroidered Confederate Air Force, Confederate Flag, and Flying Museum  Confederate Air Force Long-Sleeved Shirt with Slacks  Dorsey Randall Buttram, Sr., died on 9/15/06 after a long and blessed life that began on August 15, 1916 in Colorado Springs as the fourth child to Frank and Merle Buttram. He attended school in Oklahoma City, spent his last year of junior high in Switzerland, and then graduated from Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania. He obtained his bachelors in electronic engineering from Cornell University in 1939. During World War II he served as a flight instructor for the United States Air Force and as a test pilot flying B-17s, C-54s and C-47s. After his tour of duty, he attended Oklahoma University for graduate work in geology. He met his wife, Phyllis Gayle Barnes of Pawnee, Oklahoma, at the First Christian Church of Oklahoma City where they both were members of the choir. They were married on August 21, 1943. After the war, he took over the management of the family's cattle ranches in Oklahoma and Mississippi, where the Brangus breed of cattle was developed, and worked with the Department of Agriculture to accept the Brangus breed as the first American breed of cattle. He served two terms as president of the International Brangus Breeders Association of America. At the same time, he was helping the family develop the Ruby Red grapefruit at the family's citrus groves in the Rio Grande Valley. Along with these previous activities, he was also becoming more involved in the family's oil business. He became president of the family's oil company in 1964. He felt his duty was to represent the Oklahoma oil industry in every way he could such as being on the Speakers Bureau of the Independent Petroleum Association of America of which he had been a member of since 1949. Thus he was invited to speak to the Parliament of England and virtually every state in America on the subject of energy. He made numerous trips to Washington DC to convey the message to Congress on the necessity of maintaining a healthy domestic oil industry. He served on the board of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association and was a member of the Oklahoma Geological Society as well as the prestigious American Association of Petroleum Geologists. He had a deep love of flying and was a leader in the Civil Air Patrol. He was a longstanding member of the Confederate Air Force, an organization dedicated to the preservation of World War II era combat aircraft, and as such he helped preserve and fly many of America's historic aircraft. He was the First Wing Leader of the Oklahoma Wing and served on the General Staff of the National Organization. He was an aircraft sponsor for the Heinkle HE-111 German bomber (the very airplane that was the personal aircraft of Francisco Franco, the Head of State and Dictator of Spain in the late 1930s), Douglas A-26 Invader, and the Consolidated PBY Catalina. One memorable event with the CAF occurred in 1972 at the 'Transpo 72' National Transportation Exposition held in Washington DC in the summer of 1972. The members of the CAF flew several dozen WWII aircraft from Harlingen, Texas to Washington, and at noon on one day of the exposition, the entire fleet of aircraft flew at low level up the Potomac River, past the Pentagon and on over the Capitol. Dorsey flew the Douglas A-26 Invader on this unique and probably never to be repeated mission. He was a great philanthropist of the arts and music. He continued the Buttram String Awards, a statewide competition for high school age string artists. He served as a Trustee for the Oklahoma Museum of Art. He served on the Board of the Chamber Orchestra and helped in its early inception. He also served on the Board of the Oklahoma Symphony Orchestra for many years. Mr. Buttram was an active member of the Sirloin Club, the Committee of 100, and the Men's Dinner Club. He also gave much of his time to the YMCA, Pee Wee baseball program, Boy Scouts, 4-H, and FFA. He maintained the tradition of supporting higher education through the University of Oklahoma that started with his father, Frank, and is being continued by the following generations of the family. Dorsey was a Master of the Royal Secret of the 32nd Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, and as such he also was active in Con-V, Jesters and the Shriners. His deep faith in our Lord Jesus and God his father led him to serve on the Board of Southwest Radio Church, as a Deacon of the First Christian Church of Oklahoma City, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and many other Christian organizations whose endeavors are to encourage mankind to follow in faith. Dorsey was a loyal booster of Oklahoma in the U.S. and abroad extolling the greatness and uniqueness of this fine state and claiming that to really see the U.S., a visit to Oklahoma is mandatory. He was also greatly admired and respected.  Military leaders in Washington D.C. had all but forgotten about the World War II war planes and the men who flew them. In the 1950's, when several retired pilots residing in Texas began restoring the planes, they referred to the military brass in Washington D.C. as Yankees and to themselves as the Confederate Air Force - or so the story goes.  The Confederate Air Force is a unique organization founded in the early 1950's. It has dedicated itself to the preservation of the world's greatest combat airplanes built between 1939-1945. These airplanes represent a time when American technology and manufacturing capacity overcame the 10 year lead enjoyed by our enemies during World War II. These planes proved to be the weapons that contributed to the Allied victory in 1945. The members of the Confederate Air Force created a flying museum, so to speak, of the historically significant aircraft from World War II. Their mission was to restore this outstanding collection of these fully operational aircraft to shed light on such an important time in the history of our country and of the world."

It has a ported barrel and slide from the factory (the C stands for Compensated) and has the older style Teniffer finish so it is smooth and not like the Nitride chalkboard the newer guns have. Round count is between 500 and 1000. For more info check out this youtube review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j0uudDoHPoThis is a great gun to shoot, the ports allow for less muzzle flip and less recoil, but the gun is a little too small for my hand and I do not want to modify the frame. Has a very small spot of holster rash on the right-rear corner of the slide. The gun is discontinued and quite rare but occasionally there are examples on Gunbroker. This is not a standard Glock 19, I'll sell it for $600 without the extras.The gun comes with the following:- Original Glock Case with Gun Lock, reloading tool, and cleaning rod.2 Glock Factory 15rd Magazines2 KCI 15rd Magazines (I have a total of 6 KCI mags, all work great)1 Pierce +2 extension (Seen on gun in pics, stock Glock magazine floorplate is also included)- Glock Extended Magazine Release (Installed, stock mag release is also included)- Glock Extended Slide Release (Installed, stock slide release is also included)- Fobus GL2E2 Right Hand Paddle Holster- Ghost Rocket 3.5lb Trigger (Not Currently Installed)- Ghost Firing Pin and Trigger Spring Kit (Not Currently Installed)- Hogue Handall Rubber GripI also have some cheap 9mm available for sale with the gun only, as well as KCI and Magpul 17rd magazines if interested.I'm looking for Factory Glock 17rd or 33rd Magazines, a SCCY 9mm, a cheap M44 or Type 53, an AR15 Carry Handle, and Magpul M-LOK accessories.

Being that it had a stock repair as most all rifles 100+ years old did the inspector marks were sanded at armory, the marines were well known for sanding marks.  Finish is all original hand burnished bluing with an excellent patina, there is a hatcher hole on the left side with the metal inside still unfinished, a distinct indication that it has not been refinished.
