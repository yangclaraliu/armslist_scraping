I received this brand new in case Springfield XD9 4"" Full Size Service Model 9mm pistol from my local gun shop last week after ordering it online. It is the ""essentials"" package which includes the Springfield XD9101HC 4"" Full Size Model 9mm Black pistol, two 16 round stainless steel magazines, bore brush, gun lock, plastic Springfield case, and manuals. This gun has never been fired since coming from the factory. The warranty information has not been registered with Springfield. 
From the Springfield website: ""The XD® 4″ Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD® 4″ Full Size has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD® 4” Full Size is the original XD® offering from Springfield Armory®, and the most basic XD®. This is the XD® that started it all.
The XD® 4″ Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4” Full Size. Where you point is where you shoot.""

The XD's frame is made from a proprietary polymer material that has produced a pistol that is extremely durable, reliable and lighter than popular competitive models.
The frame is checkered in front and rear for a more positive grip, even with wet or sweaty hands. The XD's also have a slide release, ambidextrous magazine release button, and a quick turn disassembly lever, allowing for amazingly fast and simple field-stripping."

Rampant Colt marks are in perfect condition, original grips are in very good condition. The finish has no other marks or scuffs and there is only a very very faint, minimally present turnline indicating that there is some handling but no carry wear and only MAYBE one firing. Lockup and timing are in perfect condition and bore is bright and shiny as are all chambers in the cylinder. The gun is even a little stiff to open because it feels like it has never been used. Pictures of this finish are hard to get and do not do it justice.

American Legends Rifle Awarded2016 Friends of the NRA’s “NRA Gun of the Year”Montana Rifle Co.Kalispell, MT (Ammoland.com) – The Montana Rifle Company (MRC) sure is enjoying a Stellar year. Not only were they 2015 Mule Deer Foundation’s “Rifle of the Year” with the ASR-SS Rifle, Field & Stream Magazine’s “Best of the Best” with the X2 Rifle, but just recently announced they are 2016 Friends of NRA’s “NRA Gun of the YEAR” with the all new American Legends Rifle (ALR).“To win this award is a highlight of the hard work and dedication that we have not only put into production, but also rifle design and development,” said MRC VP of Sales & Marketing, Jeff Sipe. “We had an idea of what we wanted this rifle to not only look like but also what we wanted it to symbolize,” Sipe added.The ALR is a 300 Win Mag built on MRC’s award winning Model 1999 Montana Action and match-grade hand-lapped barrels. The steel is chrome moly matte blued for an elegant finish without the glare no hunter likes to see in the field. The bottom metal is engraved in a gold Cerakote® engraving with the “NRA Gun of the Year” logo. The barrel is a #2 contour, 24” barrel with a 1- 10 inch twist rate.The biggest issue was having a wood stock in a production platform that could fill the desire for elegance. MRC worked along with the management crew at Boyds Gunstocks to come up with a stock that would fill its needs. The end result was an AA grade American walnut stock with black tip and grip featuring a wrap-around front checkering pattern and a raised cheek piece coupled with a 1” Pachmayr® decelerator pad.“The American West was won by legends that fought and died, struggled to survive and made a living in some of the harshest, yet most majestic lands known to man. It is in memory of these “legends” that we came up with the new rifle,” said Sipe.“There are many awards given in the firearms industry and this is one of the most coveted of them all. The NRA is not only a powerful lobbying group but by far one the most influential supporters of the 2nd Amendment in our country. It is an incredible honor to be awarded the ‘Gun of the Year’ and we are humbled and thankful to the Friends of NRA and the entire selection committee.”"

The hammer must be cocked back either manually, or by the action of the slide, to fire every shot. The advantage to this operation is two- fold.First and foremost, similar to the Colt 1911, the Sig Sauer has a superior trigger pull when compared to double action autos. In turn, this leads to greater accuracy. It has a crisp trigger that makes for a more pleasurable shooting experience than most double-action-only subcompact pistols.Second, the P938 Extreme's single action design allows Sig Sauer to incorporate a high ride beavertail grip frame, which leads to greater control under recoil by safely placing the shooter's hand up higher along the bore axis. This generous beavertail grip also protects the web of the hand between the shooter’s thumb and trigger finger, and the hammer recesses into the beavertail section, to avoid any chance of hammer or slide-bite while firing.In addition to being a great-looking pistol, the Sig Sauer P938 is much easier to load than other micro 9mm's on the market. For shooters that do not possess strong hands, it's smooth and easy slide is one of its greatest features. There are also positive vertical serrations on the back of the slide that further enhance loading and unloading.The slide locks to the rear on an empty magazine, and the slide latch release is easy to reach with the thumb of the shooting hand. Similarly, it has a user friendly manual thumb safety which further enhances shooter usability. However, there is no grip or magazine safety.While the 1911 is a ""cocked-and-locked"" design, the P938 is actually ""cocked-and-unlocked"". In other words, the slide can essentially be moved back and forth while the thumb safety remains engaged. This engineering design feature allows for the safe loading or unloading of the pistol.This Sig Sauer P938 Extreme weighs in at a mere 16.0 ounces and has a black Nitron slide that is extremely corrosion and wear resistant. In case you are unfamiliar with Nitron, this is Sig's term for the Ionbond finish that is administered at a specialty coating company's third party facility. Ionbond is a firearms finish that is applied through a Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) process. This involves the depositing of diamond-like carbon coatings via a vacuum, and results in a finish that will provide years of protection against wear while retaining a nice appearance.Similarly, the aluminum alloy frame has been black hard coat anodized for additional wear resistance. To prevent abrasion of clothing or skin, the slide and sharp edges have been rounded. With a 3"" barrel and a seven round extended magazine, the P938 Extreme has been designed to handle the extra energy from the 9mm cartridge.A set of excellent factory SIGLITE night sights sit on top of the slide, are highly visible, easy to use and tracks well in low light conditions. Hogue G10 Piranha grips provide a secure hold while firing the pistol. For warranty or repair, the pistol is backed by a manufacturers lifetime warranty. Overall, the Sig Sauer P938 Extreme is an ultra compact, lightweight, reliable and user friendly 9mm handgun that is made here in the U.S.A.  http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?i=719491  FeaturesSIGLITE: Night SightsCaliber: 9mmBarrel: 3""Slide: Stainless SteelFrame: Lightweight Aluminum AlloyFinish: Corrosion resistant Nitron slide, black hard anodized frameGrips: Hogue G-10 PiranhaSingle Action Design- Micro compact similar to Colt 1911Beavertail Style Frame- high ride hold for better control and comfortWidth: 1.1""Weight: 16 ouncesMagazine Capacity: (1) 7- Round Extended w/ Finger RestSafety- ambidextrous manual thumbWarranty: lifetime"

The butt stock has some finish wear and the barrel has spotted corrosion but doesn't affect the shooting performance.

These rifles are extremely hard to get your hands on. It took me 4 or so months to get my hands on this one. I have done the full AR swap, all Kel-Tec parts were used. I also have the original furniture that comes on the rifle. The neat thing about this rifle is it folds in half and can be stored in a small back pack. It's perfect for a camping rifle, truck gun or bug out gun. I used it as a truck gun. It has been fired about 50 times then stored in the truck. You will get the rifle, AR15 swapped furniture, original furniture, original two magazines, X1 reflex sight and the original box with paper work. I take extreme care of my weapons. I am parting with this rifle because I recently bought a .50 BMG rifle and I would like a night force scope to go on it. So this sale will go towards the scope. Price is firm, to get the full AR style swap it will cost you about 125 to 150 plus the cost of a rifle, if you can find one. I'm willing to drive up to 30 minutes from North Myrtle Beach. Will require you to sign a bill of sale."
