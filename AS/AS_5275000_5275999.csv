I bought this intending to keep it as an alternative to my target AR, but I have another route in mind at this time. I would also consider trades, but they would honestly need to be in my favor since I primarily need the cash. I would heavily consider a full size 38/357, CZ Scorpion, CMR30, or perhaps an AR10. Would also like a UC-9 “Uzi” carbine, or 9mm/45 carbine that takes block mags. Shoot any questions or offers to REDACTED and we can go from there.

This is a great find and passing it on to someone else that will enjoy this very beautiful Colt. The Colt Double Eagle is a double-action / single action, semi-automatic pistol manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company between 1989 and 1997. It was the first double-action semiautomatic pistol offered by the company and was available in standard full-size, as well as in more compact versions. It featured a decocking lever, and was chambered for several calibers. The design of the Double Eagle was based on the Colt M1911 pistol. Magazines are single stack and are identical to magazines shipped with the M1911. This Double Eagle is in mint condition and as if you walked back in 1989 and bought it brand new form the gun shop. It is getting very difficult to find these in NIB condition as most people buy these to fire. This one is ready for either a Colt collector to add to the collection or for the Colt range firing that is ready to take this out and find out what Colt offered in 1989 design and feel. You will be 100% satisfied with this Colt so don’t let it slip by you. Shipping is $25 and free for all military, veterans and law enforcement. Please visit and like our FB page at: DCF FB Page"

These rifles are Norinco built versions of the famed Russian SVD Dragunov sniper rifles. Both guns are all-numbers matching, in original padded hard cases. Both rifles come with original accessories including Type JJJ issue scopes. Originally, these guns were imported with two magazines each. I have been able to acquire another four magazines so each gun has 4 mags-- 8 mags total. I have seen a single magazine sell for as much as $450 on Gunbroker as of late. Which brings me to the next point. Both of these rifles are the rare 7.62x51 NATO versions (aka .308 Win). Originally only 1,000 made it into the U.S. Before being banned by Clinton. It is unknown how many survive to date. You're looking at two of them. Also included is manual, magazine pouch, and correct SVD bipod. The correct bipod alone is nearly impossible to find. I'm wanting to trade everything mentioned above for a Barrett M82 or M107. I will also sell for $11,000."

Manufacturer is China North Industries group in the world’s most populous nation. Importer and warrantor is Target Sports of Texas. Construction is entirely steel, with matte blue military finish. Sight is conventional threaded brass bead. Overall length is 20 inches, from muzzle to chamber mouth. Muzzle choke is .730 Cylinder bore. Outside diameter is .886 at the muzzle, and 1.252 at the chamber mouth. With a chamber mouth internal diameter of .805, wall thickness is .078 at the muzzle and .213 at the mouth. This barrel will handle 2 3/4 inch or 3 inch shells. It will NOT chamber a 3 1/2 inch shell. For Remington 870P series shotguns and pre 1987 shotguns, its lug is inletted for a detent ball, but one would need to be installed before the older style detent slotted magazine caps would stabilize. A magazine extension usually takes care of that remote problem anyway. We have added a Masen Black Warrior® Trench Gun style heat shield, that attaches with four brass screws that are included of course. Every barrel comes in its factory box with protective wrapper, silica gel, and grease coating. Replacement pricing on a new Remington 4620 is over $150, and Remington does not make a factory 20 inch barrel like this one. Heat shields often price at upwards of $50.

$760 firm in cash or higher in trade value.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in or around Garland area or I can ship to your FFL for $40 more in TX.  Has to be Overnight UPS and will need copy of your FFL before shipping.  Thanks for looking!"

Your already saving money by not paying tax, saving time by not having to fill out the forms 4473, and you don't have to take a number and wait like the big stores are making you do because the store owners are to cheap to properly staff their stores.
