It has all original bluing, there are no cracks or chips to the wood, very solid wood by action, very smooth and tight gun, and has very shiny bores. I test fired the thing after buying it and it shoots like a charm. I then cleaned, lubed, and waxed it up and stored it away for safe keeping.

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.  All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.SpecsModel #: VP9 Type: Pistol: Semi-Auto Finish: Blue Hostile Enviroment Stock: 3 Interchangable Backstraps, 6 Lateral PlatesSights: FT: 1-Dot RR: Low Snag 2-Dot (Luminescent)Barrel: 4.09 Hammer Forged with Polygonal RiflingOverall Length: 7.34Weight: 29.84 oz (with Magazine) Caliber: 9MM Capacity: 15+1 Action: Striker Fired# of Mags: 2Receiver: Black Polymer Frame with Picatinny RailFeatures: Striker Fired, Made in Germany, Ambidextrous Slide and Magazine Release"

(1) 1911A2 NCO Navy (Flat Chrome) with Nose Piece
(1) Chris Reeve’s Project One Knife -
 
Karl Lippard's 1911A2- The technology is century current and battle tested.  The pistol is the most accurate 1911 known.  For the purists that debate this point, try to CONSISTENTLY shoot 400 & 600 yard shots with open sights with your prized Colt 1911, and land the shots on the target. NOT POSSIBLE.
 
Important parts of the gun, except for springs, are made of S7 ~ Vacuum Arc Melt Steel, certainly one of the strongest and best metal found in the world today.  Tolerances are built at below .050 microns.  That is a slide fit worthy of a Marine, say no more.  In remote areas, the pistol's instructions call to be cleaned with sand and any type of liquid (in battle, another way of saying urine) and you will be ready to go.  It is guaranteed for life, guaranteed for life even if abused.  Now there is an interesting concept here, guaranteed for life, even if abused. 
 
The Lippard barrel will take pressures upwards of 78,000 PSI.  In essence, you could very comfortably fire 460 Rowland cartridge pressures with his barrels and still have plenty of strength to handle the load.  Colt's barrels don't test at 1/2 of the tested pressures that of a Lippard, actually more like 21%.
 
So it is battle tested, already the most accurate 1911 pistol (proven by its 400 & 600 yard recorded record ON YOUTUBE) guaranteed for life **including abuse**.   
 
History of the 1911 A2 Combat NCO® The proto-type
""Combat NCO® Grade 1911 A1®"" pistols were made in 1987-88 at Pachmayr Gunworks in Los Angeles, CA under the fine direction of shop foreman Lester Pittman. Modified 1911 A1 were called NCO's and protected their otherwise Classified nature. The design and tactics for the Combat NCO originated from then General Manager of Pachmayr, Karl C. Lippard, former USMC Drill Instructor, Jungle Instructor and Hand to Hand Combat instructor who had combat experience using the 1911 A1 in an offensive mode.
 
These 1911 A1 series 70 pistols were modified to military specifications for specific combat use in small quantities. There were three types of pistols produced for the military: they were marked ""NCO Grade Combat"" in which a detailed criteria was given; an Officer Grade Combat in 9mm for military officers only; and General Grade Officer"" .45 for General Grade officers only with their respective officer service number on the pistols. The NCO Grade pistols were requested by the Marine Corps for special unit use such as Force Recon, Delta Force and other special weapons units of the government for use against terrorists.
 
A manual was written for tactical engagement. Also designed for the criteria was a special knife made of A2 steel out of one solid bar. There were 27 knives made. It too was design specific to the military task of close quarter combat as taught by Marine Corps Hand to Hand Combat Instructors and Sgt. Lippard. All these military pistols and knives were warranted for life against everything from Pachmayr, including abuse. None made were ever returned or seen again.
 
These pistols were made exclusively for the military and not sold to the general public until resurrected and updated in 2007. The Combat NCO knives and subsequent variations were sold and well known to the public. The knives were tested and used on combat operations by Karl Lippard's old unit of 1st Force Recon and returned in 1999 upon retirement of the Unit Commanding Officer. The word ""Combat"" in the ""Combat NCO"" name is a statement of origin and identified it from common 1911 A1's.
 
The acronym ""NCO"" in the name was used because he was the man who used it. The man and the pistol are both called Combat NCO's. Born in Combat and tested there by Marines, Delta and CIA since 1987 the Combat NCO remains the only ""Offensive use"" 400 yard accurate military pistol designed for that duty in the world today.
 
Offensive Use Pistols in military service as a norm are defensive in nature. Specifically the 1911 A1 in discussion must be defined as defensive as it has none of the attributes to be used in an offensive mode. The sights are small giving poor results in most light conditions for accurate shooting at any distance beyond 10 feet for most users in a defensive mode. Its loose function made of 8620, and 4340 steel material allowed for functionality but limited its long term use, accuracy and survivability beyond the official life span of 16,000 rounds. Its redeeming feature however was the caliber of choice being the 45 ACP. In this it excelled in its assigned duty since 1911.
 
The Combat NCO®1911 A2® is an Offensive weapon by design. Before we can come to the designation of ""Combat NCO, NCO or 1911 A2"" model changes, we need to have a background on the differences from the 1911 A1. To even USE the term 1911 A2, or propose it, one would have to assume the original pistol in production designed by John Browning has been significantly modified in patent or design that improves the accuracy, economic life, function, effective range, interchangeability and military use of the A1. This has been done to such a degree that the 1911 A1 is not the same pistol except in conceptual thought.
 
Some subsystems remain KLD classified even today. Furthermore, there are continued advancements in design for patent called the ""A3 and A4"" models taking the original 1911 out in upgrades to the end of this platform design set to be year 2100.These changes in the way barrels are made and replaced, it's barrel bushing, nosepiece ~ bushing and it's use; the slide stop, safety, hammer, sear, frame, slide, front sight, rear sight fixed, rear sight adjustable and, to include the material used, constitutes a ""1911 A2"" and acknowledges its origins.
 
Now that we possess accuracy and safety in the Combat NCO®1911 A2® we can think about for the first time extending its maximum range. And while this data is found in great detail in patent we can say here that the sights specific to the Combat NCO®allows it to give good results up to 400 yards. Some discussion there as to thickness of the front sight blade comes into play as it is an Offensive Weapon; how targets are measured in distance by that; how targets are engaged to maximum range if necessary, and in qualified hands, even extend the range from 400 to 600 yards without sight adjustment.
 
When all the criteria are satisfied of an accurate Offensive Weapon on a 1911 design platform, and all patented components are present, collectively it is called a Combat NCO® model 1911 A2®. It's not who makes the gun that is important; but what's inside it. I will send separate actual pictures of the firearm, the ones used are from Karl’s stock. The pistol has been lightly used and the knife is used, but is pristine condition (99%)
 
 
The Project I (spear point blade) was designed in conjunction with Sgt. Karl Lippard, USMC and author of ""The Warriors - United States Marines"". The concept was to fulfill all the features which Sgt. Lippard felt were vital for a knife carried by a Marine.
The 7.5"" blade is perfect for chopping, digging and cutting, with sufficient weight up front for maximum strength and ideal balance. The wave serrations on the cutting edge are designed to cut easily through nylon cord or harness. The 2"" cross guard has a night index which tells you by touch which direction the cutting edge is facing."

The Model 22 was re-introduced as the second limited production Thunder Ranch revolver in 2007. This gun features a 4"" match barrel with under lug, fixed sights, cocobolo grips, and an internal lock. The popularity of this revolver led S&W to continue its production in its classic line as the 22-4. It is quite an accurate revolver and has a smoother trigger pull than the original, most likely due to improvements in production. A limited production run of bright nickel-plated, non–Thunder Ranch models were made. Only select firearm dealers were considered to be allowed to sell this particular model."
