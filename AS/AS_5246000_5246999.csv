The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle ejection port fire-control safety sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Profesionally Cerakoted with Magpul Flat Dark Earth.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.Buyer pays $25 shipping.

I figured I would let my Glock 43 go as a compromise. Exactly 40 rounds through it. 100% BONE STOCK. Never touched any internals, grip work... nothing. Always stored with Froglube in the safe. Comes exactly how I got it brand new with cleaning brush, magazine loader, Glock hard case, and 2 magazines (one with factory pinky extension). I don't really bring it to the range at all when I go so I'd figure I can let it go. I will also trade for a rilfe or pump action 12 gauge. I do not have any handgun permits so I can not trade for any of those. As always, cash is best. MUST have matching drivers license and FID along with Permit to Purchase handgun. I work shift work so I'm not available every day of the week, but can make my very best effort to make a deal happen. Thank you for looking, have a good day !"

Trade value should be in the 500 ballpark as I will include around 70 rounds of ammo and the 3 factory mags.I'm also willing to sell the gun outright. I have a good idea of the value of this gun so please, no lowball offers. I am not in a position to where I HAVE to sell it, just don't need a second pistol at the moment.

M4 feed ramps are incorporated into the barrel extension and upper to enhance reliable feeding, while a true 5.56x45 NATO chamber ensures that both commercial and higher pressure surplus mil-spec ammunition may be safely used. The bolt and carrier both pass a thorough Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) test for guaranteed structural integrity, and the gas key is properly staked to its mil-spec bolt carrier. All steel parts feature a heavy Mil-Spec Phosphate finish for superior corrosion resistance and durability, while aluminum parts are Type III Hard Coat Anodized.  This DDM4v5 features the new DDM4 12.0 Free Float Quad Rail Handguard that extends forward over a pinned, low profile gas block to create one long, uninterrupted top rail platform, as well as providing ample room for mounting tactical accessories and enhancing the system's accuracy potential by isolating the barrel from outside influences. The DDM4 Rail combines the best features of Daniel Defense's previous handguard designs to create an entirely new and improved platform. The 1-Piece Lower Rail of the handguard has been located closer to the barrel for an exceptionally slim, compact exterior footprint that is more comfortable and ergonomic to hold in the off-hand. The DDM4 rail is secured to the upper receiver with a new Bolt-Up System using 4 steel fasteners for rock solid stability and repeatable positioning of rail mounted accessories, and includes 4 Integral Quick Detach Sling Swivel Sockets for a multitude of sling mounting options. This DDM4v5 Upper is equipped with a Mid-Length Gas System that offers the advantages of a longer sight radius and a smoother recoil impulse, and comes complete and ready to fire with a charging handle assembly, Daniel Defense Flash Hider, 3 low profile ladder rail covers and a Daniel Defense Vertical Fore Grip.   Technical InformationUpper Receiver: A4 Flat-Top BarrelLength: 16"" Barrel Contour: Government Barrel Material: 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium, Cold Hammer Forged Muzzle Thread Pattern: 1/2""-28 Chrome Lined: YesBarrel Finish: Mil-Spec Heavy Phosphate Twist Rate: 1 in 7"" Chamber: 5.56x45mm NATO M4 Feed Ramps: Yes Muzzle Device: SureFire 3 Prong Flash HiderGas System Length: Mid Gas Block Diameter: 0.750"" Handguard: DDM4 12.0 Quad Rail, Free Float Sights: None Bolt Carrier Assembly Included: Yes Bolt Carrier Type: Mil-Spec Extras: Daniel Defense Vertical Grip, 3 Low Profile Rail Covers, Pinned Low Profile Gas Block Weight: 4 lbs, 8 oz"

It also has an extended beaver tail and a finger cut in the trigger guard to allow the shooter to have a higher grip, and better bore axis. This is truly the perfect Glock (and you don't have to send it away to a gunsmith with a soldering iron and heat gun with the hopes he is able to reshape the grip angle-and no amateur stifles!) This Glock's trigger has been tuned to 4.75#. All internal parts have been smoothed and blended.  It has extended slide release and extended slide take-down. All externals are stainless steel, along with the pins.  Gun comes with 3 mags, original case, lock, 2 Lone Wold back straps, and TWO BARRELS!  To build this yourself would be over $1000...  This Glock is s tack driver.

This Glock 19 has a very low round count and is built on LONE WOLF FRAME. The Lone Wolf frame changes the standard Glock grip angle to the same as an H&K or to a 1911 (depending on backstrap insert). It also has an extended beaver tail and a finger cut in the trigger guard to allow the shooter to have a higher grip, and better bore axis. This is truly the perfect Glock (and you don't have to send it away to a ""gunsmith"" with a soldering iron and heat gun with the hopes he is able to reshape the grip angle-and no amateur stifles!) This Glock's trigger has been tuned to 4.75#. All internal parts have been smoothed and blended. It has extended slide release and extended slide take-down. All externals are stainless steel, along with the pins. Gun comes with 3 mags, original case, lock, 2 Lone Wolf back straps, and TWO BARRELS! To build this yourself would be over $1000... This Glock is a tack driver. Suppressor or carry ready."
