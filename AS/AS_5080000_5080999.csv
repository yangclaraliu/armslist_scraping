The Glock 19 Gen 4 was purchased new on 1/14/2016 from a local gun shop here in Forney (I have the paperwork). Just today (1/19) I was able to get a great deal on an AR-10. So now I'm in need of a tactical scope/mount for the AR-10. (the wife wont let me buy anything else without letting go of a few items)
The Glock has not been shot yet. All I did was add the ""rubber"" Talon grip to it..which can be removed if you don't like it. The price for the grip was 20$ from Amazon.It comes complete just as if you bought it new and then walked out of your local gun shop with it.
Just to give you an idea of the scopes I'm looking at... Vortex Viper HS-T, PST...Leupold AR Mod 1, SWFA SS HD.... just to name a few tactical ones. I'm not looking for NCStar etc... then again I'm not expecting NF or Zeiss either.
If you have a scope you think falls into the ones above I mentioned..let me know. Then again if you want to just purchase the Glock that would also work.
Let me know what you think.... If I dont respond to your offer please dont be offended...Im just not interested in it.
Im located in Forney...I will only travel a short distance to the surrounding areas. FTF, CASH ...""BILL OF SALE"" Transaction only. Have a valid TX license or CHL...Text 770 Two 89- Nine 899, or message me throught Armslist."

The gun has never been fired and only been taken out of the box to registered at purchase. The entire display was put back in the original box and locked in my safe. This is not the same quality as a Remington R1 because I own one and you can tell the difference as soon as you pick it up. There is nothing wrong with the R1, I love it , but this 1911 is of much better quality and much tighter. More the feel of a Nighthawk or Kimber if you know what I mean. It is a replica of the original 1911s used in WW1 by the USMC with leather holster, double mag pouch, and laynard. I hate to have to sell it but I need a new scope for a precision rifle I am building and something has to go.

My revolver deserves the best home I can find. I have come close a few times but no winner yet. So here is the deal. I am in Winfield, KS. If I sell or we trade you will come here. I will NOT lower the price for you because you have to travel. Price is firm and fair, $550. As for trades? I am looking for another XDSC 3"" Mod 2 or a XDs 3.3 in 9 or .45 only. I will look at all offers ONLY if there are pictures sent with info in the email. Do not ask if it is available. If the ad is up, it is. I like all things really. I will look at old trucks and such. I don't want another revolver I have enough. FDE is wanted in the fore mentioned trades. Used or new. I am easy to work with but travel daily and never know when I will get back so please be patient and flexible with me. Thanks again for looking and have a Blessed Day!!   Will trade for: XDSC Mod 2 in FDE 9 or .45 3"" barrel XDs in FDE or black .45 only  I will look at all offers if you send pictures and info with the request. I am mainly interested in .45 cal only. I like Glocks Gen 4 in .45 ACP or a 1911 platform in .45 but like I said I will look at all offers but no pictures and info gets you no reply. Thanks."

I picked this gun up off of a older gentleman at hunting camp this year who bought it new. He gave me 2 and 1/2 boxes of shells with it and said that he had only shot it a few times then put it in the safe. I took the old scope off of it and put a BSA I had laying around on it to better utilize the flat shooting round but have not had a chance to shoot it yet because it's been so damn cold out. Anyway I have a few other projects I'm working on and could use the cash to finish them so it's up for sale. These old 700s are awesome and getting harder to find in such nice shape.

I have a Kahr P380 in great condition and minimal use. The Kahr P380 is the black diamond edition and has had under 150rds through it. My P380 will come with talon grips, box, paperwork, 1-6rd magazine and either another 6rd / 7rd or 8rd magazine your choice. In my honest opinion this is the finest pocket 380 on the market that has no thumb safety. The size is neck and neck with the Ruger LCP but has a great trigger and actually dove tail sights. Only reason that I am trading it is due to me walking into another P380 with night sights and would like trade it to fill another role. I am looking to trade for one of the following, depending on trade offer cash may be expected or given. Keep in mind this is the premium line from Kahr and was purchased for $599.99 and is not the CW380.

These can be removed but I recommend them as it allows for a wider variety of screws to be used. With the wood grips, I also have 4 thin washers used as spacers for a nice tight fit.    *****4 Mec Gar 18 round magazines    *****Olight PL1 Valkarie weapon light (pictured)    *****Israeli Military Industries Retention Roto Holster    *****In addition to the above, I also touched up the front and rear sights with high-vis model paint.

Have primers, shot, wads, cases, and other miscelaneous needs for reloading if interested. This information comes directly from Hornady website:info below taken off website  Hornady 366 Reloader 12ga 2.75"" Hornady's 366 Auto Shotshell Reloading Press is the ideal press for the avid target shooter. The time-tested design lets you load high-quality, low-cost ammo in a hurry, just set the case and wad in place, and pull the handle. The 366 Auto does the rest, automatically. FEATURES INCLUDE: PRIMER TUBE FILLER Every 366 Auto includes our Primer Tube Filler. Holds a full box of shotshell primers, and fills the tube with a turn of the dial. Will not drop primers upside-down into the tube. EASY EMPTY POWDER AND SHOT HOPPER TUBES If you need to empty your powder or shot, this entire assembly can be easily removed without spilling, a feature unique to the 366 Auto. Baffles let powder and shot flow more smoothly for more uniform loads from start to finish. AUTOMATIC PRIMER FEED SYSTEM Makes priming shells automatic with the pull of the handle. Extremely smooth and reliable design reduces to nearly zero the chances of crushing the primer. Primer Tube Filler ensures no upside-down primers enter the feeder tube. THREE-STAGE TAPER LOC CRIMPING Starts crimp, closes and tapers. Perform more reliable crimping with both six or eight point crimps. Give factory taper to your shells. PRIMER FEEDER SHUT-OFF (optional) SPRING LOADED SEATER PUNCH (optional) STANDARD SHOT AND POWDER BUSHINGS These easy-to-change standard bushings make it easy to switch to a different shot or powder for most popular target loads. POWDER SHUT-OFF AND SHOT SHUT-OFF The shut-offs for powder and shot let you operate the machine as you need to by shutting off individual stations. SWING-OUT WAD GUIDE The wad guide swings out to give you better access, making it easier to place the wad. Helps to speed up your reloading. AUTOMATIC INDEXING Each pull of the lever automatically rotates the shell plate, so you do not have to do it manually. You will be amazed at how much faster and smoother your reloading efforts go with auto indexing. FULL-LENGTH RESIZING STATION You can resize your shells to factory dimensions, or skip this station entirely and speed up your reloading. Many presses force you to resize. The 366 Auto gives you the choice. PRIMER CATCHER Every pull of the handle ejects the spent primer from fired shells into the primer catcher for neat, easy disposal. AUTOMATIC SHELL EJECTION Completed shells are automatically ejected behind the press, so you don't have to remove them manually. Another speed advantage over other presses. SHOT DRAIN HOLES IN SHELL PLATE If you reload, you will eventually spill shot. Spilled shot rolls to the edge of the shell plate and through the holes, so it won't jam. ALL DIECAST CONSTRUCTION Solid die-cast frame is long lasting, and provides a stable, rigid platform for precision reloading."

From the 17 Remington to the 243 Winchester to the 375 H&H Magnum, accuracy and performance are excellent. In addition, it is a longtime favorite of Match shooters' Next is one full box of Hornady Frontier factory loads with 55gr Spire point bullets (super shocks) , count is 20.Next is a count of 10 Remington Peters 55gr Hollow Points.So the total count of live rounds in 22-250 is 90 rounds with 30 being factory loads and 60 being reloads.I acquired this ammo with several guns I bought and the long guns have been sold so I have no use for the ammo.Check my other listing for some 30-06 factory ammo too.If you happen to have any IMR SR4756 powder I would consider that on trade.If you have questions please ask. I do reload myself for pistol and revolver, these rifle rounds appear to be reloaded in a quality way. I take no responsibilty however for them.Will take on trade CCI or Winchester small and large pistol primers and possibly other reloading essentials so inquire if you have something to trade please.............Thanks!"
