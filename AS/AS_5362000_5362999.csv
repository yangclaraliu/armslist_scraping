The 457 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The 457 is a traditional double-action pistol, meaning that the first shot is fired in double-action mode and the following shots are fired in single-action mode. The 457 has a 3.75-inch barrel and 7-round magazine capacity. The compact design of the pistol makes it ideal for concealed carry. There is no spur on the hammer, thereby reducing the risk of being caught on clothing when you draw the weapon. This pistol comes with the original box, 2 magazines and all the original paperwork. The pistol has slight wear marks on the finish from the holster but is in excellent condition, no scratches, marks or dings.

Very few rounds have been fired out of this 35 year old beauty. It has been stored in a climate controlled safe since it was imported to the U.S. in the early 80s. Minor wear from a few trips to the range and getting moved around in the safe, but in good condition overall for its age and no rust anywhere. Barrel has a bright and shiny bore with deep rifling. This rifle is built like a tank, will eat anything you throw at it, and will last a lifetime and then some. These will only go up in value and are a great investment. Get this while you can, before Hillary gets elected or Obama's Executive Order bans their transfer. Includes one 20 rd mag. Also have a new, never used geniune German HK claw mount with the 30mm scope rings which retails for $550 which can be sold separately or made a packaged deal with the rifle.

I have heard debates regarding using 22 conversion kits in a 5.56/223 upper. Believe it’s a matter of opinion but I would only run dedicated 22 uppers on my 5.56 lowers.
 
I inspected everything you see here before purchase. Also, I have put about 1000 rounds through this upper and it functions flawlessly. 22lr is extremely dirty ammo so every time this upper was fired it was taken down, cleaned, oiled and stored in a safe. I bought this when it looked like the government was going to attempt to ban 5.56/223 ammo. Hell, they still might but wanted to keep training so I went to 22lr to keep sharp. Then came the 22 shortages so that plan went to crap. Now both are available in abundance.
 
Here’s the deal, I am selling the upper with three mags along with the riser and red dot optic for $170. I would not mind holding onto the ATI 5.56 lower, as it really is a great lower. Never know when the next attempted AR ban will come down the pike so it will quadruple in value should we get another socialist in office. That said, if you want the lower and the Blackhawk bag included I would take $300 for the entire package. This would be a great training package for shooters as well as a great training platform for younger shooters becoming familiar with the AR15.
 
If you want to make an offer please feel free. All I can say is no but there will be no hard feelings. I might also we willing to trade so throw anything at me you like.
All buyers must be 23 years of age and have an active Oklahoma driver’s license. CCW’s preferred.

It's had under 200 rounds through it, but has been dead-nuts accurate, with 100% reliability. These are considered in some circles to be the finest polymer-framed 9mm duty pistol made. The slides are Tenifer treated for wear and corrosion resistence, and features a decocking button, which safely returns the pistol to double-action mode (much like the Sigs, Beretta 92, CZ75BD, etc.) , making it vastly safer to carry or store with a chambered round, while still retaining the ability to fire instantly without any traditional safety in the way (this pretty much negates the likelyhood of an accidental discharge, as has become so common with Glocks and other striker fired safetyless pistols.)These also have the Euroepean-style paddle-type ambidetrous magazine release, whcih make it nearly impossible to accidentally release a magazine, as can happen with the more common button releases. Another unique feature is that these have a ""double strike"" capability, meaning if you get a bad primer strike, you can immediately pull the trigger again, you don't have to pull the slide to eject the round and re-cycle the action, as with other striker-fired designs.This  was made in Ulm,Germany, like all the other ""real"" Walthers of the past 100 years, it isn't one of the SW99 collaborations with Smith & Wesson (not that there was anything wrong with them, that just matters to some folks).And yes, this was the James Bond gun during the Pierce Brosnan years !!Buyer must be a Georgia resident that is over 21 and otherwise legally allowed to own fireams,and have valid ID. I have my Georgia carry permit, so I'm good to go.Thanks for looking......P.S. The photo with the case and papers is of the actual pistol, the other one is just a pic I borrowed of the interwebz, but it had much better clarity, and is identical."
