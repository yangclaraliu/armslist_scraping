The blue is great for people who have astigmatism or any type of color blindness and have trouble with green or red reticle a getting blurry or blooming. Also, the blue contrasts against any natural background much better than red or green reticles.  At 1.8 magnification this reticle acts as a quick aiming point for closer and faster target acquisition. At full magnification to provides the accurate aiming expected of a precision rifle scope. It was also build with an internal bubble level seen when behind the glass in the bottom of the eyepiece. This has the U.S. Optics custom fast-focus eye piece for rapid FOV adjustment. Parallax is adjustable via knob on left side. The scope comes in the original box with an extended Anti Reflective Device/ Sunshade, turret adjustment tool, screw-in hard lens covers and U.S. Optics flip up lens covers. This is scope was only installed in an American Defense Manufacturing 20 MOA quick-detach mount for indoor  display purposes.

Only 2000 were ever imported. This pistol is like new. Includes Nylon holster, cleaning kit, 3 10rd Mags, 86 rnds target and 94 rnds hollow point.
The ""Barak"" (""Lightning"" in Hebrew) pistol was developed by famous IMI (Israel Military Industries, now IWI - Israeli Weapon Industries Ltd) company by the 2002. Originally intended as a military pistol for Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), the ""Barak"" was apparently supposed to replace in Israeli service the older Jericho pistols of domestic origins, as well as Glock pistols, quite popular in Israel. So far the future of ""Barak"" as an IDF service pistol is uncertain, and in the meanwhile IMI decided to bring this pistol to international market. It became available in Europe early in 2003, and in USA by the late 2003. In Europe it is still known as ""Barak"", and in USA it is known as Magnum Research SP-21 (Magnum Research Inc is currently a sole importer of IMI / IWI firearms in the USA).  ""Barak"" SP-21 pistol is not the best looking handgun, but it is definitely a practical and business-like pistol, available in most popular calibers: 9mm Luger, .40S&W and .45ACP. It is also flexible in functioning, because of double action trigger, separated ambidextrous safety which allowed for ""cocked & locked"" carry, and a separate decocker button, located at the top of the slide, just ahead of the rear sight. Additional ""modern"" features are polymer frame and accessory rail under the barrel. As a result, this gun is, at least for all practical purposes, a strong rival to such pistols as a Glock or Walther P99. However, it is still to be seen if this gun will succeed both in Israel or on international market.  The ""Barak"" SP-21 pistol is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. While the rounded shape of the slide can suggest the rotating barrel lockup, in fact the SP-21 features a Browning High Power type tilting barrel locking. The pistol is hammer fired, with true double action trigger, ambidextrous frame-mounted safety lever and separate slide-mounted decocker button (at the top of the slide). Civilian models, offered in USA, also feature an internal key lock as an additional safety feature.

Numerous uses in conjunction with night vision. $650 cash or $750 trade. Sold new for $1279.  See below for full description:
The AN/PEQ-2A Infrared Target Pointer/Illuminator/Aiming Laser, (ITPIAL), P/N ITP-500C incorporates lessons learned with Aiming Lights in Desert Storm, other combat operations, and extensive field evaluation, plus production experience with over 50,000 US Military standard aiming lights. The result is a dual beam multi-function laser, which combines the utility and operational effectiveness of aiming lights and illuminator/pointers in a singe device.
Separate Aiming and Illuminator Beams. Both beams are adjustable in elevation and windage. Aim spot can be centered in illumination area. Illumination beam is able to focus from a pinpoint spot to wide-angle flood. Pointer ranges can exceed 10 miles. Various diffusers available for customized light shaping. Compact, Durable, and Lightweight. Uses 2 AA batteries. Waterproof to 66 feet. Meets all military environmental requirements Operation The ITPIAL features a unique switching capability for both gun mounted and hand held operation. A fully integrated low profile Mode Selector Switch is conveniently located for ambidextrous operation and is designed for ease of use even under zero light conditions. The switch allows the operator to select one of six modes: AN/PEQ-2 OFF AIM – LOW AIM – HI ILLUMINATOR DUAL-LOW DUAL-HIGH
The AN/PEQ-2A model incorporates a safety block over the switch that prevents the user from switching the mode switch into High Power.
Low power is eye safe* and is useful for force on force training and to preclude blooming in close combat engagements, while high power enables engagements or training at extended range and in high light conditions. The Infrared Target Illuminator/Pointer/Aiming Laser beam can be adjusted from a 0.5-mrad beam for long range pointing to a 10° circular illumination beam. A variety of lights shaping diffusers are available for creating wider illumination angles. The ITPIAL is the only device of its kind to have two independently adjustable beams. The ITPIAL has two sets of Azimuth and Elevation adjusters that allow the operator independent adjustment of both laser beams.
The ITPIAL is equipped with an integral push button FIRE switch, which provides convenient operation in the hand held mode. This single button switch enables the operator to activate the ITPIAL in either momentary or steady on modes. When weapon mounted the ITPIAL can be activated using a variety of remote switches.
Depending on the weapon and the preference of the user, “push button” or membrane remotes of various lengths can be supplied. All switches quickly attach to the weapon and provide for convenient fingertip operation of the system, and all switches withstand demanding military environments.
Performance The ITPIAL is a highly durable, lightweight device manufactured with advanced engineering polymers and composites for maximum utility and durability. The ITPIAL incorporates an advanced electro-optical system comprised of two index guided laser diodes, diffraction limited micro-lens assemblies, and unique full logic microprocessor controlled electronic drivers.
Weapon Attachment The ITPIAL is easily attached to all US Military Standard direct fire weapons and the AT4 Rocket Launcher with standard brackets. The ITPIAL attaches to the various brackets with a single thumbscrew. The ITPIAL can be removed and reinstalled on its bracket without loss of zero."

It's a licensed copy of the Czech ZVI ZP-98 ""Kevin"" pistol. It's blued, with a black alloy frame, and uses a unique gas-retarded blowback action that operates via a ported barrel. In my experience this makes for exceptional reliability without the weight or stiff recoil of a straight-blowback pistol. It is one of the smallest .380 pistols on the market, being shorter than the LCP / TCP / P3AT in both length and height, albeit a little thicker and heavier.This pistol is in excellent condition, with only minor carry wear.

This looks like an early 1970's production that may have been sporterized by the factory at a later mid 70's date. This info came from a fellow whom certainly knows his 99's and was a big help in researching the numbers and stock design. For an extra 650.00 I have 127 rounds of 150grain ammo and an extra magazine. I was just informed that this rifle may very well be one of the last .284 rifles Savage made. I will leave that to the experts. Thank You for looking.Cash price is 1,000.00 firm.....email for more photos.A little info on the .284; 
For open country hunting of deer and pronghorn, the .284 Winchester loaded with the Speer 130-grain (8.4 g) spitzer at 3,100 ft/s (940 m/s) will do anything the .270 Winchester will do and it will do it in a short action rifle. Larger game calls for bullets weighing from 150 to 160 grains (10 g). H4831, H450, H4350, H414, IMR-4350, and IMR-4831 are excellent powders for the .284 Winchester.
These ballistics make it clear that the .284 Winchester is as good as the .280 Remington with the same weight bullet. Of course the short, handy mountain rifles for which the .284 Winchester seems best suited seldom come with 24-inch barrels.
The cartridge is sometimes used for long range target shooting like 1000 yd/m long range competitions, where participants usually load their own cartridges. For this application the .284 Winchester is loaded with 175 and 180 gr"
