28,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5328028,For Sale:  Double Eagle M85 G36 Style Airsoft Electric Rifle,"Webb City, Joplin, Missouri",$ 60,"Listed On: Thursday, April 7, 2016",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"BRAND NEW IN OPEN BOX. I bought it new for a project but changed my mind. Price is $60.00. Located in Webb City, MO.
Description A 1:1 scale replica of an actual M85 machine gun, this electric airsoft gun is remarkably authentic. The AEG fires round plastic pellets known as BBs, which are propelled out of the gun by compressed air. The advantage of the airsoft machine gun, however, is that players can safely train, simulate, or play with the gun without fearing serious injury. The M85 looks, feels, weighs, and functions just like a real firearm, but is built for casual recreation rather than weaponized use. The M85 is considered a low-powered electric rifle (LPEG) due to the use of a plastic gearbox (PGB), making it an ideal entry-level introduction to electric airsoft guns.
The M85--which shoots up to 260 fps--includes a battery, charger, and electronic sight for a perfect all-in-one airsoft setup. Semi-Auto/Full-Auto selectable. Fires 6mm ammo at approx. 260 FPS. 500 rounds per min. 50 round capacity. 7.2V 700mAh. Folding stock. Includes battery & charger, adjustable electric red dot sight, mock silencer, safety glasses, sling, airsoft tools, and a few BBs. Variable Hop-up system."

Requirements were issued in 1949 that the pistol had to be chambered for 9 mm Parabellum and could not exceed 7 inches in length or weigh more than 25 ounces. Candidates included Browning Hi-Power variants by Canada's Inglis and Belgium's Fabrique Nationale, and Smith & Wesson's S&W Model 39. Colt entered a modified version of their M1911 pistol that was chambered for 9 mm Parabellum, had an aluminum alloy frame, a short 4.25-inch barrel, and a 9-round magazine. In 1950, Colt moved their candidate into regular production. It was the first aluminum-framed large frame pistol in major production and the first Colt pistol to be originally chambered in 9 mm Parabellum. The first year's production included 45 ACP and 38 Super chamberings. In 1970, Colt introduced the all-steel ""Colt Combat Commander"", with an optional model in satin nickel. To differentiate between the two models, the aluminum-framed model was renamed the ""Lightweight Commander""."

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

This handgun bright displays a stainless steel polished finish, select walnut grips with inlaid gold medallions, gold-filled engraved slide with Dr. Ugo Beretta's signature and 470th anniversary logos. It also has an ambidextrous safety de-cocking lever, and 3-dot fixed sights. I purchased this handgun a little over 16 years ago brand new  and have never fired it so it's in brand new condition. This firearm has been one of my best collector items in my firearm collection, but now I am in a postion to where I have to let it go. I have seen this handgun in particular go for over $2000 used and fired online so I know mine is worth a fair amount and also because these models are not quite easy to come upon. I have not see any local gun store including Cabelas and Bass pro shop have in stock or on display this exact model so I guess you can say it's pretty rare since only 470 models were made. It hurts me to have to let it go mainly because I've had it for so long but I have other priorities at the moment. The handgun comes with the orginal case of which I will say has a couple of scratches not from mishandling, but because i've had it in a safe for so long and once in a while I would move it around and over the years the case would take a couple of scratches but that does not reflect the beauty and condition of the firearm itself. It also comes with the 10round factory magazine which has the mark of the 470th anniversary logo on it. My asking price for the handgun is $2100OBO please feel free to call, text, or email me anytime for further questions or more images of the handgun my number is REDACTED"

The patented ACSS reticle allows for quick and easy ranging and hits on man-sized targets out to 800 yards. Also factors in windage and has holds for the average running speed of a man. The reticle is etched in the glass so no batteries is no problem. In my opinion, it's like a bugdet ACOG. The description below is from their website. Check out their site for more information and reviews. Comes with packaging and paperwork for all components.The Primary Arms 5X Prism Scope features the patented ACSS reticle, providing quick ranging, wind holds and moving target leads for .223 Remington, .308 Winchester, and 5.45x39, in an easy to use sighting system at 5x magnification. The etched reticle requires no illumination, but a CR2032 battery illuminates the center through 5 red brightness settings and 5 green brightness settings. The scope is extremely durable, designed to handle heavy recoil and extreme weather conditions, with a 3-year warranty. A 1913 Picatinny mount is included, but this versatile optic is also able to accept ACOG, quick detach (QD), and standard bases for AR15 and AK 47 platforms. The standard mount can be removed for use on AR15/M16 carry handles in conjunction with our carry handle screw, product code 92581A320.

My gun is in good shape, just has a little holster wear on the slide. It was manufactured in 2004 and has the LEM trigger. It is double action only and has a smooth trigger with a consistent break at 5-6 pounds. It does not have a manual safety or decocker since the LEM was installed. The gun also has tru dot night sights installed. The pistol will come with a box, one 8 round magazine, and a fobus OWB kydex holster. Depending on the trade deal, I can include a couple boxes of target ammo and a couple boxes of JHP defense ammo. I am looking for a nice full sized pistol in either 45acp or 9mm. I do not want a .40 but for the right gun I will consider it. I would like to find something like an FNX, FNP, FNS, HK45, P220, G41, G34, etc. Basically a full sized duty pistol in the same ballpark as my gun. For the right trade, I can also include my Sig P320 but that's only if there is a value difference I need to make up. That gun is pending on another trade but if I trade it then I will update this listing to reflect it. If this listing is up, then the gun(s) is still available. You may TEXT ONLY to REDACTED or email me for inquiries."
