The condition is around 95% with no issues and only normal wear from handling. I've had this rifle for a few years and the only reason I'm selling it is because I'm switching all of my rifles over to .308. Just had this rifle taken down completely for a detailed cleaning and inspection. It still had the factory 'grease' type lubricant that tends to freeze or slow things up in the cold weather. Replaced all of that junk with a lighter oil and adjusted the trigger to have a nice, crisp release at 2 pounds and 5 ounces. Still has the original trigger assembly and have never had one issue with it firing when it wasn't supposed to (Remington had a massive recall and replacement on all 700 series rifles).The only thing not original on it is the rear sight assembly. The sight was broken off of the dovetail mount when I bought it and since I always had a scope mounted on it, it didn't bother me. I installed a basic, aftermarket rear sight assembly in order for the new owner to have the option to use the iron sights. Factory original rear sight assemblies are available for about $40.  It has Weaver Maxima two-piece scope bases with an older Norinco fixed 3 power scope that's actually fairly clear. There's no rust anywhere to be found and the bore is nice with strong rifling. On the rear left of the receiver are two screws for mounting a peep sight and the stock has a factory inlet to allow the peep sight to fit.This would make a good hunting rifle, as it's light weight, or just a good piece to add to your collection as it will maintain its value. The manufacturing dates stamped on the barrel indicate it was produced in July of 1953. Tried to get a good picture of the date stamps but it turned out a little blurry. A nice website to refer to for the various barrel stampings is 'Leeroysramblings' when you search 'Remington manufacture dates'.It is stamped '0ZZ' on the left side of the barrel and has no other stampings that indicate it's been repaired by Remington (refer to website). On the right side of the barrel, it has the standard 'REP' proof mark and other stampings from the factory.The rifle holds nice, tight shot groups and the action works very smoothly.Feel free to ask any questions or request additional pictures. Thank you!I don't mind shipping this rifle to your FFL if you're not local. Shipping and insurance usually runs around $30."

Imported from Russia with the Molot factory markings, the VEPR 12 was made after the Saiga was brutalized by import regulations and made to resemble more of what they wanted the American import saiga to be. I have only shot about 50 rounds through it at the range. There are modifications on it, a Chaos Rail system with a vertical grip attatched, a Shark Break and the folding stock is operational. It comes with 4 of the standard 5 round magazines and one 10 round magazine. Importation of the shotgun has slowed, and the folding stock variant is getting harder to find which has been driving the price up, and I would venture to say it will continue to rise and prove to be a good investment.

It was old when I bought it. It was a souvenier that I kept on a book shelf as a conversation piece. I never attempted to load it. Experts have told me that it's a kit gun. The maker is unknown. It is a cap lock pistol with no serial number, an ATF Classified Antique.  Single shot, muzzle loading percussion, blue 6"" (bluing faded). There is mild rust and a slight wood split on the stock. The stock has a curved grip as is typical in flintlock pistols. I was told years ago not to mess with antiques, so I haven't cleaned up the engraving, which is nice. This handgun is attractive."

Hahaha! $0.62/per round with stripper clips!These are the ""scary"" light armor piercing rounds that sent the BATFE in a tizzy last year and Americans writing their congressional leaders to pull their heads out of their butts on the issue. Of course, ammo went flying off the shelf and wasn't to be found last year. These are 62 grain steel ""penetrator"" rounds with the green tip. Ballistically, they fly almost identical to standard 55 grain 5.56mm ball rounds out to about 450 yards.  At around 500 yards, they drop about 1/8th of an inch more than the 55 grain plinking ammo from experience (although the online calculators show them identical). Keep in mind they are 5.56mm and NOT suitable to fire in .223 rifles (the excessive pressure may damage the rifle and/or injure the shooter). These are 2013 (pre-crazy) purchased and then placed on stripper clips and in magazines, then all of them put in a .50 cal ammo can with dessicant tins. I pulled 30 rounds out and fired them all without issue a few weeks ago. I have 260 rounds genuine USGI Lake City Brass ammo (military SS109/m855) and PMC brand 5.56 X-TAC ammo. We found the PMC to fly a little better at longer range than the LC stuff and the FPS was a bit more consistant. The average shooter won't notice a difference when shooting. These had a place in our defense plans until a heavier caliber pea shooter came on line, so we don't have a need for the rest of these anymore. This is not low quality junk ammo found on other listings. 
Buying the green tip 62 grain rounds online, in bulk, runs between 58 and 66 cents each, not including shipping and taxes (if they apply) or stripper clips. Taking the average cost of a little over 62 cents per round, I came up with $162 for the remaining 260 rounds I have left. All of those are mounted on stripper clips, so you just need the spoon to load 30 rounds into a mag in about 6 seconds. That’s less than the cost of 2:1 range ammo I was looking to trade for (best price we found over the last year was $6.99/box of 20 making them .35 each). At 2:1 for the sale price, they would run $185 for the green tips in trade. So, I’d be willing to let them go for $162 since they’re just taking up space.
TRADES:I am looking to trade 1:1 for factory soft point 55 grain ammo in either 5.56 or .223 (all ammo will be on stripper clips if desired). NO RELOADS please. I'd also consider trading 2:1 for standard 55 grain plinking ammo (xm193, American Eagle, Remington, etc) in either 5.56 or .223. NO RELOADS please. IL residents MUST have a FOID card for trading. No card, no trade. The magazines in the picture are not included, but the stripper clips are."

The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use. The new WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for the woman that desires everything.
