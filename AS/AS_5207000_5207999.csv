Has fully adjustable sliding rear sights along with grooved and marked barrel for precision tuning shooting.Has the three position tang safety that works. Numbers on barrel, receiver and stock all match. Rear sight has three digit numbers on each part that are the same. Bore and rifling are beautiful. Trigger is as smooth as butter and breaks at 2lbs 12oz according to the digital scale. Was originally ordered with top of the line diopter sight and base. Previous owner had the stock refinished and it looks incredible. It was a light enough refinish that the original Mauser cartouche wasn't sanded off. I know this was stupid and the dumbass made a $3500 original rifle into a beautiful rifle worth alot less, but it is what it is. Blueing is original and in 95% easy. Pictures do not do it justice as it looks like a work of art close-up and shoots even better.Price lowered to $1300. Reasonable offer considered.

Kayak is in good shape aside from needing fresh paint and a good cleaning (it has been sitting up in my shed for the past two years) comes with original paddle. The only other thing is the drag handles are a little chewed up, but are easily replaced. This kayak sits up high in the water and glides very smoothly especially through shallow water, I used it to get to some pretty hard to reach spots when I was duck hunting. Other than the paint and drag handles there is nothing wrong with it,only reason for selling is I have recently bought a newer model for fishing/hunting asking $225 obo Only trade I would be interested in is a Ruger 10/22.  Thanks for looking."

Comes with box and everything as new. Disappears in a pocket holster, or any other carry method.  Very reliable and easy to shoot.  Perfect concealed carry pistol and a great sight for easy and rapid target aquisition.  I even used this at a 1 day training class at Front Sight in Nevada and it performed very well.  If interested, please contact Don at REDACTED. Please be 21 or older and we can meet at Warrior Arms in Valparasio to do the transfer (we can split cost).  Even w permit and bill of sale, transfer will take place there.  Thanks for looking and have a great day."

She complains also that the triggger is getting more difficult to pull. There's nothing wrong with the gun; it's her arthritis that's progressing. We wwant to sell the SCC 9mm to buy a Norinco 213 9mm. They have a slide so smooth it take two fiingers to draw it back and the trigger is very easy to sqweeze.

In very good condition with some minor scratches on side of case. Comes with an unused S&B black NATO strap, S&B TPU dive strap (attached), and waterproof Pelican-like case. Only a few months old so battery is good to go and sapphire crystal is in perfect condition. MSRP: $395ASKING: Make Offer, will ship for $10. Info below from the Smith & Bradley website:The Sans-13 tactical stainless steel watch has a matte stainless steel finish. Using proprietary Lume Tube technology, the Sans-13 tactical watch embodies the credo, ""Only you should see your watch.""  We designed the Sans-13 after conducting hundreds of field interviews with members of law enforcement and the armed forces.  The overwhelming critique of existing tactical watches on the market was the fact many lume on the hands and dial of the watch, often tritium, was simply too bright and could compromise a position.  In response Smith & Bradley developed the Lume Tube technology to provide better lume than simple super lume paint without the overbearing brightness of tritium. 
Under the hood, the Sans-13 is a tactical workhorse that powered by a Swiss Quartz movement by Swiss maker Ronda. This is a top-shelf, full-size movement. The Sans-13 was designed and specifically sourced strictly for tactical military and law enforcement purposes.  We drilled down on every detail of field work and came up with a truly functional design. A crown that does not protrude past the crown guard so that it will not become detached. A larger case and bezel with ratchet that can be operated with or without gloves. A proprietary rubber band that blends rugged toughness and flexibility to prevent breakage. Actual screws rather than spring bars to attach the band to the lugs. Proprietary Lume Tube Technology. Each Sans-13 Stainless comes with a choice of Black, Tan, or Green NATO strap. Size: 43 mm, Movement:  Ronda 6003.D, 4 Jewel (Swiss Quartz), Functions：Date window, Water Resistant 200 meters, Case: Solid 316L Stainless Steel, Black Dial with super lume vial markers and hands, Crystal: Anti Reflective Sapphire Crystal, Bezel: One-Directional rotating, 90 clicks.http://www.smithbradleyltd.com/collections/all/products/the-sans-13-stainless-watch"
