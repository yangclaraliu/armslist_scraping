Manufactured by Destructive Devices Industries. It is a stamped AK and is built using a DDI stamped receiver with a Green Mountain 4140 barrel and a TAPCO trigger assembly. This DDI Stamped Ak47 has a KG Gun Coat finish, Fenocited Green Mountain barrel. Fenocite provides superior corrosion resistance, increased accuracy, and reduced wear, barrels can last a third longer than conventional barrels. Hogue grip/handguards, and a Phoenix Technology stock. Two 30 round Magpul AK Pmag, rail sections and hardware for the Hogue hand guard, additional railed upper hand guard. I have (4) different AK's and this got shot one time with a 30 round full mag. Ran 100% as expected. This is the most accurate and best made AK-47 for the money. I see people asking $750 - $850 for a sub par Romy AK or a Centry Arms mfg. All I need is a bill of sale to an AL. resident of legal age, that can purchase and own a firearm in the state of AL."

The scratches are so light, I could not get them in the pics. Functional condition is excellent. It is a well cared for and lightly used gun. It was my rarely carried CCW for a few years.

This is not your everyday AR-15, it's a custom built, Top of the line marksman’s rifle. Barrel is a Spinta Precision, 20 inch, polygonal rifling stainless steel, National match grade barrel. Took 10 weeks to get when I ordered this one. Bolt and carrier group were matched to the barrel At Spinta in California. Match chamber for Hornady 6.5 Grendel 123 grain A-MAX Shells. Anderson Upper and Lower, with Anderson LPK, and gold forward assist. We have seen muzzle velocities over 3k feet per second with these rounds. Velocity at 1000 yards is still supersonic. Hand loads will be even better. Hand guard is an Ares SCR, 15 inches, Key mod, with two 5 inch rails. Its light weight, but strong. Holds a 6-9 inch bipod very securely. Magpul MAG400 6 position stock on Mil-spec buffer tube assembly. I have a 3-9x50 NcStar scope on it just to see how it patterns. You may want to change it to something more substantial one you see how it shoots. It has been assembled, cleaned, tested, cleaned, and is ready for its owner to enjoy. I build custom rifles for Law enforcement and Military marksman, so ask any questions you have. If I don’t have the answer, someone I work with does. I originally built this rifle for me, but It has sit unused for too long. This would be a 1400 dollar or more rifle in any gun store. The Hornady ammo is now available at any gun store for about 19 dollars a box. Cheaper ammo is available for practice, but I don’t recommend it. I am willing to ship to an FFl in your area, or meet in this area."

I've listed some common errors, come on guys, learn to use it.1. The single most abused feature is the many listing categories, put your ad in the proper place to reap the highest success.2. In today's technology, posting a text/phone number will serve you best.3. You have options on your posting, sell or trade, just indicating sell, with a trade option buried in your ad, eliminates many searches, use the sell/trade option.4. It takes 4 days for the bump, I know that's a long time, I hate it as much as anyone, but constantly re-listing your item with word changes, just makes you look like your desperate or perhaps an idiot."

At 1.5” in diameter, 7.625” in length and weighing just 20 oz. these suppressors are smaller and lighter than our full-size Phantom M2 .30 Cal. suppressor while delivering similar performance on .308 Winchester. On .300 BLK, 7.62x39mm and 6.8mm these new designs are actually quieter than the full-size Phantom Suppressor. They are perfect for serving double duty on both a .308 Winchester host and a .22-250 caliber host as well as anything in between! These all-new suppressors feature CNC welds throughout and an updated tube design that incorporates a thicker blast area with a secure gripping surface that also adds a unique look to the suppressor. Both the LT and LTA suppressors utilize our improved Q.D. Mounting system that allows for faster, easier and more secure mounting and like always, the mount is included in the price of the suppressor. The suppressor is also backwards compatible with 5.56mm Q.D. Mounts. Both suppressors are full-auto rated on barrels as short as 10.5” and carry a lifetime warranty.

Not your average OTB shooter. Exceptional in every aspect of the build and no corners cut. Upper and lower fit so snug in fact it almost seems like one piece and with a magpul CTR stock only makes the feel that much more solid feel. Heavy duty vltor buffer ensures proper and accurate cycling. Bushnell red dot sight with aim point lock retention sights ensuring accuracy at 0' every time you look down them. Magpul ladders on the Yankee hill rifle length free float which is solid retains at 0' when getting down range. Noveske and vltor and magpul make up for the items I may forget to list. Once again boys no corners cut on this one. CMG drop in trigger prevents trig creep. Nice easy pull. Vltor upper,armalite lower mostly traded out for magpul and aftermarket parts making this build an absolute beast everything you see in the picture you get including a condor discreet black breakdown bag less than 26' in total length giving you a discreet carry to the range. Fiochi 300 blk 150 rounds in 5 total magpul mags. Another 150 rounds of premium Remington 300blk rounds hard to find and at the time $30 a box. With all his being said whoever capitalizes on this will be happy as a pig in s**t. Reluctant to part ways but moving to a state that doesn't allow these things unfortunately and I want someone who has a love like I do to get on it. Make an offer no trades unless it is cash and trade. Fee free to ask any questions so much stuff is included in this that you can get this and head straight to the range. Serious inquiry's only, obvious you must have FOID no funny s**t. Price is negotiable but no lowballing. Do not care that much for the cash more of the person who is going to take this bitch and appreciate her. Sure as hell didn't mention everything but there is spot more included try to refer to the pictures and contact if you have ANY questions. Oh did I mention it has only had a clip put down range??

If you've bought many new firearms you know it really is rare to receive a new one (that's not several thousand dollars and intended to be a show piece) that doesn't have flaws from the factory. It includes all of the papers, back straps, magazines and even the outer cardboard sleeve that goes over the blue plastic factory case. I I simply need to reduce my collection, and since I've never done anything other than clean and inspect this pistol, I clearly don't need it.

The CZ 75 BD is used by more Governments, Militaries, Police and Security agencies than any other pistol in the world.  The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.- All steel construction- High capacity double column magazines- Hammer forged barrels- Ergonomic grip and controls- Unparalleled accuracy- Slide-in-frame design for better recoil control- 3 dot sighting system- Smooth double action and crisp single action- Extended service life due to advanced design and use of superior materialsDesigned in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced.  An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design.  The CZ 75 design is perhaps the most copied handgun design in existance.  The use of all high quality steel assures the CZ 75 BD Police pistol will likely be around long after the origional purchaser.If you do any research on the CZ 75 pistol, you will not find a single credible source that has negative comments about the CZ 75 pistols.  I'm sure that is why it is a fact that this particular pistol listed in this ad is possibly the most issued sidearm for law enforcement, security and military use in the world.  This pistol clearly states on the frame that it is the heavy duty Police version.  Purchaser must have valid Indiana ID and preferably an IN carry permit.  With those items and $525 cash, you can own this great pistol today and have one of the best pistols made regardless of any price."
