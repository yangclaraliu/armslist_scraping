In addition, I have three holsters and accessories for concealed carry.  First is a like-new AlienGear CloakTuck 3.0 IWB (right-handed), including the spare parts kit.  Second is a custom kydex holster which may be used for AIWB or for pocket carry.  Third is a kydex trigger guard holster, aslo great for pocket or boot carry.  I also have a SnagMag pocket magazine holster and two kydex magazine holsters.  Of course, I will include the hard case and its contents as well.  Thus, you are getting about $200 of gear PLUS the firearm for only $500!  I am selling this as a package set only. Price is firm. Lawful Nebraska residents only.  Purchase permit/CCW and bill of sale required.  Thank you for looking!"

Therefore, I have decided to sell my beautiful Beretta Model 84BB in .380. It is the older model with the beautiful wood grips and the rounded trigger guard. Gorgeous. I bought the gun in 2000, shot it maybe 100 times and then put it away. Right now, it has not been fired in ten years but has been boken down, cleaned, and oiled every year. Great condition - minor bluding wear onthe edge of the slide but no wear marks at all on frame or grips. Right after I bought it, I carried it some, and it was easy to conceal and comfortable. Because I am selling the gun, I will also include in the price a very nice Kirkaptrick Leather open top belt holster in burgundy. (Go to their website and look at the TSS holster.) The holster looks like it just came out of the package, and that is pretty much the case. It also comes with two 13 round magazines and the owners manual. (Sorry, I do not have the original box.) I love this gun. It has a grip you can actually get a hold on, it's styling is superb, and it has 13 round capacity. Shoots great - at least it did ten years ago. Great .380 carry gun or just a great collector gun. I will ship to your FFL dealer. I can also provide more photos if you like. It willl be hard to find a nicer version of this particular gun."
