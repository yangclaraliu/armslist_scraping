If you have not yet received your tax stamp for your Scorpion, we strongly encourage you to NOT store this kit at the same physical residence where your pistol is located. Please read the following:
NOTICE REGARDING EVO 922R KITS The EVO 922R PARTS AND FOLDING STOCK KIT (“EVO 922R KIT”) is intended to be used in conjunction with a CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol. Under federal law, attaching a stock to a firearm with a barrel less than 16” amounts to making a short barreled rifle (SBR). Prior to making an SBR, the owner of the firearm must first register the firearm with ATF and pay the appropriate tax. Additionally, federal law (the “922(r) statute”) prevents a person from making a rifle using more than 10 of the parts listed in 27 CFR 478.39 if the resulting rifle would be “non-sporting” under federal law. A Scorpion SBR would be “non-sporting” under federal law, hence the EVO 922R KIT. ATF has taken the position that an SBR is made when unassembled parts are placed in close proximity in such a way that they “serve no useful purpose other than to make a rifle having a barrel less than 16 inches in length… or convert a complete weapon into such an NFA firearm…” See ATF Ruling 2011-4. CZ-USA takes no position on exactly what “close proximity” means in the context of dealers and distributors of firearms. Purchasers of the EVO 922R KIT, including dealers and distributors, are solely responsible for ensuring they are in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations pertaining to the assembly, manufacture, and possession of SBRs and SBR components, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C. § 922(r) and 27 CFR 478.39 and related regulations and rulings, and encourages you to consult with your attorney or to contact ATF should you have questions are your particular circumstance."

This is a Hi-Standard Supermatic Citation. Introduced as part of the 102 Series pistols, the Citation was a high grade target pistol destined to become one of the most important pistols in the Hi-Standard line. The rakish lines of the 102 Series guns along with some of the very unusual barrel profiles were unconventional in their day and remain so today. This pistol is particularly interesting because it comes with the very scarce 10-inch ""Space Gun"" barrel. This unusual, odd-looking barrel features a tapered round/thin profile with a large diameter muzzle atop which sat the front sight. This fat muzzle section acted as a vibration damper and also had slots which served as anchor points for a detachable muzzle brake. The length of the barrel was also grooved for the attachment of barrel weights, both of which are included. The rear sight was mounted on the rear of the barrel, above the chamber. Pistols shipped with the standard shorter barrels had the rear sight mounted in a dovetail on the slide......NO TRADESI CAN BE REACHED   @     REDACTED"

Because this weapon does not technically have a stock and is well over 26"" in fixed overall length it is classified as simply a ""firearm"" under the ATF. Heres the link to the letter from the chief of the firearms technology branch of the ATF confirming the legality of the firearm.  http://www.franklinarmory.com/XO-26_Letter__c_.pdfSelling my 11.5inch barrel AR with shockwave brace, shockwave adjustable length of pull pistol buffer tube, and thordsen custom cheek rest w/battery tubes. Though it closely resembles a stock it is %100 legal because the pistol brace and cheek rest have been approved for ""pistols"". Also AR pistols cannot have a vertical foregrip on them unless it is over 26"" in overall length which re-classifies it as only a ""firearm"". This firearm is 27.5"" so it is well within the legal boundaries. This allows you to attach any accessory you want and have the functionality of a short barreled rifle without the extra money on a tax stamp, legal paperwork, and many months worth of waiting. And of course since its a ""firearm"" it can be taken across state lines.  The AR was assembled completely by a gunsmith and has had only 50 or 60 rounds out of it, and is completely free of scratches and marks.Comes with one Pmag with magpul floor plate, magpul back up flip up sights, magpul vertical forgrip, M-lok handguard, and one M-lok rail section, and BAD Lever. $1100  (may drop the price if you can meet at an FFL near me and can meet on my strict schedule)Will include Eotech512 Holographic for $400 more.Questions are welcome and i will answer them ASAP."

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

I am simply looking for something smaller to carry. Must be 9mm!
If you have a Glock 43 you win.
Would also consider a Shield w/some extras...mags, holster, something like that.
I'm pretty open, but the largest size I'm looking for is around the size of a Glock 19...which I would consider that if it's a Gen 4 or a Gen 3 in FDE.
 
THE ONLY LARGE HANDGUN I would trade for would be a Glock 34, CZ75, or Beretta M9.

HE contacted ME about a gun I had on here for trade, wanting to trade. We text back and fourth a bit and agreed to meet at my office after he got off work. When it came time for him to show, he stopped responding to text or calls and never showed up. That was especially nice since I stayed two hours late to wait on him. It turns out, he's done this to me before. I still had the text on my phone from our last interaction. He bought lawnmower from me (for next to nothing and he low balled me at the last second) about eight months ago. We were talking and he offered me a good deal on an ar15. I told him I'd let him know. I decided a little later that I wanted to buy it and text him, he responded and we set a time and place. Then he never showed and wouldn't respond then either. I text him the next day and told him I had a spare parts mower very similar to the one I sold him that I'd let him have for $20. Shocker!: he responded instantly. Saying he didn't have the Ar with him, but he'd be happy to meet and get the mower. I told him I couldn't do it till we could do both at once and never heard from him again. Normally, I wouldn't do something like this. But people like him really piss me off. They make sites like this difficult to use. So I wanted to post this to try and prevent someone else from wasting their time with him. I mean how hard is it to text and say""I can't make it"" or ""I know I told you I'd meet, but I changed my mind"" . Lol. I kind of doubt anyone will have this problem with him on here because he's asking $550 for a M&P 9c that you can buy brand new at academy sports for $489"
