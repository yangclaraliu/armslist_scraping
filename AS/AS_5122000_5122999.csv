This pistol was so accurate, that it pushed my legendary SIG 210 9mm to the selling block several years ago. I don't shoot that much any more, so I just decided to see if some other gun enthusiast might be interested? I don't need to sell any of my guns, so my asking price will be my selling price. This gun is still like new and comes with everything that it came with from the Custom Shop when I ordered it. $1750 CASH or multiple pistol trades with “boot” or AK-47 variants with “boot.” Please no junk or anything that you can't sell already on your own. This gun is for the person that wants only the “BEST” and can afford it. You won't find one of these in your local gun store.When ever I decide to sell one of my high end guns, I offer the following: Come take a look at my gun, and if you like it, I will give you up to 60 days to sell your gun/guns to come up with the remaining balance. I am a gun enthusiast and not a gun dealer or collector. I can make this statement, and that is, ""it will sell to the first person that comes and looks at it?"" The Pro-Tek I begins life as a CZ 75 Compact D PCR pistol. Once it is turned over to the custom shop in Mesa, Arizona the transformation begins! They completely de-horn the pistol. They replace the original rubber grips, and blend a set of textured aluminum grips into the frame, so that the fit of the grips is perfect. This lessens the width of the pistol from 1.34 inches in its original PCR configuration to 1.14 inches in the Pro-Tek I version. The slimmer grip frame seems to accentuate the curve of the back-strap as it melts into your hand.The slide is given an octagonal cut with a flat top, and this completely changes the lines of the pistol giving it a streamlined appearance. This pistol also has excellent three-dot night sights. The rear sight is a low profile wedge type, that is adjustable for elevation.The de-cocker has been cut back to make it less obtrusive without sacrificing its function or ease of manipulation by the shooter. CZ’s competition hammer is also installed on the Pro-Tek I model. The slide is given an anodized Bronze/Gold finish, and the aluminum frame is manufactured with a glossy polycoat finishAll of the controls (de-cocker, slide stop lever and magazine release) on the pistol are in easy reach of your right thumb. The magazine release button is slightly extended but smooth and de-burred; when it is activated the magazines fall free. The magazine well has been beveled to augment the process of recharging the pistol with a fresh magazine. All in all, there is very little they didn’t think of to attain their goal of making the Pro-Tek I the ultimate CCW pistol. This gun has the smoothest DA trigger pull that you will ever experience on any gun, and the SA trigger pull when cocked, breaks like my Custom Les Baer 1911.As wonderful as this pistol is to hold and look at, the best experience comes once you hit the shooting range. Whether you are shooting standard or +P loads the Pro-Tek I handles recoil beautifully. The grip frame spreads the recoil evenly across the web of your hand and between the textured grip panels and the beavertail the pistol stays centered in your grasp. Between the recoil handling aspects of the pistol and the short reset trigger, it sure makes for easier and accurate follow-up shots.As far as accuracy goes, if you like all of your rounds to produce one gapping hole in the target then you will like firing the Pro-Tek I.Take a look at the factory supplied test target.Will trade for:"

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

The higher the cost the more the cost or the more the tickets. I don't believe that there is one raffle with over 100 tickets. That means that your worst odds of winning is about 1/100. Some of the raffles cost $10 and you receive a nice knife whether you win or lose.      There is a military raffle just for showing up, all millitary member, active, inactive retired it doesn't matter. there is a silent auction, there is a live auction and lots of games.

GREAT CARRY SEMIAUTO. ONE 12 RD MAGAZINE. The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery, providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you'll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness. Whether you're a competitive shooter, firearms enthusiast, or armed professional, the Witness product line can fill all your needs. Quality, value, comfort, accuracy and dependability. EAA Witness...No Limit ! European American Armory is proud to be the exclusive importer of Tanfoglio products in the USA. One 12 Rd. Magazine, Gun Lock, Hard Case"

I love this gun but an opportunity has come up to purchase one of my dream guns so sacrifices must be made. I will take 1200 and I will include 400-500 rounds of 45 acp ammo.

But I would expect the total value to be near 1400 if we go that route. The gun will come with two magazines. No factory box or paperwork. The chrome finish shows some light usage marks but nothing that won't polish out. There is one idiot scratch on the barrel bushing where it looks like someone used a metal tool to try to remove it.

No open sights. Weaver type scope bases mounted.  I have shot multiple 1/4 inch , 50 yard groups, with  sand bags off the bench,  with this rifle using RWS 50 or Eley match black box target ammo.  It likes CCI standard velocity for practice ammo.The stock is rough by any definition. This was apparently a Junior ROTC weapon and it shows it on the stock.  The receiver has a barley visible  hand scribed ""US"" on the left side.  If you are looking for a pristine collectible 52 this is not for you.  If you want a superb shooter that you can restock or refinish this stock this is for you.  I had planned to put a Richards laminated stock on it as I did with a Remington 40X but just never got around to it.  Or you can just shoot it as is like I have been doing.  You will not be disappointed with the accuracy of this rifle.Text me at  615 477 789 two and I can send pictures and answer any questions.Cash.  Sale only, no trades,  face to face in the Nashville metro area or in the McMinville, Cookville, Smithville area"

It is in like new shape as it was sold in 1978 and these nickel Diamondbacks are getting more and more desirable and expensive daily. Serial number R25032 makes this gun 38 years old and it is as if you walked back in time and bought it new at a store. If you have been looking at a nickel Colt Diamondback, this is your gun because, it is that nice. Shipping is $25 to your FFL and free to all active military, veterans or law enforcement.
