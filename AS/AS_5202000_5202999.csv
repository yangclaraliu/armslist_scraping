$1,300 in cash or better in trade.  
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal. 
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.
Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  Any all ammo deal would need to be a really good one as I have PLENTY of everthing.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area or I can ship for $30 more.  Thanks for looking!"

$1,980 firm for everything or $1,880 without the MI flip sights or higher in trade value.  I can also take some more off if you don't want all the mags, just let me know.I might consider trades, but only if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If it's not a good deal as far as the value goes, then there is no reason to offer it, sorry, just trying to save everyone some time.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal.  Are you wanting the rifle, all the mags and the sights or?? and are you wanting a straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns and bolt-guns.
Ammo in common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have PLENTY of ammo.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics to help, but I have nice scopes, Aimpoints and Eotechs just sitting right now for future projects.Ftf in the Dallas area or will ship insured for $40 more.Thanks for looking!"

231,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5202231,For Sale:  Quality .270 Ammo Federal Remington 270,"Dallas, Dallas, Texas",$ 580,"Listed On: Monday, February 29, 2016",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 20 boxes of quality ammo, 6 boxes(110rds. to be exact) of Remington 140gr. Premier Core-Lokt Ultra Bonded PSP and 14 boxes(270rds. to be exact) of Federal 140gr. Vital Shock Nosler Accubond.  Can't find either of this 140gr. ammo in stock anywhere right now, so this may be it??, but when it was available the Remington sold for around $30ea. and the Federal was $35+ea.   
$580 FIRM for all the ammo, please do not offer less, you will not get a response, I don't need to sell it and I'm sure I'll get another .270 rifle in the future.  This ammo sold new for $680+ before any tax and/or shipping online, so at $580 it saves you at least $120.  Or I will split it up, $150 for the 110rds. of Remington and $450 for the 270rds. of Federal or may do $150 for 90rds. of the Federal.  Also, I've had several trade offers for USED firearms that sell new for around $500-$550.  Just because it is ammo and not a firearm, I am not going to straight trade $700 worth of new factory ammo for something that sells used for $450-$500, maybe, I am going to need a little cash on top. 
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now, pretty simple.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  We can do current price to current price on ammo.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland area or will ship via UPS for $25 more.  Thanks for looking!"

As you can see in the pics, I have had quarter sized cutouts to both side of the frame to aid in magazine extraction in case of a malfunction and have had the trigger guard undercut to attain a higher grip to lower the bore axis/ reduce muzzle flip. It feels fantastic but does not look like it came from the factory that way. It does not look terrible by any means and if you view your sidearm as a tool it shouldn't offend you in the slightest but if it does, you can still get the benefit and hide it with a set of Talon grips if that is your thing.

Fits real nice in the hand (i got medium sized hands with lanky fingers and find it still quite comfy to hold and shoot) Recoil is minimal thanks to the steel frame and is pretty damn accurate thanks to the fixed barrel.

Very, very smooth action and have had no issues with it whatsoever. This was the precursor to the 1911 and John Moses Browning's first commercially successful gun. It was way ahead of it's time for what it is. Price isn't firm, depending on whether you come to meet me or how far I have to travel.As far as trades, I'm open to anything except for .22.
