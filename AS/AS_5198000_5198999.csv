It's big, a little heavier than I like and loud as hell, this makes me not want to play with it therefore it's up for grabs. Make no mistake though it's a great rifle and functions flawlessly. The rifle itself is a PSA PA10 18"" SSK15 upper with a Midwest Industries 308 SSK series 15"" Rail, Titanium SuperComp XL .308 Muzzle Brake and PSA BCG and charging handle. The lower consists of all PSA parts with a Magpul grip and Magpul STR stock. I had a Timney trigger in this rifle but pulled it and put a mil spec trigger in it for this sale. The optics are a Burris AR536 Prism Scope with a Fastfire III red dot sitting on top, probably not as powerful as some would like but I was going to be using the rifle inside of 300 yards and this is more than sufficient for this range. The ammo consists of 1170 rounds of Surplus M80, 60 rounds of perfecta and over 120 rounds of Hornady A-Max. It also comes with 9 magazines all of them Magpul, 4 25 rd, 3 20 rd and 2 10 round and I have only opened 2 of them the rest are new in the bag. All Total I have over $2600 into everything and to be honest I'm in no hurry to get rid of it so consider this when making offers. I am interested in a enclosed trailer,nice little vehicle that gets decent mileage or a smaller fishing boat, I have more guns that I would trade and also cash I can throw in."

Serious offers will be considered.  Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW rifles are available in 16” and 12.5” barrels chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. (*All NFA rules apply)A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included.The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

The GSG-AK47 is a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, and the look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection.Features:Caliber: 22Stock: Wood stockMagazines: 2 magsAction: Semi-AutomaticCaliber: 22 Long RifleBarrel Length: 16.5""33.5"" overall barrel length Capacity: 24+1Trigger: StandardSafety: LeverStock Style: WoodMetal Finish: MatteWooden furniture Hand weathered finishTape and bandana added Gun Weight: 6.75 lbs"

Great size for conceal carry, and 15+1 capacity is perfect for personal protection. The gun is too nice for for me; I'm looking to downgrade to a compact pistol, particularly one chambered in 9x18 Makarov with cash on your end. That being said, I'm more than willing to listen to other reasonable trades, including rifles, as long as I can get a good bit of cash with it. Description copied from Sig website: PISTOL, COMPACT, 9MM, M11 Issued to US Naval Aviation and key units in every branch of the Armed Services, the M11 is proud to serve. Upgraded with a stainless steel slide, a Short Reset Trigger and three 15 round flush fit magazines, the M11-A1 variant features the same phosphate coated internals, SIGLITE® night sights and MIL-STD UID label of the standard-issue M11."
