This started out with a 74u LLC. receiver that I got from a guy that messed up drilling the center scope rail hole and general rough handling. The messed up hole doesn't effect anything and you can't see it unless you look inside right at the rivet. I then used a bunch of spare parts to finish it off. The barrel was shortened and then the Damage Ind. flash hider was permanently attached via blind pin and weld. You can see the weld spot. Now for the bad. Normally, I do all of my own parkerizing, but this time I was leaving for vacation and wanted to have it done by the time I got back. So I dropped it off at a local ""smith"" to blast and park. Well, he did a shit job and it doesn't look good in my opinion. Now, some of my friends said it's not that bad, but to me it's unacceptable. I ended up not having to pay for the work and therefore will not add the cost of reginishing into the sale price. The park will do what it was intended, just not look good while doing it. Looking to get $1,200 shipped for the rifle. No magazines are included. This price is purely what's in it parts wise, maybe less, in fact, and does not include my time and materials in building it. I'll get better pics when I actually have some good light out. So for now you'll have to deal with these crap pics of the rifle on my kitchen floor."

The stock was sanded, brazed with a torch and stained a beautiful dark pecan color and sprayed with professional grade automatic clear coat. While the stock was off I made a few adjustments to it, as the action and barrel were tight to the stock, I free floated the whole length of the stock to the action, this is a 95% free floated barrel, as it has a recoil band which I put a washer under to lift the front of the barrel up off the front of the stock. Gun went from shooting 3inch groups at 50yds to now shooting 1inch groups at 50yds.These can have scope mounts drilled and tapped to the side by a gunsmith as well! $40 for a scope mount online I planned on doing this and using it for hog hunting and brush hunting but decided to buy a much more versatile rifle instead!

This barrel like new and has only 50 rounds through it and was bought for a G35 that has since been traded. With this 3-piece combination the shot groupings are incredibly tight and the recoil is definitely reduced. This barrel is also compatible with the Glock 22 and Glock 31. The barrel extends out approximately 1¾” in the G22 and G31.  Total original cost for these items was over 365 dollars.  Trade offers will be considered as long as we can meet in or around the Phoenix area.  Trade interest include Tactical Optics, Weapon Lights, AR15 parts and accessories, factory ammo possibly other items too.  Contact me if interested."

Here is a 109201 variant of the M&P 9. It was California Compliant until August of 2014, and shipped that year with two 10 round magazines. We bought it and its mates on a distributor liquidation, and subbed new Italian blue steel Act-Mag Magazines for the factory 10s, which we have a market for anyway. Manufacturer is Smith & Wesson of Springfield, MA. Type is striker fired locked breech semi-automatic pistol. Construction is stainless steel slide, barrel, and full length guide rod with steel internal parts housed in a Zytel Polymer grip frame. Barrel is 4 1/4 inch, five groove ECM 1:9 rifled bore, good to go on well made lead bullets where German and Austrian pistols are not. Sight radius is 6.4 inches. Barrel and slide are Melonite finish black stainless. Sight system is Novak Combat 3 dot, dovetailed into the slide. Frame has an integral 3 slot picatinny rail for light or laser. The M&P 9 is full time double action with a very consistent 8 pound pull .300 two piece trigger, that only travels .300 inches from rest to fire and resets in only .14 inches. Safety system includes a firing pin safety, trigger safety, and a magazine safety. This pistol, then, will NOT fire single shot with the magazine removed. Weight empty, no magazine, is 24 oz; weight fully loaded will be a bit over 35 ounces. Overall length is 7 1/2 inches; 5 1/2 inch height; and very nice thin 1.2 inch width. Each M&P 9 comes with a total of 3 interchangeably grip frame back strap pieces that vary the grip frame circumference. Both magazines are new Act-Mag Italian blue steel 17 shot, so 17+1 rounds total loaded capacity. The M&P series takes all comers for ease of handling, positive feel, and reliability and consistency under the most adverse field and combat situations. Each M&P 9 comes in its factory box with protective papers, Shot-lock® trigger lock, instruction manual, never executed factory registration card, grip pieces, chamber protector, and fired brass envelope with a 2014 date. Replacement pricing on this pistol in our area is well above $600.00. We’re offering the M&P 9 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only $ 419.00. Add any number of new 17 shot ACT-Mag magazines only $23 per. This M&P 9 variant is Not transferable to civilian residents of California or Massachusetts. Any ammunition or personnel showing in our photos are Not included. For civilian buyers in Aurora IL, Chicago / Cook County IL, Colorado, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction where 17 round magazines are restricted from civilian possession, we will sub one 10 rounder or $25 off and no magazines. Shipping.$15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation.
