 This is the deluxe higher value two tone version with the complete pistol pack kit that includes the full case, holster,  mag holder, extra backstraps and magazines.  I have also included extra magazines for a total of 4.  This is an outstanding compact 45 perfect for the ultimate stopping power carry pistol.  Fits beautifully in your hand with the slim design and single stack magazine.  Red fiber optic front site with white dot rear sight provides quick target acquisition.  I am the second owner.  The first owner fired 150 rounds and I have only fired 7 rounds myself.  Pistol is in perfect condition as shown in pictures.  Great pistol.  The only reason for selling is that I prefer my Kimber 1911 3"" 45.   Price is at $525 with no taxes or government paperwork or FFL Transfer fees.
 I do my research and price considerately.  Low ballers will be simply be ignored. If you are educated and familiar with this pistol, then you already know this is a great package deal.  I have had way to many tire kickers that want to negotiate then don't have the integrity to follow through.  If you are going to inquire then do your research first.  Gaurantee you wont find another like this pistol in better condition unless you want to pay retail for a new one.

I do my research and price considerately.  Low ballers will be simply be ignored. If you are educated and familiar with this pistol, then you already know this is a great deal.

The Barrel is 1989. The bore is in really nice shape ( Very Bright ) I am not the origional owner but I do know who did the custombarrel job and they are VERY good and this example shows off their craftmans ship. All the metal just got refinished in KG Gun Kote 2400 series, satin black. The action is nice and tight and the head space is perfect. When I got it it was a sub MOA rifle but was not looking very goos since someone had put some kind of nasty rubber coating on the stock.The stock was stripped down and I found three holes on the foregrip portion from a sling mount and where someone had mounted a bi pod. I did an inlay with South American cherry I believe it was and also inlayed the rear of the stock where the other sling mount was. Then put on four coats of satin spar varnish.I then hand fitted the stock to make it a full float and laid in new bedding. There are a couple of VERY small scratches on the barrel that I was unable to get out without spraying the gun kote to thick and making it prone to chipping. but all in all it turned out beautiful.The only reason I am selling this beauty is I just have to many rifle projects going on and my safes are full ( Bringing old rifles back to their glory is my hobby ) The Remington 788's in adverage to fair condition sell on gunbroker consistently for 400.00 and up without a SS Bull Barrel.At 475.00 ( FIRM ) you will not find another custom barreled and refinished Remington 788 which was known for their out of the box accuracy. All you will need is to add your scope mount and scope and start shooting.Last chance guys, in 5 more days it is going on gun broker, I lowered the price since I would much rather not have to ship it."

You can shoot 556 NATO or .223 out of this rifle. I use 556 and only shoot good quality brass. I wouldn't recommend shooting steel ammo, but that is up to you ;)
The upper comes with a fantastic rail by Samson Mfg ($300). Ready for whatever optics you want.
I had this sighted in with a Red Dot and a 3x Magnifier and it shot like a laser beam. You throw a good hunting scope on here and you'll be amazed.
The AA Piston System is one of the best on the market. It's really insane. 
I have shot about 125 rounds through the rifle, never a misfire, never a jam. It as a kick ass rifle."

Great condition and super fun to shoot.  Cheap to shoot in 9mm for plinking but also makes for an excellant home defense weapon.  Minimal recoil and size makes it a good fit for all shooters.  Included is a red/green reflex sight and 5 Glock factory mags.  3 are 33 rounds and 2 are 17 rounds.  Nice quad rail and some parts interchange with ar-15. This can also be changed to other pistol calibers easily.  This is not a Bushmaster in 9.3x62.  The program did not have a selection for a Just Right Carbine in 9mm.  Not interested in trades right now and will not ship.

The TSW (Tactical Support Weapon) features a rail under the frame for light or laser sight attachment, thicker full length frame rails for enhanced accuracy, and delayed unlocking to reduce felt recoil. That and it's 37.6 oz. weight makes this a highly controllable soft shooter for accurate follow up shots and comfortable fun at the range. The action is called Traditional Double Action (TDA) which describes a longer 1st shot trigger pull which cocks the hammer, and single action short crisp trigger pull on subsequent shots. An ambidextrous safety / decocker is featured for convenience and ultimate safety. There is also a loaded chamber indicator.This later production pistol I have for sale was made 1/26/2005. The factory Novak Lo-Mount 3 dot sights and recoil spring are new.It took me 2 years to find this model in good shape since those who have them simply don't let them go.It's been well cared for as you can see. There is normal carry wear including faded surface laser etching but the finish is really nice with no noticeable scratches. The internals are excellent since you simply can't wear out a 3rd Gen Smith. Along with a 2nd factory magazine, an S&W case, a box of top rated Hornady Critical Defense FTX self defense ammo, and an owner's manual are included. No trades please. Email Bill for phone #."

It's very rare to find one of these in the box with 2 mags. The extended mag is particularly hard to find. This one also has the original paperwork. I'm the second owner, but bought it unfired from a Washington police department who bought a bunch of these back in the 90s as concealed weapons but never used them. When they cleared their armory, I was able to get one. The size is almost identical to the Kahr P9; as a matter of fact I use the same holsters for both.
