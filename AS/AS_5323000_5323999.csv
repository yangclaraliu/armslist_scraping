This is the first of a new line of Centerfire rifles for Rock Island Armory. It's intended for mid-range use with a mounted scope and is perfect for varmint hunting. We've created this beauty to be exclusively chambered in Armscor's signature caliber, .22TCM - which happens to scream at over 2,800 fps. The 5 round mag can be interchanged with the 17 round .22 TCM pistol mag, turning this into a high-capacity rifle.

258,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5323258,For Trade:  92 dodge dynasty FT AR,"Dayton\west carrollton, Dayton, Ohio",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, April 4, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"1992 Dodge Dynasty. The vehicle has a smooth running 3.0L V6 engine and automatic transmission. The transmission shifts fantastic and has no known issues.  link for pics http://dayton.craigslist.org/cto/REDACTED.html I drive it daily, Dayton to Miamisburg, roughly 15 highway miles each way - no problems!  The body is pretty clean with minimal rust. The tire treads are in good condition. The interior is just about perfect with the exception of the dash pad is slightly warped from the sun. I've recently replaced the headliner. Power locks and windows, all work great. Passenger front door opens only from inside (linkage?). The radio shows time but does nothing else. Also, the blower motor is inop. Have not diagnosed but may just be resistor or motor. Control unit appears to command actuators and modes as designed.   The odometer stopped working on the previous owner, however according to his title he had only put a few hundred miles on it before it broke and I've put maybe 200 miles on it since. The odometer currently around 120K miles. Also, at highway speeds there is a slight vibration/shimmy felt in the steering wheel, not sure if tires need balanced. Other than that, it's a dependable car and fires up and drives each morning  Mechanically, it is a rather sound car - after I bought it I replaced a brake line going to the driver's rear drum. The only engine faults I know of is the ECT (engine coolant temp) sensor is bad - the gauge on the dash is pegged to Cold and does not move - being a NTC type sensor, I assume the sensor is the culprit (excessive resistance in sensor).   The car has a new fuel pump and fuel tank installed by the previous owner.   I daily drive this vehicle while I work on my other cars - i just finished a major repair on my Jeep and it's now road worthy so i am looking to sell the Dynasty.   I put down everything I know that is possibly wrong with it, and will not hide any issues - I don't need to sell the car but a few of my project jeeps are done so it can go if need be - I've gone over the car pretty well as a former ASE certified flat rate tech with a local Jeep/Chrysler/Dodge dealership- and this car is in impressive condition! Please don't hesitate to ask questions or make an offer! As a good Christian man, I've disclosed everything I currently know about the car's condition!

This rifle is a bit of an oddball as it came from the importer without a bayonet but with a scope rail. It was imported by KSI out of Pomona CA. All bluing is 100% except from where somebody used a screwdriver on the takedown lever. The bore on this rifle is chrome lined and in pristine condition. All the metal is in excellent condition and the rifle comes seated in a Ramline composite sporting stock. It groups great at 50 and 100 and makes a great hunting rifle. I'm only selling because I want to get into an AR or another M39, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the gun, I just have an expensive habit of getting bored and wanting something new."

It consists of a drilled well, septic system, main house, with kitchen sink and bath/shower (must be hooked up) generator/maintenance shed, out house, guesthouse and Quonset shop. It is off the grid; however it still has both a landline telephone and cell service.The property is located off of the Parks Highway at mile 187.5, just south of the ""Igloo,"" Broad Pass and Cantwell, Alaska. It is at mile 224 on the Alaska Railroad, a whistle stop at Colorado Station siding. You have year round access via road, railroad, wheel and float plane with well, septic system, diesel generator. The main house is well built and insulated on a pile and cement foundation. It has a kitchen and gathering room, living room and two upstairs bedrooms. There is a separate sleeping cabin with a queen bed and Toyo stove for heat. Work has moved us away from our dreams and now it is time to sell. We are a reluctant, but motivated seller. We will sell the whole package or separate the guesthouse and Quonset shop and 2 acres to reduce the total cost. We have priced this to sell; if you are looking for the entire 12+ acre property all in we are asking $275,000.00. We would sell 10 acres, the house, gen shed/shop out buildings, well and septic system for $200,000.00, or the Quonset shop, guesthouse and 2 acres for $80,000.00. Call, text or email us.

Completely reliable never had a single malfunction, even after 500 came in the same day, the rifle dirty as heck kept chugging along (even with a broken gas ring). Great great rifle. It is a PSA Premium 16"" CMV carbine length upper, the barrel is chrome moly vanadium steel, chrome lined and made by FN. The bolt is full auto in profile, and is also well staked, shot peened carpenter steel and chrome lined. I replaced the gas rings as I had one fail, though the rifle never skipped a beat. The upper is topped with a magpul BUIS and a fixed front post which are dead on at 50m. The barrel is wrapped with a magpul MOE sl forend. The lower is PSA with a PSA stock and parts kit. The trigger spring is Wolff, and feels excellent. Only the trigger spring was replaced, not the hammer spring so no light strikes. GREAT trigger. It has the subdued rubber MOE grip and MOE trigger guard, as well as Anti walk pins. It is a solid build, and you will be hard pressed to find another as solid and reliable.

These guns are both in good shape with boxes and paperwork as well as other items included. Details on each are below. I am wanting to trade both of these pistols value of $1250. Specifically I am wanting an FN FiveseveN but I will also consider other semi auto handguns in that value range or of slightly lesser value with cash added. I'm not looking for an inflated AR15 or antique shotgun or anything other than a handgun. I have my CHL and want to trade both of these guns for something I can carry daily. I like both of these pistols and they work 100% but I am looking for something I LOVE. A nice 1911 or the FiveseveN would fit the bill for me.The HK USP-C is an awesome shooter. It runs flawlessly and I've never had a malfunction through the 150 rounds I've run through it. Ran a huge variety of ammo without a hiccup. It has a little holster wear on the slide but nothing major. Comes with Tru Dot night sights installed, a Fobus OWB kydex holster, 1 magazine, and the original box with all factory paperwork.The Sig Sauer P320 Compact is a brand new pistol. I've not put any rounds through it yet but that just means you're getting a brand new gun. These guns have a removable fire control group which allows the user to change the frame, caliber, whatever you want on the fly. Mine comes as a FDE slide with a medium sized FDE frame and a small sized black frame. It also has factory Sig Lite night sights, 2 magazines, and everything inside the box from the factory. Both of these guns are easily worth what I'm asking. I would like to find a preowned example of the FN FiveseveN but as I said before I will consider other handgun trades as well. If you have a rifle and pistol to trade, I also might consider that. However, I must be clear in stating that I will NOT do a deal without getting a handgun unless I receive enough cash to buy what I want from a shop. If you have any questions, just send me a message or TEXT ONLY to REDACTED. Please send pictures and details of any trade offer. Lowball offers will be ignored, please respect my terms of the trade deal. Thank you for looking."
