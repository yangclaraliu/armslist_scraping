I bought it new a little over a year ago and I've fired 480 rounds through the barrel. The barrel is the original Daniel Defense 16 inch 1/7 twist cold hammer forged chrome lined barrel. The rifle is kept extremely clean and well maintained in my climate controlled safe. If you're looking to purchase an AR15 Daniel Defense is top of the line! Daniel Defense quality exceeds that of Rock River, DPMS, Windham, Bushmaster and I'd even go as far as saying Colt. My Daniel Defense upper and lower receiver are matched to each other so there is no gap or wiggle between the upper and lower receiver. I paid $1,350 for my rifle new and with everything I have on it my rifle sits at about $3,140. Nothing that I put on my rifle is ""garbage"" equipment and here's what's on it:-Vortex Viper PST 2.5-10X32 FFP MRAD scope-Burris PEPR quick detach scope ring -Magpul mbus PRO flip up sights -Laserlyte K15 green laser with pressure switch -Surefire duel illumination flashlight with Daniel Defense drop ring -Vanguard equilizer 6-9 bipod (swivels, pivots and conforms)-B5 enhanced sopmod adjustable shoulder stock -Six 3 inch Daniel Defense picatinny rails Along with the rifle you will get the original Daniel Defense shoulder stock and hard case.  I will also include 7 30 round magpul PMAGS, some ammo and a UTG rifle drag bag to carry the rifle in. I also have some miscellaneous parts you can have if you want them.I'm looking to get $1,800 for everything and there isn't much wiggle room on that price. You're going to spend at least  $1,300 (minus tax) for a Daniel Defense AR15 brand new so if you're in the market for a SPR AR15 this Daniel Defense SPR is the AR15 for you.I have more pictures upon request. Feel free to contact me anytime day or night with questions and inquiries at REDACTED text message is preferred over calls. I will accept trades for the right firearm (s) listed below.Thanks for looking-Matt"

I am the original owner but CORE offers a lifetime no BS warranty which covers anything and everything no matter what happens, and no matter if the rifle changes hands 50 times. Arguably the best warranty in the industry! Founded and operated by veterans that know how to put out a quality rifle built to extremely high standards. The rifle is like new with only one range trip, totaling 90 rounds. Mid-length gas system on a Mil-Spec 1:7 twist rate CMROV 4150 black nitride barrel. It took roughly $3K to put this perfect racehorse together! I don't expect to get near what I've got in it. I will sell it as it sits for $1825 (well over a grand less than I have in it). I'm also open to trade + cash. Here is a rundown of the rifle and upgrades. More pictures and info available on request. Thanks for looking.

All matching serial numbers. Internals are super clean. Inside the barrel is basically perfect. Almost mirror like with strong rifling. Original two tone marked magazine in nearly perfect condition. MINT original walnut medalian grips. Right grip has two carved nicks (see explanation below)They just don't come up like this any more.Has slight wear on the slide and frame just from age, and probably from someone carrying it many years ago. The wear near the front of the barrel looks like very light corrosion but does not feel like it. I believe it is just holster wear. Please see photos in the link at the beginning of this description.Serial dates it to 1936. Pre WWII. The person I bought it from bought it directly from the original owner's family and claims that they were a prison guard in the 1920s and then active service in WWII. He claims the family said this gun saved the original owners life two times. There are two nicks hand carved into the right grip that supposedly represent this.Comes with all original springs, as well as new Wolf springs (currently has the wolf recoil spring installed just to keep pressure off the original).I fired this gun once at the range. Everything works flawlessly, and it's the most accurate Colt hammerless I have ever shot.Comes with a custom IWB leather holster.Some also call this the M1903 but technically it is an M1908NO TRADEShttp://i.imgur.com/V5hgvOU.jpg"

Rugged reliability and accuracy combined with solid construction to make the M&P line stand out in a highly competitive field. Now Smith & Wesson offers the lightest, slimmest and most compact semiautomatic in the M&P family – the Shield. Less than 1"" thick, 6"" overall length and weighing just 19 oz., the Shield is perfect for concealed carry or a law-enforcement backup gun. Striker fired with a low bore axis and an 18° grip angle, the Shield delivers a natural sight picture and points instinctively. The consistent trigger pull and short trigger reset enhance accuracy and make for fast follow-up shots. Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W with a 3.1"" barrel, accuracy is outstanding for a compact semiautomatic. Maintenance is easy with the patented M&P No Tool Takedown System. Steel recoil-spring rod adds durability and the captured spring speeds the takedown and cleaning process. The Shield comes with two magazines, a six- or seven-round version that fits flush with the base of the grip and an seven- or eight-round version with an extended finger rest."

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding ""return-to-zero"" when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new Slim Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15"" rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with Daniel Defense's mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, 9 o'clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16"" Government profile barrel and the new designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip. This rifle is finished in Mil-Spec & Cerakote.Materials & Construction  Lower Receiver: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

They are referred to as ECR Instant-On holsters with automatic laser activation the moment you draw. No buttons, no squeezing, no doubt. When you draw, it's on. All items are new in box. I removed them to install them on my G42, but removed them because I'm looking at a Kimber Micro Carry instead of the Glock. You get two sets of batteries with the laser.
