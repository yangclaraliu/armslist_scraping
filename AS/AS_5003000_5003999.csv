I have a S&W Bodyguard for sale . It's brand new. Never shot or holstered or anything. I bought it online and found out from my local gun store that there's a duo tone option for the Bodyguard which I would prefer over the standard black (personal preference). So I'm selling this one so I can buy the duo tone version instead. I intentionally bought this without the laser. It is 100% stock and I have no ammo or holster or anything for it. It comes with a Lifetime Warranty from where I bought it, though I'm not sure if it's still valid with a different owner. Regardless you'll still have the 1 year manufacturer warranty should anything ever happen. 

Will consider offers, but I'd really like to get what I paid out of it (minus FFL fee which is about the same amount as sales tax if you bought in a store). Located in Bloomington on the West side. Cash only."

Product Description
With the addition of the Px4 Compact Beretta has completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range. 

The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package.The 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols.

This model also introduces an ambidextrous slide stop lever.

A high magazine capacity is maintained, with 15 rounds in 9mm and 12 rounds in .40 S&W. 

The Compact models accept the full size magazines as well, increasing capacity to 17 or 20 rounds in 9mm and 14 or 17 rounds in the .40."

At 5″ tall with a barrel length of just under 4″, the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4″ off the length and about 1/2″ off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

For sale or trade is a LNIB CZ 75 compact model chambered in 9mm ($514.00). This pistol has be shot a total of 38 times and is in perfect condition. It comes with everything as new from the factory plus 3 extra magazines ($99.00) that are unfired for a total of 5 and a Fobus paddle holster ($27.00). that’s a total value of $640.00.

Will sell for $600.00 or trade for something interesting. Some ideas would be a 1911 in .45APC, something Sig in 9mm or???"

Intended for use with a suppressor this one of a kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107. An all-new bolt carrier group design and a four-port muzzle brake engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor is key to making the rifle suppressor ready.

The Barrett M107’s lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The Barrett M107 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new recoil buffer system that is also optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference. Delivered with a Pelican case one 10-round magazine flip-up iron sights detachable adjustable lightweight bipod legs lightweight monopod sling attach points and owner’s manual."

719,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5003719,For Sale:  NEWer 1911 Andrews Leather custom holster for IWB w/ body shield,"Kent, Seattle, Washington",$ 50,"Listed On: Monday, February 22, 2016",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Good day, 

I am selling a custom made Andrews Leather (check out his website) Inside Waist Band (IWB) MacDaniel II leather holster with a body shield, torque plate, and internal steel hardtop, I just bought from Andrews Leather (lifetime quality holsters). I bought two different colors, but really only need one, so I am selling this one. This is an absolutely beautiful holster. I bought it for about $120, selling it for much less. It comes with two belt loop sizes. 

Description: 
-The slim profile allows all-day carry with comfort.
-Belt loops are mounted on a locking swivel for more carry options.
- Roughout design provides a firmer carry than a slippery smooth finish. The smooth side is turned inward for ease of draw and reduced wear.
- High relief hand molding gives perfect weapon fit. A high site track clears tall front sight blades.
- A spring steel reinforcement plate is contained within the rear flange. This prevents 'foldover' of the flange. More importantly, it creates a stiffened paddle over which the belt lays when the holster is worn. This pulls the butt of the weapon up firmly against the side. 
- A full band of steel prevents the collapse of the holster top when the weapon is withdrawn. This allows a one-handed return without having to look at, or wrestle with, the holster.
- The mounting screw must be loosened before changing the loop angle. There is a toothed washer between loop and holster to prevent 'spin'.
- Body Shield Option - leather shield stands between the side and the top of the slide, but leaves the grip area clear for a full hand grasp.

Blued finish and a 4 inch Barrel, no box or paperwork. The Colt snake series were hand crafted custom shop guns and are arguably the finest revolvers ever made. The fit, finish, buttery smooth trigger, and accuracy of these legendary revolvers is second to none. Colt has publically stated that they have no intention of ever reproducing the famous snake series because Colt no longer has the expertise and master pistolsmiths needed to make them.
     The Diamondback has a slighty smaller frame than the famous Python and is prized for having better ergonomics for shooters with smaller hands. Also ideal for women. I personally prefer these over the Python because I never saw much advantage in a .357 over a .38 unless you're using it for hunting. .357 typically means a larger bulky frame, more weight, issues with over penetration and a lot more recoil.

ATTENTION: For all you Colt collectors who like to bring a jeweler's loop to look at pistols. This revolver is a shooter, not a safe queen. If you're looking for an immaculate pristine unfired condition museum piece, this isn't the gun for you. That being said the firearm is in decent used condition, nice shiny good rifling in the barrel, not too much wear on the finish so it's still pretty, good lock up, and beautifully smooth trigger. The only flaws are the usual little nicks and blemishes you typically see when a pistol has been used and fired, nothing obvious. The biggest eyesore is a previous owner used a metallic silver paint to brighten up the front sight blade and they also put two little paint dots on the rear sight. This can probably be easily removed without damaging the original finish underneath, I just never bothered with it because the paint actually does a good job of making the sights more visible.

The price reflects the condition of the firearm and is quite reasonable compared to what they typically go for on auction sites or at gun shows. If it was brand new in the box, I'd be asking for a lot more, so don't waste my time with low ball offers. Not really interested in trades but if you have something rare and interesting you can always try your luck. (FYI a smith M&P or mass compliant ruger is neither rare nor interesting)"

These guns were not shot much except for annual qualification. They are very accurate and the action is typical S&W tight and smooth. This gun will make a nice addition to any S&W or LE collection or used as a concealed carry or house gun. Comes with compact Hogue Bantam grips with finger grooves and open back strap.
