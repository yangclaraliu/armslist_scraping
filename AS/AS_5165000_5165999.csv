The bore is bright and the rifling looks good. I inherited this from an elderly relative and I have never fired it.  I have no idea of how well it functions but it looks in good condition to me. This rifle was produced from 1934 to 1963 and this model did not come with a serial number according to the Blue Book of Gun Values."

The receiver and barrel have matching numbers but on the receiver the original number is XXXXed out and a new number stamped above it.  I am wondering if it is a Russian capture weapon that has had original markings removed and re-numbered.  It was inherited from an elderly relative and I have never cleaned or fired it. The rifling looks great. The bore is not shiny but neither is it corroded.  It just might need a good cleaning. I think I have an extra stock that appears to be a sporterized military piece.  The one with the action in it is a monte carlo style. I will give the extra stock to the purchaser.

Features a hammer forged LRB reciever, 22"" Criterion medium weight DMR contour chrome-lined barrel. The barreled action has undergone a cryogenic treatment by a company named 300 Below. The muzzle brake is a Smith Enterprise (SEI) Good Iron brake. NM front sight. Stock is a USGI fiberglass stock from Fred's, selector switch has been filled in and sanded smooth for a clean look. The gas piston and gas cylinder nut are both from Smith Enterprise. See their website for details on their products. Smith Enterprise scope mount with low steel rings(also SEI). Scope is a Shepherd Enterprises Model 310-P2 with 18"" stadia BDC rings in the reticle from 100-1000 yds. Scope acts as a range finding device, just match whatever ring fits your target (18"" is the average shoulder-shoulder width of a man) and fire. I've shot this rifle using this scope at 1000 yds using the bottom ring and can say it's dead on. The trigger was professionally tuned by Smith Enterprise for a 4.5 lb let off. The paint was done by myself using Krylon camo. Can be repainted to your liking if wanted. Comes with the Harris 6-9"" bipod and 10 CMI 20 round mags seen here. Sling will not be included. This rifle is extremely accurate 1-1.5 MOA using surplus NATO 147gr ammo. A very capable 1,000 yd rifle. Rifle has exactly 1,476 rounds put through it. With the cryogenic treatment, the barrel will last well above 10K rounds. The rest of the parts are standard USGI. Absolutely no issues with this rifle, just need the funds for another project. FTF in the Tulsa/BA area. Thanks for looking."

The AN/PAQ-4C is a .7mW IR laser, same power as the civilian designators out there. The item is in fair condition as it obviously saw wear during its issue, it was turned in at the end of its service life with no faults found (per the paperwork that will come with the item) and I've used it without issue as well. The serial number has been scratched off as is typical with these items but the serial number is written down in the paperwork should that be of interest to you. The laser will come with all mounts, switch, manual, soft case, hard case, paperwork and fresh batteries as pictured. I am asking $335 + $15 for shipping via USPS should you not be in the greater Pittsburgh area which can be paid for via cash, PayPal gift, PayPal + 2.9%, money order, or personal check."
