This scope is in excellent condition. The lens are clear, & scratch free. The ring marks are minimal. We can email close up photos, on request.Shipping to the lower 48 states, will be $15.00. Please call: REDACTED, for a quote to Alaska, or Hawaii. Although these Redfields were some of the best hunting scopes, ever built; at this point, they are almost 20 years old. We can not guarantee this scope is in perfect condition. Even if they look good, & there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them, you don't know for sure, until you mount the scope, & try it. However, we do guarantee, there is nothing obviously wrong with the scope, we don't tell you about. I have well over a dozen Illuminators, just like this one. All of them have been disassembled, & cleaned; & they work good. All of these original Redfields, should be disassembled, & cleaned, before mounting them on a rifle. This usually costs about $60.00. You should figure that in, when buying the scope. We have used several scope repair companies. The two we would absolutely NOT recommend, to anyone; are: Iron Sights, & ABO. We have sent a couple Redfields to Iron Sights, & it took a year to get them back, & they still had the same problems, they had, when we sent them in. ABO, is even worse. They either can't, or won't, fix anything properly, & they do not stand behind their work. They are very expensive; also. We would not recommend you send a toy scope, or a Tasco (same thing actually), to ABO; much less a prized Redfield, such as an Illuminator. That said; there are several other scope repair companies; which are reputable; who will disassemble, & clean a Redfield. We take all major credit cards, with a 3% surcharge. We will also take a check, but we will have to delay shipping for a couple days; on out-of-state checks. We are a retail store, so our items are subject to sale BEFORE they are reserved online. If you don’t see what you are looking for, please call us at REDACTED. We can sell most scopes at very reasonable prices. Thank you."

I have disassembled, cleaned and inspected every part on this gun and it's in great shape. As with any standard 1911 all parts are available if you want to upgrade or change parts. Along with being a beautiful gun it has a magwell installed and comes with one magazine. Here's one of the review excerpts: These innovative guns were very distinctive with a King’s-type beavertail grip safety, light-weight aluminum trigger, extended slide release and extended thumb safety, extended ejector, fluted ejection port and Commander-style jeweled hammer. They were comparable to Kimbers and high-end Springfields in quality, but OA had the benefit of their own in-house foundry, so they came correct with the steel metallurgy. They made their broach-cut National Match grade barrels from bar stock in-house, which few can say. This had put current collector prices on most post-2004 OA models at a starting point of $1K judging at recent online auction results. Should you be lucky enough to have one put it away as prices are going up. Alternatively, if you know someone selling at a good price then jump on it.Must be 21 and have a Texas DL - Text REDACTED"

The SPAS has always been highly collectible due to the limited numbers that were imported. The overall condition is nice, it does show where as you can see in the pics. These continue to appreciate in value as the rarity of available samples on the market continue to decline.

Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies. The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match.

The bullet included a Lubalox coating, a proprietary oxide process. Though widely misreported to be Teflon, molybdenum disulfide, or wax, the ammo has an unusual black appearance compared to other copper-jacketed or lead bullets. The black appearance was due to the oxidized copper jacket. This Lubalox coating was to protect the barrel rifling, and did not give the bullet armor-piercing capabilities. This coating is still widely used on many of Winchester's rifle bullets today...The bullet was designed in 1991 under the supervision of Alan Corzine, who at that time was VP of research and development for Winchester. The round quickly developed a reputation as a very effective expanding bullet. The alleged armor-piercing (AP) notion is urban legend, and was a result of media hyperbole (perhaps confusing ""Talon"" with the ""Teflon"" that coated KTW AP bullets)—rather than test or field data from actual shootings considering the short time it was on the market. Col Leonard J. Supenski of the Baltimore County police department said ""It has the stopping power that police officers need and it is less likely to ricochet or go through the bad guy,"" something that could be said of any reliably expanding hollow-point. Despite its unique design, the Black Talon was found to be comparable in performance to conventional hollow-points....The first shooting which brought critical media attention to Black Talon was by Gian Luigi Ferri, who used Black Talon and other ammunition to shoot 15 people at a San Francisco law office in 1993; nine of whom died"
