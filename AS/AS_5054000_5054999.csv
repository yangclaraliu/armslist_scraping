This Sig originally came new from their Newington N.H. factory as a ""dehorned"" or “Sig Anti Snag” (SAS) carry firearm. It has a stainless slide with beautiful “P226 SAS” engraved into the slide. It is a German metal frame. Since acquiring this P226, I have sent it to the Sig Pro Custom Shop and had the stainless slide “bead blasted” to a perfect and like new finish. I then had all internal springs inspected and replaced as necessary, then converted to a DA/SA action, added a De-cocker safety lever, upgraded the standard trigger to a SRT trigger function, put brand new OEM Sig Rosewood grips with stainless screws, Siglite night sights, and also equipped it with a brand new Lasermax Guide Rod Red laser kit, which is the only NATO approved guide rod laser out there. It has NOT been fired since it came back from the Sig factory, and prior to that, it still maintains a low round count. In my personal opinion, this Sig is just an awesome gun, not only with its high accuracy and smooth as silk shooting capabilities, but it is also a real gem to look at. It is my carry of choice.   I have over $1200.00 in this Sig. I am asking $1,000 or Best Reasonable Offer. Must present a current government issued ID such as a drivers license, or as preferred a  “Canceled/Carry Weapon Permit”. Looking specifically for a SIG EQUINOX P228, but would consider a P229 in 40S&W. Will also consider another P226, as long as it is an EQUINOX, chambered in 40 S&W or even maybe a 357.   I am not interested in any other brands or trade offers, if you cut me, I bleed purely Sig.     I am not hurting for money, nor do I desperately need to sell this classic. Just curious to see what other opportunities might be out there?   Please support our Military and Law Enforcement Personnel.   Thanks for Looking."

In 1999 Colt introduced their last double action revolver model. This was a version of the SF-VI/DS-II series revolvers built on the ""SF-VI"" frame. This was a stainless steel revolver using the same transfer bar safety-ignition system as all Colts made after 1969. The new model was chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge, the first small frame Colt ever to use the Magnum round. The frame was slightly thickened in the top strap area to increase strength and the gun was heat treated to a higher level. Barrels were 2 inches, and a few 3 inch models. Finish was satin stainless and possibly a few bright polish models. The grips were Hogue Mono-Grips made for Colt by Hogue. These have a pebble texture. PRICE: $1895REDACTEDElite Pawn and Gun7804 Garners Ferry RdColumbia, SC 29209"

742,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5054742,For Sale:  Here is what gun control advocates want.,"Gunbantown, North Carolina, United States",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 12, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The following is a response to a NY Times Editorial and is a gun control advocate being completely honest about the ""reasonable gun safety"" laws they want:""RogerPhoenix, AZ January 6, 2016 Ok, this is getting ridiculous. Even though President Obama has not managed to get any gun control measures passed in the seven years of his presidency, the sale of guns has increased dramatically on the basis of irrational fear and paranoia. Since the gun lobby refuses to compromise on any reasonable gun laws, it’s time to finally declare, “Yes, we are in fact coming for your guns.” First we’ll outlaw handguns, the main purpose of which is to shoot another human while being easily concealed. Then we will outlaw any type of assault weapon or rifle with a high-capacity magazine. Finally, we will limit and control the amount of ammunition any person can buy. You can still have a simple rifle or shotgun for hunting or protection as you see fit, but even those will have to be safely secured in your home when not in use. How will we accomplish this? With government storm troopers raiding your house? No, we will use the most powerful weapon a democracy has at its disposal, our vote.""579 up votesThis is what Obama wants too. This is why he is pushing for expanding the prohibited persons lists to include those on the no-fly list, a list put together with no due process of law at all.The next time somebody says they are not coming for your guns remember this and remember Diane Feinsteins words: ""If I could’ve gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them — Mr. and Mrs. America turn ’em all in — I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t here."" - Diane Feinstein 60 minutes 1995.So called Universal Background Checks, MIGHT be a good idea if they were not such an obvious stepping stone to ever more gun control. The strategy is:1. Force all sales through NICS.2. Change federal law to require firearm data to be sent in NICS transactions and allow a gun owner database to be built from NICS data. This only takes one gun control sympathetic session of congress and a president to sign it.3. Prohibit anyone and everyone possible by expanding the prohibited persons categories. The ""no-fly"" list is the first step, next comes the ""mentally ill"" which is every vet with a diagnosis of PTSD, every kid prescribed an ADHD drug and every person who has ever had an outpatient counseling session with a therapist. Next misdemeanors like 1st DUI offense and other traffic offenses. We actually already prohibit many misdemeanor offenders because many state misdemeanors carry a maximum sentence of more than two years which is the threshhold for a state misdemeanor being a prohibiting factor. Many of these misdemeanors are relatively minor charges where judges seldom give any jail time at all but what matters under federal law is the maximum time they could give. 4. Pass any and all possible gun restrictions whether constitutional or not and hope the courts take no action or at least drag it out as long as possible.5. Eliminate protection for firearms manufacturers from lawsuits over product misuse. This one doesn't really require the other stepping stones, but the more people who are ultimately prohibited the less people who will have a right they still deem worth protecting i.e. divide and conquer. For those who think the courts will intercede, consider this: Since the Heller and McDonald decisions, no lower court has overturned any really significant anti-gun legislation and the Supreme court just refused to hear an appeal where the Highland Park (a city near Chicago) Assault weapons ban was upheld, meaning despite clear language from the supreme court protecting firearms in common usage, the ban has been allowed to stand. It's highly doubtful that the courts will protect your rights to anywhere near the degree they are constitutionally required too. Supreme court rulings are of little practical use if even the Supreme court that issued the ruling will not strike down laws contrary to it."

The only problem it has is that while I was away in the service I allowed my bro to use it and the barrel got rusted but the rust was all on the outside and I sandblasted the barrel, wire wheeled it, sprayed rust reformer/inhibitor on it and finished it with an automotive matte black coating. I've used the gun for 2 years after doing that and it's working beautifully still and wouldn't be selling it if my wife didn't buy me an upgrade for xmas. Before putting it up for sale I gave the gun another wire wheel and re coated it again so whoever gets it has a nice looking gun. Just before listing it I cleaned, and oiled the gun and it's movement is nice and look good. I put a clip on fiber optic sight on the vent rib, and it'll also come with an extra full choke.  Please feel free to call, text, or email with any questions or concerns, my number is REDACTED and my name is Brian.  Thank you for your time"
