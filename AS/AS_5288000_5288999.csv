As for the PSA lower, it has a KAK pistol buffer tube with teflon coated spring and upgraded buffer (standard carbine weight). Rubber tube cover. Single point sling end plate. Also, lower has an upgraded nickel boron coated Mil-spec fire control group. This gun is basically new I have only fired 3- 30 round mags. I do not want to sell but I need to recoup some $$$ that I just spent on something else. The upper retail is $650 alone. PSA lower with all parts was $300. Iron sights $35. UTG circle dot $55. Lazer $55. Houge grip $22. Enhanced Billet trigger gaurd $20. Approx $1137 invested. Only asking $875. Just to note the iron sights can be used through the red dot.To purchase you Must be a NH resident with a concealed pistol license and matching NH drivers license or we go to an FFL. They are now preordering this exact upper for $800.  Go to american weaopns components dot com and look for ""the equalizer 10.5""."

Adjustable flip up sights with optic rail. Semi automatic AK platform fires 12 gauge round, awesome shotgun and the chrome lined barrel is threaded if you wanted to add muzzle brake or suppressor. I have fired it less than 100 rounds and wish I had more time to go out to the range. I didn't have any issues with high or low brass.

Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice. Keeping the varmint hunter in mind, the .308 Winchester upper receiver group can be easily swapped out for any Mil-Spec Colt upper receiver chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The fact that all operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release, bolt catch and safety selector, makes for versatility and ease of use. You can depend on the new Colt LE901-16S to take the shot of your lifetime! Special Features ?1-Piece Upper Receiver with Back Up Iron Sights (BUIS) ?Full Floated Barrel ?Bayonet Lug and Flash Hider ?Ambidextrous Controls ?Accepts Mil-Spec 5.56 Colt Uppers Ships with the magazine well adapter block needed to mount MilSpec 5.56 Colt upper receivers to the LE901-16S lower receiver."

This is a lightly used compact version of the SR9.
Comes with 2 – 10 round magazines and 1 – 17 round mag as well as a Kydex IWB holster for those who wish to concealed carry.
This pistol has been extremely reliable from day 1 and is also very accurate especially considering it’s 3.4 inch barrel.
I’ve owned many polymer 9mm pistols and I’d put this one up against any of them.
The only trade I’d consider would be for a full sized SR9.
You must be over 21 and a Missouri resident and have ID to prove it.
Feel free to reply with questions or to see more pictures of it."

993,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5288993,For Sale:  Diana RWS 460 Magnum .22 underlever pellet gun,"East of Huber Heights north of 70, Dayton, Ohio",$ 375,"Listed On: Monday, March 28, 2016",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Made in Germany with a lifetime warranty, the Diana RWS is simply an incredible .22 caliber pellet gun. It packs 1000FPS knockdown power and I've been extremely impressed by the quality and accuracy of this gun. I simply don't have the time or the land to properly use it for what it's meant for. I has less than 75 shots through it, and is in incredible condition. Brand new these are $550.00 at Pyramyd Air, the most reputable air gun merchant on the web. This rifle is spring powered and only requires one pump. The stock is real wood and features an 11mm dovetail scope mount. I don't know what else to say. Research it. People who can look past the silly complaint of a plastic front sight are ridiculous. The thing is BEEFY and as if they didn't already use enough metal and wood. This thing is bound to be a heirloom. I wanted to pass it down to my son, but I live in the city and it's not practical. It's killing me to sell it."

I bought this rifle 2 years ago and it's has been fired a couple of times about 7mags gone through it, but still looks mint including all manuals, test target, bolt, magazine, and warranty papers which you can fill out and register with CZ the coloring and finish on the nutmeg brown thumbhole stock is gorgeous. My photos don't do it justice. When I unboxed it at my FFL it drew a crowd and everyone raved about the coloring and the finish.It took me a long time to find the 16"" short bull/varmint barrel. CZ says on their web site that their shorter and heavier profile varmint/bull barrels are their most accurate, so this should be ideally set up for maximum accuracy, and with the threaded barrel you can also run a suppressor if you wish.The rifle will ship with the original box and packaging, the original manual and warranty papers, bolt, magazine, and test target Pls be aware with your local gun law before making inquiry."
