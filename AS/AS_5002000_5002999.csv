These are excellent rings in great condition.  I recently put a chassis system on my rifle, and these rings were too low for the scope I use.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the rings but I had to buy a set of the high NightForce rings to clear the handguard on the chassis. They were used for around 5 months if that makes any difference.  I paid a little over 160 for rings new, and these have been lightly used.

Each kit contains:

•	One (1) Front End Cap O-ring (McMaster-Carr® Part #9263K598),
http://www.mcmaster.com/#9263k598/=10ggvpr 
•	One (1) Piston Housing* O-ring (McMaster-Carr® Part #1201T27),
http://www.mcmaster.com/#1201t27/=10ggwql 

*This particular piston housing O-ring is not compatible with the M13.5 piston. It is compatible with the other pistons offered by AAC, including the popular 1/2""-28 TPI piston.

AAC sells their own 6-piece Ti-RANT 9mm O-ring Kit for $20 + shipping (http://www.advanced-armament.com/Pistol-Silencer-O-Ring-Kit_p_683.html), but it is often Out of Stock. However, AAC also reveals that the very same O-rings that they sell can be ordered directly from McMaster-Carr® (http://www.advanced-armament.com/assets/images/pdf/manuals/O-Ring_Guide.pdf). They are cheaper in terms of cost per O-ring, but the catch is that they come in bulk packs (10-packs for the End Cap O-rings, 50-packs for the Piston Housing O-rings). I ordered 1 pack of each O-ring, and I am now looking to sell the extras in a more practical quantity so that you can share in the cost savings that I enjoyed.

I have personally verified that these O-rings fit the AAC Ti-RANT 9mm suppressor perfectly and are identical to the original O-rings that come with the suppressor directly from the factory.

Payment is accepted via cash, PayPal, or USPS Money Order. I do not accept credit cards and I prefer you do not mail cash.

If you cannot pick up in person, I will ship this 2-piece O-ring kit in a small ziploc bag inside a standard letter envelope via USPS. Shipping is free.

I do not accept returns on this item. Be sure you know what you are ordering before placing your order.

If you like the 92 models, you will love this one, feels great in the hand and would be great for CCW or OCW in 2016.  I would like to keep this one, but I need some new tires in the coming month.

$580 firm in cash or a little higher in trade value. 

Might look at trades as long as it's a good deal on the value, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

As such, there are ZERO MIM parts on this pistol, it has a match barrel, novak style sights, ERGO extreme use grips, and the adjustable trigger. I have upgraded the springs to Wolff 16lb springs, and I added a low-profile magazine well to aid reloading. Even before the spring upgrade, this gun fires flawlessly. I have never had a failure to feed, or extract. Not a hiccup. It is a true tack driver, and has a low round count, to boot. So why am I selling? The Weight. the full size Revolution weighs just over 2.5lbs empty, and I am looking to get into a shorter, lighter, scandium framed 1911. The weight of this pistol actually really helps with the accuracy, but I'm looking for something lighter.

Read the information below to understand why this is such a Rare German Made Pistol. 

The Erma-Werke Luger Model KGP-69 is a Toggle Locked, Blowback Operated Pistol that is Chambered in .22 Cal.LR. It has a Steel Receiver, Toggle Train and Barrel (1/2"" shorter than the P08). The lower Frame seems to be a steel alloy. The Steel Receiver and Barrel Assembly is Blued; (Bluish-Black). Lower Frame has a black coating. The grip panels are molded synthetic in a Simulated Wood Design..
The Company started After the Soviets burned the Lugar factory, using some of the same Tooling Equipment and Manpower. Known as Erfurter Maschinen und Werkzeugfabrik, the facility moved to Munich-Dachau Germany and became known as Erma-Werke.
Prior to WWII Erma produced the .22cal Conversion kit for the 9mm P08 Luger Pistol and was so successful that Erma decided to manufacture its own small target pistol. From the first .22 made in 1936 known as the Old Model; to 1969 and the first KGP-69 it has incorporated the improvements of its Predecessors including its pure blowback design. Erma-Werke went out of business in 1997.

This is a Remington Model 700 SPS Tactical AAC-SD with Threaded Muzzle chambered in 308 Win and Tracking Point Optic. Comes with everything in the pic.  Will consider multiple firearms or other cool guy stuff.From the Manufacturer's Website: Created through a collaboration between Remington Arms Company, LLC (“Remington”) and TrackingPoint, an applied technology company in Austin, Texas, the Remington 2020 Digital Optic System revolutionizes long-range accuracy by combining hand-selected rifles, matched ammunition, digital optics and target-tracking technology into an integrated shooting system. “The Remington 2020 System is the next significant advancement in firearms technology,” said Scott Blackwell, president of Remington. “Remington has been a leading innovation provider to hunters and shooters since 1816. Through our partnership with TrackingPoint we are now leveraging a powerful R&D network and technology engine allowing Remington to continue to enhance our consumer’s experience. The end result; we have created the ultimate hunting and shooting confidence builder that allows the user to share their experience from start to finish.” The Digital Optic System: The digital optic system effectively bundles numerous devices and technologies together in a state-of-the-art package that brings confidence and improved accuracy to the shooter at distances of up to 500 yards. Integrated capabilities include: •3-21X Digital Scope•Laser Rangefinder (750 Yard Range) •The Most Advanced Ballistic Computer Available •Video /Audio Recorder •Still Camera (frame capture) •Wi-Fi Server Looking through the Remington 2020 Digital Optic System, the shooter is presented with a Heads-Up Display (HUD) that overlays the information about the ammunition, environment and shot orientation that effect accuracy to the field of view before them. Through a sequence referred to as Tag, Track and React (TTR™), the Remington 2020 Digital Optic System allows the shooter to designate the desired location of a shot (""Tag""). The advanced internal ballistic computer immediately generates a firing solution based on a far greater number of inputs and factors that affect the bullet's flight than other ballistic calculators or tables. The shooter then simply adjusts their point of aim to bring the ballistically corrected reticle on target (""Track"") and take the shot (""React""). Even on targets moving up to 10 mph. Recording and Streaming:The system can also broadcast a Wi-Fi signal allowing others to see a streaming live video feed from the HUD via a smartphone (Apple iOS or Andriod) app. For the first time, another person can share what the shooter is seeing and doing wirelessly for more effective coaching, mentoring or guiding. From the time a Tag is placed until a preset time after the shot is taken, this stream can also be recorded, with audio, to internal memory for later downloading and sharing."

I obviously couldn’t use all of these if I lived 1,000 years, so I am listing them on here for you all.  I have gone through these and tried to verify their contents as complete and accurate, but mistakes can happen. Please ask any questions or clarifications before setting up a time to meet to purchase. In addition, please bring the item that you are purchasing the holster for when purchasing to verify fitment as there are no returns or exchanges on these. Retail on these is substantially more than I am asking. I would also consider discounting if you bought larger quantities. Some of these may have been testers, returned, or simply opened. May or may not have original packaging. I would also consider trades for Cmr30/Pmr30 magazines/holsters/cases, linear compensators in 1/2x28, 7.62 HP ammo, 22 magnum ammunition, certain red dot optics, 458 Socom ammunition, firearms, etc. Honestly, just shoot me a text only at REDACTED and we can go from there. Please be patient with responses as this is a very large number of items to sort through. Thank you in advance. These are for pickup in Norman only.  Here is what I currently have on hand, I do not have others so please do not ask. Please refer to the list on if i have something only. Also, please do your research as to designs, types, and purposes of the holsters before inquiring. That way it can avoid wasting either of our times do to mix ups.

This is in excellent condition and I am not wanting to take less than $175 shipped for it. I just paid $190 shipped for the 12"" on eBay so I know they are still bringing that. And rather than come much off the price I'd rather keep it incase I decide to make another sbr/pistol upper. The rail is so light and feels great in the hand.

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. The P320 will be immediately available in 9mm, .40S&W and .357SIG, with .45ACP coming later in 2014. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. Contrast or Night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous. Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol."

Birdshead Gripframe w/ Wood GripsFrom Lipsey's: Some Lipsey Exclusive guns happen fairly fast, others take some time. The Bearcat Shopkeeper is one gun that has been on the drawing table for several years. It all started with a visit to one of our biggest and most loyal dealers in Alabama. I was talking to one of their store managers, who is a true sixgun connoisseur, when he mentioned his Bearcat he had sent off for some custom work just showed up and wanted to know if I would like to see it. Naturally, whatever else we were talking about was put on hold until we could check it out properly.He showed me a beautiful little 3"" barreled Ruger Bearcat that I just couldn't put down. We both agreed it would make for a great Lipsey's Exclusive, and after talking to Ruger, they agreed to take a look at it. The little custom Bearcat was sent up to Ruger so they could check it out and they agreed it would be a great project, however, Bearcat production was already tapped out with the regular models.One feature that stuck in my head was the regular square butt on the standard model with the shorter barrel reminded me of the old S&W J-Frames that had 2"" barrels and square butts. They just didn't look quite right. So we went out on a limb and asked Ruger if they could produce a round butt or birdshead type frame to go along with the 3"" barrel. In addition to the 3"" barrel and birdshead gripframe, we had to use a couple of other unique features to make it all work. Due to the short barrel, Ruger had to use a ""button head"" cylinder pin and a crescent shape ejector rod so that the spent cases could easily be extracted from the cylinder. Ruger is also using a steel ejector rod housing that matches the rest of the gun. In my opinion, it looks better than the aluminum one used on the standard Bearcats.I am happy to say that even though it took 3 years, the wonderful engineers at Ruger made it happen and now we have a true ""Shopkeeper"" size Ruger Bearcat. When the sample arrived at our offices, we just couldn't put this little gun down. This is one of those guns that once you put it in your hands, you will have to get one.Jason Cloessner"
