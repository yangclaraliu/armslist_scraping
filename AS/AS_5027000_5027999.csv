 Hello Everyone, 
This listing is for an unfired Entry Level AR15. This is from my private collection and I would keep it, but I would rather thin out a bit or try something else. This is a PSA Upper with a 16 inch stainless heavy freedom barrel with a 1:7 twist. This comes with a FDE adjustable stock, Magpul forend, stainless buffer, A2 front post, polymer rear flip sight, Two polymer 30rd magazines (one could use a little smoothing out), and a Seekins Billet extended mag release button. This is based on an Anderson Multi cal lower and Anderson parts kit. 
 I would also consider trades on this. Mainly would consider CMR30s, UC-9s, Marlin 357/44 magnum lever guns, Just Right Carbines in 45/9mm, 10/22, etc. Some trades will need boot/extras on your end, some will on mine. Shoot any offers to REDACTED (text only please) and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting,"

Description: The SIG SAUER P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. With its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

The gun is brand new. I sent it to Weatherby and had the barrel threaded and they put the Accubreak (muzzle break) on it. They evidently fired it there because they charged me an ammo fee on top of the other charges. Other than that, the gun has never been fired. These guns have a really awesome 2 stage trigger that break crisp and clean. It will come with 3 boxes of ammo too. 2 boxes of Hornady SST and 1 box of Remington Core-Lokt. There is nothing at all wrong with it. I recently bought a .338 Lapua and just don't need this one. No Obama.....I'm not trying to make a profit on it. I am not ""in the business."" I've got $800 in it so you can keep your goons from hassling law abiding regular folks. The gun will come in A box. It may or may not say Weatherby on the box. I'd hate to be considered a firearms dealer just because of what's written on a box. Also has all the paperwork and lock that came with it. Face to face only. Cash only. All the standard stuff that normal people understand.  I'm open to trade it for just about anything in reason. No I won't trade it for a cheap 22 or Grandpa's old single shot so please don't waste either of our time. What do you have?"

Better than Saiga.  Next to be banned?
From an online review:
	""The Molot Vepr 12 isn’t like previous AK platform blasters. It hasn’t been neutered. It isn’t bastardized. In my considered opinion, the Vepr is better than the best Saiga 12 or other AK platform shotguns.""
	""The Vepr 12 is very similar the standard Kalashnikov shotgun. It uses similar parts but works off of a stronger foundation. Built around an RPK receiver, these guns are more or less an AK on steroids. Beyond the thicker steel, these guns also sport other RPK inspirations–notable the handguard and rear sight; the rest is just classic AK design.""

Made from 1947 to 1969.

Colt decided to rename the Army Special to more reflect the actual buyers of the gun, so the Army Special name was changed to the Official Police.

The 1947 post-war version had a ramped and serrated front sight, a new shaped hammer with grooves, and the new cylinder retention system.



That was just what the gun was, THE official police issue revolver for a great many police departments like the New York City Police, Boston Police, and Federal agencies like the FBI and Treasury Department.

The Official Police would serve as a prime police issue gun into the 1960s, and was highly favored by private guard services, industrial plant guards, and civilian gun owners wanting a powerful and strong revolver."

I will update the ad as more items are added and of course when items are gone. I have other firearms listed as well for a bigger deal.  Prices firm at this time, may change them later if not moving.  I have pics of the other items, just message me for them.

1.) Hornady Critical Duty 9mm FlexLock 135gr +P JHP 50rd. boxes. The more common 25rd. boxes go for $20-$25 online and the 50rd. boxes for usually $35-$40 plus any tax and/or shipping when you can find them in stock.  If you can find it cheaper, great, but I have looked and I could not.  $300 per case(500rds) no shipping.

2.) D&L Sports 1911 Single Stack Quad Magazine Pouch/Holster, like new. $60 shipped.  http://www.dlsports.com/kydex_1911_single_st ack_quad_magazine_pouch.html 

3.) Grips are in excellent/like new condition, prices are the same whether shipped or FTF, from left to right starting at top, smooth wood grips $40, checkered Walnut $30, S&W ""K"" frame $50, faux Stag $25, Recover Tactical 1911 grip/rail system $35 and the Pachmayr Rosewood/rubber $25.  Found another pair of AJAX 1911 Pearlite grips $30.

4.) 6 boxes of 20ga. shells, see pic for load info.  $30 no shipping.

5.) Zombie flash suppressor, perfect to top or tip off your Zombie rifle.  $20 shipped.

6.) Nikon M-223 1-4x20mm Point Blank Reticle with flip caps and box/ppwk, mount is NOT included.  $220 for scope shipped.  Sells new for around $300 and no mount included.

7.) Nikon M-223 1-4x20mm Point Blank Reticle, no box and the M223XR mount is NOT included unless you want to add $80(sells for $100).  $200 for scope shipped.

8.) Beretta 92/96 Crimson Trace Laser Grips, older model I think, traded for these a few years ago and never used them.  They are used, but still work great, the pic with laser dot on cabinet is taken 20+ feet away.  I think you will have to order or make something to hold the batteries in when mounted on pistol, you will see what I'm talking about when you take the factory grips off.  Also, the very small Allen Key to adjust, if needed.  $80 for grips shipped.  Sell new for around $300.  

Might look at trades as long as it's a good deal on the value, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.

Ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.

FTF in the Garland area only or will ship, if stated.  I can accept PayPal.  Thanks for looking!"

399,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5027399,For Sale:  Obama's REAL strategy with background checks.,"Obama - On the Soap Box Again., North Carolina, United States",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 5, 2016",Rifles,Universal Firearms,no type,no type,no type,"Well, Obama's executive order on background checks is out, and, as expected, it's nothing but 100% redundant to existing federal law. People engaged in the business of selling firearms must have a dealers license and perform background checks. Yeah, no kidding. That's only been the existing federal law for decades. The net practical effect of this executive order is nill. Private sellers who are not ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms still do not need an FFL and do not need to run background checks. 

The rather obvious fact is that Obama doesn't really care about background checks themselves. They are a means to an end. For anyone who doubts this see the Enforcement of the Brady Act Reports which neatly break down how many checks were run, how many denials there were and, among other things, how many people were prosecuted for lying on form 4473 or for any other reason related to a NICS transaction. Here's a highlight: For 2010, the last year I could find the report, out of 72,659 denied NICS checks 62 people were prosecuted for any reason. No, that's not an error or a typo. 62 prosecutions out of 72,659 denials. So, clearly, the Obama DOJ does not care about prosecuting people who attempt to illegally obtain guns. So, why is Obama signing high profile but completely redundant executive orders that serve no practical purpose? Simple: Political grandstanding to start a new push for universal background checks legislation. Universal background checks are not the ultimate goal however. So, what is? Dramatically expanding the list of prohibited persons of course. Step 1: Prohibit any sales that don't go through NICS. Step 2: Expand the classes of persons prohibited at every opportunity. Step 3: repeat step 2 over and over. 

The first clue to this can be seen in Obama's call to add persons on the no fly list to the prohibited persons categories. It's worth noting that no due process of law whatsoever is required to place someone on this list. Who is on the list is classified. How they got on the list is classified. Ted Kennedy was on the list. The difference between you and Ted is that Ted was a high powered Senator and got off the list with a phone call. For you it will take 2 years and $50K in legal fees. Of course the no fly list is a small step and is not the end of it. Since the Supreme court has affirmed an individual right to keep and bear arms, the only way that gun prohibitionists can really reach their goals is to keep adding categories of prohibited persons. Sure, they might get local ""assault weapons bans"" and ""high capacity"" magazine bans but their ultimate goal of total or even serious gun restriction is off the table, unless they simply add people to the prohibited persons categories, which the supreme court has upheld. First it will be the 'no-fly' list. Next it will be anyone who has a diagnosis of ""mental illness"". That includes every child who has ever been prescribed an ADHD medication and everybody who has ever been prescribed an anxiety or other psychiatric medication. Vets with PTSD? You better damn well believe it: PROHIBITED. The ""mentally ill"" catchall will prohibit 60+ million people all by itself. Next it will be some class of misdemeanor, perhaps DUI, then speeding violations, etc. The 'logic' will be: ""If you can't obey the traffic laws, you can't be trusted with a gun"". As you add to the prohibited person's categories, fewer and fewer people will enjoy the right and fewer and fewer people will be politically active in protecting it. Eventually changes on the Supreme court will permit complete reversal of Heller and McDonald. That's the endgame and it will come faster than you think. So, all I can say is: If you are OK with asking your government permission to exercise your rights, sooner or later it's going to say NO. 

**Since somebody emailed and asked, here is how the law defines a dealer in firearms, and no, Obama cannot change the definition with an executive order.

18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(21)(C)

"" (21) The term “engaged in the business” means

(C) as applied to a dealer in firearms, as defined in section 921(a)(11)(A), a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms;""

Note the specific exclusion for ""occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms"". 

Finally, in response to someone elses question, no, in my opinion: If you are truly considered a dealer in firearms under federal law but don't have a license, simply asking to see a permit will NOT satisfy your obligations. You must hold an FFL in addition to complying with the Brady Act and all other dealer requirements. Simply requiring a permit from your buyers is not a substitute for an FFL and all that goes along with it.

  Kimber is known for their tradition of excellence and high quality firearms.  The Stainless II .45 ACP blends the features and performance expected from Kimber in a stainless steel pistol with increased resistance to the elements.  Essentially a stainless steel version of the Custom II, it has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and over travel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled.

Once it arrives it will go to the buyer of this.

If you know anything about Hi Powers, this is a $100 upgrade that greatly improved the trigger pull. If you've never heard of Cylinder and Slide, Google them. Second, the previous owner removed the magazine disconnect safety, which means the pistol will fire without a magazine inserted. This also greatly improved the factory trigger pull.  Third, the pistol has been upgraded with a set of Navidrex checkered thin grips, which are much better than the factory plastic grips.  Finally, the pistol will come with three (3) 15-round Mec-Gar magazines, which in my experience are also superior to the factory mags.

The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.

Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rim fire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.

When I look through it closely it really does not appear to require FFLs or background checks for private sales. There are various things that define you as an ‘unlicensed dealer’, including:

1) A business card,
2) Representing yourself as a source of firearms for customers,
3) Taking orders, and offering to buy a specific firearm to immediately resell to that ordering person.
4) Repeatedly selling and then restocking the same model and make firearm,
5) Accepting credit cards, getting business insurance on your stock, and other similar business related activities.
6) — and this is the money one — As a general rule, you will need a license if you repetitively buy and sell firearms with the principal motive of making a profit. In contrast, if you only make occasional sales of firearms from your personal collection, you do not need to be licensed.

I guess this law can be abused, just like any and all other laws can be abused. But if things are as represented in the guidance, Armlist and Gunbroker and all these sorts of websites — and private sales at gun shows — should be fine.

Here is the actual guidance. Note that it was published Jan 1, 2016, so the ATF had a heads-up on today's Imperial Decree:

DDescription

Kahr Arms, in collaboration with Spyderco, has created the Kahr Arms Delica 4 sprint run. This one has a khaki colored handle. 

The Spyderco manufactured Kahr Delica 4 is based on a modified blade design from self-defense expert Michael Janich. The 2.5"" blade has been chosen to make the knife legal to carry in larger urban areas like Boston and Chicago, while maintaining the intended utility of its design. It features a smooth thumb ramp. 

The Kahr Delica 4 utilizes the same handle design as Spyderco's popular model.. The color is black. The hardware and the VG-10 steel blade are non-reflective stonewash finished.
