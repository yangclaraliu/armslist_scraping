I'm going to be moving out of state and liquidating my gun collection. This one isn't one of those I need to get rid of but if it finds a good new owner that will take care of it as well as I have, I won't loose too much sleep over it. It's taken care of me and luckily I've never had to use it except for at my local shooting range. I just put brand new Duracell batteries in the laser as of 4/11/2016.I do do have other handguns and shotguns in my collection I'm looking to liquidate if interestedThank you and God Bless."
