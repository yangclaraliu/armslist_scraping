Comes with box, user manual, trigger lock if I can find it, 44 empty cases, and a speed loader with the remaining 6 live rounds in it. Has a couple tiny blemishes in the finish that I tried to get a snap of but they are very small, probably from being in the box, and can only be seen in the right light. Let me know if you want additional photos of any part of the firearm. It's a sweet shooter, the DA is a little heavy but SA is just beautiful. Unrelated, I also have a SADF M83 battle jacket (think Mad Max) and chest rig I'm looking to part with. Let me know if interested and I can get you some photos."

It does have holster wear on slide/frame but functions like a Glock and there of course is no rust/pitting. This gun has been well taken care of considering it was my carry gun for a while. The gun proabably has had about 800 rds fired through it. I have had a professional stippling job done as well as trigger guard undercut. It has truglo fiber optic sights installed, Ghost 3.5 connector, flat-faced OEM trigger and just put in new spring set about 3-4 months ago. I have 6 mags ((2) 15RD Glock OEM mags, (1) 15RD GL9 Magpul pmag, (3) 17RD GL9 Magpul pmags, and also the pictured Blade-Tech Klipt IWB holster RH. I do not have original box etc. It is what is pictured. Everything (gun, 6 mags, holster) total $440 CASH FIRM. Or I can keep the other 3 pmags and holster and I will sell gun, and (3) 15 rd mags for $400 FIRM. Trade value higher. Interested trades are: anything .45 ACP, cheap/used AK, AR upper in .300 BLK, nice rifles, no shotguns, .22 rifle or junk guns. I can add 9MM ammo for right trade. I can provide more info/pics upon request through email. My cell does not get great service, so email the best bet. Will not ship. Can only meet FTF within 20 min or so from Swansboro.

Serial is BSCXXXX. This gun is from the early 90s before the M640 was beefed up to chamber 357 mag. The newer 640 revolvers are great, but they definitely carry like a bigger gun, unlike the older 640, which keeps the airweight dimensions.As you can see from the photos, in excellent condition, low round count, and well taken care of. Trigger pull is exceptionally smooth, timing is exact, lock up is tight. Comes with original box and papers. Includes a brand new package of Bianchi speed strips and a set of A-zoom 38spl snap caps in excellent condition.Asking $520 cash FTF in Birmingham, AL. A beautiful wheelgun with a bit of something for everyone. If you are looking for a CCW, it is light enough to carry, but heavy enough to shoot comfortably, so you can practice as much as you want in a range trip. Indeed, if you already have a 642/442, many carry the airweight, but practice with the steel frame 640, which is the exact same size. Hammerless design, so nothing to snag on clothing while concealing or on the draw.For collectors of no-longer-in-production S&W revolvers, I have the original box, manual, etc. and even the crinkly yellow grease paper it came with. Would be great for showing off to your friends, both at home and at the range. For investors, these will undoubtedly continue to increase in value (as are all prelock S&W revolvers that are no longer made) due to finite supply and continued demand for classic no-nonsense wheelguns.Bottom line: Don't miss this opportunity to pick one up as these are becoming increasingly hard-to-find!I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.Thanks for looking!Happy to answer any questions, share more photos, arrange a face-to-face inspection, etc."

The M1861 is a .36, and is based on the larger .44 caliber Army revolver, but slimmer and lighter. It is regarded as one of the most attractive of the Colt percussion handguns, and was made in far fewer numbers than the M1860 Army. Only 38,000 of these originals were made between 1861 and 1873.This beautiful replica is brand new. It has never been loaded or fired, and comes in the original box with all the original paperwork. It's steel framed, not brass. The cylinder is engraved with a naval battle scene, as were the originals, reflecting its use by the Union Navy, which preferred the lighter .36 to the heavy Army gun. It superceded the earlier issue .36, the Model 1851.This gun is ideal for Civil War re-enactments: it was used by both sides, and Confederate copies of it are known. It was used in the post-war settlement of the western frontier, and this revolver will be a great gun for the Cowboy Action shooter.Because it's percussion fired it is completely exempt from the never-sufficiently-to-be-cursed Gun Control Act of 1968 and all its provisions. Unless you live in some benighted hell-hole like the People's republic of new Jersey, you need not use and FFL to effect the transfer: it can be sent directly to your door.  I will ship via FEDEX at actual cost.After the expiration of the Rollin White Patent in 1872, conversion cylinders to allow the use of fixed ammunition went on the market: several present day companies make conversion cylinders for this gun: they're drop-in replacements requiring no gunsmithing and allow use of the .38 Long Colt cartridge."

Includes Laser Bullet.
This is a used Glock reset trigger and Magic Bullet Laser module. Originaly purchased from Magill's GlockStore. It's in great condition, I simply didn't get to use it as much as I had planned so it's for sale.
Full description as copied from GlockStore:
This is unlike any other reset trigger kit on the market!
I have tested them all and I know that our trigger pull is more realistic. It actually clicks like a real Glock trigger, and it will actuate the Magic Bullet. This combined, gives you the most dynamic, dry fire/laser fire training tool available at this time.
Our kit includes a specially designed striker and modified trigger bar and trigger housing that gives you a consistent and realistic trigger pull while effectively resetting itself to allow for rapid shot after shot practice while projecting a laser dot to your target each and every shot, no matter how fast you pull the trigger. 
The Reset Trigger System drops into your existing gun in less than 2 minutes, and you're ready for serious training that will translate itself to the range the next time you shoot live ammo. Please, watch our online videos for complete demonstrations and information regarding this outstanding device.
If you are serious about training and want to become a faster, more accurate shooter, I strongly suggest that you consider the entire package as described. I encourage you to watch the videos on our website so that you fully understand the value and advantage this training will give you."

888,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5274888,For Sale:  NEW Griffin Armament Alpha Silencer Suppressor,"Amissville, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 825,"Listed On: Friday, October 6, 2017",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"In stock and on sale! Visit www.54-17arms.com. New for 2016- the Griffin Armament Alpha takes the Recce 7's market leading attributes and patented baffle system and adds new-to-market features. The Alpha uses 6AL4V Titanium components to drop weight to 14.5 ounces for a .300 win mag rated suppressor that weighs less than most market 5.56mm offerings. The ratchet lock front cap and keyed together baffles allow the Alpha to be disassembled by the end user for cleaning and ease of service. Traditionally, welded construction allowed the greatest confidence because serviceable suppressors were comprised of multiple components that could loosen. The Alpha's active locking front cap removes this concern and allows end users to remove copper and lead deposits which rob volume and add parasitic weight to centerfire suppressors over time. This allows the use of lead bullets and rimfire ammunition without concerns of damage to the suppressor. The Alpha features a CNC machined, billet tube body for maximum thermal transfer and unparalleled strength and durability. 17-4 stainless steel provides double the strength of traditional 316L stainless steel tube bodies, providing redundant strength for additional safety. A 17-4 blast baffle reduces sparking common in titanium suppressors. Years of internal testing has found 17-4 stainless steel to provide longer service life than 718 Inconel, the prior market leading alloy. 17-4 stainless is also twice as strong as cast Stelite 6. A Taper Mount Minimalist Brake, dissassembly tools, and a 1/2x28 direct thread adapter are included, making the Alpha a terrific value. Visit Griffin Armament for more info. MSRP: $1050"
