This is a very hard to find, Original Beretta Model 71, with 5.9 in. bbl., and adjustable sights. Extremely hard to come by!This pistol is in very good condition for its age, mechanically 100% with the usual wear and finish marks for a pistol of this vintage. I can not be sure, but i beleive the barrel has been finished in a Duracoat type finsh. It is a matte balck and matched well, but I do not beleive it is original. The grips are original vintage with thumb rest and very nice condition.If you have never owned one of these small compact Berettas, you are missing out. These are fixed bbl., alloy framed., manual safety, extremly accurate, semi-auto, .22 LR pistol, originally chosen by the Israeli mossad for use in the 60's and 70's. The origunals are getting very hard to find.Complete with original box, brush etc and original Beretta 8 rd. magazine with one extended magazine and proper spacer, which is extremly hard to find. Don't let this one get away...Cashonly, no deals, no trades.I use e mail..when you are ready to buy, let me know by e-mail and we can arrange to meet.

It is a mixed lot but mostly PPU, Hornady, and Winchester brass. I will sell it unprocessed or full processed. Will sell in lots of 100 up to 500. I will drive a reasonable distance based on the amount of brass you would like to buy, but not more than 30 minutes from the Columbia area. Compare the price of what I am asking for the brass and what others on the internet are asking, they are robbing folks. I will throw in an extra some extra rounds in each lot. I use this brass all the time and minor dents will come out during sizing, also the bent necks. Any brass I wouldn't reload goes in the scrap bucket and I won't sell. I am pretty anal on the processing of my brass. All of it is decapped, wet tumbled with SS pins, crimps removed, sized, trimmed and then cleaned a final time. I will sell the unprocessed brass, decapped for $15.00 per 100, and the full processed brass for $22.00 per 100. No shipping at this time. I think my prices are very reasonable and you can't find this brass cheaper online. Thanks for looking."

Henry Fitzgerald himself and not in the Colt factory. The craftsmanship on this is outstanding it’s well within the time frame and has the patina and the grooved hammer and the barrel has been correctly crowned. The timing and lock up is good and the bore and rifling are in good condition along with the cylinder chambers. The grips are quality reproductions and it comes with a nice high hip holster.
 
 I believe it was made by J. Fitzgerald himself during his career as a New York Cop and competition shooter. No self appointed expert can verify it either because no records were kept when he made them for clients, just the ones made by Colt. Also for you safety experts there are no documented accidental discharges because of the front trigger guard being removed.
 
 Fitzgerald built many of his specials for clients many of these were law enforcement officers and soldiers during WWI and WWII. This pistol has J F stamped on right and 1 s on the left bottom of the grip frame, possibly J Henry Fitzgerald only the Shadow knows for sure. This 99 year old Colt is well within the time frame and has the patina and possibly customized by Fitzgerald and not Colt Factory made. $525 or trade call Bill REDACTED"

I love being able to carry in any pocket, anywhere, and with stainless steel construction, they are not prone to any rust or corrosion. This one has been shot very little, and is in like new shape. I just had the Trijicon sights replaced, for FREE, because they stand behind their guns. These guns sell for $349, and the grips go for about $30 each. This is a great deep conceal carry, this is a .22 MAGNUM, not a LR or short, it has some powder behind it, and now Hornaday is making definsive rounds. Also comes with a full box of ammo. It is very shootable, and fun. Get one while they are still legal."

Within the black powder community, the folks who gravitate towards the flintlocks tend to go “all the way”. Well, I’m as guilty of that as any and more so than most. The purpose of RJM, is simply to provide goods and services to those folks within the community who simply want the best available. While doing so, I want to create a “home” for some of the top artists and craftsman in the country. My greatest goal is to keep these skills alive and set the stage for the next generation of craftsmen. While hard to believe, there are just not that many men who can take a slab of wood, a weight of iron and create a firing work of art. It’s my deepest conviction that the skills of our forefathers be preserved and passed on, and it’s my intention to do everything possible for just that."

I would bet this rifle has killed thousands of squirrels, beer cans and various varmints over the decades and now, she can be YOURS!!! As you wll see in the first photo, she does hang out with other cool items...so hopefully, you have enough cool stuff to put her with in YOUR home.  She does not have her front or rear factory sights, BUT she does have a nice period correct Bushnell 3-7x20 scope on her.  It looks like her receiver cover was painted at one time BUT I will tell you, she shoots fine and when you hunt with her, you will not be crying if you get her dirty.  Also, she does have the rare to find Remington Factory sling mounts.  I will ship to your FFL and since the buyer will pay shipping, we will go with the cheapest possible.  These rifles usually run about 25-30.00 to ship.  IF you are local, you can just come and pick her up.  I prefer dealing with CHL holders locally and if you are not one, rest assured there will be a bill of sale completed.If interested, you can look me up on FaceBook under https://www.facebook.com/tecash  or on my cell at REDACTED"
