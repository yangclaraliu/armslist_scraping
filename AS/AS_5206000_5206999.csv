""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.oh yea did I mention""life time warentee"""

It comes in the factory Springfield lunchbox with all the goodies (2 mag holders, holster, etc.) Also comes with 4 factory 7 round magazines, three 8 round Chip McCormick power mags, and one Nighthawk Custom 8 round magazine. Round count is somewhere in the neighborhood of 300. Looking for $800 on this one, FTF at FFL (preferably Ark Tactical) you cover the fees. Located in Littleton, COI will get some better pictures when I have some natural light."

The pistol is in great condition with little ware from rarely being fired. On this Star M-43 the nickel finish gives the gun a beautiful look. Adding to the gun is the rubber grips and the textured front and back giving you a nice firm hold on the firearm when shooting. Making the gun versatile for left and right hand shooters is the ambidextrous thumb safety, 3 dot white sights for a easy aim and a 3.25"" barrel for added accuracy in a smaller gun that would make a great concealed carry piece. Overall length is 6 Includes one 7+1 round mag & factory case. Any questions please ask thanks.This is a sub compact size gun with a 3.25"" barrel and 6.5"" overall.This was my step father's who recently passed.  If this ad is up it is still available.  Look at pictures for condition or I can email you more pics on request!  Please stop texting me for a list of all his guns, I am listing what we are selling on here and GB.

When they are combined with recycled tire crumb in a unique manufacturing process, an extremely durable material is produced.Sound and Shock Absorption: Rubber athletic mats have excellent sound and shock absorption qualities, and they can also serve as an effective vibration buffer. These characteristics are particularly important for indoor applications.Anti-Fatigue Resilience: Fabricated from thousands of fine rubber granules, athletic mats offer excellent underfoot comfort. Their resilient properties cushion the strain from running, exercising, walking or standing.Installation: Rubber athletic mats require no adhesives or special tools for installation. Simply lay them in place, and their weight will keep them there.Portability: As no adhesives are required for installation, Rubber Athletic Mats can easily be removed and re-installed again and again.Easy to Clean: Cleaning involves a broom, damp sponge mop or vacuum cleaner.

Its tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic. The controls of the 3032 Tomcat Inox are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide as well as preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand. Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the 3032 Tomcat Inox were designed to be carried concealed. Therefore, the lines of the Tomcat are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster, pocket or belly-band without catching on anything. The rear sight is adjustable for windage, so that you can easily experiment shooting different loads while keeping your sights on target. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the 3032 a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense."

Gen III Billet Upper and Lower Receivers cerakoted FDE, Noveske marked Raptor Ambi Charging Handle, 15"" NSR Handguard, FDE Magpul STR stock and Miad Pistol Grip, Magpul MBUS Pro Sights. The rifle started life as a complete rifle factory built by Noveske. The previous owner purchased a different upper so he could shoot suppressed. I purchaseed the factory built upper from him and went to Rainier Arms, bought a Gen 3 Noveske lower and sent it for cerakote before I even picked it up. Lower was built with the same magpul furniture as comes from the factory on the rifle. Only difference is I went with a Spikes Battle Trigger over the ALG ACT (very similar). I also installed an ambi safety selector. There is zero rounds thru the lower and 30 thru the upper. It is in 99% condition. You would be hard pressed to even tell that it has been fired. I don't need to sell so don't waste my time with lowball offers, the only other one on here is $3k and I don't charge tax.

What started as a custom design built for his Force Recon platoon during a deployment became a lifelong mission for Travis Haley to build a rifle sling that works around the end user, and not the other way around.
The D3 Rifle Sling can be run in single point or two point configuration and has been designed to transition between the two in moments. The sling includes two, positive locking QD swivels and features Haley's proven, SDI single hand quick adjustment system.
The sling also debuts a low profile pad, inspired by climbing harnesses created by the world's leading mountaineering companies. A 5-layer laminated construction sealed with stretch woven materials, the pad provides stability and comfort without adding weight or bulk. 
The D3 Rifle Sling is the result of over 15 years of continuous use, revision and improvement, delivering a versatile platform intuitive to the point where the rifle becomes a natural extension of the body."

Uncle Sam’s original spec sheet was a one-size fits all. But the 1911-loving public quickly figured out that America’s favorite autoloader could be improved with customization. The Loaded Series from Springfield Armory® brings you the culmination of those lessons. These pistols are Loaded with all the features a 1911 should have. Whether you’re looking for a pistol to use for target practice or home defense, you’ll appreciate the extended ambidextrous thumb safety found on all Loaded 1911s. Likewise, the ergonomic beavertail grip safety, lightweight delta hammer and extended trigger enhance handling and performance in any situation. But not every feature does all jobs, and so the Loaded Series is a diverse lineup. The variety of finishes, frames, calibers and sights means that there is a Loaded 1911 designed to handle your intended application. If you’re ready for a 1911 that brings you upgraded features without a custom shop price tag, look into the Loaded Series.    Share            Specs    Caliber .45ACP   Recoil System 2 Piece N.M.

957,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5206957,For Sale:  $599 H&K P2000SK V2 LEM Trigger 9mm 10rd,"Overland Park, Kansas City, Kansas",$ 599,"Listed On: Friday, July 15, 2016",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Heckler & Koch P2000SK v2 9mm Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 - 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines."
