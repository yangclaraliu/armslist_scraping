Yes, it saw some use downrange and got a small ding on the side. Still works, since it's made of STEEL. I love this rear sight, but don't need it anymore, since I'm going to a rifle that has built-in iron sights.
KAC sights were chosen by the military for their rock-solid construction, clear sight picture, and intuitive controls. It's stupid-easy to zero your rifle with this sight and then engage at ranges up to 600 meters. Zeroing Tips:    25/300 Meter Zero: Place a target 25 meters down range. Turn the rear sight drum to the ""Z"" setting and fire a 3 round group(s). Adjust the front sight post and rear sight windage knob until the desired point-of-aim/point-of-impact is achieved. If possible, turn the rear sight drum to the ""3"" setting and confirm zero at 300 meters.    50/200 Meter Zero: Place a target 50 meters down range. Turn the rear sight drum to the ""2"" setting and fire a 3 round group(s). Adjust the front sight post and rear sight windage knob until the desired point-of-aim/point-of-impact is achieved.

Not that the ban really had an effect on this type of rifle. The lock rings and A1 style flash hider are the difference.   Serial codes were ran and it is an early 88 production.  It has the preferred receiver tube (there were 2 styles) so that is an added bonus.    This is a cool rifle, BUT!!!!  It's not a go to for killing zombies.   Originally designed in Australia and later purchase licensed by Bushmaster.  It functions perfectly, the ""But"" is the field stripping.  The lower comes off just like an AR-15. But the gas system is enclosed in the receiver and its a BITCH to take apart to clean. It's an extremely simple design, but is held together by a bolt and the pressure of the flash hider agains the barrel sleeve.   So you have to remove the flash hider, barrel nuts and sleeve everytime you want to take it all the way down.   Again it's very reliable and accurate. Just a pain in the ass to clean. Original rail is included along with the optics. I'm the second owner and know that it has 300 rounds max through it. (Bought it from my best friend). It's been a safe queen.     I don't need to sell and am very very very firm on the price. I've no interest in trades either. $1300 is the bottom line price. Not $1250 not $1275 $1300"

Looking to spend time refinishing stock and cleaning up a mosin for the hell of it. Aspects that are important to a collector matter little as it is going to be refinished, shot, and potential banged around in the brush. Model doesn't matter a whole lot (M91/30, M44, Finnish M39) With that in mind I am really only concerned with:The country/factory/time period of origin as it pertains to functional quality; The lack of serious flaws or cracks in the stock (rough finish or being soaked in cosmoline is absolutely fine);Quality of bore/barrel (strong rifling, no pitting, existence/quality of counterbore)Nothing specific outside of functional quality in mind and obviously the world of Mosins is varied; so let me know what you have and what you think is fair (Not expecting someone to offer an M39 at the same level of a rough Type 53). If I don't respond please don't take it offensively, I am betting on a fair amount of traffic off this listing.  And as a reminder, not looking to complete anything in a collection or a beauty piece."

The early model 39 came out right after WWI in the early 1920's. It had no prefix, and I can't give you a serial number range, but most are seen with 3 digit serial number if they are first year. The 39a is very similar in it's first year, as both had casehardened receivers, but the 39a had a round barrel, vs. the octagon barrel of the 39. Additionally both guns were pistol grip, and had the ""S"" shape to the bottom of the pistol grip stock. 1st year 39a's also did not have a prefix letter. There are no factory records for either gun, so no serial numbers that can be verified with a records check"

$800 firm in cash or higher in trade value.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"
