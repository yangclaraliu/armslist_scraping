You can easily control the shooting power by adjusting the amount of pumping. Another good thing is that no need of expensive CO2 packs, just pumping is enough. Though the pumping noise maybe cranky and scare the animals away. That is why it suits more for ambush hunting or shooting practice. However, due to the power control and simple function, this type of gun is very popular and preferred as a survival gun or a self-defense gun"

It has been a great carry gun for me using the OWB molded holster that will be included in the sale/trade.The S&W 3913 is a 3rd gen DA/SA handgun with a stainless slide and aluminum alloy frame. Weighing in at 25 ounces makes it one of the lighter 3rd gen guns on the market. It is a single stack 8+1 that feels extremely comfortable to carry all day. The <1"" width means that with a IWB holster you will never notice it, and even with a OWB holster (as I carry), it never shows. For a 3.5"" barrel, it drills holes right where you aim. And it will fire every time you pull the trigger. There is a reason that these guns were issued to undercover officers, and are highly prized today as being a perfect carry gun.Included in this listing:S&W 3913 9mm1x pinky magazine1x plain magazineOriginal packagingOWB molded leather holster (see pictures)Valid permit required for sale/trade.Sale/trade will only take place in the Des Moines area."

This one is marked O-66 on the receiver which means it went through a USMC rebuild (Overhaul) in 1966 and then went into storage. They only marked the receivers for a few years. O-66 marked Garands are prized because they’re often in nearly unissued condition. According to Scott Duff they’re so well thought of it was common for The CMP to give them as one of the prizes for winning a CMP shooting competition. If you google “O-66 Marine Garand” you can find more information on O-66 Garands. With the low barrel wear it would be fine to take it to the range as much as you want. It’s a non-import CMP Service Grade 1944 Springfield Armory in Superior Condition with all USGI parts. The Springfield barrel has a like new muzzle reading of 1 and a throat reading of 3. Take a look at the pictures of the receiver, it’s gorgeous with a beautiful patina and modest wear. I’ve shot 3 clips and it functioned with no issues. It has an appropriate un-humped cylinder lock and SA Op-Rod, bolt, trigger housing, hammer and a walnut CMP stock."
