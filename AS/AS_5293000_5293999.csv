Ruger's patented, detachable 10-shot rotary magazine features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding. The easy-to-use extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss removal of the unique flush-mounted magazine without leaving it exposed to dent or creating uncomfortable protrusions at the rifle's balance points."

Just attach it to your AR15 complete lower and you're ready to shoot 300 AAC Blackout! You don't even need to get different mags--use the same AR15 mags.The barrel is 16"", Melonited, 1:8 twist. The KeyMod handguard is free-floated. Has a forward assist and dust cover. Serious inquiries only please, leave your ph# and I will contact you. Must be willing to meet at a QT in Tulsa. PLEASE NOTE: the VG6 Gamma Muzzle brake reduces felt recoil but it is LOUD--you will need proper hearing protection!ALSO NOTE: Please do NOT load 223/5.56 ammo and try to shoot it out of this upper receiver--pay VERY close attention that you shoot 300 Blackout rounds out of a 300 Blackout upper, and that you shoot 223/5.56 ammo out of a 5.56 upper!"

The Nano 9mm - Comfort and Power in Concealed Carry and Personal Defense. The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense.Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.Price is firm at $400.00 Comes with everything box, manual, 2 magazines."
