Both the rifle and all magazine are made by Springfield. It has the 10 rnd mag that came with the gun, and one five round flush mag (ideal for hunting or just to have the flush look).HD photo links (armslist reduces resolution): http://imgur.com/v8nzjkr(opposite side view, although 20rng mag no longer available) http://imgur.com/eiuXhcyThe Loaded series m1a features national match upgrades, such as the barrel, trigger and sights.(4.5-5.0 lb two stage trigger, more accurate barrel, finer iron sights)gun, new price/cost - $1679.99 + tax (totaling $117.60)5 round flush mag - $39
You save about $250 from buying the gun new, not to mention some gun stores retail it higher than $1679, or if you buy online there's shipping and transfer fees (averaging $30 for shipping, and $30 for transfer fee (depending on what gun store you ship it to)), plus you get an extra included mag from me.I'm sad to see the gun go, great rifle, and fantastically accurate with the Loaded upgrades, but I am selling the rifle to pay for another gun (which I already secured), so I'm not really accepting trades, at least, it's very unlikely or you may get a bad deal.It's very convenient for me to travel to locations going north up to chattanooga, or north toward Jasper Ga, or anywhere around Metro Atlanta but talk to me if distance is the issue, I may just be heading your way.note: on march 25th, I'll be heading up I-85 from Atlanta to South Carolina, and then up to Asheville North Carolina."

Doesn't really need much said about it, it speaks for itself, beautiful gun, we'll made and always reliable.I've literally shot about 50 rounds through it, that's why I'm selling it. I never ever carry it or fire it anymore. I used to carry it for work but I use a different gun now. It just sits around and I'd rather sell it and buy something I want.It has scratches all over from being carried everyday for 3 months, but apart from that it's as new. I'll throw in the tactical grip attachment, which allows you to use a rail light or rail accessory and it makes the gun look really mean. Plus the tactical holster that goes with the grip attachment, that allows you to conceal carry the gun while using the grip attachment. And it will hold the gun in the holster with about any rail attachment you want. Also a very nice quality leather shoulder holster with double mag pouch. Both holsters are LEFT HANDED.I'll throw in 3 magazines as well.. this is easily a $1000 value package.Don't low ball me, I don't need to sell it."
