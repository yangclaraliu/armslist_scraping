Approx 50rnds through it, i try to occassionally fire what i carry to not lose familiarity. Minimal wear, you really need to get close to even notice annd its just holster wear. Comes with all pictured to include 9 Hornady hollow points, if i find the box there will be more. Im left handed so if you are too then i will throw in the holster. If you don't know the 23 has a 9mm conversion kit thats available for it. Simple swap of the barrel and its ready for 9mm, so cheaper ammo with much less recoil as it was mainly built to take on .40 rounds.text REDACTED"

Can be in .40 cal or .357 SIG, but I do have a preference for the .357 SIG. Railed or non-railed is okay. I do have a preference for the older, German-framed guns with the short extractors. DA/SA only, I will not consider DAK models, sorry.I have two pistols that I will also offer up in trade if someone is interested. One is a Sig P250 Subcompact in 9mm. It was purchased brand new by me December 2014, and has probably 1200-1500crounds through it, if that. It comes with case, two 12 round mags, two 15 round mags with grip extensions, and a Fobus paddle retention holster.The other pistol is a Gen 2 Glock 19. It has seen quite a bit more use than the P250, and has an unknown number of rounds through it as I purchased it used, but by the barrel wear I would guess no more than a few thousand rounds have been put through it total, and only a couple hundred by me. Has slide finish wear from being a regular carry pistol. It is actually my current carry pistol, and the P229 will replace it. It came with one mag when I bought it, and I have since added three more factory mags and three Magpul mags. It also comes with a Fobus paddle retention holster.Both guns together with accessories are probably worth about $750 or better. I will gladly trade both for the right P229, expecially if extra mags and accessories are involved.I'm north of Everett in the Marysville/Arlington area."

I have well over $1100 invested in this rifle, so serious offers only. The price is negotiable. The only reason I am looking to sell is the fact I'm just an AR guy. This rifle was fun to shoot, but I always find myself grabbing my AR when I take trips to the range. Really looking to sell everything at once!"

The rifle operates flawlessly and is fun to shoot. I have enjoyed it and have decided it is time to let someone else enjoy it. The price is for 1- M1 Garand and 600 rounds of 30-06 ammo with 30 enbloc clips, bayonet and 1 ammo can. This is not a collectors grade rifle, it is what ""you make of it. It is a re import from Korea with the Blue Sky Armory stamped barrel. I am willing to separate the ammo from the rifle. And would be interested in trades on M1A or PTR91 /HK91 rifles."

The pistol is less than a year old and comes with everything in the box, plus an exrta mag.  I have less than 200 rounds through this firearm. Sig Sauer gave the discreet, all-metal P238 platform some 9mm muscle, and the result is the P938: the first 1911-inspired 9mm microcompact by SIG SAUER®. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever all in familiar places.A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 can pack six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame, depending on the magazine (this version includes both).P938 Package Overview:Sig Sauer has included both a 6-round (flush fit) and 7-round (extended) magazine with a finger-grip extension. In addition, this P938 also comes equipped with a SIG laser.X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser:The SIG X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser for the P938™ Pistol is a compact, lightweight, red pointing laser used for aiming. The X38-TGL combines pinpoint accuracy and rapid target acquisition with intuitive operation, in a form fitting package weighing only 1.0 oz. • Ambidextrous On/Off switches • Compact form factor blends with the lines of the P238 and P938 • Convenient low profile mounting • Windage & elevation adjustments"

I have not seen a Glock come from the factory with both barrels and suppressor sights.  But  I have not seen everything. Please let me know if you're interested, and we can plan to meet up or exchange more pictures. I put exactly one magazine through each barrel to confirm point of aim point of impact. Still has gold grease from the factory.  I prob won't keep this up for long. Thank you"

The quality of materials, the precise tolerances, the skilled workmanship, and the need to withstand a lifetime of recoil make it physically impossible to build a world-class riflescope that is ""cheap.""But, they thought, perhaps they could make one a little more affordable.One of the most difficult challenges we've ever faced was building a riflescope that is worthy of the Nightforce name in every regard - yet within the reach of a wider range of hunters and shooters who don't need the ""overbuilt"" characteristics of Nightforce's NXS series, most of which were originally created to withstand actual combat conditions.It wasn't easy. But Nightforce did it, by limiting some options, offering simpler controls and using a less complex manufacturing process... not by reducing the quality of its components.Welcome to the Nightforce SHV 4-14x56. Nightforce is confident it will outperform any riflescope in its price range. And frankly, many that cost much, much more.All Nightforce did was cut the costs.
