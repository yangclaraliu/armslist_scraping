Check out this youtube vid if you have questions:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8xRufiC9-INext is a rifle I recently purchased here on Armslist. It is a customized sporter enfield. Blue and wood are in very good condtion. Some nickel plated parts, very good bore and action. I bought this as kind of a parts gun. The rifle has no magazine. I cannot seem to fit my No5 magazine into it, but I do have a spare aftermarket magazine that needs to be fitted to the rifle (as it stands the aftermarket mag doesn't work, it needs to be fitted)Both rifles for $380. I'm selling these two rifles at a loss, and I'm selling them both to make space in my safe (a good problem to have right?). At $380 this is a very good deal, which is why I am very firm on the price.

If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile. The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol.  Use your XD-S® Single Stack with an X-Tension™ magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there. If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack  in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

The American Patriot Knife is available in two configurations, the standard, black, Emerson G-10 or, in a very limited quantity, the Special Edition, George Washington Wood Patriot Do not miss a chance to own an authentic piece of American History. Each “Special Edition” American Patriot Knife is built with wood from a two hundred fifty year old oak tree from George Washington’s original farm at Mount Vernon.  This grand old Oak was alive when George Washington led the colonial army to victory in the war for American Independence.  Every Special Edition knife comes with a custom die struck coin beautifully finished in Gun Metal Copper along with a copy of a survey map drawn by George Washington himself, showing the location of the tree on his original farm.  In addition, each of these special edition models comes with a letter of provenance and a guarantee of authenticity for you to pass on to the future generations of American Patriots.

This is a great shooting 22 and is incredibly accurate. The finish is very nice with the exception of a few areas of thin bluing. This gun has been shot and used and was no safe queen. This particular model does have adjustable sights, trigger, and trigger over travel stop. It comes with a set of newer Taurus wood grips that have been fitted to it and a set of Hogue overmold grips.  I am looking to sell outright or entertain trades. The only particular thing I have in mind is a S&W J frame revolver, either newer or older. Otherwise feel free to offer. More photos available on request."

It has all the comfort of our Original design, but comes with the following additional features: adjustable cant, tuckable, excellent positive retention. The holster is made of polycarbonate, which is an extremely durable thermoplastic. Common uses range from cd's & dvd's to bullet resistant glass. We chose to use polycarbonate because it has 30% more tensile strength and almost double the impact strength of acrylic-polyvinyl chloride, which is the material used by many of the most popular IWB holsters on the market today. All of this simply means that the Professional holster is made of the highest quality materials available. Using polycarbonate also allowed us to develop a positive retention IWB holster with our Twist Release System™.  When the holster is worn, your body puts pressure against the backing, which presses the firearm against the polycarbonate.  The polycarbonate holds the firearm in place and provides additional security for the retention of your firearm.  Simply drive your thumb between the holster and the grip, then slightly twist the grip toward your body to release the trigger guard from the retention bump for a smooth draw!Rated one of the best holster out there check the reviews out! $76 will let it go for $60 obo .
