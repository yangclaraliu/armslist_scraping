Good working condition. The shotgun uses interchangeable chokes and also comes with an extra barrel I believe it's for slugs. The shotgun new is $1800 plus $250 for the speed bead. Shotgun is functional and in excellent mechanical condition. I'd also say it's in good condition looks wise besides some wear. If your looking for a 100% perfect gun this isn't for you. If you may a great gun with minimal wear for less than half of a new model, this is your gun. Benelli uses the interia system so it runs no matter what the outside temp or no matter what the moisture levels are in the gun. It's about as bulletproof of an semi auto shotgun as you can get. Includes sling. Please call or text Robert at REDACTED willing to trade for over and under 12 gauge or other high end firearms. Cash proffered over trade. Thank you!"

This is a parts gun, I had an original riot gun barrel screwed into it as a project, however the gunsmith did a poor job and it wont chamber a round fully (action jams).  I dont have the time to fix it so its being sold off as a parts gun/project.  Overall its in realtively nice conidtion and with the correct headspacing (presumed) fixed it would make a great western action shotgun.

I know that if you use the internet to facilitate a sale, or if you repetitively buy and sell guns, you're supposed to get a license. Does armslist count? The way I understood it is that getting a form 7 FFL license was hard to impossible to get. I read that up to 2 transactions in which no background check was performed could land you in jail. Is this retroactive? Could you get in trouble for sales you made before the executive order went through? The way I read it on the ATF website they could prosecute you for making a transaction that you didn't profit off of but ""other factors"" were involved. What other factors?

 Altogether these five magazines have about 40-50rds/ea through them, I only took them to the range once and went through 250rds. These have been stored unloaded and have nice, stiff springs. I never had any problems with these during usage, they worked without any malfunctions in a Springfield 1911A1 ""Loaded"" model and a Kimber TLE/RL II. I'm only selling these off because I don't shoot .45's very often anymore and would like for someone else to be able to enjoy these instead of letting them gather dust.

The SuperNova Tactical comes with a  ghost ring rear sight and a protected front sight post that allow rapid sight acquisition, while holding up to rugged environments.  This benelli comes with a pistol-grip stock.  The full pistol grip stock allows user better 1-hand control of the weapon when using the off hand to open doors or clear brush from one's view. A shim kit enables adjustment of drop and cast. A short barrel with a fixed, cylinder choke are ideal for fast work at close range. Benelli constructs the SuperNova with corrosion-proof polymer over-molded on a skeleton framework to form single-piece receiver and buttstock for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. All metal parts have a non-glare, anti-corrosive finish. The polymer forearm pushes a rotary-head bolt back with dual-action bars. Aggressive ribbing on a contour-tapered forearm provides a secure hold while cycling the action under any circumstances. A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine to quickly load another round via the ejection port. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place; the shotgun can be fieldstripped down to basic components in less than a minute. The Benelli 12 gauge SuperNova Pump-Action Shotgun handles all 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" ammunition. The gun comes with integrated sling attachments.

Here's the story. I got this pistol years ago.  It has not been fired and has been in a safe collecting dust. I can't vouche for much other than its clean, and can run easily through a functions check. Slide works, cycles rounds, safety works and hammer drops when you pull trigger. It seems like it should operate fine but honestly I don't care enough to find out. If you would like it I'm asking a whopping 75 bucks and won't bother to answer other offers. It is what it is folks, have at it if you'd like."

Sometimes you need something a little different. A full sized battle rifle can be a tight squeeze in your truck or in the heavy brush. The Springfield Armory® M1A-A1™ Scout Squad™ combines the legendary power and reliability of the M1A™ with the quick handling and fast sight acquisition of a scout style rifle.

From the two-stage military trigger to the aperture style rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation), you’ll find that the Scout Squad™ is packed with all the standard features that make the M1A™ great. The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil.

Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle."

Less than 200 rounds have been shot through it.. Thanks for looking."
