These targets are made out of 3/8"" thick AR 500 steel. They can be shot with rifle or pistol. They come with a circle plate that overlooks the shoulder of the target representing a hostage situation and when shot, the plate flips from one shoulder to the other without you having to reset it. No more walking down range to cover holes in a paper target. They come with a two piece stand for easy takedown so you can put them in a car. The target is 5 feet high on the stand. The torso measures 12""w x 24""h with a 6"" diam. hostage plate.  If you want to see them in person, they can be seen at Denver Guns & Ammo or if you contact me, I can make arrangements to meet you. They are lots of fun because they are reactive targets and give immediate feedback. Once you shoot these targets, you will never shoot paper again."

133,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5423133,"For Sale:  .300 AAC Blackout AR-15 Pistol, 7.5 inch barrel New","Jupiter, Florida, United States",$ 695,"Listed On: Sunday, May 1, 2016",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,".300 AAC Blackout AR-15 Pistol, 7.5 inch barrel. Shipping to US FFL only (see below) or face to face local area sale (Palm Beach County/ Martin County FL) with current CCW or military/ LEO ID. This is a custom .300 AAC BLK short barrel build configured specifically for sound suppressor (silencer) applications. The goal was to create an overall compact and accurate weapon even with a longer suppressor mounted. While it functions reliably with quality supersonic factory ammunition, suppressed or unsuppressed (range tested with Remington 125 grain), it is optimized for use with subsonic ammunition with a suppressor (tested with Remington 220 grain subsonic). The 1 in 7 inch twist rate is also better suited for heavier bullets.It is not configured for subsonic unsuppressed use; this will result in malfunctions due to under-gassing. While the gas port could be opened up to allow such use, gas ports once enlarged cannot be reduced. I strongly recommend instead fitting a longer barrel (at least 10 inches) for anyone wishing to run subsonic ammunition unsuppressed. Of course this largely defeats the main purpose of the excellent .300 Blackout (Whisper) round, namely quiet precision shooting. Hence my reasoning in optimizing this pistol for subsonic suppressed use. (I do build a longer barreled .300 BLK pistol for those desiring a more all-around firearm or living in areas not allowing silencers.)Suppressed testing was conducted with a Silencerco Harvester .30 caliber silencer in good condition. This is a 9 inch silencer rated for a variety of ammunition. Results may vary with other suppressors. The Anderson adjustable gas block (click-adjustable from front in 90 degree increments; not necessary to remove handguard) allows custom setting for your environment and suppressor, or for function and reliability tuning as the firearm breaks in.The target profile stainless bull barrel is threaded 5/8x24 and correctly recessed at barrel face for silencer attachment. Although the barrel is heavy, overall weight is held down thanks to the lightweight slimline Keymod handguard.Fire control group: Standard trigger is a military type single-stage premium PSA unit, polished and tuned. It has a smooth release but may be heavy for some. If you prefer, I will fit a Rock River Armory National Match Two Stage Trigger with approximately two pounds of pull at both stages. (First stage sets the trigger; second fires.) This is an excellent and robust trigger for hunting accuracy and match shooting. (See Top 5 Best AR Triggers, www.ammoland.com/2015/03/top-five-best-ar-15-triggers/) Cost for this upgrade is $40, but I will do it for free if you pay my reasonable asking price and don't beat me up for discounts :) . I chose an Anderson Manufacturing lower receiver as the basis for this build because it is: + A quality forged MILSPEC receiver; + Reasonably priced; + Caliber marked as 300 AAC BLK. One does not want to confuse .556mm/ .223 and .300 AAC cartridges. Proper caliber marking helps prevent accidents.(Caliber marking on lower is also desirable for anyone planning to submit a BATFE Form 1 for SBR conversion.)This pistol is not treated with Anderson proprietary RF85 low friction coating; normal AR-15/ M4/ M16 maintenance and lubrication procedures should be followed.Note that most factory made 300 Whisper ammunition (e.g. Corbon) will also function in 300 AAC firearms. However this particular firearm has only been tested with marked 300 AAC BLK Remington ammunition.Anderson Manufacturing is an ISO 9001:2000 (originally MIL-Q-9858A) certified manufacturer with extensive background in automotive OEM and aerospace industries prior to becoming a full time firearms manufacturer in 2008. Although relatively new to the firearms world, Anderson has gained a reputation for building durable military pattern firearms long on value without unneeded bling. Anderson is proud to have a workforce comprised largely of US military veterans. For more on Anderson, see www.andersonrifles.com/about-us/.Aero Precision, manufacturer of the upper receiver, is another high quality manufacturer of AR pattern firearms and components. Finish of the Anderson and Aero components is virtually identical, with MILSPEC hard coat anodizing used by both manufacturers. For more on Aero Precision, see aeroprecisionusa.com/ap/manufacturing/.Note that standard configuration is with aluminum forward assist plug installed; see photo. Many shooters myself included prefer this for a sleek and simpler upper receiver. Slamming a jammed round with a forward assist usually just creates a bigger problem; better just to eject. However many people are used to the FA, and if you prefer I will fit a MILSPEC forward assist assembly at no additional cost. Your gun; your choice!I assemble my firearms using a high quality light machine oil or grease (barrel nut) as appropriate. Critical fasteners are lightly treated with low or medium grade (removable) Loctite. The castle nut on the buffer tube is not staked as these are one of the most frequently changed items on ARs. It is secured with medium Loctite.No sales to California, Connecticut, D.C., Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or anywhere else this firearm is prohibited by state or local laws. 30-rd Magazine cannot be shipped to above states or locales such as Colorado, Cook County, IL etc., where high capacity magazines are prohibited; however I will reduce your cost by $10 if the magazine is not included.

The metallurgy is far superior to any of the old military Mausers, and there is no thumb cut on the side of the receiver which makes it stronger and stiffer and more accurate.  The bolt and safety shroud are made to clear a scope.  The receiver is drilled and tapped for mounts.  FN installed Sako triggers on most of their actions and this one has one.  The trigger is similar to a Timney Sportsman.  This one is blued with a lightweight aluminum alloy trigger housing/magazine well.  The aluminum alloy has an enamel finish with some scratches.  It can be redone very easily. This is from a factory .30-06 rifle so it will accept all .30-06 length cartridges.  $350 firm and that is a great price.  These are getting harder to find and are not cheap.  There is just no comparison between these and any of the old military Mauser actions.  I am in Northeast Ohio but can travel to Erie or Meadville to do a face to face transaction."

All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany.

Besides that this rifle is spotless and looks like you just pulled it out of box!The rifle specs are as follows: CORE30® Billet Lower CNC Machined from solid 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy Integral Over-Sized Trigger Guard Type III Hard-coat Anodized Finish CORE30® Billet Upper CNC Machined from solid 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy with 1913 Picatinny Rail and Laser Engraved T Markings CORE30® Chrome Lined 8620 Steel Carrier, Magnetic Particle Inspected (MPI), Mil-Spec Carpenter 158® Steel Bolt, Chrome Lined Gas Key Hardened to USGI Specs with Grade 8 Hardened Fasteners, Mi-Spec Staked, Tool Steel Extractor Upgrade, Extractor Spring and Shot Peened 16” 4150 CMV Mid-length Barrel 1:10 Twist 5/8x24 TPI Chambered in .308 Winchester CORE30® V3 Billet Charging Handle Magpul® MOE Grip Magpul® MOE Mid-length Forearm Magpul® MOE Six Position Stock SureFire SOCOM 3 Prong Flash Hider Low Profile Gas Block (.750”) Magpul® 20 LR PMAG Weight: 8 lbs. CORE Rifle Systems NO BS Lifetime Warranty One of my favorite things about this company and this rifle is the last thing on that list, and yes you read it right. CORE offers a NO BS lifetime warranty, and yes the BS stands for what you think it stands for, and it is the best warranty out on the market. Pretty much if anything breaks, even if it is your fault, they will send you a new part no questions asked. And the warranty extends to whoever owns the gun aka however many owners it ends up with.The company is based out of florida and all parts used are 100% american made by milspec standards.Here is the official website and full information about the rifle:http://core15rifles.com/core30-moe-rifle.htmlAs you can see the rifle sells for about $2,000 brand new, I am asking $1,500 for it and that includes an additional 20 rd pmag, and the CORE hard carrying case."

Russian made SKS rifles are the most highly sought after of the SKS variants because of the higher level of build quality. Definitely a step up from the more common Chinese or Yugo SKS rifles out there, unless it's a pre ban commercial Norinco which is arguably equal.     It's getting harder and harder to find a nice SKS, the Russian imports dried up years ago and the value of everything continues to go up. If you ever wanted to add a quality SKS to your collection now would be a good time.I'm using the proceeds from this sale to fund another gun project, so I'm not really interested in trades, but if you have something particularly rare, cool, or interesting it never hurts to run it by me.Transfer to be done at FFL dealer, I'm out of FA-10 transfers. If you are willing to meet at the place I use in Worcester, I'll pay the transfer fee, otherwise the buyer pays the fees."
