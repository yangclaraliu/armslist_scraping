Sights are unique to this model and very good for target aquisition. These were favorites of the French Foreign Legion before, during and after WWI, as well as French Resistance fighters and some Nazi soldiers during World War II. In fact, a few days ago a cache buried in Latvia during WWII was discovered with a preserved Mle 1892 revovler just like the one offered here. The revolver, along with other supplies and explosives, was left for saboteurs in the area! (article is on guns.com and is titled ""70 year old saboteur cache looks like it was buried yesterday (17 PHOTOS)"").Lots of history and a good shooter! Ammo can be reloaded or purchased from a few places online. -Comes with the original holster which is in great condition as well. The leather is very supple, strong and flexible and can still be worn or hung on a belt for display.-Also included is a rare box of original unfired ammo! Packaged and shipped from the Paris factory in France.  25 rounds.This price is set low to sell fast. I will ship to FFL or C&R if buyer is out of state.

Bolt action single shot. Has about the same weight and dimensions of a K98 Mauser. Surpisingly accurate. First 6 inches of bore rather poor due to corrosive priming. Last 90% of bore in good condition which must account for its good accuracy even with cheap ammo. Has adjustable trigger access near bolt. Really nice fully adjustable rear sight for elevation and windage. Buying a comparable sight would probably run close to $100. Would make good first rifle for a kid to teach marksmanship not like a semi-auto to just blast away. Very guiet report not being much louder than a powerful air rifle. Has about the same balance and feel of a 98 Mauser. Willing to trade for whatever? Face to face. Thanks.

If you aren't familiar with this weapon, let me give you a back story. This rifle was used by the Indian Army and was one of the last primary bolt action rifle used in combat, other than specialized sniper rifles. This rifle was manufactured in 1968. This rifle is based on the .303 Enfield MKIII SMLE platform, but is specifically manufactured and chambered in 7.62x51. The stock is a No.1 MKIII Enfield stock. The removable magazine holds 12rds and you can still purchase spare magazines on GunBroker for about $50. This particular rifle is designed for the use of stripper clips. The bore is bright and shiny and rifling is very strong! The headspace has been checked by a gunsmith and it can shoot standard commercial 308 ammo. I on the other hand, have only shot 7.62x51 ammo through it. For being 47years old, this rifle is impeccable. There are no import markings on this rifle, just original stamped Enfield numbers. All serials match, including on the receiver, bolt, nose cap, magazine, and rear sight. Asking $375obo. I also have more pictures available if requested. Unfortunately, I do not have the bayonet or sling for this rifle, but you can still purchase the original canvas web sling online.Buyer must meet at my Local Gun Shop located in Clayton, NC. The buyer is also responsible for the transfer fee ($15 Cash/$20 Credit Card). I know this is a rifle and I do not have to have meet at LGS, but all Federal Laws will apply. Willing to ship to your local FFL, buyer pays $30 shipping cost and will need a USPS Money Order.If interested please message me or text me at 919-Two-6-Two-480-Zero.On a side note, due to Armslist not having Enfield as an option for Manufacturer, I posted it as CIA. Again, this is an original Enfield."

Ask most marksmen what contributes to their accuracy over any distance and they’ll brag about their scopes, barrels, triggers or even skill. At Burris we know the true building blocks of an accurate shooting system are the rings and bases. To consistently put your rounds on target time and time again, your scope needs to be properly aligned and anchored to your gun. That’s why every ring and base we offer is computer designed and engineered to specifications that would make NASA proud. They guarantee precise optical alignment and shot placement. They will withstand years of use and punishing recoil and look good with any scope on any gun. Go ahead. Give all the credit to your gun, scope or shooting skills. Just remember that without Burris rings and bases, you wouldn’t have that accuracy to brag about"

The gun has all the bells and whistles including a nikon scope, bipod, tactical flash light and a telescoping stock. As you can see in the pictures everything is top notch and gun is gorgeous. Probably put around 250 rds through it, and the gun has just been serviced by buffalo gun center this week. I am moving south so my NYS legal guns are going to stay behind for those who need them until this safe act is revoked. All star tactical is out of webster, NY and youll see they have a very high rating for the work they have done producing these NYS legal AR. They have also designed these in such a way that when this safe act is revoked you can easily convert this rifle back to a non fixed mag. Youll see in the photos it has a fixed 20 rd. mag, this is just for looks the mag only holds 10 rds. It has a set screw that prevents the mag from being released. You instead load the rounds through the top, Allstar has made a quick pull pin allowing you to flip the gun open and load easily. Also just for looks is the green silencer, this is not an actual silencer just for looks and doesnt positively or negatively effect performance. The barrell is threaded allowing your to thread whatever tip you would like. I have way more money into this then i will see back, if you look the add ons up youll see that. But I also dont need to unload this for a song, If no one is interested I will take it to texas and convert it back. Please feel free to email me with any other questions or photos you would like."

I can't figure it out.  I load my own 45 acp and have tried several different projectiles, powders, and powder loads, all to no avail.  This rifle is a handsome peice and if I desired a trophy on the wall he would be a great addition.  But I don't buy firearms for them to be trophies.  I buy them to enjoy shooting and this rifle is not enjoyable.  Maybe someone with more resources and patience can get this Tommy Gun to run right, but I can't.  I am done.  So there it is:  I am being honest and up front unlike the shyster who sold me the rifle many months ago.I paid $750, then purchased a 20 round mag for $35, and a sling for $20.  It came with a jerry-rigged drum(one that wasn't designed to fit this model)but I have never tried it.  The seller said it ""worked great!"", but I sincerely doubt it given how he deceived me about the rifle."

It is designed for use by civilian and security markets. The “MKA 1919 Match” is unlike many other 12 gauge shotguns as it is very light and ergonomic, this is due to the use of modern and high strength composites. The mix of AR and semi-auto shotgun features balance out well to create a very workable, flexible shotgun. The “MKA 1919 Match” semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gasoperated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver.

There has never been a higher demand for self defense handguns than there is today. The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can’t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well. We wanted to give our customers the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power.
Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.
The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in 9mm. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.
Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish.
If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.
