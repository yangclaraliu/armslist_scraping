Randall Knives are legendary.  If you want to buy a new one, the wait is approximately five years, and unlike this one, that knife will have no history.  This Model One, with an eight inch blade came directly from the estate of the 93 year old widow of the gentleman who carried it in World War Two, and perhaps used it beyond that.  Here are some details:
The sheath is a Moore made (all sheaths were contracted by Randall and this is an early one) model completely stitched and identifiable by the absense of throat rivets.  The sharpening stone is a Norton, old, but not the original issue, replaced due to loss, breakage, or the owner's grit preference.  Overall the sheath is in very good condition showing the expected edge wear from actual field use.
The blade is sharp, has no edge flaws or chips, and is stamped ""Randall Made / Spfld, MASS"" which tells us that this knife was one of only 1058 commissioned by Randall to be produced in Northampton, Mass from 1943 to 1945, in order to meet the wartime demand.  It is evidently carbon steel, with minor spots which I feel could be polished out, but that are typical of all high carbon tool steel blades of this age.
The handle is made of bone, which is unusual.  The Randall factory handle of this model were usually produced with the stacked leather handals, but today many different style and material handles are available.  One wonders if the handle on this knife was a prototype customization, a replacement for a worn or damaged leather grip, or a later replacement by the owner.  What's interesting is that the finger grip pattern seems identical to modern custom antler and fossil ivory handles availble from Randall today.  Washers and pommel seem to have been replaced to fit the bone handle as well.
The Guard is original brass and in solid condition, again with the bruises and character of realtime use.
Randalls were not government issue, but were the preferred knife of warriors in WWII, Korea, Viet Nam, and wars since, right up to the present day.  Brig. Gen James Gavin carried one in WWII and so did Gen. Westmorland in Viet Nam (his is also pictured with a ""white"" handel).
This particular knife is a fine example of what helped make the legend, and needs now to put into the hands of someone who will fully appreciate and preserve it."

Not desperate to sell, just haven't used the rifle and made a trade for another similar setup.  This rifle has had 25 rounds through it, one box of Remington factory loads and 5 hand loads. Read up on the 300 RUM and you'll find that it is one of the most versatile rounds made; you can load for everything from whitetail to moose and hit out to 1000y plus. This cartridge paired with arguably the best bolt-action rifle ever manufactured is a nice rig.

Don't really have an interest at the moment in finishing it or building an AR pistol, so it needs to find a good home.

Never fired... heck, never mounted on a lower. Did attach Magpul handguards and an Eotech, but they aren't on there anymore. It's basically new out of the box, but it's too late at this point to return it.

Locals (Seattle to Bellingham area)-- I'll accept cash, check, or money order. Non-locals (everyone else)-- Money orders only. If you send a check, it will be two weeks to ship just to make sure the check clears.

Price includes insured shipping, and is firm.

The new Daniel Defense DDM4v9 is designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications.  The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Government profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire.  The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

The gun comes with 2 5 round mags, a scrub brush to clean, lock for safe storage, a conceal holster and mag holster. I found the holster it comes with to be uncomfortable so I have another holster for it. An extra extended mag (7 round mag), an unopened 100 round pack of practice ammo, 10 rounds of Hornady self defense rounds and 20 rounds of federal hollow points. I'd like to sell it all at once for $680 obo. This is an amazing firearm! I've cleaned the gun religiously and it's only had about 100-150 rounds through it. The nearest and cheapest place I know of that'll do the FFL transfer is Stop, Drop and Shop on Austin Bluffs and Academy. FFL and background check will be a cost paid for by purchaser.

 Purchased this rifle new and installed an over travel adjustment screw with factory spring in the Trigger mechanism. It has a crisp 3.5lbs trigger and is a sub MOA rifle with good ammo. I've performed a complete break in using factory F. Fusion ammo and the rifle comes with an additional box and a half of the same ammo. So far I've killed a couple of crows past 100yds and an 8pt. Buck at about 90 yds with it. It is an excellent budget set-up and should serve you for a lifetime of hunting.

I know you can get one of these new or used for around $200 and the scope used for about $250, the mounts go for about $20 each and the sling was only $20. I'll throw in a box and a half of Federal fusions for you so you'll be ready to hunt it with asap. 

I figure $400 is more than fair for such a nice set-up, the scope is perfect for dusk and dawn hunting and is worth more than the rifle.

Cash sales are welcome, however I'm also interested in trading this little guy for an AR-15, see below.  I received the gun as a trade in mint condition with the factory box, two 7-round magazines, paperwork, holster, mag carrier, and the necessary accessories for field stripping the pistol.  Has a full length double spring guide rod and a unique feed ramp design that's built right into the barrel.  I've put a couple of hundred rounds through it myself and it's a pretty fun gun.  The trigger has almost zero creep and breaks like an icicle with no overtravel.  Not bad for a factory trigger.  The shorter sight radius and fiber optic front sight get up and on target quick.  Very fun.  Gun will come to you thoroughly cleaned and lubricated.

As far as an AR-15 trade, I'm really most interested in either a plain vanilla Colt or Windham Weaponry rifle with iron sights. Not interested in aftermarket optics/accessories or a stack of magazines.  I reload, so I don't need ammo.  I've had more contact than usual lately from people with very public felony arrest records, so I have to limit transactions to Ohio residents age 21 and over with a Concealed Carry License from Ohio or one of our reciprocal states.  I apologize for any inconvenience, but things are starting to get a little crazy around here and I'm not breaking the law for anyone. If you have a good trade or have an eye for a nice 1911 and want to do lawful business with a honest man, give me a shout."

Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self-and home defense as well as for concealed carry.Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home DefenseDesigned to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the Px4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts equal fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextrous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable - the Px4 just keeps delivering.Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with FeaturesThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of lasers, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easy training or shooting with either hand.Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter's hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.SpecificationsActionConstant Action Barrel Length (mm)102Barrel Length (inches)4Caliber9x19 (Para)Magazine17Overall Height (mm)140Overall Height (inches)5.51Overall Length (mm)195Overall Length (inches)7.68Overall Width (mm)36Overall Width (inches)1.42Sight Radius (inches)6.02Sight Radius (mm)153Weight Unloaded (g)785Weight Unloaded (ounces)27.7"

The V11 Pro Series carries the new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 which offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. Competitors will also appreciate the larger latch provided by a Vltor Gunfighter Mod 4 Charging Handle for easier manipulation under magnified optics.  A newly designed Muzzle Climb Mitigator redirects propellant gasses through calibrated ports, countering both recoil and muzzle climb.  A Geissele Automatics Super Dynamic 3 Gun Trigger delivers rapid hits on target with its light, short pull and quick reset.  Combined with the softened recoil impulse of a rifle length gas system, equals shorter split times, more precise follow-up shots, and reduced fatigue. MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTIONLOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.
