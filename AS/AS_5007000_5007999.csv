These older Standard models are getting hard to find ,and one in this condition is really a nice find ! 
I purchased recently from the Grandson of the orginial owner. He told me that in the 30 years he owned it that he had never fired it. I took it apart ,and cleaned it very well. The internals look near new, and it had very minimal dirt and crud inside. I believe that it was the very first time it had ever been field stripped. 
You will not be disappointed in this pistol. If you are looking for a collector piece this may well be it. If you are looking for a like new shooter ,this is definitely the one you want.
I am only looking to sell at this time ,and would have no problems keeping it. Please keep lowball offers to your self.
Asking 450.00 or best offer. 
Would consider trades ,but value would have to be greater than my asking price.
Thanks for looking"

This is a polymer frame gun…very light and it’s easy to make it disappear in any pocket.  The Taurus TCP has one major feature which the LCP doesn’t have and that’s last-round-slide-hold-open. When the last round in a magazine is fired, the slide locks open telling you the mag is empty.

The TCP is an outstanding pocket-carry design with a very smooth trigger. Its light weight (10.2 oz.) with a comfortable grip makes it an outstanding concealed carry gun. It's easy to pocket carry and just disappears in your pocket or purse.  It’s identical in size to the Ruger LCP but feels a bit softer to shoot than the LCP.

The full package comes with everything that came with the gun from the factory: original box, Taurus locking system with keys, all paperwork, and the 6-round magazine supplied by Taurus.

I’ve also included an extra factory mag that I had purchased, plus I’ve added a Talon Grip for increased control and comfort.

I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas (College Station/Houston general area) without shipping. Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TX driver’s license or permit.

This is the Snake gun that all want but only a few will ever own. 600 of these Colt BOA 4” revolvers were made with this one being SN BOA0553. All Colt collectors know that the Colt BOA was a limited production revolver made exclusively for the Lew Horton distribution company in 1985. The current owner purchased this from United Pawn Shop on 7/3/1994 and has stored it ever since maintaining it’s new in the box condition. Please look at the pictures closely and ask us for any other pictures you want on this extraordinary Colt revolver and you be the judge on the mint condition. The finish is a very deep mirror like blue that only Colt revolvers can capture. This gun by all inspections looks to be never consumer fired and is as new today as it was when it was made in 1985 and the only thing we see on this BOA is a very slight turnline as can be seen from the pictures. The box is a bit beat up but still contains the end label that is original to this gun. This revolver is a true collector piece and reserved only for the Colt collector that wants to own the Holy Grail of all Colt Snake guns. If you have been trying to buy a mint condition BOA, this is your gun and it will placed in the center of any collection once you own it. Like we stated, the current owner has been storing this BOA for over 21 years after he bought it 1994 and this is not one that has been sold and sold time again online. Don’t let this very rare Colt BOA slip through your fingers as it is a once in a lifetime chance to own a mint Colt BOA.  This Colt will ship $120 fully insured to you FFL.

The good news is there is no corrosion thanks to someone removing it and refinishing it. The bad news is that it was sprayed with a rattle can and it did not take completely. The majority of it looks fine but the paint is starting to wear off near the ejection port. My plan was to complete strip and clean it then coat it with duracoat.
