Bent the feed lips down just enough until it feeds right.It's actually a very accurate gun. I just took the original sights off because it was welded in place, off target. What you see is what you get.Tec 9 with top rail added.Bushnell trs-25 red dot sight.45 degree angle backup sights3 30 round mags that run great.1 30 rounder that needs a little adjustment. 1 barrel extension.1 fake surpressor. 1 computer bag that fits it all.And the original crappy sights that were taken off.And the original charging handle.Note.You must be legal in every way to own pistols. Buyer and seller will sign receipts.If you look like a gangbanger, forget about it.I have more pics, but armslist is so stingy on the pics.Will send to you on request. Would make a great SBR.

I've decided I have enough ar15 ARs and am going to try some bigger calibers. Parted out my DD barrel and vortex FH. Considering using the BCG FOR A 300 blackout build some day. Dd FF handgaurd went with barrel. This $68 will help get me off to a start on a different platform. The upper is made to accept an ejection door and a forward assist assembly. Come to think of it I have several several plain ejection doors and a spring but do not have the rod and miniature c clamp. I will include the door and door spring. There are no flaws or marks on the finish aside from where the charge handle snapped close where it rests when bolt is closed from hand cycling a mag or 2. Very nice Finish it looks great.

The Precisionist mechanism makes it one of the most precise available on earth. It's accuracy is that of 10 seconds +- per year. Quarts movements are usually 15 seconds +- per month. I myself currently own 4 Bulova Precisionist timepieces and they're perfect. I think the only other watch that has a sweeping second hand is a Rolex and maybe some automatics.This watch is great for dress and casual. Not to mention that rated at 300m it is actually a scuba dive rated watch unlike most diver style watches. It's the best watch I've ever had. My absolute favorite. I have two just like it though and one needs to go.The MSRP on it is $625 (See last picture with tag still attached.) Trade for big boy toys. Interested in trades of firearms and small arms. Also considered iPads or Apple Watch, or even a nice diamond ring for the misses. Txt or call 6lO 9533 if seriously interested. Cash only. Thanks"

If you are in the market for a magwell for added grip without the extra weight and huge bulk as some of the higher end competition ones, then these are the answer. I have used the same one on my personal gen 4 17 for the past 4 years and it is working great.

The pistol offers a rotating barrel and locking system and comes with 3 backstraps (small, medium and large) that are interchangeable. Ambidextrous safety. Features and BenefitsRotating barrel and locking systemChrome-lined barrel with a deeply recessed combat muzzle crownTechno-polymer reinforced fiberglass frameInterchangeable backstrapsAmbidextrous safetyAutomatic firing pin blockDrop-free magazine with a reversible releaseSingle and double action with a 10-round capacityIntegral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 railThe lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to MaintainThis pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame."
