The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect. If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16.

The scabbard/bayonet release mechanism within the handle is in excellent working order and 100% functional. Ricasso is date-stamped 1903 on one side and US on the other. The bayonet is about 16-1/4"" / 41.3 cm overall; the blade is about 11-5/8"" / 29.5 cm long.  This bayonet has not been cleaned or tampered with in any way; 100% original condition.Please email me for a lot more pictures.  REDACTED"

If it's been fired, it's very little. I'm not saying it's perfect, because there is a small scratch above the right grip and a very, very faint cylinder line, but it is about as close to perfect as I've seen. I don't think you could improve on it very much and l know you won't be disappointed. It comes with a gold box that is period correct, but I'm not sure it is original to this gun because l can't make out the serial number on the bottom, but the box is in excellent condition also. All numbers match including the grips. I can only post three pictures, but if you're interested and send me your email address, I'll send you more.l purchased this because the ship year was the same as my birth year, but I've found something else that l like, so I'm not interested in trades. I will ship to a ffl only for $30.00, including insurance. Thanks for your interest."

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-ups.  Would also like more Pmags for both.M855A1 rounds or ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.1oz.

899,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5111899,For Sale:  Quality .270 Ammo Federal Remington 270,"Dallas, Dallas, Texas",$ 580,"Listed On: Saturday, February 13, 2016",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 20 boxes of quality ammo, 6 boxes(110rds. to be exact) of Remington 140gr. Premier Core-Lokt Ultra Bonded PSP and 14 boxes(270rds. to be exact) of Federal 140gr. Vital Shock Nosler Accubond.  Can't find either of these 140gr. ammo in stock anywhere right now, so this may be it??, but when it was available the Remington sold for around $30ea. and the Federal was $35+ea.  $580 firm for all the ammo, sold new for close to $700 before any tax and/or shipping online, so at $580 it saves you at least $120.  Or I will split it up, $150 for the 110rds. of Remington and $450 for the 270rds. of Federal or may do $150 for 90rds. of the Federal.  Also, I've had several trade offers for USED firearms that sell new for around $500-$550.  Just because it is ammo and not a firearm, I am not going to straight trade $700 worth of new factory ammo for something that sells used for $450-$500(maybe), I am going to need a little cash on top.  I will consider trades only if it's a good deal as far as the value goes, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now, pretty simple.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.Trades considered:I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.M855A1 rounds or ammo in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  We can do current price to current price on ammo. 1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer. Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal. Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland area or will ship via FedEx for $20 more.  Thanks for looking!"

The first night was a full moon, and I staked out the chicken coop. Dawn came, not a single coyote then, or for the next 12 years! The coyotes had left Dodge, must have known I had their number. From then until now I put less than 50 rounds through it doing target practice and sighting it in. The other 99.99% of the time it faithfully and successfully guarded the underside of my bed. It’s in perfect condition, just like it came out if the box. I’ve sold the ranch, can’t use it (legally) in this new community, so I’m looking for someone who can put it to good use. We both know what it’s worth, be the first to make me an offer close to my almost firm asking price and it’s yours. I’m located in South Sacramento (Isleton), CA, and can ship to your FFL for $35. Payment is cash or credit card, there is a 3% discount for cash. If you want to come and inspect it dry (no firing) please email me at REDACTED and we can make arrangements. I will answer all your questions, and certify the condition and description provided."
