Just recently got a call from the FFL and he had one last one with a lower parts kit installed and upgraded stock with QD sling point. I was told people are trying out different mag releases like the saiga mag release, cmmg mutant release, etc which is cheap. All that holds it is a roll pin. This is obviously a project but this is the only Rhino lower in Colorado. This is the final price drop.I spoke with a company that makes uppers that are compatable with the AK magazine and this lower. I will send you all that information if are interested in buying"

From the Hogan Manual...Hogan Gun specifications:OPERATING SYSTEM: Gas trap/piston operation, rotating bolt (short stroke system), reversible gas piston for suppressed or non-suppressed operation. Unlike some other “op rod” systems, on the HOGAN gun, op rod springs have been eliminated due to possible damage and system failure during sustained firing of the gun. The HOGAN gun system has been designed and manufactured to greatly decrease/eliminate heat, carbon build-up, gas leaks, fouling and wear/tear on operating parts which can have an adverse effect on an operating system. Each piece of operating system is hard chrome plated and/or melonite heat treated making them almost self lubricating and act as non stick surfaces making them easy to clean and maintain.UPPER RECEIVER: Billet machined from 7075 aluminum forging, (aircraft aluminum alloy), 1-piece upper receiver to fit the Free Floating Monolithic rail system; electro-less silicone Nickel on the interior, finished in NP3™CHARGING HANDLE: Billet machined from 7075 aluminum bar stock, manufactured with an oversized grip and locking latch.

Gas tube: 4130 aircraft quality tubing. Block and tube are joined then mated with barrel (matching serial#’s added), then melonite heat treated together. Gas plug: billet machined from 4140/4142 steel bar, heat treated to Mil-Spec, ground to size, mag phosphate on top, NP3 coated, and/or chrome plated with blackened top.BOLT and CARRIER: .223 bolt: machined from 9310 steel bar stock, phosphate heat treated to Mil-Spec .223 and mag particle inspected, hard chrome plated. Carrier: billetmachined from single piece of 8620 steel - integral keyed steel bolt carrier (machined as one piece to leave key in place). Heat treated per Mil-Spec, Nickel Teflon plated.BARREL: 16” length. Barrel blanks are supplied by Rock Creek Barrels, Inc. and completed to final specification at Hogan Guns. Medium contour, hand lapped button twisted rifled, 6 fluted to improve rigidity and heat dissipation, reduce weight, improve accuracy by reducing barrel vibration when firing. 4150 Mil-B-11595 chrome moly vanadium alloy (machine gun rated). 70 Rockwell case hardened heat treated “5R” polygonal barrels are 2 times harder than Mil-Spec and hammer forged barrels. Corrosion resistant and 10 times thicker and harder than Mil-Spec chromed lining. The treatment on the barrels causes zero imperfections and is extremely smooth which also enables the barrels to consistently achieve excellent accuracy. Chamber: 5.56 x 45 mm NATO (.223 Cal) “5R” polygonal right handed 1x8 twist button rifled barrels.

The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. Maximum effective range with the standard 6-inch barrel is 200 meters (650 ft.). The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing."

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to CZ's polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.Like the P-09,  the P-07's safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.The P-07 shares the P-09's updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snap-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we've had to date.SpecificationsProduct Name  CZ P-07 Duty - 9mm  SKU  91186  UPC Code  REDACTED61  Firearm Type  Handgun  MSRP   $510.00  Chambering  9mm Luger  Magazine Capacity  15  Magazine Type  Double Stack  Frame  Black Polymer  Grips  Stippled  Trigger Mech  Double Action / Single Action  Sights  Fixed Three-Dot  Barrel  Cold Hammer Forged  Barrel Length  3.8""  Weight  1.7 lbs  Overall Length  7.2""  Height  5.3""  Width  1.46""  Safety  Interchangeable Ambidextrous, Decocker / Manual Safety"

Don’t miss your chance to own the first ever production of a new Winchester model!—–A remarkable new 1873 like no other. There is something entirely cool about a pistol grip stock combined with an octagon barrel. It has the look more of a dedicated rifleman than a working cowboy. You may love this rifle for other reasons, but the fact remains that a ’73 like this is pure classic. But we have taken it a step beyond with a walnut stock with a satin oil finish that’s velvet smooth to the touch. The classic rifle-style forearm offers a timeless look and feel. Then, of course, the color case hardening on the robust steel receiver, lever, crescent buttplate and forearm cap protect against corrosion and offer the most authentic 19th century look you can get. And then the crescent buttplate is the final touch — slipping right into your shoulder for a more solid hold from any shooting position. Set your sights now. SEMI-BUCKHORN REAR SIGHT WITH MARBLE ARMS® GOLD BEAD FRONT SIGHT gets you on target quickly. STEEL LOADING GATE for smoother loading.

It's a beautiful, heavy duty gun that needs to have someone actually use it. I kept purchasing ammo for it, and I've accumulated 15 boxes that will be included in the sale. I also picked up a nice rail attachment that's on the side. The Saiga's have a side mount, so the attachment will give yout two rails to work with. Also, the previous owner made sure that the tip is threaded. I don't have a close up of that. Lastly, the rifle includes the typical smaller mag, but I'll also be including the larger mag I purchased as well. Please feel free to message me with any comments or questions. I'd like to sell this as soon as I can to open up the funds for other things I need. Thanks for taking a look!"

Romarm Model GP WASR 10/63 Caliber 7.62x39 Firearm Type RifleBarrel 16in Fun Fact WASR-series rifles are manufactured with stamped sheet metal receivers that were originally intended for single-stack magazines. Featuring hard chrome-lined barrels, side-mount scope rail and wooden stocks, WASR-series rifles are commonly imported to the United States by Century International Arms. At the Century International Arms factory, the rifles are modified to conform with certain United States firearms regulations particular Title 18, Chapter 44, Section 922(r) of the United States Code, which deals with unlawful acts related to firearms. For example, the magazine wells are typically widened to accept standard AK double-stack column box magazines. Other common modifications include installation of upgraded gas pistons, fire control groups (i.e. trigger), pistol grips, and plastic folding or collapsible stocks manufactured by TAPCO of Georgia. Older WASR-series rifles commonly caused trigger slap, which is caused by the bolt slamming backward into the trigger assembly and causing significant pain to the shooter's trigger finger.[1] Beginning in 2007, Century International Arms has installed the TAPCO Intrafuse AK G2 trigger group, virtually eliminating the trigger slap problem. Rifles with this trigger group will have ""TAPCO USA G2"" stamped on the left side of the trigger. Some of these rifles may exhibit canted front sight blocks and gas tubes. WASR-series rifles are inexpensive and easily customized, with hundreds of aftermarket stocks, muzzle brakes, flash suppressors, telescopic sights, and other accessories available."

Originally using a single action bar, that was known to bind and even break, this was changed to dual action bars in 1970, following the expiration of Remington's patent on the double action bar design. A single large locking lug is used to secure the breech. The magazine tube is located below the barrel, and is screwed into the receiver. The slide release is located to the left rear of the trigger guard, and the safety is located on the upper rear of the receiver (often called a ""tang safety""). Sights vary from model to model, from simple bead sight to a receiver mounted ghost ring or an integrated base for a telescopic sight. Most models come with the receiver drilled and tapped for the installation of a rear sight or a scope base. The factory scope base is attached to the barrel via a cantilever-type mount, which places the scope over the receiver but keeps it with the barrel if the barrel is removed. Intended for use in harsh and dirty conditions, such as waterfowl hunting or combat, the Model 500 series is designed to be easy to clean and maintain. All Model 500s feature interchangeable barrels (given a particular gun's magazine capacity—a barrel designed for a five-shot tube will not fit a gun with a seven-shot tube), which may be removed without the use of tools, by loosening a screw on the end of the magazine tube, allowing the barrel to be removed. The bolt locks into a locking lug located on the top of the barrel, ensuring a solid bolt-to-barrel connection and not relying on the receiver for any locking strength. The trigger assembly, which includes the trigger, hammer, sear, and trigger body with guard, can be removed by pushing out one retaining pin and pulling downwards on the guard (if a pistol grip is installed, it usually must be removed first as virtually all such grips obstruct the removal of the trigger body). The elevator can be removed by putting the gun on safety and squeezing the sides together, freeing the pivot pins from the receiver. The forend can then be moved to the rear, allowing the bolt and bolt carrier to drop out, and then the forend can be removed by moving it forward. The cartridge stop and interrupter will then fall free, leaving just the ejector and the safety in the receiver, held in by screws. The magazine spring and follower may be removed by unscrewing the tube from the receiver (this may be difficult on some new 500s). This level of field stripping is sufficient to allow all components to be cleaned."

The Remington 1100 distinguished itself early on as one of the first semi-automatic shotguns to significantly reduce recoil while remaining lightweight and reliable. Designed to replace Remington models 58 and 878, the Remington 1100 was introduced in 1963. Until then, many gas operated shotguns retained vestiges of the long recoil action inherent in John Browning's original design. The Remington 1100 is available today in 12, 20 and 28 gauges as well as .410 bore. This shotgun is credited with establishing the era of the reliable, highly successful gas operated auto loading shotguns. In fact the Remington 1100 remains one of the best-selling semi-automatic shotguns in US history. Additionally, it set the semi-automatic shotgun record for most shells fired sans cleaning, malfunction or parts breaking in 1978 at 24,000 rounds."
