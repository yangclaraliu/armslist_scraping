You can shoot it all day long and shooters fatigue will never be an issue…  The next generation Sig Sauer P220 Elite builds on the exceptional engineering, design and reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIG’s new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT will provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA (Double Action & Single Action) with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting.  No production pistol is more closely identified with superior performance than the P220 and the new P220 Elite offers shooters new features that enhance the pistol’s performance. These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain an optimally confident grip from the holster to the ready position even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front trap checkering, SIGLITE Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P220 Elite package.  This Sig Sauer P220 Elite is new and un-fired. It comes with 3 new Sig Sauer manufacturer 8 round magazines, 3 new Pro Mag manufacturer over-sized 10 round magazines, and an ambidextrous all leather shoulder holster for discriminating buyer!

It comes with BOTH the factory .40 barrel and the Sig store 9mm drop in barrel as well (both calibers - one gun - same mags).  When I bought this gun in December my intention was to carry the same type of gun as I shoot in weekly USPSA matches, a Sig Double/Single. Being in lovely New York I had a screw up on my permit and was unable to take possession until just last Friday. The thing is, I have changed from my Sig to a totally different gun in the weekly shoots, so now I do not really have a need for this gun.  I did run 2 mags of .40 though it (20 rounds total) and another 3 mags of 9mm (using the 40 mags). No issues at all with feeding or extraction of both calibers, accurate with both barrels, actually a cool little gun. All said this gun has had MAYBE 50-60 rounds including those from the factory down 2 differnt barrels.  It's a very nice shooter - nice all around pistol - just have no use for it in my cabinet of guns.  It fits into my p229 holster just fine - but has never been carried a day in it's life - just test fitting.  I paid $650 for the new p224 with the 2 mags back in December and another $214 for the Sig 9mm barrel - so I'm about $865 into this gun... that said, I was stupid and realize that... so - I'm willing to sell the gun with both barrels and cover the shipping from my FFL to your FFL for my asking price of $749.  More than happy to answer questions (yes - shipping is included in the price : no - I won't ship direct, only to your FFL : yes you must use an FFL on your end : no - I won't separate the gun and the barrel) and take / send more photos if you want / need them."

If it's time for you to change equipment, change to this. With the heavy barrel, you won't pull up. And the acutrigger feature helps with the slow squeeze. Has detachable mag. The Zeiss scope is the REAL DEAL. Diavari Victory 2.5 x 10 x 50, with adjusting reticle lets you pick the nose hair you want to shoot at twilight. Once you've used this scope, you'll never want another traditional reticle. As you zoom in, the crosshairs enlarge. Single point from the bottom, with two squared-off side hairs. Nothing obstructing your view from the top. I've seen this scope alone, on ebay, listing at $1300 or more. Selling with case, strap, scope cover, cleaning kit, and a case of Hornady 165gr ballistic tips it was shot in with. This gun and scope are going to be very hard for me to part with, but it's time to buy some fishing gear, and our hunting lease ran out. When it's time to get zeroed in every pre-season here in the South, take one shot at fifty, one shot a hundred, and you're probably good to go. I was this season.

Never missed....until? Then you're snake bit? Well, this set will SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM. When this trigger's pulled, something drops in its tracks. Sure cured my yip. If it's time for you to change equipment, change to this. With the heavy barrel, you won't pull up. And the acutrigger feature helps with the slow squeeze. Has detachable mag. The Zeiss scope is the REAL DEAL. Diavari Victory 2.5 x 10 x 50, with adjusting reticle lets you pick the nose hair you want to shoot at twilight. Once you've used this scope, you'll never want another traditional reticle. As you zoom in, the crosshairs enlarge. Single point from the bottom, with two squared-off side hairs. Nothing obstructing your view from the top. I've seen this scope alone, on ebay, listing at $1300 or more. Selling with case, strap, scope cover, cleaning kit, and a case of Hornady 165gr ballistic tips it was shot in with. This gun and scope are going to be very hard for me to part with, but it's time to buy some fishing gear, and our hunting lease ran out. When it's time to get zeroed in every pre-season here in the South, take one shot at fifty, one shot a hundred, and you're probably good to go. I was this season.

Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Apart from the winning features of the PX4 line, the Inox offers you an attractive and durable stainless slide contrasting with the black frame. Super-Durable and Safe Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of military and law-enforcement groups around the world are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering. Soft-Shooting, Strong and Easy to Maintain This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame. Perfect for Concealed Carry and Loaded with Features The lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".  This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.  The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
