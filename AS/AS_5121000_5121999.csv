This Smith & Wesson Model A was made by Husqvarna, and is one of the smoothest actions I have ever encountered. I bought it a couple of years ago and put it in the safe. It just sits, and I've never even fired it, so off it needs to go. It deserves to be used! The rifle is in good shape overall; only real flaws are two pinned cracks in the stock. Previous owner said they were stable, but it wouldn't hurt to keep an eye on them (or simply inspect & re-pin). The stock itself has BEAUTIFUL figure to it, so it's well worth saving, and well within the capabilities of a competent gunsmith to do so.  Located in Charleston, IL -- stronly prefer a face to face meet so you can inspect the rifle.  All laws apply (FOID required, will be checkes, 24 hour wait, etc...).  Thanks!"

My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $199 for a trust. This includes an initial in-person or phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Florida, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Arkansas and Texas and can assist with trusts in those states as well. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at 2ndamendmenttrusts@gmail.com to inquire about my services."
