The upper without bolt was $350 alone, then ordered the PSA heavy bolt and charging handle.

Also has a new PSA 30 round magazine, a canvas/elastic sling and no-name red/green dot w/ cantilever mount that works as well as some of my high-end red dots scopes.  

The SBX brace is mounted to a Phase 5 buffer tube with ambidextrous sling end plate.  Opted for this setup as stock PSA tubes do not use the castle nut.  The BATF letter will be included along with the box for the Sig brace.  Also mounted is a black hogue grip.  And yes, it does have the dust cover and forward assist.  

Selling for roughly $90 less than invested, so price firm and fair and really not looking for a trade right now.  A great deal for someone in this market. Will sell to OK residents only, and please don't waste anyone's time trying to buy if you are a felon.  Ad will be removed when sold, thanks for looking.  Will sell for $600 firm (less of a loss for me) without the brace if someone does NOT want the brace."
