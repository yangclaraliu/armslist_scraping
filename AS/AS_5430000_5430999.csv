Its a 'tanker' rifle. Built on a Springfield receiver with mixed parts. Comes in an aftermarket stock.The finish is worn on it, It had been refinished, blued at some point.... the bolt and the gas tube are polished.The rear sight has been replaced with a williams peep sight.The action cycles well and the trigger pull is pretty nice too. I dont know much about Garands to say if its original trigger or if work was done, but for a WWII era millitary weapon, its nice.The barrel is in beautiful shape, stong rifling and is mirror bright!
 
Overall the gun functions feels good. Was grandpas gun, hasnt been fired in years.... but my father in law says that he shot it frequently and was his go to Elk gun.
The gun is rough, in my opinion, though the bore is excellent... so I figure if a nice Garand goes for $1100+
 
$600 is legit for this one."

Big enough to hold plenty of ammo and small enough to conceal, they are the Swiss army knives of the firearms world. The problem most of them have is bulk. Concealment takes effort, and the grips are too large for small-handed shooters. Since my qualms fall into both categories, I’ve never been comfortable carrying one. And that’s why I was so excited when I saw the advertisement for the SIG P320, with its dehorned appearance and ludicrous amounts of customizability.
Other guns in the past that feature interchangeable backstraps delivered less than impressive results. Since they don’t allow a wide enough range of sizes to fix the ruined ergonomics of handguns whose grips resemble 2x4s. So I was pretty skeptical of the interchangeable frames until I held the medium-sized one.
“It fits!” I cried out like the prince in Cinderella, finally finding his lost love. I can eject mags, drop the slide and fire the pistol without having to rotate the gun in my hand. Out of curiosity, I tried the small size, which wasn’t uncomfortable at all. I could easily use the P320 with that smallest grip installed, but found that my support hand would overlap my firing one a little too much. Though that could just be hands reporting a conflict with my previous muscle memory.
Ergonomics aside, the pistol has a slightly higher-than-average bore height which amplifies felt recoil. In the 9mm version tested, this is a non-issue – especially if a shooter it using a grip that properly fits their hands.
The P320 Compact feels like a cross between a VP9, a Glock 19 and an M&Pc; with the best attributes of all three. The only addition I’d like to see made available would be either a frame that doesn’t include a railed dust cover or a rail cover for existing ones. I feel that would make this gun draw easier from concealment, though a quality holster can do much to remedy this.
Hip-shot verdict: the P320 is on par or surpasses all major brands of polymer-framed handguns in terms of functionality, usability and accuracy, and I would argue it has better ergonomics and trigger pull than the vast majority of its competition. I can’t personally think of a striker-fired handgun with a better trigger, though the newest Century TP9SA and H&K VP9 come in a close second. I wouldn’t sell my Glocks to purchase the P320, but if I weren’t already invested in Glock pistols, the P320 is a very attractive option.the APex trigger REAKKY makes this gun fly. -Dave REDACTED"

The Glock 21SF Generation 3 has some minor exterior design changes as compared to the Glock 21. The short grip frame is noticeably thinner from the backstrap to the trigger, and it incorporates the Glock Rail. It has an ambidextrous magazine release. Note the redesigned magazines will function in both designs, but the old magazines don't have the necessary cut out in the front of the magazines to function in the redesigned weapon. These models ship with a threaded barrel.
With not one, but several high quality features, the GLOCK 21SF 45ACP FS 13RD THRD BBL is a great firearm for the money. This amazing weapon is a particular favorite of many hunters across the world. And it is because so much effort has been put in place to ensure that the GLOCK 21SF 45ACP FS 13RD THRD BBL accurately responds to the many demands by hunters and law enforcers. The only unusual thing is the price that is deliberately very low. You can not see any tooling mark on the GLOCK 21SF 45ACP FS 13RD THRD BBL and this is because so much effort is put in making the finish very even. The first thing that strikes you when open the box is the smooth muzzle that takes your game to its ultimate position. Great quality and price."

This process keeps the plate from shifting. All plates are “comfort curve” which is achieved by a custom precision die that bends each plate to our specs. Approx. weight of plates is 7lbs per plate. The Tactical Cut plate is used to reduce weight. The plate is curved both down the center and slightly at the bottom. It is designed to enhance free movement and easier shouldering of various weapons. The Tactical Cut is widely sold to SWAT teams across the USA.Made In the USA Designed to the specs of law enforcement, SWAT, private contractors. All our ballistic plates are made in the U.S.A. We also provide ballistic steel for vehicle armor ups and safe rooms. We specialize in our customer’s needs, custom sizes available.Quality Steel All of our plates are tested, certified and batch certified on a regular basis. Our Level III quality steel will never expire, crack, or need to be replaced like other body armor. We use one of the largest steel manufacturers in the country. Dates of manufacture are with the last 6 months as we obtain steel weekly.Anti Spall Coatings We do not coat our plates with any type of rubberized coatings. The reason is that the steel plates are “Certified” and tested. We have done extensive testing on coatings and to date have not found a “coating” that can be lab tested and certified to provide anti spall ability. We recommend a rated Level IIIA trauma pad be installed if you are concerned about this issue.
