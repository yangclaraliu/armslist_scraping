Caught off-guard, American units fought desperate battles to stem the German advance at St.-Vith, Elsenborn Ridge, Houffalize and Bastogne. As the Germans drove deeper into the Ardennes in an attempt to secure vital bridgeheads, the Allied line took on the appearance of a large bulge, giving rise to the battle’s name. Lieutenant General George S. Patton’s successful maneuvering of the Third Army to Bastogne proved vital to the Allied defense, leading to the neutralization of the German counteroffensive despite heavy casualties.The ""scratched"" engravings on the lighter:Bastone82 Airborn 12/44 PETaken from Col Staphe S.

During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide about 3 mm (0.12 in) until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension at the base of the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This camming action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.[34] Features[edit]       A subcompact Glock 30 field stripped to its main parts with a .45 ACP roundThe slide features a spring-loaded claw extractor, and the stamped sheet metal ejector is pinned to the trigger mechanism housing. Pistols after 2002 have a reshaped extractor that serves as a loaded chamber indicator. When a cartridge is present in the chamber, a tactile metal edge protrudes slightly out immediately behind the ejection port on the right side of the slide.[36][non-primary source needed] The striker firing mechanism has a spring-loaded firing pin that is cocked in two stages that the firing pin spring powers. The factory-standard firing pin spring is rated at 24 N (5.4 lbf), but by using a modified firing pin spring, it can be increased to 28 N (6.3 lbf) or to 31 N (7.0 lbf). When the pistol is charged, the firing pin is in the half-cock position. As the trigger is pulled, the firing pin is then fully cocked. At the end of its travel, the trigger bar is tilted downward by the connector, releasing the firing pin to fire the cartridge. The connector resets the trigger bar so that the firing pin will be captured in half-cock at the end of the firing cycle. This is known as a preset trigger mechanism, referred to as the ""Safe Action"" trigger by the manufacturer. The connector ensures the pistol can only fire semiautomatically. The factory-standard, two-stage trigger has a trigger travel of 12.5 mm (0.49 in) and is rated at 25 N (5.6 lbf), but by using a modified connector, it can be increased to 35 N (7.9 lbf) or lowered to 20 N (4.5 lbf). In response to a request made by American law enforcement agencies for a two-stage trigger with increased trigger pull, Glock introduced the NY1 (New York) trigger module, which features a flat spring in a plastic housing that replaces the trigger bar's standard coil spring. This trigger modification is available in two versions: NY1 and NY2 that are rated at 25 N (5.6 lbf) to 40 N (9.0 lbf) and 32 N (7.2 lbf) to 50 N (11.2 lbf), respectively, which require about 20 N (4.5 lbf) to 30 N (6.7 lbf) of force to disengage the safeties and another 10 N (2.2 lbf) to 20 N (4.5 lbf) in the second stage to fire a shot. The Glock's frame, magazine body, and several other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle. The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a nonslip, stippled surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the locking block, which is an investment casting that engages a 45° camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame. The Glock pistol has a relatively low slide profile, which holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the pistol more comfortable to fire by reducing muzzle rise and allows for faster aim recovery in rapid firing sequences. The rectangular slide is milled from a single block of ordnance-grade steel using CNCmachinery. The barrel and slide undergo two hardening processes prior to treatment with a proprietary nitriding process called Tenifer. The Tenifer treatment is applied in a 500 °C (932 °F) nitrate bath. The Tenifer finish is between 0.04 and 0.05 mm (0.0016 and 0.0020 in) in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth. The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, nonglare surface with a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications) making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration. Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion-resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including Teflon, bluing, hard chrome plating, or phosphates. After applying the Tenifer process, a black Parkerizeddecorative surface finish is applied. The underlaying Tenifer treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off. A current production Glock 17 consists of 34 parts. For maintenance, the pistol disassembles into five main groups: the barrel, slide, frame, magazine, and recoil-spring assembly. The firearm is designed for the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge, but can use high-power (increased pressure) +P and +P+ ammunition with either full-metal-jacket or jacketed hollow-point projectiles."

I have only bought the best condition guns throughout the years because if and when I sell them I don't have to makes excuses or apologize for them.Sometimes (more often than not) gun show dealers will take milsurps that are already clean but nasty dogs, then lather them up in cosmoline and tell you ""How great they'll clean up!""Since many buyers at gun show already have stars in their eyes and don't want to get their hands dirty they buy the dealer's fluff and take the dog home only to discover that they've been bit.I don't play that game or waste my time with lowballers. Don't screw up good milsurps by trying to make them something they were never meant to be.  Adding ""tactical"" stocks and all that other crap is money better spent on other guns, ammo, and fun. You can always sell an orignal milsurp. You can't hardly give away that after-market ""bubba"" bs.$400.00 for rifle and ammo package. Price is FIRM. Don't ask if I will take less. I won't.

My other G19 Gen 3 is the 'TALO' Boron slide finish model, and is one of the most accurate CCW guns I have ever carried for my personal protection, but it isn't for sale, so don't ask.Most people don't know, but the G19 Gen 3's are still the most sought after 9 mm pistol by professionals, and ones in the know about CCW guns.Why is that you might ask? Because the Glock 19 Gen 3 model has a track record, and was sold by the 10's of millions world wide. They have also consumed 100's of millions of rounds through them, and have probably the best reliability record in existence, for when you pull the trigger they go “bang.” The Gen 3 also has a thicker polymer frame than the Gen 4. Glock hollowed out some of the polymer frame, to make room for the double spring that was un-necessary, for an already easy shooting pistol. Unless you need the ambidextrous mag release, there is no reason to go to a Gen 4.I'm looking to trade up with “Boot” for a DA/SA 9mm compact pistol with a hammer.I have a special need for one of these.

I have the original stock for this rifle (included in sale), however, the original stock was sporterized at some point, and the barrel bands, bayonet lug, cleaning rod, and band spring were lost.  In an effort to return the rifle to milspec, the previous owner of this rifle obtained the stock, barrel bands, and bayonet lug; I added the cleaning rod (probably a replacement - I got it a while ago and don't remember).  Alleged veteran bring back (I say alleged because without offical documentation, that is pure speculation); no import stamps; not a Russian capture.  Everything matches minus the aforementioned stock and metal parts near the muzzle.  The butt plate currently on set-up is from the original stock (in an effort to keep as much originality together as possible). You'll notice in one of the pictures that the last number looks over-stamped on the bolt safety (over-stamped 5 over a 1); I believe this was a factory mistake, and not an effort to ""hump"" or deviously force match the bolt at a later time (I can provide more pictures of the 2 other over-stamps upon request).  Barrel and bolt bear the same ""M"" letter block, coinciding with SN production date, and further supporting the notion that this occurred at the time of original production. I'm not an expert, this is just what I've found searching the Internet to explain this.  Moderate pitting on parts of the metal, but otherwise, rifle is in good condition. The barrel displays some pitting, but rifling remains good.  Please feel free to contact with any questions."

Very nice glass!!!I have a bunch of primary arms optics I am getting rid of (for those who don't know, primary arms makes excellent stuff for the money, $ for $ best optics out there, the one budget company that delivers quality)1) Primary Arms Red Dot (lifetime warranty) 50,000 hr battery life, little heavy but built like a tank. Purchased for $199, will sell for $100. Comes with extra batteries.2) I have (2) Primary Arms 3x Magnifiers, not as nice as aimpoint/eotech magnifiers obviously but quality nonetheless especially for the price. Purchased for $100 each, will sell for $50 each3) I have a Samson QD Magnifier Mount, works perfect with P.A. Magnifiiers, one of the best magnifier mounts out there. Purchased for $199, will sell for $100.4) I have a Primary Arms Micro Red Dot. Purchased for $125, will sell for $50.5) I have Trijicon Accupoint TR24r 1-4 dual power (tritium/fiber optics) BAC scope in a Trijicon labeled Bobro QD mount (best mount on the market hands down, LaRue is popular choice so is ADM, but nothing comes close to Bobro) the trijicon labeled bobro accupoint mounts are no longer made, only Bobro branded mounts are currently available. Purchased scope for $1000, purchased mount for $269, will sell each for $800 and $200 respectively, or $960 for both. 6) I have a Trijicon Accupoint TR20 3-9 amber triangle in a bobro mount (mount is cerakoted graphite black for extra protection/longevity) Purhcased scope for $850, purhcased mount for $250, cerakote $50, will sell together for $8407) Last but not least I have a Leupold HAMR w/ 3.5MOA deltapoint reflex sight. MSRP $1950, Purchased for $1550, will sell for $1200 (which is less than what the HAMR can be purchased by itself without deltapoint reflex sight)All of the above are great deals in my opinion.

Single lithium Battery (CR2032) Five Year Battery Life    The Trijicon Miniature Rifle Optic (MRO) is a reflex-style, sealed sight intended for use on rifles, carbines, and shotguns to provide fast target acquisition. It is designed to be used with both eyes open, providing the operator with maximum situational awareness. The large aperture and tapered light path maximizes the viewing area in such a small optic, allowing for fast target engagement – especially from non-standard shooting positions. Advanced lens coatings and electronics produce a crisp red dot. The brightness control dial on the MRO is specifically designed for ambidextrous usage. With a mid-adjustment “off” position and eight discernible brightness settings, this brightness dial allows for quick and ergonomic adjustments. The MRO features fully protected adjusters that maintain zero even during rough handling, and can be adjusted without the need for special tools.

Utilizing an optics attachment platform similar to the rare and much-sought-after AUG A2, the AUG A3 M1 is in Short-Rail version.The AUG A3 M1 boasts an overall length of just 28.15 inches, including its 16-inch heavy barrel, making it at least 8 inches shorter than an M4 carbine with a comparable-length barrel. The short-stroke gas-piston operation of the AUG runs exceptionally cleaner by nature because all of the operational exhaust gas vents out of the front of the rifle. The AUG's matching, yet opposed, stainless steel operation and guide rods affixed to the bolt carrier glide effortlessy inside the receiver for unparraled smoothness in operation as well as exceptional reliability. Dual gas-adjustment settings ensure its operation, even with the dirtiest ammunition and in adverse conditions.The AUG A3 M1 has all the classic features and benefits that established it as the pinnacle of modern rifle design, including expedited disassembly as well as simple conversion to left-hand operation, which requires replacement of the standard bolt with the optional left-eject and swapping the ejection-port cover. It also features a quick-change barrel with a collapsible forward grip as well as a two-position cross-bolt safety that locks the trigger.The receiver was also updated to replace the permanently affixed front sling swivel with a VLTOR Quick-Disconnect Sling Swivel, which makes two-point sling attachment or removal extremely fast and easy, and users of single-point slings can remove the front sling swivel entirely, if they so desire.The AUG A3 M1 stock, cocking piece and forward grip are made of highly durable synthetic.SpecificationsModel   Steyr AUG A3 M1   Purpose  Target shooting, military and law enforcement, multi-gun competition  Manufacturer  Steyr Arms   Operation  Adjustable, short-stroke, gas-piston, semi-automatic  Magazine Type / Capacity   Polymer double-stack detachable box / 30 Rounds   Receiver Material  Hard Eoxal-coated aircraft aluminum   Caliber  5.56x45mm (.223 Remington)  Barrel Length    16.375"" chrome-lined CHF barrel (18.375"" with muzzle brake)  Rifling   6 Grooves 1:9"" RH Twist  Safety  Two-position trigger-blocking   Trigger Type  Single-Stage  Pull Weight  15""  Recoil Pad  Elastomer; ; 0.3-inch thick  Sling Swivels  Two (front QD, rear reversible)  Pistol Grip  Integral  Overall Length   28.15"""

""I had been licensed to carry in New York State since I was 18 and had looked for an ultra-compact 9mm pistol,"" Justin later told American Handgunner. ""To my chagrin, I could not find a pistol with the quality of construction and features in design which I felt were appropriate for a carry gun. Therefore, I decided to design an ultra-compact 9-mm. pistol that I could carry.""[4] By his junior year of college, he decided to design one himself. In 1999, Kahr Arms bought Auto-Ordnance Company, not associated with the original AOC, maker of Thompson submachine guns, then owned and operated by Numrich Arms who had bought the crated assets of Auto-Ordnance started by General John T. Thompson and his investors. Now Kahr manufactures Auto-Ordnance's line of semi-automatic weapons, including a long-barreled rifle version of the famous ""Tommy Gun"".[5]Kahr offers its line of compact pistols at a time of significant liberalization of concealed weapons laws in many U.S. states. Since the 1990s, many states have passed ""shall-issue"" laws, as promoted by the American National Rifle Association and other gun rights organizations. Such laws mandate that state authorities must issue permits to carry concealed weapons to all law-abiding applicants who met certain conditions set forth by state law, including passing a comprehensive background check. In 1994 the U.S. government banned manufacture and importation of pistol magazines with more than a 10-round capacity. These were the so-called ""high-capacity"" magazines, which again became legal to manufacture and import in most states in September 2004, after the relevant federal law expired. This change in federal law rendered many staggered-magazine pistol models (commonly with magazine capacities of 15 or more rounds) less popular in the American market. They were now overly large in light of their newly mandated 10-shot limit. Kahr was at the forefront, offering relatively small, well-made pistols with magazine capacities of up to eight rounds of 9mm or .40-caliber ammunition. These single-stack magazines allow for slender, compact pistols that have proven popular with the buying public.Since late 2003 or very early in 2004, Kahr has changed from offering a Limited Lifetime Warranty on their pistols to one of only five years' duration. In 2003 the New York Daily News reported that the Kahr K9 was popular as a back-up weapon with New York City police officers, who called it the ""Moonie gun"". In June 2010, Kahr bought Magnum Research, which markets the Desert Eagle. On July 1, 2013 Kahr Firearms Group announced that it was leaving New York state because of the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act. Kahr has purchased 620 acres in Pike County, Pennsylvania, and will move its corporate staff after building offices in 2014 with plans to build a new factory by 2019"
