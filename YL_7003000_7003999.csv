This is my IWI Tavor IDF-16, one of the rarer Tavors out there that not only features an integrated Mepro 21 Tritium/Fiber Optic dot sight (No Batteries Needed, Ever!), but also features more robust folding rear sights than the commercial SAR model (and Tritium, no less!). To my knowledge (unless something has changed), this rifle is unique in the sense that the barrel-mounted Mepro sight is the ONLY dot-reticled M21 currently supplied/mounted (via manufacturer) to any IDF model in the USA and is far superior to the triangle reticle these usually come with. You can remove the optic in exchange for a rail system.
This rifle has been kept in great condition for my personal rifle- the barrel and other components have been changed out for IWI factory parts. In short, it's more ""Refurbished"" than Used, to ensure you're nothing short of thrilled with it.
Unlike the traditional SAR model with the flimsy back up sights, these feature rotating/folding peep sights that perfectly co-witness with the optic, which is zeroed to 50/200 meters. With the right ammo and skill, I have taken out steel at 650 meters with this rifle. She's a piston gun and as robust at they come- she will likely outlive you and provide the defensive needs your family requires for generations to come.
She's compact. Shorter than many SBRs without the paperwork due to her bullpup design. I have been able to place her inside of small gym bags, pillowcases and backpacks. She is very well-balanced and loves to be fired from the standing and kneeling position (though the bench will do). You can fire her with one hand if you like, she doesn't mind and will gladly balance herself inside your shoulder. Recoil is mild and she's sure to turn some heads.
The IDF-16 variant of the Tavor is as close as you can get to the Israeli military-issued model and is devoid of all the fluff/quirks that many people dislike about the commercial US Tavor, including the newer X95s. She can take a serious beating and keep going, with or without cleaning and lubrication. She can be converted to 9mm with ease, and will come with a coveted barrel wrench in order for you to remove the barrel (cleaning is a breeze). That said, she isn't as cheap as the others- even used. She MSRPs at around $2,599, so this is a steal when you think about it. A new ""bland"" Tavor (without the IDF-16 features) sells around $1500, and a Mepro 21 MSRPs for about $550.
I chose the number 1812 due to Independence day, the Star Spangled Banner (written during the War of 1812) and even went down a few dollars of the appraised value to do so. Call me eccentric, I'm a patriotic kind of guy.
I loved this rifle. I still do. Why would I sell it, you ask? I'm getting married on July 4, so I have to make room for things. That said, I'm not desperate to offload her, so low-balling me will have zero effect. I may flex a little, but not much. It breaks my heart, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
I've used this rifle in competitions where I completely smoked AR users. Once you get the manual of arms down, she's as fast as lightning in terms of reloading, target acquisition and follow up shots. You can maneuver her in a way that would result in an AR being barrel-dragged through the mud. She's the perfect 5.56 home and vehicle defense rifle.
In addition to the carbine that served me so well, you will also get:
x1 Cyclone Plate Carrier, valued at $120, plus several pouches.
x1 Sling, Magpul.
x2 Magazines, Magpul, with 60 rounds of ammunition.
X1 Barrel wrench.
 
Priority will go to those with Concealed Carry Permits. Permit or no, a bill of sale will be signed, acknowledging that you are the purchaser of the firearm, legally allowed to own the rifle and do not plan to use it for illicit purposes.
Jump on this opportunity while you can. My loss will be your gain."

NIB Armscor M-16 Style .22lr Semi-automatic rifle with 10rd mag w/Lifetime Warranty. From the same manufacturer that brought us the Rock Island 1911. The M1600 is a .22 Long Rifle equipped with an 18.25 inch barrel and black finished wood stock and pistol grip. 39 inches overall length. The stock magazine is 10 rounds with an option to upgrade to a 15 round. The M1600 is outfitted with a post front sight and an open U-notch with elevation adjustments. Includes sling.  Very few in stock.  This is a cosmetic copy of the M16.  None of the parts are interchangable with a real M16.  They have been making pretty much this same gun for over 30 years. I actually own one of these from the 70's and it still works great (Bingham Squire was the name of the manufacter back then) It is very reliable and simple.  You can find 25 round mags on the internet.  The gun is perfect.  The streaks shown on the firearm are from the light coat of oil put on by the factory.  It wipes off.  Photos were literally taken right after the box was opened.  The rifle and magazine were in a plastic sealed bag.  I had to open it.  If you get the one that was used to take pictures then know that is why they were opened.  Here is a link to a video I put together on this rifle and the very similar Mak22.  I was having all types of problems with the camera, so please tolerate the amatuer nature of the video: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=rn8FqootQwI I sell new firearms with full manufacter's warranties for less then many dealers are asking for used guns.

I have fired approximately 400 rounds through this gun over the past 3 years and it has been very reliable and accurate. Though I do clean it regularly, it was designed to function in extreme conditions. It is a smaller gun which makes it perfect for conceal carry, and built like a tank with all steel construction. Ammo is very inexpensive, so doing a lot off shooting doesn't break the bank. It was issued to our Cold War counterparts, the Polish, as well as other armies and police forces around the world. I am selling this as a package deal. The prices are broken down for reference.

Franklin Armory's revolutionary Binary Firing System (BFS) is ideal for three gun competitors, tactical shooters, and recreational enthusiasts. It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe, Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode, or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode, the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger, whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound), the release phase now has a positive reset, and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification. The BFS works in every AR application: AR10, AR15, MPX, etc. Specifications Type: Trigger Model: Binary Firing System Dimensions: Gen 3 Size: AR Platform/22LR,9mm Upper/Franklin F17 Series Material: Metal Action: Semi-Automatic Trigger: 4.5 lb Safety: Three Position Finish: Black Manufacturer: FRANKLIN ARMORY Model: 5550 BINARY FIRING SYSTEM (BFS) Condition: NEW"

I have a Sig Max competition 1911 in .45. These are hand built/fitted from Sig's custom shop. The gun was then sent to Atlas Gunworks for action tune/trigger work (all internals replaced with EGW...series 70 conversion...tuned to perfection). Gun is in excellent condition (<500rds) and has the best competition trigger I’ve ever felt…1.5lbs and 1/32” movement from glass-rod break to crisp reset.(These come from the factory with a 5lb trigger with all kinds of extra movement...horrible). This 1911 is set up to shoot smooth, fast, and accurately. I’ve started reloading 9mm, and am narrowing my collection of handguns down to that caliber. Comes with 2 WC 8rd,and 2 Chip McCormick 10rd mags, 2 holsters, and everything from factory.

The Premier Series delivers just that. Think of our Premier Series Rifles as an extension to our Custom Series Rifles, but with standardized features for greater efficiencies in parts production and assembly – providing near custom-quality rifles at prices that are affordable to serious shooters. The Premier Series LRP rifle features a Bergara Branded aluminum chassis made in partnership XLR Industries.  This Chassis is CNC machined from solid 6061 T6 aluminum and features an AR15 style grip, adjustable length of pull, adjustable comb height, and the butt plate can be canted to give a precise fit to the shooter in virtually any shooting position. What makes this rifle so special you may ask?  Well, Bergara uses Premium 416 stainless steel barrels, which receive a proprietary honing process at our barrel-making facility, at which point they continue through another four stages of production to produce the most accurate production barrel we could possibly make.  Upon completion, the barrel receives a Cerakote™ finish and is coupled with the Bergara PREMIER action.  This process is completed at our facility in Lawrenceville, GA USA.  The Bergara LRP weighs around 10 pounds, comes with an AICS detachable five-round magazine, a Timney 517 flat trigger, as well as a Talley 20MOA rail. The LRP rifle also come standard with threaded muzzles (5/8x24).  Barrel lengths range from a 20” barrel on the .308, 24” on the 6.5 Creedmoor, and 26” on the 6mm Creedmoor. It has a guaranteed capability of producing sub-1.0 MOA or better groups at 100 yards with factory match grade ammunition.  Every Premier Series Rifle is qualified for accuracy prior to leaving our facility.  Each rifle must shoot three consecutive 3-shot groups, all sub-1.0 MOA to qualify.  Once completed, we included a copy of the target itself, as well as the information on the factory load used, the date, and the shooter who qualified this rifle.  All premier series rifles are capable of producing sub 1.0 MOA or less with quality factory match grade ammunition. The LRP rifle starts at $2000 • Weight: 10 lbs • Magazine: MAGPUL PMAG 5 7.62 AC AICS Style Detachable 5 Round (10 Round Optional) • Trigger: Timney® 517 Flat • Barrel Length: 20” in .308, 24” in 6.5C, 26” in 6MMC • Barrel Taper: # 5 • Action: Bergara Premier Short • Stock: XLR® Element • Rail Scope Mount: 20 MOA Picatinny CALIBER/TWIST: .308 WIN/1:10, 6.5 CREEDMOOR/1:8, 6MM CREEDMOOR/1:8"

Check with MPA for all the custom colors available. The overall premise of this rifle is a custom built, application specific rifle. Due to the significantly reduced weight of the chassis, and the accuracy capabilities, this rifle has tremendous long range hunting capabilities. The customer chooses his caliber and chamber, along with the length and contour of the barrel. These choices will be determined by the application for the rifle. If you plan on packing the rifle for extended ranges on foot, then a lighter contour would be appropriate. However, if plans include using a muzzle brake or suppressor, the muzzle diameter needs to be large enough to provide a shoulder for the “end of barrel” device to attach and locate. If you are focused more on velocity and extended thermal stability of the barrel, then a longer, heavier contour may be appropriate. Refer to the contour chart on the “Precision Rifle Barrels” page on our website. All chassis and barrels are cerakoted, and we provide a multitude of colors and patterns. Solid colors are included. Custom patterns have a +$150 upcharge. The length of pull and cheek riser position are adjustable and locked in position with a series of set screws that are embedded into the buttstock body. This is the same system we use on our standard BA chassis, but without the thumb wheels. The adjustable monopod can be added to this chassis, along with the bag rider plate. Trigger type and pull are also important considerations. We offer either the Rifle Basix L1 (1.5-4lbs) and the LV1 (8 oz to 2 lbs) as our standard triggers. Just pick the trigger pull you want. We also can provide the rifle with other aftermarket triggers. Timney, Jewel, Huber and others. Just let us know if you have a preference other than Rifle Basix. Triggers other than our standard will include an upcharge depending on the trigger. On caliber selection, if your choice is not shown above, contact MPA. If a chamber reamer is available, we can create the rifle. Twist rates depend on the caliber and projectile weight. The spigot mount is an accessory mentioned above is designed to be inserted in the front of the chassis to provide an extended distance between the front bipod and the rear support. Simply insert the spigot into the chassis and attach with (2) Flat Head Cap Screws. Then move the pic rail to the spigot."

Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game. Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it's not a descendant of anything. Available in .338 Lapua Magnum, .300 Win Mag, .308 Win, .260 Rem, 6.5 Creed and 7mm Rem Mag, this rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting. Its straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide. The Model 98B rifle's aluminum upper receiver boasts an M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions using KeyMod. From its shooter-adaptable design to its unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action."
