The MDE is extremely well made, and the fit and finish is right up there with Seecamp, in my opinion.  The felt recoil is really light compared to other pocket .380's, and it's extremely accurate for such a small pistol.  These were not mass produced like the LCP, TCP and others, and therefore are somewhat rare...those who own them seem to keep them.  Cash only please, show Missouri ID and sign my bill of sale.  Please feel free to email me with questions, or for additional images.  Thanks for looking."

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame and a polished and engraved stainless steel slide. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. Comes with original walnut grips, 1 6rd stainless magazine, case with lock, holster and chamber flag. Less than 50 rounds through it.

Barrel has been shortened to about 22.5 inches, stock cut down, bolt handle bent, and a black enamel type finish applied to most of the blued parts.Mechanically fine, feeds and cycles rounds alright, but I have never fired it.Stock has a pretty decent crack behind the receiver tang as pictured. There's also a chip off the top of the stock next to the bolt handle (also pictured) Would make a nice project, basically needs refinished and a stock repair (or new stock)Bore is dark, would probably benefit from a good cleaningI have another sporterized stock available that is a little longer than this one (still not full length), but not cracked and in decent shape that I'll include for another $40.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.  While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.Made in U.S.A.    FEATURES  Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction Modified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec platforms Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability Long life USGI-spec stainless steel spring Over-travel insertion stop on the spine Ribbed gripping surface and new aggressive front and rear texture for positive magazine handling Paint pen dot matrix panels on the bottom of the body to allow for identification marking Flared floorplate aids magazine handling and disassembly yet is slim enough for use with many double and triple pouches Pop-off Impact/Dust Cover to minimize debris intrusion and for ammunition protection in storage and transit      ITARInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations Controlled Product"

Springfield Armory® defends your legacy with world-class pistols and unapologetic commitment to self-defense There are some tools so basic, you can’t imagine being without them. But even essential tools can be refined and improved. That’s the principle behind the new XD-E™: the best elements of the world-renowned XD® Series, condensed into a weapon so intuitive, comfortable and accurate, you can’t imagine being without it. The hammer – the most important tool in the toolbox. The XD-E™ sculpts unmatched Point And Shoot® ergonomics into a sleek frame just an inch wide, for hand and holster fit so satisfying you’ll take it everywhere. The low-effort slide practically racks itself, so handling’s a pleasure. The exposed hammer clearly shows gun mode, and the single/double action trigger shows respect for your shooting style, unlike other compacts.  Then there’s the grip: GripZone® provides active texture that matches your grasp like a handshake, improves stability, and feels incredible. Three magazine options let you personalize concealability and capacity. Impeccable feel, weight and balance launch the XD-E™ from invisible to impactful in an instant, for go-anywhere confidence unlike any you’ve felt. New shooter or skilled gunner, wrap your mitt around the new XD-E™ and you’ll know. This is more than a hammer. It redefines what your hammer should be."

You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.

From Trijicon: Developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon, the Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is designed to be as durable as the legendary ACOG. The RM06 is an LED sight powered by a standard CR2032 battery. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the RMR is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. 
With eight available brightness settings, the reticle can be manually adjusted by pressing the plus or minus buttons on either side of the unit. To switch to auto adjust mode simply press both buttons simultaneously and release. To save battery life turn the optic off by pressing both buttons simultaneously and holding for 3 seconds.
The Trijicon RMR is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications."

Designed with a sense of duty and precision, and copiously tested to ensure accuracy, function, and the feel you should expect from a pistol bearing the Browning name. The 1911-22 A1 compact model is designed faithfully to look and feel like the original government model 1911-A1, in a compact package. Displayed images are of the actual pistol.

At the time, the 98/29 was among the world's most advanced infantry rifles, being modelled on the vz.24, itself a refinement of the timeless Gewehr 98 design. Only made for a brief period prior to the Second World War, these rifles were shipped to the Persian government and most of the examples encountered were imported in the 1970's. As such, non-import marked examples are considered rare, and this rifle, being unissued, matching and complete with bayonet and scabbard, would be a superb addition to the most advanced Mauser or military arms collection."

The tip of the RPK style barrel is vented to create functionality as if there was a muzzle break attached. A unique feature of this firearm is the removable trigger housing. Also, there is no scope rail attached to the side of the receiver. Instead, there is a rail system built into the receiver directly, just above the fire control group and below the top cover. A scope mount (not included) can be attached to this rail system.
Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with one 10-round magazine, a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit.

Featuring fine Walnut, a precision machined ordinance steel receiver and a hammer forged barrel, this magnificent BAR will make autoloading enthusiasts out of the most skeptical riflemen. Classic in looks and contemporary in performance. The BAR MK II Safari is the hunting rifle that sets the bar for every other autoloader on the planet with accuracy and speed -- and a caliber selection -- that is not matched by any other hunting semi-auto. The BOSS. Browning's Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System (BOSS) is a patented advancement in rifle accuracy. When any rifle is fired, the barrel goes through a series of vibrations as the bullet leaves the muzzle. The variations of these vibrations greatly affect the accuracy of the rifle. Controlling these vibrations will greatly control the accuracy of the rifle. Browning's BOSS allows you to control the vibrations of your barrel so you can shoot groups you didn't think possible. Adjusting your BOSS to these ""Sweet Spot"" settings allows you to find accuracy never achieved before by an out-of-the-box rifle."

At the time, the 98/29 was among the world's most advanced infantry rifles, being modelled on the vz.24, itself a refinement of the timeless Gewehr 98 design. Only made for a brief period prior to the Second World War, these rifles were shipped to the Persian government and most of the examples encountered were imported in the 1970's. As such, non-import marked examples are considered rare, and this rifle, being unissued, matching and complete with bayonet and scabbard, would be a superb addition to the most advanced Mauser or military arms collection."

Rifle shoots well and makes an impressive ""boom"" when fired.  I've fired this one with surplus ammo (always cleaned it properly when I was finished) and it was relatively accurate.3:  Persian 98/22 Mauser in 8mm Mauser caliber  - A true Persian Mauser with the Persian numerals on the front sight.  This is a standard long-action Mauser and a favorite for people who want to do conversions.  The stock is a gorgeous light walnut with some tiger striping in the buttstock area.  I have fired the rifle and it's accurate with standard ammunition.4:  Czech model 24/47 Mauser in 8mm Mauser caliber - A nice example with a rough, dark stock.  I think the stock would look really nice if sanded a bit and refinished, but I kept it in original condition.  I've fired this rifle also with standard ammo.  Includes a bayonet!I would like to sell all as a group, but if you would like a specific rifle please feel free to make me a reasonable offer.  I will not deliver the rifles"

This walther is the only striker fired pistol on the market with a decocker button. This works in conjunction with the anti-stress trigger to give you a couple different carrying options. You can load the chamber and decock the striker. This provides a long double action type first shot with a short reset and every follow up shot has a short pull like a single action trigger. Or, you can chamber a round and carry as is. This firearm does not have a safety mechanism (that's what your index finger is for) and it has a first generation/european style mag release that is located on the trigger guard (my favorite style). It is more ergonomic and prevents accidental mag drop in my opinion. My name is Joey, call or text 4zero5-99zero-85one4Please don't call or text before 8AM or after 7PM. Thank you for looking.

I do have the original box with the key inside and the little envelope with the first round fired. I also have the factory magazine and another one I bought for it. Lastly, I will include an iwb holster. Between the gun, holster, extra magazine I have over $400 in it. Personally, I think these guns are worth more as they have more features and are more reliable than many of the Sigs, s&w's, springfields, beretta's, etc I've owned over the years. In fact, I carry it every day, leaving my guns that cost twice as much at home. Yes, these are that dependable. Small and light, so easy to carry and conceal. Not asking for what I have in it back. I know they sell used for less. More interested in trading if I can find someone who has what I want and appreciates this gun for what it is."

Custom rifle accuracy right out of the box.     The classic Browning A-Bolt (often referred to as the A-Bolt II) delivers dependable, pinpoint accuracy that exceeds the stringent standards of the modern rifleman. The renowned A-Bolt has been produced in popular chamberings, materials and finishes to satisfy your needs in any hunting or shooting situation.     Limited Distribution     A-Bolt II rifles are often more specialized than in the past and most are available only in limited distribution at a limited number of dealers, in special models only. But the features that made it famous for decades are still there. Have a look at A-Bolt II rifles and see for yourself why the A-Bolt II continues to lead in versatility and performance. Nothing hits the mark like a Browning A-Bolt.   A very sophisticated bolt action.     With a short 60° lift, the bolt incorporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the full length of the bolt. When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt II feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.     Barrel     The barrel is free floating and glass bedded at the recoil lug and front of receiver to maintain the proper spacing around the barrel for consistent accuracy. The recessed muzzle crown helps protect the rifling. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity.     Trigger     A chrome-plated trigger sear provides cleaner, crisper trigger pull. Screw adjustable and pre-set at approximately 4 lbs.     Magazine     Hinged floorplate with detachable box magazine makes it simple and fast to load a spare magazine.     Magazine Capacity     For all A-Bolts except Micro Hunter — Magnum calibers, including WSM: Three in magazine, one in chamber. Standard calibers: Four in magazine, one in chamber. 223 Rem.: Five in magazine, one in chamber. For A-Bolt Micro Hunter only: Three in magazine, one in chamber.       Other Aspects of the A-Bolt II Rifle System     The BOSS® System     Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System. The tunable BOSS was available with some A-Bolt II models over the years. An interchangeable, non-ported BOSS-CR is included at no extra charge."
