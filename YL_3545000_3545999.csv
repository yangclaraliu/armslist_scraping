Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

From Beretta:

Right out of the box, the 1301 Tactical features an oversized charging handle, large textured bolt release and an oversized reversible safety button. This makes it easy to use under most weather or lighting conditions—your hands will always be able to positively and safely grip it and operate the controls. Also, the aggressive checkering on the fore-end and stock makes it easy to gain a secure grip even while wearing gloves. As far as sighting, the 1301 Tactical features a robust, protected ghost-ring system with an interchangeable front sight, giving the user the opportunity to adapt it to its intended use, whatever the conditions.


The integrated BLINK gas operating system, featuring a cross tube gas piston, allows the 1301 Tactical to cycle 36% faster than any other shotgun on the market. This also makes it ideal for three-gun tactical competitions: when shooting the 1301 Tactical, you will simply and objectively have an edge over your competitors"

Prices will go UP! UP! UP! on these classic collectables. NO MORE WILL BE AVAILABLE ONCE THESE ARE SOLD! VERY GOOD CONDITION WITH NO RUST & NO CRACKED GRIPS. AN ORIGINAL 1970s GERMAN 26.5mm FLARE GUN PISTOL. I offer a 100% reliability guarantee! *NO FFL LICENSE or PERMITS NEEDED TO BUY, OWN, SELL or TRADE THIS FLARE PISTOL. IT CAN LEGALLY FIRE SHOTGUN SHELL BUCKSHOT AMMO MAKING THIS A TRUE ""SHOTGUN"" PISTOL & SURVIVAL PISTOL TO TAKE CAMPING OR ON BOATING TRIPS. It's like having a single shot Taurus 'JUDGE' pistol that can also fire flares! A flare pistol is a very interesting device. Blue and orange smoke signal 26.5mm rounds are also available as seen in the new movie MAD MAX FURY ROAD. Any person can own and carry concealed a flare pistol without a permit in all the states of the U.S.A. because it is a signaling safety product. I have for sale is a German 26.5mm all-steel flare pistol. This pistol was made in Germany and was imported into the US in fairly-limited quantities in the early 2000s. Several retailers sold them inexpensively. However, today they are nearly impossible to find. In my opinion the German flare pistol is the highest quality, strongest and most interesting of all of these type pistols brought to the U.S.A. during the last 20 years. Many feel that the HK is a better pistol, however unlike the German flare pistol, the only steel part on the HK is the barrel, as the entire frame is plastic. The lighter HK also have a very strong recoil that is painful to fire with .45 caliber barrel inserts. This German flare pistol is in very good surplus condition and made of heavier steel. That's what keeps the recoil down. There is no license needed to buy or own this flare pistol! 26.5mm to .410/.45 Long Colt adapters allow 2.5"" & 3"" .410 shotgun ammo or .45LC ammo to be safely fired. There are also 9mm,.40 and .45acp adapters available. The 26.5mm to .22LR insert is for the most inexpensive use. The 26.5mm to 12 gauge adapter allows the less expensive 12-gauge flares to be fired. Optional front brass bead sight, green fiber light sight, and recoil pad are available at an extra cost. *Note: The insert adapters are not included with the sale of the flare pistol. I have photos of these adapters to show what the flare pistol is capable of firing. I sell this flare pistol with a FREE barrel insert. The other inserts are available from many different web sites. Fire Red Rain 26.5mm flares in this German flare pistol for this 2015 NEW YEARS EVE!"

Hey everyone a little about this gun.....

The infamous tec-9, ab-10 model. ""Ab-10"" stands for after ban, which this is the ""remodeled"" tec-9 that was released after the infamous federal weapons ban of 1994 (now defunct). The ONLY difference between this model and the original tec-9 is this one doesn't have the threaded barrel.... Which was useless anyways in my opinion. Other than that, it's the same exact pistol.

All I have is the pistol and the standard 10-round magazine. I don't have the box or the owners manual. Over time they were both misplaced due to the original owner keeping all  his firearms in a safe and didn't keep up with the contents. Rest assured, this gun is not stolen or ""dirty"" I have ran the numbers myself on FDLE and am willing to meet you at the local sheriffs dept to conduct a ballistics test to ensure the firearm wasn't used in any crime...
 The original owner is a retired sheriff deputy of the Palm beach county sheriffs dept and I myself am former military.

This pistol is chambered in 9mm. All in all its a fun pistol to shoot. A brand new firing pin AND new extractor was inserted in this gun 2 weeks ago so the infamous jamming issues related to this firearm are simply non-existent with this specific one. I'm firm on price,  it's a pretty good price for this gun. You can contact me ,  Justin, @ REDACTED or REDACTED"

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xdm-competition-series-9mm/#sthash.NZXANEL1.dpuf"

The 370 rounds have been stored well. It shoots great. Very accurate and powerful gun. A Real bushwhacker. Rounds give deeper penetration than a 357 Magnum. Penetrates some older model armored vests. I'm not sure if I have the cleaning rod. I always used a bore-snake, and religiously cleaned immediately after shooting. The ammo box isn't included.

These shotguns are a pair of 12 gauge rock island m5s made by armscor.  I bought this pair of consecutive serial number shotguns for my wife and myself as a his and hers pair.  They are both nickel plated and come with heat shields on the barrel.  After less than 20 shells through one shotgun, my wife decided the recoil was too much.  So I don't see any reason to keep this pair.  Like I said, one shotgun has about 20 rounds through it and the other shotgun has 0 rounds through it.  So one is brand new and the other is almost new.  One thing to note is that the shotgun that has been fired lost its bead sight off the front of the barrel.  I guess it wasn't properly tightened at the factory, so it will need to be replaced.

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $195 (Reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license.

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $195 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."

Works well, but I'm interested in trying something different. I'm interested in trading it for a different HD/Tactical style shotgun. Primarily looking for a Benelli Nova Tactical or a Winchester SXP Extreme Defender, but would consider other similar weapons. I already have a nice field gun so I am not interested in hunting shotguns.
Would consider less expensive model shotguns as well+cash, such as a base model Winchester SXP, any of the ASI shotguns on the market now, the IAC Hawk Remington 870 clones, and others.

While I'm primarily interested in another shotgun but I would also consider a mid or full sized 9mm of some sort or a .38 special snub revolver.  Not interested in rifles at this time.

I ended up getting an awesome Sig P226 .40 DAK that I really love. A few days ago, a second P226 .40 DAK fell in my lap from a trade. As I only need one, and can't really get the hang of the John Woo two-gun leap through the air sideways while shooting thing, I'd like to sell it or trade the second one for either a Ruger SR1911 or a Remington R1 Enhanced.

I am selling this Sig P226 w/rail with three preban magazines to whoever meets my asking price.  The pistol comes with original Sig plastic case, and I can include some ammo and a nice quality leather holster. This also comes with the rail light that came with it, very bright, slips on and off easily, great for a night stand or home defense pistol.  Very clean and appears to be well maintained. I fired 50 rounds through this one to verify functionality, and it was stellar.  Extremely accurate and rugged, like all Sigs.  

This is the DAK model, not often found in Massachusetts.  It has a consistent trigger pull, very nice and smooth.  I find the DAK version to be much easier to shoot than the traditional DA/SA model, as the trigger pull is the same every time.

Let me know if you have an interest in this. Thanks.

I am asking $600 for this with three preban magazines and a quality leather holster, case, and 50 rounds of Hollow Points to get you started.

I will not ship or sell the magazines separate thank you.
