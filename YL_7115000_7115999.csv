Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.

I bought this rifle less than a month ago and just took it apart today to clean and get ready to fire. Long story short I'm honestly too lazy to go through the cosmoline removal process which is why the rifle is already disassembled. I wiped off most of the exterior cosmoline but you would still need to do some extensive cosmoline removal from the rifle. The rifle is guaranteed to have EVERYTHING, it was only disassembled for cleaning (literally taken apart today 7/25 around 2am). This is for the rifle only, I don't have the ammo pouch, oil can, sling & cleaning kit. This rifle is in beautiful condition, I paid extra for the hand select so you won't be disappointed. The price is firm which is below what I paid for the hand select + shipping. Please contact me via email, I will respond asap.Thank you"

1,150 rounds (23 boxes of 50) of Sumbro sub machinegun 9x19 ammo.  Brass re-loadable cases.  Non-corrosive primers.  Full metal jacket, lead core, 115 grain bullets.   It was manufactured in Macedonia in 2013.  It is no longer imported into the US.
 
The average ArmsList price for 9mm ammo is $10 per box of 50, or 20 cents per round.
**I will sell the whole lot for 15 cents per round, or $172.50 for the 1150 rounds.  All or none. **
Transaction near Tuttle Crossing Mall, or at another location convenient to me.
 
This ammo is hotter (+P) than most standard 9mm Luger ammo.  By being sub gun ammo, the primers are harder to reduce the chance of an accidental discharge in full auto fire.  I bought the ammo to use in an UZI, which is no longer with me.  This type ammo works well with 9mm carbines, MACs, and weapons with hammers."

I have a Browning Hi-Power in .40S&W up for trade. Included are 4 mags (2 original, 2 mec-gar), self defense ammo, and approx 200 rnds of target ammo. Also included is a Ramlite magnetic laser/light combo for the Browning. I bought this with the Hogue grips already installed and never had the original factory grips. The ONLY interest I have is a 1911 in .45 ACP. Ideally, I would want to trade for two lower end 1911s (I also have an Eastfield 916 12 g pump and ammo I can add in) but will entertain all legitimate offers.
