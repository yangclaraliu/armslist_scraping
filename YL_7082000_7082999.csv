It has the correct USGI walnut stock with a clearly visible JLG cartouche and small ordnance wheel. I discovered a very light import mark on the underside of the receiver (“Lithgow SAC. CA”), and my guess is the rifle’s receiver was likely finished at some point in the past given the lack of wear. (Note: I’m not interested in any trades at this time, selling this to fund a vintage sniper rifle).

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

They also produced barrels after WWII.This is barrel is a blued WWII production barrel with the numbers and name on the top, the letter P on the side, and the flaming bomb on the bottom.The chamber is bright, so it has not been refinished.I believe this was one of the good ones.The throat/chamber measures out 2 of 10The muzzle measures 1.5 out of 3.The serial number dates this to 1953, and it may have been used late in the Korean war. Shipping will be $40. I am accepting only USPS Money order or bank certified check for this item. Feel free to ask questions, thanks for looking."

This thing is quite light almost to a fault, and being the Predator model it has the slightly thicker barrel with the threading on the end, and a picatiny rail section on the top. Stock has nice amount padding on the back too, so the .223 model is rather soft shooting. It's also stupidly accurate for a rifle at this price point, being sub-MOA with that 22in barrel that's free floated. It's even 1/8 twist, so it will shoot the heavier 62 and 69gr .223 bullets just fine. Trigger on the thing is unreal as well.My only problem is that the barrel is thin for the type of shooting I do, and I'd rather have a more dedicated precision rig. However, that tapered ""bull barrel"" and stock does make the rifle less than 7 pounds, so that's all an example of win some/ lose some. Not good for me, but for someone who appreciates a very light and accurate rifle that punches well above its price, it's great. Asking $325 for the rifle, but if you want the scope as well, then I'll throw that in for an extra $100. The scope is a Burris 2-7. Do need cash, so no trades."

It will come with everything it did as new, 20rd pmag and mbus. I may have the original box, if I can't find the box, I'll include a soft case of some sort.This is Colts best AR offering (in my opinion). The balance of the pencil barrel really shines here. I already have another 6720 that I'd never part with. This one, however just sits in the safe and needs a good home.I'm only looking to trade this one, not sell. In trade I'd be interested in the following:-9mm compact striker fired pistols plus cash-CZ P10c, Gen 4 G19 or Vickers G19, M&P 2.0 no safety-these are really the only models I'm currently interested in, you can try me with others, but I'll be very picky if you're not offering one of the above-in addition to a 9mm pistol in lieu of cash-a Ruger 10/22 Takedown, Mossberg 18.5"" 590a1, Trijicon RMR (gen 1 models are available at Cabelas for $349, so that'd be the value I attribute to one of these now) or a factory (must be FACTORY) Complete Aero Precision lowerSo to be clear, first and foremost, I'm looking for one of the striker fired 9mm pistols listed above plus cash or one of the add-ones detailed above. I'm not interested in one of the add-one plus cash etc. Looking to add to my pistol collection here.i have my NC CCW and will expect you to have one too or show me an original pistol permit to prove to me you can legally own a firearm in NC. You'll also need a valid NCDL. Yes, I'm aware that you do not need a CCW for a private rifle trade/sale in NC, but it is more so for my peace of mind. We also both get a bill of sale.ftf in Indian Trail onlypics coming up later today."

It does not have original diamond grips but are SMith grips. This gun was pulled down and inspected by a local world champion Revolver shooter and gunsmith and agrees never reblued and shows at a 90-95% gun. Looks like it was a safe queen more than anything. Local Gun shop also inspected and agreed never reblued. Very smooth action, i have never fired, took this in with another weapon and would rather see a serious SMith lover own this. It is the rarer 8 3/8"" barrel. Askin $750 firm which is actually in the middle of what these go for on early model builds and only gaining  value, i am not however a collector sometimes unique guns just end up in deals i find or make."

This Uzi comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. This firearm is made of an All-Metal design, and has only minor signs of wear/tear. This can be attributed to the fact that it was well taken care of, and only lightly used, despite having been previously owned. There are no major flaws/defects to be found, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. There are a couple of small, shallow nicks and cuts, but that is it! This Uzi comes with 4 Magazines, including 1 10-Round Magazine, and 3 20-Round Magazines. This Uzi also features a fold-out, all-metal stock, as well as a wooden stock that can be swapped in. This Uzi features a bolt on the top of the receiver, and is capable of firing .22LR, 9MM, and .45 ACP, though it does come with ONLY the .45 ACP barrel. This setup comes in a soft-shell zip-up carry case, and comes with the original owner's manual, as well as a Certificate of Authenticity from the manufacturer Vector Arms. Please see our listing images for the EXACT condition of this firearm, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

Will sell the complete rifle or piece out. If you purchase the entire rifle I'll throw in a $270 Plano case. Rifle has been fired approx. 500 times and extremely well cared for. It has been stored in a de-humified gun safe with the weight of the rifle on the butt and the bipod only, never on the barrel. The rifle was built by one of the best gunsmiths in the country, using the best parts money could buy. It produces incredible groups, and is more capable than the human behind the rifle. Total price: $5600. Over 7000 invested. I have all receipts and documentation. For more info on components used in this build, visit Precision Rifle Blog.com"
