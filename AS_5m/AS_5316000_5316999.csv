Its simple and robust design, accuracy and awesome reliability served the Soviets well as their main ­battle rifle of WWII. Under appreciated until recently, the Mosin Nagant is one of the hottest collec­tibles on the market today!

Other than the shell, she has been redone including the sights, the recoil spring, the barrel, the trigger, the beavertail, as well as the now full length guide rod. I put on an underrail to mount lasers and/or flashlights, of which I chose to purchase a brand new, green, Lasermax laser that ran me $195. It's significantly more to go with the green vs standard red, I found out. This pistol will also come with 2 extra sets of grips, an extra magazine, the original bushing tool and an aftermarket one I bought (that's much easier to use), close to 200 rounds of ammunition (of which hollowpoints are included in that), a conceal carry holster, and the original carrying case from Remington. I assure you that this pistol will excite you just as much as it has me. There are about 20 rounds that have been put thru the barrel and her condition is stunning. There isn't much more you could do to it and she's set up perfectly for reliability, as well as performance. I've got almost $1600 into this firearm, not including the ammo, bushing tool, and holster. I had no desire to sell. If it hadn't been for being diagnosed as terminal with my cancer, I would not be getting rid of her. Don't worry about doing anything thru a dealer for legality, just bring me cash and we're good. My asking price is $900. I want to ask for more, but I figured it would be hard to ask for that much, so yea. I'm pretty firm on the price just considering. I would consider partial trades, but nothing straight across because I need the money. My price will give you everything I listed and I live in Arvada. My name is Justin and my cell is REDACTED. If, for whatever reason, you can't text or call, my email is REDACTED. I need to sell asap. Thank you."

I am not interested in selling individually or trading individually so please do not ask. I have two wonderful pistols that I love but I am making an attempt to downsize the quantity for something pretty special. Very interested in an FN FiveseveN, custom shop 1911, or otherwise high end pistols only. If you have something you want to trade, just send me some information and pictures of what you have. I expect a fair trade for both of us so please don't lowball or you will be ignored. I cannot add any cash to a deal either. Just not in a position to do so right now. Now some info on my pistols.HK USP Compact .45acpGun was manufactured in 2004 and it is in very good shape. Some slight wear on the slide finish but no damage to the metal (pitting, gouges, etc.) It comes with tritium night sights which illuminate very well. This pistol shoots phenomenally and is equipped with the LEM trigger. It is set up as a DAO without safety or decocker. It is extremely accurate, smooth, and reliable. Bore is  very good and everything functions perfectly. Comes with 1 magazine (8 rounds), box, paperwork, lock, and potentially some ammo depending on the trade.Sig Sauer P320 .40S&WThis gun is in almost brand new condition. Only had a handful of rounds through it. The slide is the bronze/fde finish with black hardware. It comes with a FDE medium compact frame as well as a black small compact frame. The night sights are very bright green and it is smooth as butter. Comes with 2 magazines (12 round), case, all paperwork, lock, the whole 9 yards. These pistols are a modular platform where you can change everything including the caliber with only a few purchased parts. If you're unfamiliar with the P320, do some research. Amazingly comfortable, reliable, attractive firearm.I am only wanting to make a deal to trade both of these guns for: a single handgun, handgun plus rifle, handgun plus cash, or a rifle plus cash. I would love to get my hands on an FN FiveseveN. I am also open to offers for a high end 1911, large caliber semi auto (Coonan, Desert Eagle, etc) or other similarly valued pistol. I am open to offers for a pistol plus negotiable cash amount. I will consider all handguns, but I am very picky about revolvers. Not looking to trade for only a rifle (perhaps a rifle pistol combo would work though). Let me know what kind of deal you would want to work out. Worst I can say is no thank you. If you send me an offer, please include details of the trade as well as pictures. I would be happy to send detailed pictures upon request of either or both of mine. I am located south of Indianapolis but I will drive within reason to meet up. By contacting me, you agree that you are legally able to own these firearms and that you are an Indiana resident. We must meet in a public setting and provide a photo identification, for both of our safety. All other details can be discussed privately. Any trade offer must also be legal for me to own as well. Thank you very much for looking."

After the war ended the AH Empire broke up, and newly-independent Finland bought up all the Mosins they could to arm themselves, building an M39 from this receiver.Stamped matching receiver, barrel, and floor plate, the buttplate and bolt are not numbered, and the hex receiver's Imperial Eagle has been scrubbed.  A classic Improvement on the Soviet Mosin Nagant, the M39 was one of Finland's mainstay weapons during the Winter and Continuation Wars of World War 2.Chambered in 72x54r, this was made in Riihimaki at SAKO, Suojeluskuntain Ase-ja Konepaja Osakeyhtio (Firearms and Machine Workshop of the Civil Guard).Hey forget about getting Sako's TRG M10, this is much better.The rifle comes with the original sling and cleaning rod.The bore shows use, but still has decent rifling. There is perhaps 60% bluing remaining on the barrel, buttstock, magazine, and little if any left on the well-used receiver.This Sako has its original wartime finger-groove jointed stock, marked with SAKO's gear wheel logo.  The stock shows use but is in good solid condition, and the bore shows some use but still has good rifling.The  picture shows the buttstock's Sako gearwheel cartouche, as well as the stock maker's crossed cannon cartouche with ""S"", standing for the subcontractor Sakara Oy.There is a tiny Century arms import mark behind the front sight.For local FTF FFL PPT sale in the South Bay LA area, all laws apply, contact me if you want to check it out, thanks for looking."
