It is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Influenced by HK engineers' experience with the P30 pistol, the VP Series breaks ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK ""light pull"" trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in a production striker fired handgun. The VP trigger has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. With the VP, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP40 uses HK's ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six grip side panels, accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol's grip also instinctively position an operator's hand for optimal shooting. An extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail is molded into the polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces (160 grams). All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. VP pistols feature HK's patented charging supports - simple components mounted on each side of the rear of the slide to provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VP pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring to help reduce the recoil forces, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK's famous cold hammer forged barrel, made from cannon grade steel, also ensures long service life. The polygonal bore profile contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK's hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP40 pistols use proven HK P30 steel magazines; this model comes with three 13-round capacity magazines and night sights.

For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail.

Made 2009 according to ""AK"" date code on slide. Police surplus, formerly property of the New Smyrna Beach Police Department, and appropriately marked in unobtrusive lettering along the slide. I discussed the history of this gun by e-mail with a firearms quartermaster of that department and he told me that their PD replaced the S&W 4506 with these H&Ks and then the H&K with the Glock 35 .40 caliber -- seems to me a step down in terms of firepower but I didn't say so. As you can hopefully see by the pictures, this is one of the least used pieces of police surplus I've seen. I suspect it was probably issued to someone with a desk job who didn't feel the need to slip it into or out of a holster very often and also didn't spend much time at the range, or maybe it was just issued to an officer who took special care of his weapon.The USP comes in several different trigger styles. This is the default Type 1 style with a traditional DA/SA trigger and safety that can allow you to carry decocked with the safety on, decocked with the safety off, or cocked and locked in the style of a 1911, while also functioning as a decocker when pressed fully downward.Comes with original box, three magazines, and factory night sights that still work, though I don't know how many years they have left in them. It's seven years old, so I suspect if you can find out how long these sights are meant to last you can get a pretty good idea. I will also include a Streamlight TLR-4 with an adapter to fit the proprietary H&K rail. A pretty solid value all in all, I think."

I paid $328 plus $20 for the sling. These are now out of stock and impossible to find at any retailer. I have not shot this rifle and it still has a small amount of cosmoline preservative grease on the bolt. I invested money into another rifle and need to free up some funds, my loss your gain.
