X -Caliber® is designed for use in any condition and with any ammunition available.Originally designed with two calibers, a rifled .22 LR and a smooth bore .12 GA -, this rifle can fire up to 12 different calibers thanks to the 8 steel adapters supplied. In addition to the two original gauges, adapters allow you to shoot 8 pistol calibers ( .380 , 9 mm , .357Mag/.38SP , .40 S & W, .44 Mag, .45 ACP , .410/.45colt ) and two shotgun calibers (410 ga, 20ga), combining the flexibility of a shotgun and the power of a rifled gun. The choice of materials is the winning factor of X -Caliber ®: the whole structure is made of steel, but the weight of the stock has been almost eliminated. A metal caging encases a preformed polypropylene foam stock, with a very durable and thick weft, ensuring excellent comfort.Polypropylene (PP) is a thermoplastic polymer used in a wide variety of applications including automotive and furniture, abd is unusually resistant to mechanical stress and to surface wear.By simply pressing a lever , the rifle can be bent in two, reaching a total length of 18.5 "" - that is, the length of the barrel - to be easily carried in a backpack.All the details are studied to obtain maximum flexibility and practicality. The stock is ergonomic and has a housing for ammunition and the maintenance/cleaning kit. The front sight is optical fiber and the rear sight is adjustable in elevation and windage to fit the gauge used. The gun is supplied with three picatinny quad rails which allow you to mount your favourite accessories.X -Caliber ® is a lightweight and robust weapon, which marks a step forward in the concept of survival rifles."

The gun features steel sights and a grip safety like a 1911.This is a previously owned, gently used and well cared for firearm. It comes in the original hard shell case with all accessories intact including owners manual, two magazines, a paddle holster, paddle dual mag pouch, speed loader and interchangeable backstraps in three sizes. I'll also throw in an Alien Gear IWB holster for free. I bought it used, so I have no idea on round count through it (I have put only a hundred or so down range with it), but I can assure you the gun looks and works almost like new! The frame is OD (green) and I have added a Hogue Handall overgrip which gives a nice, no-slip feel to the grip (it can be easily removed in minutes if you prefer the factory grip). This gun sells for between $600 and $700 new. Here is the description from the Springfield Armory website:The XD(M)® offers the best ergonomic experience possible in a polymer platform. With multiple interchangeable back straps, the XD(M)® can be perfectly tailored to fit your hand. As it shares the same perfect grip angle as the standard XD® and the 1911, the XD(M)® points effortlessly and naturally. Aggressive mega-lock frame texturing and major grasp slide serrations keep the XD(M)® in your hand and operational under any conditions. The slide and frame feature aesthetically pleasing contours that make it a more concealable pistol.The features available on the XD(M)® will impress even the most demanding shooters. The XD(M)® includes a basic list of safety features shared with its predecessor the XD®. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback to know if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind.The list of features doesn’t stop there, though. The XD(M)® comes with interchangeable mold-tru back straps, meaning it can be customized to fit your hand. Have a light or laser that you want to mount on your pistol? The XD(M)® comes standard with an accessory rail that has multiple slots for maximum flexibility – even on the compact models. The maximum reach ambidextrous magazine release gives fast reloading access to shooters with any size hands. The low profile combat sights give a clear sight picture. Longevity and reliability are ensured by the fully supported ramped match-grade barrel and rugged Melonite® or stainless steel finish. The Megazines® included with your XD(M)® will ensure you have plenty of ammo available for whatever the job is at hand. And when it’s time to clean your XD(M)®, it can be field stripped without pulling the trigger."

The pistol is in 9mm luger, looks and functions like new. Great bore, tight action functions perfectly. Just had it to the range three weeks ago. It comes with bright ghost ring sights. If you meet my price I'll throw in a box of PMC FMJ with the pistol and holster. Hi Points, love em' or hate em' seems to be the way it is. Truth is I've owned em' for years and I've found them to be rock solid, reliable and accurate. Inexpensive but not cheap. Lifetime warranty no matter if you are the 2nd owner or the 22nd. All you pay is shipping if you break it. Anyway, I'm asking $175 for the pistol and holster with a box of PMC.

The P1812 FW rail system was designed to punch way above its weight. The triangular profile offers the best possible handling ergonomics while still maximizing weight savings. Unlike many other ultralight rail systems on the market, the oversize cutouts and keymod mounting system allows for a wider cross section profile, thus ensuring a more positive grip when firing. With a solid lower half and heat-dissipating CNC cutouts on the top, you can rest assured the FW rail can handle anything you throw at it."

The next-generation PMAG 40 GEN M3 is a 40-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.  While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.  The PMAG 40 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.  In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.  Made in U.S.A.   FEATURES  Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction Modified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec platforms Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability Long life stainless steel spring Over-travel insertion stop on the spine Ribbed gripping surface and new aggressive front and rear texture for positive magazine handling Paint pen dot matrix panels on the bottom of the body to allow for identification marking"

The C-A1 is somewhat of a hybrid, combining the compact length of the Steyr S-A1 pistol with the full-size grip of the Steyr M-A1 pistol. The barrel of the C-A1 is 3.6” (91mm) long and provides a platform that is ideal for self-defense carry by offering a short overall weapon length while ensuring optimal grip control. An integrated Picatinny rail allows for simple mounting of a laser or light and slide-racking grooves on the back of the slide allow for a firm grip when manually operating the action.  - See more at: https://steyrarms.com/firearms/pistols/c-a1-pistol.html#sthash.tfgmpxsz.dpuf"

A durable synthetic stock resists weather and rough use and features removable spacers in the butt of the stock to adjust length of pull. The Pro Hunter’s barrel is available in a 23.6” or 20” barrel Stainless Steel version or Mountain version with 20” barrel. The rifle is chambered in a choice of 7mm-08 Remington, .308 Winchester, .270 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield, .300 Winchester Magnum (available only in a 25.6” barrel variant). As in other high-performance long-guns offered by Steyr, the Mannlicher Pro Hunter features the Safe Bolt System (SBS), a unique 2+1 safety function that offers 3 settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The fire mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot; the first level of safe mode disables the firing mechanism and the second level of safe serves to lock the bolt down against the stock and also features a press-to-release tab that locks the SBS switch in the safe position. Another feature is the 2-stage magazine securing mechanism that uses a first stage that locks the magazine in but allows the bolt to be operated while not engaging and chambering the rounds in the magazine, thereby providing the operator with the option of loading individual rounds by hand while maintaining a full magazine at the ready. One more tap to the bottom of the magazine then seats it in the second stage, which is ready for auto-loading. - See more at: https://steyrarms.com/firearms/hunting-rifles/mannlicher-pro-hunter.html#sthash.9ufcgNGb.dpufSorry, not interested in trades for this fine rifle.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net"

The Steyr Scout provides the ideal solution for versatility, durability, accuracy and reliability in a compact and lightweight bolt-action rifle platform. Developed in a nearly decade-long collaboration with legendary Marine Corps Lt.Col. Jeff Cooper, the Scout boasts an extensive list of innovative features. The lightweight bolt-action, all-purpose Steyr Scout rifle was designed to accept a low-powered, forward-mounted scope for accurate fire and both-eyes-open operation to detect flanking dangers. Backup “ghost-ring” iron sights integrated to the top rail can be deployed within seconds should the optics fail. The rifle can also be fitted with a standard scope, should the need arise. In keeping with Cooper’s requirement for a magazine cutoff, Steyr incorporated a two-position magazine system that allowed the rifle to be fed individually with the five-round magazine in a lowered position. The magazine could be seated one step further with minimal pressure, allowing the bolt to feed cartridges directly from the magazine. A second five-round backup magazine is contained in the buttstock in case of an urgent need to reload. With a fluted, cold-hammer-forged barrel measuring 19 inches, an overall length of 38.6 inches and an out-of-the-box weight of just 6.6 pounds, the Scout is a breeze to pack out on long adventures, patrolling the farm or taking a quick trip to the range. The compact design of the stock features an innovative integrated bipod that is hardly noticeable until it is folded out from the stock. Between the bipod legs is a UIT rail for attachments, and the stock is outfitted with five press-and-twist sling-swivel attachment points that allow the addition of Cooper’s favored Ching Sling on either side of the rifle. The Steyr Scout is built on the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action with a unique 2+1 safety function that offers three settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The FIRE mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot, and the first level of SAFE mode disables the firing mechanism while allowing the bolt to be cycled. The second SAFE position locks the bolt, at which point the bolt can be pushed down against the stock, locking the firing pin and firing mechanism out of firing position, allowing safe transportation with a round in the chamber. Simply pressing the safety’s release tab and rolling it forward returns the bolt to either the SAFE or the FIRE position. The Steyr Scout is available in a choice of Black, Grey, Mud and Green, and it is available chambered in .223 Remington, .243 Winchester, 7mm-08 Remington and .308 Winchester calibers. Two 5-round magazines are included, and a high-capacity conversion kit and hi-capacity magazines are available to increase the load-out to 10 rounds. The unique features make the Scout a self-contained platform that can easily be carried in a rifle scabbard without any need for attaching/detaching a bipod or finding extra pockets for a spare magazine, perfect for use on horseback, ATV or on a vehicle rifle rack. - See more at: https://steyrarms.com/firearms/hunting-rifles/steyr-scout.html#sthash.44exjJZT.dpuf    Model: Scout  Purpose: All-purpose rifle  Manufacturer: Steyr Mannlicher GmbH, Kleinraming, Austria  Importer: Steyr Arms, Inc., Bessemer, AL  Operation: Bolt-action repeating rifle  Caliber: .223 Remmington, 243 Winchester, 7mm-08 Remmington, .308 Winchester  Action material: 25CrMo4 steel  Magazine type/capacity: Polymer double-stack detachable box/5 rounds (10-round kit optional)  Barrel: 19-inch, fluted, cold-hammer forged  Rifling: Four-groove, 1:10 RH twist (.308)  Sights: Flip-up iron sights; integral top rail  Finish: Mannox®  Safety: 3+1 position safety  Trigger type: Single-stage adjustable  Pull weight: 4 pounds, 8 ounces  Stock material/type: Black, Gray, OD Green or MUD Polymer with integrated bipod & UIT rail  Recoil pad: Elastomer with spacers to adjust length of pull  Sling swivels Five removable push-and-turn-style positions available  Checkering: None  Weight, empty: 6.6 pounds  Overall length: 39.4 inchesSorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Oklahoma residents pay sales tax.  free shipping!Buy this rifle online at www.copsgunshop.net."

Was purchased new, less than 100 rounds thru, cleaned, & safe kept. Comes with Ed Brown soft carry case, gun rub, takedown tool, & all paperwork. Can ship w/USPS money order or PayPal, or can meet buyer w/cash payment w/in reasonable distance from Christiansburg, VA. If you do not have a CCP or are not active military or LEO, we will have to meet at an agreed upon FFL for face to face purchase. Details from Ed Brown site on Kobra Carry: The Kobra Carry, it's the solution for those who prefer a smaller model 1911, but insist on complete reliability. The slide has been reduced to the minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. The frame has been modified with the innovative Ed Brown Bobtail® housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. The Bobtail® minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability. These problems are eliminated with the Ed Brown Commander Bobtail® configuration, which reflects the genius of John Browning with an innovative modern flair. The functional simplicity has yet to be matched. Unique with the Kobra series pistols is the innovative snakeskin treatment. It is a directional pattern, meaning it is smooth to slide your hand up, but bites in for a snug grip the other way where you need it. It's easier on the hands than checkering, and our female customers in particular can't stop bragging about it. Not to mention it just looks cool! The Kobra Carry is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different. We are sure you'll be charmed by the Kobra Carry!"

LaserMax is the only maker of an internal guide rod laser. Our patented design has been proven in over 20 years of street and combat experience by SWAT, special forces, federal agencies, presidential security services, and many other armed professionals. It’s the most technologically advanced, hardened laser system you can buy. period. The LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight installs as close to the barrel of the firearm as possible. This ideal positioning ensures the closest, most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Your LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight comes permanently aligned from our factory for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. And there is no need to re-zero it after changing batteries. Because the LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight fits wholly inside the firearm—just replacing the gun’s standard guide rod—it’s as tough and durable as the gun itself. The LaserMax beam pulsates for increased visibility for both the shooter and the threat. Even in peripheral vision, you’ll always know where your gun is pointed. With the Guide Rod Laser sight, it’s your call if the beam is “on” or “off”—a must in situations when you don’t want to reveal your position. A convenient “on-off” switch is easily activated by right-handed or left-handed shooters, without altering the grip. With the Guide Rod Laser, the activation switch is exactly where your index finger should be for safe operation, without interfering with laser beam. You won’t have to visit a gunsmith to install the Guide Rod Laser. You just field-strip your gun as you normally would for cleaning. Then replace the factory guide rod and take down lever with our Guide Rod Laser sighting system. It’s that quick and easy.If any firearm has been ported, fluted or compensated either by the original manufacturer or by a gunsmith, LaserMax will NOT guarantee alignment.This goes for between 250.00 and 300.00.  I am looking for offers of cash or firearms trade, so feel free to throw out your best reasonable offer.Thanks"
