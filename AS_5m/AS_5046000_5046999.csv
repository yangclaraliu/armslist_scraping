Details
Action: Single Action, Double Action Semi-Automatic • Finish: Matte Black • Barrel: 3.2"" • Sights: Fixed front, Adjustable Rear • Magazine(s): 2 - 12rd • Grips: Polymer • Weight: 22 oz. • Overall Length: 6.24"" • MSRP: $301.52 With its lightweight 22 oz. polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, the newly designed Millennium G2 is the ideal concealed carry handgun. The Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment. Taurus Security System (TSS)s Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Loaded Chamber Indicator Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms."

Has all new belts, alternator, radiator, timing belt, tie rod ends, upper control arms, lower control arm ball joints, thermostat, fan switch, plugs, distributer, i replace one headlight and corner light. I was originally going to do a full rebuild but ended up buying my wife a new car instead. This van needs cosmetics as the previous owner did not take care of it. Would make a great work van. Has no radio but does have 4 tv headrest i installed for my kids. I purchased the van for 1,000 and invested nearly another 3 grand into it so I dont want to sell for a huge loss as i'd probably only get less than 2,000 for it."

It is do to my life style. Yes I made a mistake. I will not let her go to a bad home, puppy mill or anywhere I feel is worst than she has it now. We give he all our attention when we are with her, and unfortunately, we have had very little time to spend with her. We love her and that's why we are trying to find her a new loving home. I have all the paperwork, except for the AKC Breeding rights paperwork. I am taking a loss, but I would like to recover some of my expense, and there will be a $1000 re-homing fee, or $1400 in trade. If you would like the breeding rights it will cost you an extra $500 and should be able to get the same day or following. The lady I bought her from lives on the south side of South Bend and has them in her possession, and that's who you will pay the $500. I have no plans on breeding her so I did not pay for them. Our dog loves to play and is close to being house broken. I don't need help re-homing her, and yes it sounds to good to be true. This is a bit tough on me so please don't waste my time. This is not a scam, if you don't have the money, or trade listed, please don't waste my time I can be reached at 574-606-6969 call or text. I have a few more pictures if you would like to see. Thanks and have a good day$1400 in Trades- Newer CRF 80, or Kawasaki 110, high end firearms, or $500 and a high end fire arm. No junk, and if I get a bad feeling about you or your household, I will not re-home her with you."

This is the model that only has the bird cage slots on the top and sides for good help with muzzle rise and still good at flash hiding. It is for 7.62x39, 7.62x51 NATO and 308 on barrels with a 5/8""x24 thread, this will not work on a 5.56 223 AR 15 rifle but will work on a AR47 which is an AR15 but in the 7.62x39 instead of 5.56 or 223. I am only asking 15 bucks for this which should be a good savings if you need one, thanks for looking, glenn.   PS: The add says no shipping but for someone that's is to far away from here I will ship this for $3.00 within the continental U.S. with standard USPS shipping."
