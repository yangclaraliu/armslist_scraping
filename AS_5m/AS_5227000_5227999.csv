Forward-ejecting allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. The stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup developed because the breech is separated from the shooter's face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. The barrel has a chrome-lined bore and chamber, threaded muzzle (5/8x24 TPI), and comes equipped with Keltec's A2-style Flash Hider. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20-round magazine is included, and the RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference."

Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use.  Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering."

It consists of a Polymer frame, zinc-alloy slide and bolt (with steel reinforcing inserts), and a steel breech, chamber and barrel. Its low price and small and compact design prompted many to purchase it for Concealed Carry. Some decline to carry the C9 in Condition One (""cocked and locked"" - generally considered to be the preferable condition for defensive carry) because of the striker fired design which lacks a firing pin block. Hi-point's handguns use a blowback design similar to that used in the Walther PPK and Russian Makarov PM. In blowback weapons the mass of the slide and bolt absorbs the rearward force generated by the propulsion of the bullet. As the pressure drops to a safe level, the slide moves back, (along with the bolt), an extractor hooks the empty casing and pulls it out of the chamber, after which the case is ejected from the weapon by the ejector. When the slide has completed its rearward travel, the recoil spring moves the slide forward, chambering another round. Many, if not most, modern handguns use a locked-breech design and therefore do not require the amount of slide mass that the blowback design requires in order to remain comfortable to shoot, safe to fire, and easy to control during the firing process."

Metal parts on each gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature. The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition. Customize your grip with two interchangeable backstraps. Includes rugged carry case, paddle holster, two interchangeable backstraps, two magazines, cable lock, bore brush and safety manual.The Original Lincoln Pawn & Jewelry of Spring Lake Park8480 Central Ave NESpring Lake Park, MN 55432www.LincolnPawnShop.com"

I recently  ran two hundred rounds without a hiccup, took the rifle apart and gave it some oil. Ready to take to the range and have some fun or keep as home defense.  This sks is mostly number matching, but not all do. A majority of the rifle has slight surface rust and some minor pitting, definitely NOT A BEAUTY QUEEN  but not junk either. The rifle will come as pictured with the stock 10 round fixed magazine, but this rifle has already been dremmeled to accept the 20 and 30 round magazines. Has extra rail space for more attachments if desired. Will include the sight and hand stop in the purchase sorry but I do not have the original stock. Can get more pics on request!!!
