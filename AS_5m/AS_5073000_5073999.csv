Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user."

I'm asking $450 (negotiable) or trade, but I don't have a specific firearm in mind for trade unless you've got a Beretta 92FS. I like this gun, but it serves no practical use for me. I found an XDS for my EDC, so this has just been sitting in the safe. I have less than 200 rounds through it, and I cleaned it after EVERY range trip. It's still in great condition.
The Springfield comes with:-Owner's manual-All factory accessories:--Speed loader--Holster--Dual magazine holster--13 round standard magazine--16 round extended magazine (available as parts kit, in accordance with all local laws).

I can get a U.S. built Uzi for a couple hundred cheaper!""Well ladies and gents, that is true. You can settle for a U.S. built Uzi that will be a couple hundred bucks cheaper, but it won't be the real deal. This Model B Uzi is for those that have taste and want the real thing. A Vector built Uzi isn't bad either, but it is still an American built clone of the real deal. A century UC-9 will be hit or miss. So yes, this one is a bit pricier than other U.S. parts built Uzis. Let's be real for a second though. If you have the fun-money to shell out 1100-1200 for a vector Uzi, then you're not in any kind of dire circumstances and can most definitely afford another hundred or two for the highest quality.The Uzi is in great condition with no heavy wear that I can see. Only notable defects is a small amount of paint chip wear on the left rear sight leaf, and a tiny scratch (a hair bigger than the circumference of a pen tip). The Uzi will include a hard case, sling, gun, full length barrel and thirty-two round magazine. Fake short barrel is not being offered at the time.Contact me at REDACTEDOpen to trades.

Bad-ass looking rifle! To clarify, this is not one of century's shoddy Wasr 10 builds. These are built to much higher standard than before. The barrel is non-chrome lined. Parts are non-matching (as are many of their factory built rifles). This thing not only looks good, but is affordable enough to make this your go-to shooter AK. There is a slight wobble in the stock when locked in both positions, but it still locks in solidly. There is a selector marking from rotating the selector lever. Round count is unknown. Because these are built from used parts kits, it is hard to determine wear based on the condition of the parts. The parts LOOK new (some paint wear on the bolt carrier), and the internals do not have any corrosion or carbon on them that I can see. Rifle will include one Tapco magazine (I have more I can sell), sling, and soft case. Yes, I am open to trades.

Used in very good condition, no longer imported or manufactured. These are becoming more rare and coveted by the day.
The H&K 91/93 or G3 is part of an integrated weapon system of true interchangeable parts for a multitude of theaters, environments and platforms. It is designed for reliability, accuracy and
ultimate durability. They are well known for being able to cycle half a million rounds with no repairs, only cleaning. This rifle is an absolute dream to own and fire. For the serious firearms user, it is the apex predator and sets the standard in the industry that all others attempt (and fail miserably) to follow. There is a reason every law enforcement community in the world (Starting with the USA) relies very heavily on H&K. There is no comparison. They are the best for a reason. If you demand the very best, look no further. Don’t take my word for it, read the history of where, how and why this weapon is chosen to serve its purpose. The record speaks for itself.
Included in the price:
H&K scope mount (removable) $400 new
Leupold 3-9x40mm $200 new
2 bipods $100 each new

This very early Glock has a ""pencil"" barrel profile, and a black base rear sight [instead of the later mandated 'weekender' rear sight]. This pistol has been fired, but does not show any unusual wear. Somewhat rare for a Glock of this manufacture date it retains all of its original black internals, and the notorious six part upgrade has not been performed. This configuration is exactly how the Glock 17 passed its legendary reliability tests in Austria. A total of 8 magazines are included: four Magpul magazines, and four pre-ban u-notch magazines [two of which wear factory +2 extensions]. Included but not pictured are the original Tupperware box and manual, a Glock soft pistol case, a factory extended slide stop for 2 pin Glocks, and a Vickers magazine release. This pistol has been re-sprung throughout with ISMI springs, but the original springs are included as well. Asking $800 or best reasonable offer. No trades at this time please. If you would like more pictures please let me know."

Krytac is all original, comes with original box and a lancer tac illuminated mil dot scope with laser. Love the Krytac just wish I would have purchased a sniper rifle. Would prefer the sniper rifle be gas powered and have a scope. Almost forgot to add in the trade value. For Krytac SPR, 300 round Krytac high cap, 4 KWA mid caps and Lancer Illuminated mil dot it would be valued at $500. Thanks guys for viewing!"

A top choice of law enforcement agencies across the country, the Gold Dot uses a patented process that forms the hollow point cavity in two stages. The core is pre-fluted to define the ""fault"" lines of expansion, controlling final diameter and retained weight. The second process finishes the cavity and controls the rate of expansion. Select, clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non-corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, as well as nickel plated brass cases for smooth feeding and durability. These technical features allow Speer's engineers to fine tune each specific caliber and bullet weight for maximum field performance.     Email, Call or Text REDACTED                                                                                                                              https://youtu.be/s8dezgRVqs0"
