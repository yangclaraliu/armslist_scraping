I need to pick up a replacement screw for that, and may do so one day this week while I'm out.  This model has the ""loaded"" Springfield model type trigger and hammer.  Pistol shoots really well, feed ramp has been lightly polished.  I've got several 1911's and bought another full size last year, so I figure something should go as I've gotten into Smith & Wesson older revolvers here lately.  They only made a short run of the double stack frames in these... don't think there is even one on gunbroker right now.  My cousin saw mine and had to have one of his own but in stainless... his Ultra Compact double stack cost him $1k in stainless last year he told me last night, and it was certainly no safe queen.  Asking $600 trade value or would go $550 cash for this one in the parkerized finish.  All laws apply, CCP or PPP required for purchase."

It's been my primary hunting rifle for about 2 years and it's been shot around 60-80 times. It's extremely acurate and has a great recoil absorbing system so it hardly kicks. A scope doesnt come with the rifle but the mount and rings do along with RCBS 300 WSM dies and a Hornady AP shell plate and about 30 rounds off ammo.

My P380 will come with talon grips, box, paperwork, 1-6rd magazine and either another 6rd / 7rd or 8rd magazine your choice. In my honest opinion this is the finest pocket 380 on the market that has no thumb safety. The size is neck and neck with the Ruger LCP but has a great trigger and actually dove tail sights. Only reason that I am trading it is due to me walking into another P380 with night sights and would like trade it to fill another role. I am looking to trade for one of the following, depending on trade offer cash may be expected or given.

The reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semiauto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies.Superior ReliabilityThe 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.Match-Grade Accuracy out of the BoxRegardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class.Packed with Useful Tactical FeaturesThis pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the 92FS the choice of military and police professionals all over the world, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection."

I originally used an optic, but later had Willams Aperture Sights installed by a professional gunsmith. The rifle has been used in this configuration ever since. Accuracy on man sized targets out to 300 yards is no problem with the peep sights. I also had the bolt bent and the wing-style safety changed to a Beauler-style low mount scope safety. Also performed by professional gunsmith.

This greatly restricted its civilian use.  If you had one, you  were likely to be able to keep it buit asll future sales stopped.  Later, RAMO Defence Co. began to assemble USAS-12 shotguns from Korean and U.S.-made parts left over for sale on domestic market, but those sales  were limited to government  only.  This is one of the originals.For TV buffs - used in the TV series ""Stargate SG-1"" several episodes when shooting up the REPLICATORS ( metal spiders)  Apon payment, shotgun wil be shipped to your authorized dealer until paperwork is complete.  If you want ME to hold it until your paperwork is complete, there will be a 5% non-refundable deposit required.  So make sure you are able to purchase.emails without a phone number will not be answered"

My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $225 for a trust. This includes an initial phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Texas, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Arkansas and Florida and can assist with trusts in those states as well. My primary office is in Tampa, FL; but I have handled multiple trusts for out of state clients. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at lonestarguntrust@gmail.com to inquire about my services."

Rare early 5 digit serial number manufactured in 1964. Comes with a fixed 2.5 power scope and Weaver rings. I bought this from an estate in 2014 and it has been sitting in my safe ever since. I thought I would use it hog hunting but it's just too nice to take into the woods. The wood and bluing on this gun are unbelievable for a 52 year old gun. Truly a collectible piece. PM any trade offers. Located in Plano.
