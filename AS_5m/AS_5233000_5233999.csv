59,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5233059,For Sale:  Diana RWS 54 Air King .22,"Canal Winchester, Columbus, Ohio",$ 500,"Listed On: Thursday, March 3, 2016",Air,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling this rifle and a couple others out of my father's estate. I have all the records for it as well. He was very meticulous and took the best care of all of his guns. He paid $645.50 at pyramydair for it. Will possibly consider trade or partial trade for other non-air gun.
If you have any questions or want more photos just let me know.The RWS 54 Air King is a recoilless sidelever rifle based on action of RWS 48/52 series. By floating the action on rails, RWS takes the rifle’s powerful recoil and significantly reduces the amount you feel. It also enhances accuracy, because the pellet exists in the barrel before spring vibration is transmitted to it.  This .22-cal RWS 54 Air King has the TO5 trigger and 2 stage adjustable trigger.
It has a Monte Carlo beech stock w/ raised cheek piece. For better control, RWS added checkering grip & forearms. This is a competitor’s dream come true. Loading is done through a sliding breech mechanism. Like the 48 and 52 rifles, this rifle can be used for field target, plinking, hunting, target shooting and spinners. The sidelever spring-piston rifle is very popular among air gunners who want to win at whatever they do.

The fact is that 3 1/2-inch shells offer next to nothing over 3-inch shells from a performance standpoint other than more punishing recoil. Plus the guns that run them are heavier, clumsier and more expensive. The M2, by contrast, is about as ideal an autoloader for all-around shotgunning as you’re going to find. Whether you’re into ducks, upland game, 3-gun competition or busting clays, the M2 is equal to the task. It balances well, handles fast, is engineered to lessen recoil and doesn’t cost as much as an equivalent 3 1/2-inch gun. Gauge: 12 ga. Trigger Pull: 5 lb. 12 oz."

If I own it I carry it and it eventually looks the part lol. I have the box and will let two mags go with it. Would sell for $575 firm, and it's worth every penny. Everyone knows or can find out the price in these new. This one is not new and is priced appropriately. Keep that in mind on your used trade as well. Not trying to be a jerk but these days everyone seems to have a stock Glock 17 that is worth $650??    Anyway,never a single issue extreme HK reliability. Also has the recoil reduction system found on the full size that makes the .40 recoil really sweet. I have ccp ask that you do as well or have purchase permit. Thanks!!"

The upgraded model offers a lighter trigger pull and easier slide operation. One of the thinnest and most concealable semi-automatic pistols today, the Beretta Pico Inox gives shooters better control than that found in many other lightweight carry pistols.The Pico's tip-to-parallel, straight-line action design, which requires a minimum barrel tilt during the recoil cycle, plus its smooth-pulling double action trigger mitigate recoil and make controlling this micro compact significantly easier than that typical of ultra lightweight pistols.The removable, serialized sub-chassis and modular frame facilitate disassembly and cleaning, and allows customizing with a Lasermax™ laser sight frame or with a selection of colored frames. The Inox slide resists corrosion from sweat, and is non- reflective. Pico comes with excellent white-dot sights, which are quick to acquire and bright enough for many low-light situations. The dovetailed quick-change sights adjust easily and can be replaced with tritium night sights. Lightweight, durable, and easy to draw from concealment, the Beretta Pico has all the reliability and quality Beretta is famous for."

The bluing on the barrel and receiver is excellent. Wood is good for a war-time model though I see a few minor Finn-repaired cracks. This is normal. I'm no expert but rifling/crown looks sharp with no pitting. Little-to-no rust. Slugged the barrel at .311.Note: this is a 70+ year-old military surplus rifle and will show wear accordingly.I am only selling because this was an impulse buy and is not in the budget. I just recieved this recently and have cleaned it up a bit but not shot it.UPDATE 3/11: Shot rifle today. Tack driver. 10 shot group at 100 yards was tight and see pic: after some practice my last 3 shot group at 100 yds was sub-moa. $425 FIRM. Please don't offer less.Thank you!"

Excelent, near new condition. I've put fewer than 500 rounds through it. I ordered the 9mm version to be a bit more economical with ammo cost. It loved to eat. The original package came with 2-35 round magazines. After much review of every Youtube video avaialble on the PPS43 - and there are many - I discovered that the difficulty in loading a full 35 rounds into the magazine was becasue of the plastic insert used to take up the slack in the original 7.62x25 magazines. So on the recommendation of several users I purchased an additional 3 magazines in the 7.62x25 capacity. They easily take 35 9mm rounds and while they do rattle a bit I have had no feeding problems. So the entire package is the pistol, soft case, shoulder sling, 2 9mm magazines, 3 7.62x25 magazines (NOTE: THIS PPS43 WILL NOT CHAMBER OR SHOOT 7.62x25 AMMO)  BEFORE YOU BUY: The PPS43 is considered both a hand gun and new manufacture so it must ship to an FFL (no C&R) and depending upon your state's regulations you need a permit to purchase a handgun. Additionally, since it is a handgun it will need to ship as such - express overnight - which is not inexpensive. Do your homework on shipping - I am not going to spend time doing quotes to the 4 corners of the country. Locally (Twin Cities) I would be happy to meet you at your FFL for the transfer - your dime. I can ship the case, strap and magazines by themselves which would save some on the overnight costs. Feel free to ask any questions you may have. I have turned my atteniton to milsurp rifles so this one is not getting out."
