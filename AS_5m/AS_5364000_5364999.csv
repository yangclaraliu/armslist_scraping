You will not find a nicer S&W 4046 anywhere. If you look at the up close picture of the grip area (left in picture) you can see that there is no wear from handling, holstering or anything else anywhere on this gun. In case you are not familier with the 4046 line, they were carried by police all over the country for years. Most of them you find are either pretty beat up, or at least show wear from holstering, etc. Not this one. It is a later model, maybe from the end of production. Has the rounded trigger guard and short stroke trigger. It also has night sights that glow great! It has a factory ""bobbed"" hammer and a loaded chamber indicator. While it is double action only, it is a short stroke. Not a long trigger pull like most DAO triggers. Very little use/very low round count. Pretty dang mint! The frame is steel, so it is heavier than a plastic framed gun, but this also reduces felt recoil. Feels more like a 9mm. It is a full size gun. If you have real small hands this might not be for you. Hogue does make some pretty cool grips for it that changes the feel and looks of the gun.Includes 4 nice magazines that I think are stainless. 3 of the mags hold 11 rounds while one of them is a ""Clinton"" magazine that was restricted to 10 rounds. No box or papers included. I will sell it for $400 FIRM, or am interested in trades. Straight trades or trade down with cash. I only like pistols, not rifles. What do you have? I love guns and am interested to see what you might offer up for trade. If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a text at the number I put in the picture. You must be legal to purchase or own (Age/Florida Resident/Not A Felon) and show me your Florida Drivers License. Thanks!"

The gun is like new, and comes with the original case and all original paperwork -- even the test case fired by Ruger in the factory. It also comes with additional fiber optic sights in case you'd want to change the color, or in case a light-gathering tube snaps. *** This gun comes with a significant upgrade. The Ruger Mark iii pistol (like the Mark ii before it) is notoriously hard to field strip. I installed a Majestic Arms quick field strip kit, and it works like a charm. With this part installed, the entire bolt can be removed with nothing more than an Allen wrench. I've got the original paperwork and original parts in case you'd like to revert to the original setup (who knows why you would, since this is 100 times easier). This part alone sells for $55."

This sale includes the American Defesne Mount seen in the photos. This thing is built like a tank and the glass is amazing. Like I said, this scope has never been used, not a single round. I'm in the process of consolidating my collection and seeing as I have two of these, one has to go. The shot through the scope is the best I could do with the iphone camera. When looking through is witht the naked eye it looks much better. It has a milquad reticle and the knobs are mil. Also included is the picutred 42mm sunshade. If you would like to purchase just the scope, or just the mount, let me know and we might be able to work something out. Feel free to contact me with any questions."

It came from the factory this way (they have the regular wood RAS47, then a regular Magpul one, then a Zhukov Magpul one; which is what this is). These AK's are 100% made in the USA and are great quality. This one has only had 30 rounds down the barrel. Other than a little mark from the safety going up and down, it is in new condition.This gun retails for $800 and up new (this one was over $900 for the gun alone at a local shop), and it comes with 3 magazine repair kits, a nice vertical hand grip, and a small rail that can be used to mount the hand grip or whatever else you would want to mount on the gun. You can make a cash offer but I'd prefer to trade it.Stuff I'd trade for: Older S&W or Colt revolvers, 1911s, a .308 rifle, an M1 Garand, a semi auto 7.62x54r, maybe a different AK or SKS plus cash. I'm open to other stuff too. I could add cash if you have something real nice. I'd even trade for US made tools, ammo, glass blowing stuff, welding supplies, performance big block ford parts. It doesn't hurt to ask but do not offer me a gun that's worth $500 and expect a straight across trade! I like this gun a lot and if I don't get any good offers, I'll keep it.Email or call/text REDACTEDThank you!"
