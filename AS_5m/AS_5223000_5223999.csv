These are fine firearms, but ones that, for whatever reason, don't see much use anymore. First up is the crown jewel of this parcel, a Colt King Cobra 4"" .357 magnum. She's a shooter, but still very clean. $1400.00 Next is a Colt Combat Elite. This gun spent too much time in her last owner's leather holster, and the finish (particularly on the slide) has seen better days. I had the frame Cerakoted in FDE. The pistol still pulls tight groups and runs like a champ. Fresh Trijicon night sights installed about six months ago. $800.00 Third on the list is a 1936 Colt Woodsman. 3"" barrel, sharp bluing, matching numbers. Great little field pistol, and very accurate. $450.00 Fourth up is an AR15 pistol built with a Colt A1 10"" upper, Colt full auto BCG (all marked appropriately) and an Anderson lower. Also comes with a Sig brace and a 100-round Surefire magazine. $800.00 Last on the list is not a Colt, but a nice little starter rifle for a little boy or girl, or something to slay squirrels with. It's a Glenfield Model 25 with a nice little 3-9 scope. Chambered in .22 short, long, and long rifle. $120.00 All the Colts come with manuals. Will make someone a nice package deal if they want everything. Trades will be considered, though I suppose I'd prefer to sell. Thanks for looking! Please contact me for more pictures.

Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.      Caliber: .45 ACP   Recoil System: Dual Spring with Full Length Guide Rod   Trigger: 5.5-7.7 pounds   Sights: Fiber optic front, low profile combat rear   Weight with empty magazine: 26 ounces with compact magazine, 27 ounces with X-Tension   Height: 4.75 inches with compact mag, 5.5 inches with X-Tension   Slide: Forged Steel, Melonite Finish   Barrel: 3.3 inch Hammer Forged, 1:16 Twist   Length: 6.5 inches   Grip Width: 1.19 inches   Frame: FDE Polymer   Magazines: 1-9round compact, 1-13 Round with X-Tension, stainless steel   Ships With: Hard Case, 2 Magazines   SKU: XDG9845FDEHC   UPC: REDACTED45"

Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.

Due to that exposure, the early skepticism I had about Filipino quality soon evaporated.  Depending on the manufacturer, you can get a very nice firearm at about half the price you would normally expect to pay for a similar product manufactured stateside.  And while I strongly support buying American, there isn’t any reason that someone who can’t afford a $1200 American-made 1911 should deny themselves a $600 version with the same features. The American Classic II is an upgraded version of the base model American Classic 1911.  For $600, you get a full-size forged 4140 steel 1911 available in .45 ACP or 9mm, with front and rear cocking serrations, extended slide release and safety, skeletonized hammer and trigger, extended beavertail type grip safety with “memory type” bump, straight grooved back strap, flared ejection port, Novak style three dot sights, nicely polished and throated feed ramp and chamber, standard recoil spring guide, one seven round blued steel magazine with slam pad, and last but not least, a pair of nicely snakeskin checkered wood grips."

This pistol has all the features of the standard 4"" model, but the longer sight radius of the Tactical model gives you more accurate shots and quicker follow up when rapid firing or in competition. Tough and durable and very easy to field strip and clean. Comes with the standard goodies in retail case and also includes 3 extra mags for a total of 5 and an extra mag carrier for a total of 2 carriers. Ready for carry or competition with the luxury of 5 mags, one in the gun, and 4 in carriers. Price also includes 100 rounds of ammo (target stuff) in retail box, not pictured, but I will have it for you.. This gun looks in unfired condition, never holstered or carried. Has been to the range once and had 3 mags run through it. Very smooth and low recoil. Retails for $649 locally when you can get them, and they only have the black version. Extra mags x 3 and carrier added will run you another $100 plus, so I think my price is fair. I have found these in black on the internet for $620 or so plus FFL shipping and tax without the extra mags etc. So my price is fair. If you find the same gun as clean as this one for less, you will be looking a while. The OD green model is a little more scarce. Will meet in public and require Ohio ID or Ohio CCW."

Setup with Simmons 3-9x scope and retractable bipod for distance shooting. Muzzle brake installed to eliminate muzzle jump for quick followup shots. The muzzle brake is threaded but is not a suppressor - any googling you do on these sorts of threaded adapters and diy suppressors is up to you. 300 blackout was made for an 8-9"" barrel, so this barrel makes great use of the cartridge. Good shooter, eats supersonic and subsonic ammo. Only around 150 rounds through it. Comes with a pmag and some ammo."

I would also like to apologize, first-hand, for the behavior of the guy who did ever try his dearest to smear my name and disearnest-ly associate me with unscrupulous activity a couple of days prior; as these sorts of things are not what I'm about. Again, I would like to apologize for his (whoever that individual may have been's) name-calling; for his childish storytelling and most importantly; for his dishonesty in firearm component values as well as his gouging of prices.
