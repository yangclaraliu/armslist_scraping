From the factory: RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward- ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The  patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to  existing Bullpup rifles."

As you can see the wood is missing and some screws. It also needs the Main Spring and the Trigger Spring that I know of. This is an extremely RARE find especially in a 16ga. This shotgun is not in too bad of condition for it's age. I have NOT had the gun apart so your guess is as good as mine as to what is inside. I was hoping to find some type of wood for it just to use it as a Wall-Hanger because of it's unique style and functioning. But since I was not able to find the wood I have decided to sell it for PARTS or for RESTORATION. I have checked the price for individual parts and I think my asking price is VERY generous according to similar items on the market.Price $65 cash.

Selling it for 100 bucks even, need to fund a new toy.These shotguns were made under contract with Mossberg so virtually any accessory that can be fitted on any of the 500 series will work smooth without a problem on the Maverick. *Serial no. was intentionally covered for pictures, there are two conditions to this sale first is the buyer is responsible for paying the transfer fee and second is at the time of the transaction the buyer will need to provide a lockable case for transfer, this firearm was kept in my safe with no case so I can transport the firearm to whichever FFL you choose but the case it is being transported in is not for sale."

These were not marketed over here so very very few were sold state side and I currently can not find ANY others for sale.
 
The finish is pretty good on this one with lots of the anodized left over, biggest issue on this one would be the cracked stock that was repaired at some point but is a matching stock so I never replaced it and there is a small dent in the rib. I had planned to give this to my father but he says he doesnt see him using it due to what it is so heres a chance for any browning collector to have an interesting piece of history.this gun is a pattern 1 and i have had it apprasied between 1500-1750 so i believe my price to be fair.
 
Here is the blue book on this particular firearm
 
 
SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT AUTO-5 12, 16, and 20 ga . In 1958, FN introduced the 12 and 16 ga. Super lightweight Auto-5 . Mfg. of the 20 ga. began in 1969. Pre-1969 Super Lightweight models were mfg.with a light alloy trigger guard and mechanism parts designed for weight reduction (approx.10 oz. lighter than the Lightweight A-5). In 1969, to further reduce weight, FN mfg. these models with alloy receivers. The alloy receiver Auto-5 were of a gray or black matte textured finish. Prior to 1972, the Super Lightweight A-5 were prone to flaking of these textured finishes. Stock and forearm cracking issues were also prevalant. FN modified its mfg. process and resolved these issues in 1972. Add 15% for NIB condition on Belgian mfg. Auto-5 models only, depending on desirability. Beware of reproduced boxes and labels, especially on the more desirable configurations.
Add 15% for the round knob (rounded pistol grip knob on stock, pre-1967 mfg.) variation on FN models only, depending on desirability.
Add $250-$500 per additional barrel, depending on the gauge, barrel length, choke, condition, and rarity (smaller gauge open chokes are the most desirable).
Add 20% for reddish stock and forearm configurations (Belgian mfg. - pre 1962).
Add 15% on FN models with blonde stock and forearm - mfg. mid-1960s.
