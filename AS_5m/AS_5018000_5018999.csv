I have not personally fired this weapon, and as with any used gun, I strongly recommend having it inspected by a gunsmith prior to use.  Based upon serial number, this revolver was manufactured in 1999.  Auction is for blackpowder revolver ONLY, no caps, ammo or blackpowder included, as New York State considers the possession of all items together to require registration on a Pistol Permit."

The rifle is in like new condition with no scratches or blemishes on the stock or barrel.  Selling with the scope which is a Burris Fullfield E1, 2-7 with ballistic plex bdc reticle, although the turrets track perfectly so you can dial onto target as well as hold over.  Scope still has original box and paperwork.  The rifle will also come with the tactical butt stock, (used to get a higher cheek weld for better scope alignment) and the leather sling.  This rifle is a great light weight hunting rifle with a light crisp trigger, but can also be used as a good range gun for shooting targets.  I can't speak for factory loads because I have never shot them through the rifle but it will consistently shoot 1/2""-3/4"" groups at 100 yards with hand loads. If the buyer does handload I can sell reloading supplies separately.

This is a TacSX2 semi auto shotgun in 12 gauge. These are made in Turkey, imported by American Tactical Imports, and are very well reviewed. I'm listing this as used but it is in brand-new condition, never fired, and may still have some of the packing oil in those harder to reach areas. Does not include original box or manual- unfortunately some of the oil the gun originally came packaged in soaked through and ruined the booklet and the box. Instead, I'll include a reprint of the manual from the American Tactical Imports website and a new soft carrying case, as well as the cable lock. • Gauge: 12ga • Chamber: 2.75"" & 3"" • Color/Finish: Black Synthetic / Blued • Barrel Length: 18.5"" • Weight: 6.4 lbs (approx.) • Capacity: 5 + 1 This also has a nice rifle blade-type front sight and a big, oversized hard rubber bolt handle, and a nice thick buttpad as well. Overall this gun is light, handy, and would work nicely as home-defense gun, trunk gun, or even shooting some clays with a 28"" barrel (not included). Asking $300 for this shotgun. I'm in the north Fort Worth area and will meet you anywhere within a reasonable distance. Please let me know if you have any other questions or would like to see more pictures."

** Paste and gel promote a durable, dry and slick wax-like surface that helps to reduce friction, eliminate fouling and destroys rust
** Safe for plastic, urethane, nylon and wood
** Contains no petroleum or water and has a pleasant mint smell

What's in the Box
** 1 oz. FrogLube solvent

** Brush
** Towel
** Swab kit

The FrogLube tube was used to clean and lubricate two handguns, but it is practically like new. To make up for this, I am also including a like new 4 oz. bottle of FrogLube liquid CLP (FrogLube Model #14706). It was also used to lubricate a few miscellaneous parts, but it is like new as well.

The retail price of these two products combined would be $52.65 based on Amazon.com pricing. I'm asking $35 for the complete package. 

Please let me know if your interested. I live near Franktown, Colorado, and I work near the Park Meadows Mall. I'd be happy to meet someone anywhere around or in between either location with the ammunition.

The lower has a patented, flared standard magwell that can be changed for a wider one if desired. The buffer is a Spikes T2. The barrel is a 16"" Spikes M4 profile 5.56 lightweight cold hammer forged and hard chrome lined unit with 1:7 twist that has been HP and MPI tested (the barrel part number is MIL-B-11595E if you wish to look it up). The bolt carrier group is from WMD and includes their trigger, hammer and disconnector, all plated with Nickel Boron which they claim can be run completely dry to cut down on clean-up time (I actually put a small dab of moly-lube on the hammer at the trigger notch but there is no lube anywhere else). The charging handle is a Vltor/BCM model 4. The 13.5"" handguard is from Diamondhead and includes two 3"" and one 6"" picatinny rail sections that can be installed most anywhere along the length and at 3, 6 and 9 o'clock. The pistol grip is from MagPul and the stock is a Rogers which locks up very solidly. The receivers, handguard, grip and buttstock have all been Cerakoted in titanium. The muzzle device is a Troy Industries Medieval Flash Suppressor. Included is a new MagPul P-Mag. Nothing here is cheap or average, I spent over $1450 on it so silly offers will be ignored. Only for sale because I bought a new LMT MRP and can change between calibers easily without using different upper receivers so that one rifle fills dual roles and I could use the space in my safe."

Was not shot at all in 2015, and can't really stand the idea of having a ""safe queen"", so it's up on the block for someone else to enjoy.

Details:

- Blued, 5"" barrel, standard government configuration (O1911 - Series 80)
- Purchased new in May 2013
- Approximately 200 rounds through it, all FMJ.
- Mostly a safe queen... was not fired at all in 2015, only occasionally removed from the safe to lightly wipe down/oil to preserve the blued finish
- Sights are DEAD ON. This is a clean, straight shooter, without a single failure or hiccup of any kind to report. Really, really hard to miss what you're aiming at with this Colt!
- Smallish scratch just to the left of the take-down lever, but otherwise, it's pretty much in spotless cosmetic condition.
- Comes with original case, lock, two 7-round magazines that are original to the Colt, and all factory papers.

Price: $760
