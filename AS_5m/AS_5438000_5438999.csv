Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty now, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship insured for $20 more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

A few things I would not mind having back-ups for or extras would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  Kel-Tec SU-16C, the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty now, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area or will ship insured for to your FFL for $40(handguns must be Overnight UPS) more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Both barrels are easily interchangeable and can be switched in seconds without needing any tools.  I’m the second owner but I just don’t have an opportunity to use it.  It’s very light with soft recoil and easy to handle.
The bore is pristine, shiny and the pump action is smooth and flawless (dual action bars). There are no dings or scratches whatsoever on the gun.  I put all new, honey-satin furniture on the gun when I bought it (with carved checkering, not pressed).  Since then it’s never been in the field.  Sadly, it's lived a sheltered life in my closet because I just haven’t had an opportunity to use it. ...my loss, your gain (or maybe your gun).
This will shoot up to 3-inch shells, including shot-shells, self-defense rounds, and slugs. It has a cylinder bore and the 22-inch barrel is threaded for the three included chokes in their own case (full, modified, and improved).  I'll also include a 25-round box of shells to get you started.  Both of the sling studs are already installed for you.
The gun comes in a really nice padded case (made by Ruger) which is sized to accommodate a scope if you wanted to mount one on the installed Picatinny rail (factory installed above the receiver).  I’m including the 12 & 20-gauge tool I used for swapping out the furniture (in case you’d ever want to put tactical furniture on it).  The tool makes that really easy to do.
I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas. I’m in College Station so the triangle formed by Austin, DFW, and Houston is do-able if we can meet half-way.  Must be a legal buyer with a valid TX driver’s license or permit.
If the ad is still up, the gun is still available. If I don’t answer your email immediately, it just means I’m at work and I’ll respond as soon as I get home.
I'd prefer cash but would consider trading for a recent Glock 42 or a Ruger SR22 (adding cash as needed).
Definitely not interested in low-ball offers. Thanks!"
