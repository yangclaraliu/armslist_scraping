Any other questions feel free to ask me.I am also willing to be flexible with price as well, even at the low cost as it is.    I APOLOGIZE FOR JUST ONE POOR PHOTO, FOR SOME REASON THE OTHER BETTER ONES WONT UPLOAD.

For a complete listing of our current inventory, and to purchase this and other guns online, please be sure to VISIT US ON THE WEB AT:   ***** TooeleShootingSupply.com *****    DANIEL DEFENSE V11™ LW The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11 Lightweight, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular). KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 LW is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Lightweight profile barrel, making it almost 5 ounces lighter than the standard V11. This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

No ring marks are visible, same condition as a new one. Only reason for selling is I decided to go a different direction with my build. This scope is built like a tank & could likely be mounted to one if you wanted to. These run anywhere from $1050 to $1200 plus tax & shipping in any online shop or retailer. Asking $950 & the only trades I would take is another high end scope. If it doesn't say Nightforce, Leupold Mark 4 or Vortex Razor on it don't bother with a trade offer.

Need to dig it all out but probably 3-4 hundred rounds selling per box of fifty always stored in climate controller safe with dessicants.I've got 6- 50 round boxes of cci blazer ammo. And about two and a half boxes that are kind of a mix between magtech, Winchester, Asking 800 cash face to face for the revolver only must send Foid and dob and wait 3 days with isp approval.Here is some info about the different changes made with each - dash , and SW people know the dash five is the best. Are info below :-""The 629-4 was the last run to have the firing pin mounted on the hammer. Some people prefer that configuration, but most opinion seems to be that the later frame - mounted firing pin is better. The 629-5 was first to have the firing pin in the frame. It was also the first to use injection molded hammer and trigger where the previous ones had been forged. (Not a problem, AFAIK, but sneered at by some traditionalists.The 629-6 saw the introduction of the infernal internal lock that has been roundly cussed and discussed on the forums. There have been a few instances of these locking up at inopportune times, but most of the dislike is the appearance. I don't know what later changes have come about, since I have no interest in the later models with the locks.(Note that changes to the blue 29 series doesn't follow the same sequence as the 629's)Hope this info helps anyone who wants to know some of the differences!"""

Comes with 3 probes and different grit cutters.  All brand new and high quality.  A $120 value alone.  Also comes with the rigid router base for regular router use as well.  
 
The indexing head is chain linked with locking cams for precise tracking and high cutting tolerances.  Rail Bearings are in great shape and all point of axis move in great working order.  
 
This was purchased 4 years ago and it has sat in my shop unused.  I thought I would start making more gun stocks and my business went in a different direction.  This tool would be a great asset in many different business models as a vast time saver.  An almost identical product made by Gemini (see wood-carver.com) sells for $5150.00.  Get in on this great deal and make your investment back on the first job.  
 
Local pickup suggested in Cincinnati/NKY area due to weight."

It has never been fired.It includes a factory hard case, one magazine and a factory holster. No bullets. I got this in the relatively rare Green Envy version because green is my favorite color, and it looks great with the Arctic White frame. So great, in fact, that I can't bring myself to shoot it. It's just too pretty. Since then I've purchased two other new guns, less expensive ones that I'm perfectly willing to shoot, so I don't need this one. It'd be great for anyone who is artistic, anyone who collects guns and anyone who just wants their carry pistol to not read as a gun even if seen in a purse or pocket. I don't particularly WANT to get rid of it. I still love it for its aesthetic properties. I could use the cash, though, and I may consider trading for a brand new HK VP9, preferably the 15-round version, or a Colt Mustang .380 or a Kimber of some sort.I don't have to sell it, so don't expect me to budge much on the price."
