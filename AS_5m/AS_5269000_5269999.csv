In 1987 John Browning's design—the first semiautomatic shotgun—was almost 90 years old, a testament to the reliability of its long-recoil action. In the minds of many hunters the A-5 is still the greatest waterfowl gun of all.

Available in blued or stainless steel, or light alloy frame. Features include adjustable sights, full underlug on 4 and 5 inch barrels, transfer bar safety system and soft rubber grips.About the Manufacturer:This company was founded in 1939 to make Smith & Wesson-type revolvers and is now part of a group that makes products ranging from hand tools to sports equipment. In 1980, after Italian arms manufacturer Beretta had completed its contracts to produce firearms for Brazil's military, Taurus purchased Beretta's Sao Paulo manufacturing plant along with the tooling, technical drawings, and work force necessary to produce several different pistol designs. By the early 1990s the company was employing more than 3000 people in four factories in Brazil. In order to more effectively tap the U.S. market, the company created a subsidiary in 1984 stationed in Miami, Taurus International Manufacturing Incorporated, also known as Taurus USA.About the Cartridge:This cartridge is based on a .22 Magnum (WMR) rimfire case that is necked down to seat a 17 grain, .17 caliber Hornady V-Max bullet. As done with the .17 Mach 2, the .17 HMR is sized such that manufacturers can easily re-tool .22 WMR gun designs to the new .17 HMR cartridge. This is a supersonic varmint round that travels over twice the speed of sound with near flat trajectory to 100 yards. The larger cartridge and load gives the .17 HMR more than 1-1/2 times the energy at 100 yards than the smaller .17 Mach 2."

The metal has a really interesting look to it as seen in the pictures. She's used and shows wear and painted areas of the stock. No problems that I have experienced. I also have a large amount of magnum ammo available if you are interested. Is missing one screw on the lower side, but doesn't effect anything. Would also consider trades on this.

This was manufactured in the last year - 1963. I am the only owner since. If you have never fired a 22 magnum, you have missed a lot of fun. My grandfather gave me this pump 22 mag in 1964, and the paint cans and fenceposts out back were never the same. I have used this to shoot field mice, squirrels, jack rabbits, rattlesnakes, prairie dogs and unmentionable larger game. Hey, it's okay; it was the '60s and it was in Texas. It is especially fun to shoot prairie dogs from about 50-75 yards, and it is quiet enough that the others normally do not startle or retreat into their holes.It really packs a punch for a lightweight pump-action rifle using inexpensive ammo. It is currently fitted with a simple 4X Bushnell scope. It has not been appraised, but I have seen many sell for hundreds more and they are not in the shape of this one. Everything is original, no refinishing or reblueing. It has honest field marks because I carried it everywhere when I was a kid and it spent a lot of time in my grandfather's jeep. I don't think it will last long at this price. Pick this one up quick."
