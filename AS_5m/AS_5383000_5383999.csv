This gorgeous unique knife is not only stunning in looks but it is also rock solid because of robust construction with its 4.5 mm Thick blade going all the way inside the handle without any joint and weld. Fantastic Unique Damascus Blade of the knife is the result of hours and hours of forging. Not many custom makers can keep such pattern of layers upon layers flowing all the way to the edge of the blade, which creates a saw-blade effect at microscopic level, allowing the blade to keep cutting while other blades have dulled. Maker hand forged the blade of this knife with 1095 and 15N20. Blade was given excellent heat treatment and Rockwell hardness of the blade along its edge is 57 and along the spine is 42-45. 4.5 mm thick blade has fantastic hand grinds on both sides. Spine of the blade has stunning file-work. Overall length of this unique knife is 9.0"" and the length of the blade is 4.5"" while handle's length is 4.5''. Gorgeous handle is a work of art.

I painted the rifle about six months ago, if you don't like how it looks, please don't email me just to say you think it looks like crap. The rifle was 95%+ original finish when I painted it and could easily be reverted to its original configuration with a little paint remover. In addition to the rifle, I have 5000+ rounds of ammo and lots of mags for sale to. I have no need to sell, but I have been slowly getting into ar15s, and this is my last ak47 that I haven't sold yet. This would make a great package for somebody looking to get into ak47 rifles. Arsenal makes a top quality ak, and this rifle is no exception.  Make me an offer. I would consider trades of the following: 9mm glock pistols, ar15 rifles that have a fixed stock and 20"" barrel (no carbine length ar15s please), 5.56 ammo, Aimpoint  and ACOG etc, or gold and silver coins.

Attorney Christopher Gasper: 614-845-1923 or chris@gasperlegal.com  http://www.gasperlegal.com/nfa-trust/  What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.  As an Ohio lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!  This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.  I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.  Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.   What the Trust includes:  - The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages) - Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms) - Appointment of Trustee (1 Page) - Trustee resignation (1 Page)  I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.  Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***  Attorney Christopher Gasper www.gasperlegal.com chris@gasperlegal.com 614-845-1923  7652 Sawmill Road Suite #166 Dublin, Ohio 43016"

The threads were professionally removed about 7 years ago. I wish I had bought a second barrel. It did not affect the accuracy.HK Mark 23 .45 ACP Pistol:The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns -yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America’s most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole.• Caliber: .45 ACP• Weight: 2.43 lbs• Action: Double Action/Single Action• Safety: Ambidextrous thumb lever• Sights: Open square notch rear sight with contrast points• Magazines Included: 2• Magazine Capacity: 10+1• Grips: Black polymer• Slide Finish: Black anodized• Frame Finish: Fiber reinforced polymer Not Interested In Trades."

In terms of size and shape, the P238 is very similar to other comparable micro .380’s. Instead of a polymer frame, however, the Sig Sauer P238 uses an alloy frame with a single action design, and is almost identical in appearance to the legendary Colt Mustang.   The Sig Sauer P238 operates with a locked-breech short recoil action. The hammer must be cocked either manually, or by the action of the slide, to fire each shot. The advantage to this method of operation is two- fold. First and foremost, similar to the Colt 1911 or Mustang, the Sig Sauer P238 has a superior trigger pull when compared to similarly sized double action only designs like the Ruger LCP, Smith & Wesson Bodyguard or Kel-Tec P3AT. In turn, this leads to greater accuracy. Second, the P238’s single action design allows Sig Sauer to incorporate a high ride beavertail grip frame, which leads to greater control under recoil by safely placing the shooter’s hand higher along the bore axis.   In addition to being a great-looking pistol, the Sig Sauer P238 is much easier to load than other micro pistols on the market. For shooters that do not possess strong hands, the P238’s smooth and easy slide is one of its most highly appreciated features. There are also positive vertical serrations on the back of the slide that further enhance loading or unloading.   The Sig Sauer P238 slide locks to the rear on an empty magazine, and the slide latch release is easy to reach with the thumb of the shooting hand. Similarly, the P238 has a user friendly manual thumb safety which further enhances shooter usability. The Sig Sauer P238 has stippling on the grips for a secure hold while firing the pistol. As mentioned, the frame has a generous beavertail to protect the web between the shooter’s thumb and trigger finger, and the hammer recesses into the beavertail section, to avoid any chance of hammer or slide-bite while firing the pistol. The Sig Sauer P238 is a very compact design, and while it may be slightly heavier than the polymer .380ACP pistols on the market, it is just as small.   We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $649.

In terms of size and shape, the P238 is very similar to other comparable micro .380’s. Instead of a polymer frame, however, the Sig Sauer P238 uses an alloy frame with a single action design, and is almost identical in appearance to the legendary Colt Mustang.   The Sig Sauer P238 operates with a locked-breech short recoil action. The hammer must be cocked either manually, or by the action of the slide, to fire each shot. The advantage to this method of operation is two- fold. First and foremost, similar to the Colt 1911 or Mustang, the Sig Sauer P238 has a superior trigger pull when compared to similarly sized double action only designs like the Ruger LCP, Smith & Wesson Bodyguard or Kel-Tec P3AT. In turn, this leads to greater accuracy. Second, the P238’s single action design allows Sig Sauer to incorporate a high ride beavertail grip frame, which leads to greater control under recoil by safely placing the shooter’s hand higher along the bore axis.   In addition to being a great-looking pistol, the Sig Sauer P238 is much easier to load than other micro pistols on the market. For shooters that do not possess strong hands, the P238’s smooth and easy slide is one of its most highly appreciated features. There are also positive vertical serrations on the back of the slide that further enhance loading or unloading.   The Sig Sauer P238 slide locks to the rear on an empty magazine, and the slide latch release is easy to reach with the thumb of the shooting hand. Similarly, the P238 has a user friendly manual thumb safety which further enhances shooter usability. The Sig Sauer P238 has stippling on the grips for a secure hold while firing the pistol. As mentioned, the frame has a generous beavertail to protect the web between the shooter’s thumb and trigger finger, and the hammer recesses into the beavertail section, to avoid any chance of hammer or slide-bite while firing the pistol. The Sig Sauer P238 is a very compact design, and while it may be slightly heavier than the polymer .380ACP pistols on the market, it is just as small.

FACTORY NEW. DANIEL DEFENSE V11™ (DANIEL DEFENSE TORNADO®)   The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.  This rifle is finished in Daniel Defense Tornado™ Cerakote™.

Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low glare surface.–The handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.–The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics. The Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed.–The six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.–The 16.1 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½”-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.–The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting.–The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.          We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $639.  pecificationsStock: ODG Synthetic, CollapsibleFront Sight: Adjustable PostRear Sight: Adjustable Ruger® Rapid DeployBarrel Length: 16.10″Thread Pattern: 1/2″-28Length of Pull: 10.25″ – 13.50″Twist: 1:8″ RHFinish: Type III Hard Coat AnodizedHeight: 8.00″Weight: 6.50 lbs.Overall Length: 32.25″ – 35.50″Grooves: 6Width: 2.50″Includes: (1) 30-round Magpul® PMAG® magazine"

CDP stands for Custom Defense Package, and the Custom CDP II™ .45 ACP earns its name. Built entirely in the Kimber Custom Shop, features like night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety and 30 LPI checkering on the front strap and under the trigger guard are standard. The 5-inch match grade barrel with match grade chamber ensures the kind of accuracy expected from Kimber and unequaled by any other brand. A Carry Melt treatment rounds and blends edges so they do not snag clothing or holsters, and the ejection port is beveled so ejecting brass clears easily. Other important additions include a match grade trigger, stainless steel small parts, checkered mainspring housing and elegant double diamond rosewood grips. Adding these features while the pistol is being built reduces the price by over $500, making it an incredible value. Quality, dependability and power are everything in a carry pistol. The Custom CDP II is the right choice in a full size carry pistol. Own one of the very best handguns on the market today with this Kimber Custom CDP II. This one we can’t say is factory new as we bought it from another dealer that bought it from the factory but it is new and never fired. Shipping is $25 to your FFL.
