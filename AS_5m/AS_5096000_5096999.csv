The action cycles nice and crisp, condition of wood stock and foregrip are excellent. Minimal wear and tear. This would be a collector's firearm if it were not for the scope taps on the left side of the action. I was also notified after aquiring the gun that the left side of the rear sight was filed down to fit the scope that was mounted on the rifle back in the day. There is a scope that comes with this rifle, however it is not mounted. I personally have not shot this rifle. I bought it to help out the owner before me who needed the cash. I thought it would be neat to have and just haven't gotten around to shooting it. This rifle is in the same condition it was in when I bought it. PLEASE NOTE: Given that I have not fired this rifle, I cannot 100% guarantee that this rifle will fire and function FLAWLESSLY, but I can attest to its great condition. This rifle is not in bad shape at all! Asking for $400 but I am open to reasonable offers.Serious inquiries only please! Send me an offer!

I would like a Springfield EMP 1911 9mm or a Kimber Ultra II 1911 in 9mm. Please no low balling or junk offers.  The HP-SFS(Safe Fast Shooting) is a current variation on the Hi-Power Mark III with a modified firing mechanism. After the weapon is loaded, the hammer is pushed forward, which automatically activates the safety catch. When the shooter is prepared to fire, the safety is pressed down with the thumb, releasing the hammer to spring backwards into the usual, single-action position. Magazines are interchangeable with the Mark III and others. The HP-SFS is the only patent system in the world that combines the performance advantages of both single action and double action pistol mechanisms with out any of their disadvantages. Carrying the pistol safely with a cartridge in the chamber is the basic principle of the HP-SFS. The hammer is in double action mode, although the weapon always fires in single action position, allowing the shooter to fire quickly and be more accurate from the first shot.call/text: REDACTED"

You know what that means. This little rifle is a BAMF! Starting from the butt: Colt branded m4 style 6 pos stock. Yeah, that's right,  6 and not 4. Because 6 is better than 4,  just ask your girlfriend. The scope is a Bushnell 1-4 variable, dopeable, bdc reticle, zeroed and ready to send Habib up to meet that Oh-lah or whatever they call him. Yeah i said it. So? The aforementioned scope is cinched down tight to the boss A3 style flat top upper via the extra chunky aluminum rings (included? of course! She don't work without em) and its all slammed up tight to the Colt branded lower (dancing pony and all folks. I mean, i already said it was a Colt right?) thanks to the brilliant little accu-wedge that's cuddled up behind the trigger. Oh my gosh the trigger! It is a match-grade affair, all coated with nickel and Teflon and all the business, and it breaks like your prom date's cherry. Hot dog!  That's a Hougue pistol grip, it's as sweet as apple cobbler at your Gran's house. Flared trigger guard....I guess if you're wearing gloves or maybe real fat that's cool...but anyways. MAGS!!! Hell yeah there are mags! Good ones too! 4x 30 round pmags, and a little bitty 20 rd pmag  in case those 30 rd ""stick out too far"".... like that's a problem. Did I mention it's a Colt? Cuz it is :) Anyhoo. There's a baller freefloat tube with like some slots....and little diamondey shapes....and extra screwholes for more rails. It comes with that little rail you see in the pic, that's a sling attachment point stuck on there and you'll get that too. The barrel is chambered 5.56 Nato, Colt branded 1 in 8 twist,  so if you're like me and dig versatility it'll do just right. Just right. Yeah.....like warm porridge. And that brings us to the very tip. Some call it the muzzle. I call it ""too late,  Jamal DeShawn Wallace the  3rd. Put my bicycle back."" Sorry,  back to the ""muzzle""... Yeah you called it, that IS a 3 slot muzzle brake. Good eye,  you sexy-ass mofo. Speaking of sexy, did you see this thing!? Crap, man. I can't stop looking at it. Neither will your friends. They'll be bringing their knockoff m-forgery around and you'll be like ""psssh, when are you gonna get a REAL man's rifle?"" And then they'll go away. Win! Speaking of win, that's what you'll do when you pop on this package, because not only will you get everything I've described so far,  but you'll also get that padded carry case in the pic AND this little milsurp doo-dad that sticks on your belt and holds 3 of the 30 rounders. And that ammo too! No way you say? You better believe it son! So, i mean obviously you better get on it right away or some other stud is gonna be strutting around the range with her and that just won't do. Oh, and if you have any questions, or just need a hug,  I'm always here."

Text Ian @ REDACTED, or email. CZ P-01DESCRIPTIONThe P-01 9mm was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public.SPECIFICATIONSProduct Name CZ P-01 – 9mm MSRP $627.00Magazine Capacity 14 Double Stack Frame Aluminum (7075 T6) Grips Rubber Trigger Mech DA/SA Sights Fixed Barrel Cold Hammer Forged Barrel Length 3.8 in Weight 1.75 lbs Overall Length 7.2 in Height 5.03 in Width 1.38 in Safety Decocking LeverSafety Stop on HammerFiring Pin Block Safety"
