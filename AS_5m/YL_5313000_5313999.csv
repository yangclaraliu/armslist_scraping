It has had the barrel broken in and it shoots cloverleaf a at 100 yards. I've broken it in with 20 shots. I sighted it in and shot about five 3-shot groups with it. I shot my deer with it this past deer season and I'm looking to upgrade for the coming season. I've heard a lot of guys talk about them being amazing moose, bear, and deer/caribou rifles. They say they really pack a punch. I'm 145 lbs, and I don't think it kicks much at all. It has Warne bases, an adjustable trigger, Hogue stock, a jeweled bolt, a buttstock shell holder, 15 pieces of brass, and 15 loaded rounds. From Just Hunt, the bases cost $40, plus the rounds and brass, and the rifle cost $1,700, so I'd like to get $1,400 for the package; I'll ship.

It shoots all American Eagle 5.56 and most other brand 5.56 really well but for whatever reason it does not like .223 ammo unless it's the high end stuff. I've heard alot of people have been having that issue lately and most likely the gas port on the anderson barrel would need to be opened up if you really wanted to shoot .223. (I've found the American Eagle 556 @ cabelas is the cheapest stuff around). Listing as spikes tactical but it's actually an anderson lower they just don't have anderson as an option.

The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight that combines the best of close and precision fire ranged combat features. The SpecterDR switches instantly from 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight at the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Depending on the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a 1.5 MOA dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has an extremely large field of view. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. Situational awareness in both magnifications is improved with ultra-wide viewing angles and unmatched viewing in low light conditions. The SpecterDR has half the weight and twice the capability of carrying two scopes, without compromise to mission effectiveness or reliability. The SpecterDR from ELCAN offers the best single solution for both CQB and long range engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use."

It's got a free floating Troy industries hand guard. Broomstick is a light capable, fab industries fore grip, that opens into a bipod. My background is Marine infantry and law enforcement, so I care well for weapons. This particular one, I modeled after knights armory's M110. its a great rifle, only a few inches longer and about 2 lbs heavier (not accounting for hand guard, broomstick and heavier bullets) than the .223/.556 M4 and it's not like in America you're ever going to take it on a 30 mile hike. Great all purpose rifle, as it's well suited for home defense or with a low capacity mag to be legal and scope, is a hard to beat hunting rifle. As I can tell, recoil isn't much more than an M4/M16/Ar15 and easily manageable. Comes with five 20 round bushmaster mags. 100 horandy super performance, +p rounds in the mags. They're $53 per box/mag worth of ammo, are hollow point with a plastic tip to retain aerodynamics. With the extra powder load, the round has a similar performance to a 30-06, once again adding to it being a great, flat shooting hunting rifle. Also comes with about two hundred rounds of federal FMJ target ammo, two laser bore sights and tan molle mag pouches for the mags. Ive also got a Trijicon reflex red dot scope off it I'd sell for $400 and a sure fire fury 3x light for $150, if interested. It's pretty well as good as new, probably but less than 100 rounds through it. Selling because I need money for a new truck more, so unless it's a new truck, not interested isn't trades, sorry. It's a good deal and I'm not really into haggling. Please email or call, preferably call. I'm not a texter. Thanks for the interest and time. 6062023584."

Its a safe queen and for me, I simply cant have a gun I dont shoot. Over the years I've collected many handguns and CZ's are my favorite. This pistol has never been shot and has been kept in a climate controlled safe for over 4 years. It comes with a bufflo hide locking case, all paperwork and three magazines. CZ USA has verified S/N. The gun is a true Adam Tyc. I dont think many made it to the USA and because of this I will be asking a premium for this pistol. I will consider trades for other target grade pistols such as shadow targets, target IIs or longslide varients (something I wont feel bad about shooting). I will also consider sig P220 x five/x six or supermatch pistols. I'm not interested in rifles as I own to many. Look for more pistols and rifles in my other listings. I'm trying to get my collection down to a reasonable size. I will include one aftermarket CZC Stainless guide rod with purchase (not installed but will offer this with the pistol)Price is negotiable to some extent and will also depend on the ease of the transaction. Local's are welcome and shipping to FFL is available. Shipping cost vary but I will typically cover half of the shipping cost. My name is Alex. Feel free to email me with any questions regarding the pistol."
