It features an ambidextrous safety, making it perfect for training or shooting with either hand and the scaled down size makes the 84F a great choice for smaller hands or a perfect option for concealed carry.  A squared off trigger guard gives this weapon a military feel and adds to stability when shooting. The 84F is a blowback operated semi-automatic pistol and the double stack magazine holds 13 rounds - which is significantly more than most of the small frame pistols being made today.  Stated as Single/Double Action, the Beretta 84F starts with the first shot as double-action and the follow up shots are single-action with an open slide design that prevents jams or other ammunition failures. This is a very reliable pistol! 100 rounds down the tube, in near new condition.  Will come with everything it came with when purchased new, except I also picked up a set of black plastic grips for it.  The factory wood grips will be included.  Also included are two - 13 round magazines, the hard case, and the box.  $450 obo (lowballers move along) - will meet for face to face transaction anywhere within a reasonable distance of St. Paul.  I will not ship or drive more than 30 minutes to meet up.  If interested, please respond to d.vandevoort@yahoo .com with a # I can reach you at and I will respond quickly.  Thanks!"

The rifle was used for M1 Matches at my local gun club, and has always shot well. The rifle receiver was made by Winchester in Dec. of 1940. According to on-line forum information responses, the rifle was rebuilt by the Red River Army Depot in the 1960's, though no markings appear on the receiver legs other than the drawing number. Most parts used during the rebuild were ""SA"" - Springfield Armory, and the birch stock is lighter than the darker (walnut?) uppers. The rifle always operated well, and was far more accurate than its owner's capabilities. This is a well cared for rifle, with plenty of barrel life left, and never shot corrosive ammo. I really hate to see her go, but she's too pretty to be left in the safe! Preferred payment is by USPS Money Order, though I will accept PayPal for an additional 5% over total (purchase and shipping) costs.  Whether shipped after received FFL or transfered locally, buyer pays any transfer/FFL costs.PLEASE NOTE THAT A SALE IS PENDING.  LISTING WILL BE DELETED WHEN SALE IS COMPLETED.I would consider trading for a NEW Ruger Precision Rifle in 6.5 Creedmore."

Unlike some of the reviews you may have read about out there this gun is reliable. I've had hundreds of rounds through it without issue. However the recoil is strong. This is because the gun is so light. It is the slimmest lightest single stack 9mm that has a 7 round capacity. The gun comes with N82 leather plastic molded IWB holster (https://www.n82tactical.com/products/holsters/) and frame mounted pocket clip. It is very comfortable, but I always opted for the more simple clip.Also it has the upgraded hardned chrome slide and cerakote tan grip. It comes with the original black grip too if you want to change it back.  This is a great CCW that makes it easy to carry every day."

My other G19 Gen 3 is the 'TALO' Boron slide finish model, and is one of the most accurate CCW guns I have ever carried for my personal protection, but it isn't for sale, so don't ask.Most people don't know, but the G19 Gen 3's are still the most sought after 9 mm pistol by professionals, and ones in the know about CCW guns.Why is that you might ask? Because the Glock 19 Gen 3 model has a track record, and was sold by the 10's of millions world wide. They have also consumed 100's of millions of rounds through them, and have probably the best reliability record in existence, for when you pull the trigger they go “bang.” The Gen 3 also has a thicker polymer frame than the Gen 4. Glock hollowed out some of the polymer frame, to make room for the double spring that was un-necessary, for an already easy shooting pistol. Unless you need the ambidextrous mag release, there is no reason to go to a Gen 4.I'm looking to trade up with “Boot” for a DA/SA 9mm compact pistol with a hammer.I have a special need for one of these. I like the HK P30SK DA/SA V3 9mm and/or a SIG P224 DA/SA 9mm. Looking for one in LNIB condition.If you want to make a CASH offer for my gun, the magic number is $525. Just not interested in selling a New G19 Gen3 for anything less. Will ship to your FFL dealer as long as it is legal for your state to have high capacity mags."

There is also a OEM guide rod and a couple of other parts from a Glock 19.Nice gun, works perfect. Since a lot of shops were milling only Glocks for MRD's when they 1st hit the market several years ago, it gave me the opportunity  to immediately start checking  out the MRD for a duty/carry gun until I found a shop to do my Sig's. Never really got as comfortable with Glock as the Sig 229, so it really is of little use to me. My loss is your good fortune. The Deltapoint is more accommodating for me. Biggest window out there for a direct mount on a pistol, and more importantly rugged and no colorization/distorition from the window and makes downrange view natural and comfortable. Many that wear glasses, and/or have less than crisp view of their iron sights, usually can see the reticle and down range clearly at the same time. Although the slide is milled for longer. taller Deltapoint Pro, a 1st gen Deltapoint is mounted securely due to the registration points; is space to the front and rear of the sight. Practically none of the machine shops want to mill the 4 registration points into the slide for a MRD and only want to do a straight cut. Really need a CNC for that. This one has 4 registration points and I think it provides additional stability. Since it is such a solid fit I do not find a change in the point of impact when removing/re-installing the Pro if desired. ===== When you upgrade to the Deltapoint Pro, it has a flip up battery compartment. I think there are a couple of advantages to having the Deltapoint, or any MRD mounted as far to the rear as possible and the rear iron sight mounted in front of the Deltapoint; More accommodating to plain clothes holster; and note the Mitch Rosen holster has a notch cut into it to fit the rear sight so that in fits normally in the holster; if the MRD was further forward it would create a problem. Just as accommodating to carry w/o a rig inside of the pants/belt; if it was further forward it has a propensity to be unstable. When the rear sight is behind any MRD, it necessairly blocks some of the  view of the reticle. No matter little that is, why do that? Allows you to mount the same way you have trained to align the iron sights, maintain the same muscle memory, but now as you begin to find the iron sights the illuminated reticle over powers the iron sights and you go to that; and if for some reason the reticle is down you will know it as you are already going for aligning the iron sights.  Of course the iron sights (BUIS) co-witness, with the reticle. .==== When the Deltapoint is stationary, no movement, for 5 minutes I think, it shuts down. When it detects movement, just touching it for instance, it turns on. There is a boot to fit over it for protection and to keep it turned off.--Please contact with any questions and for more pics."

The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design. The completely adjustable P30 grip feature - consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels - is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only ""Law Enforcement Modification (LEM)."" For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a ""light strike V1"" setup - requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger. Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9mm."
