The barrel is 24 inches with very good bore I would rate an 8 on a 1 to 10 scale. The front sight is a Winchester #21 with German silver blade, the rear is a Winchester #24G with 1901 patent date elevator. The barrel retains 90% blue with scattered light freckling, no pitting. The receiver is mechanically excellent, feeds, chambers and ejects smoothly. Full coverage of blue with areas trending to plum tint. The wood is solid and tight and stands proud above all metal surfaces. The finish looks to be factory at 90% with scattered light handling marks. The buttplate retains full blue coverage and indicates this fine 1895 Winchester has seen very little field use. Overall this is a 65-70% condition rifle with absolutely no issues! 20 rounds of Hornady factory ammo included."

He was Army, his unit forgotten but according to him he did serve as a special envoy with the British SAS during WWII on pre Normandy invasion mission. According to him, this dagger was from his first German Officer that he killed on that mission.

This revolver has around 500 rounds through it. The Ashley Emerson sights work fine but the white in the rear sight wore off. Other than that this is a beautiful firearm. I carried it as an armed courier for a few years but now have a Sig P220 so I'm letting this gun go. When it first came back from Bowen Classic Arms it had an appraisal of $2000 but I've shot it and carried it so I'm lowering it to $1000 for a fast sale. You'll also get a soft case, some ammo, three speed loaders, pancake holster and a belt that will fit up to a 34in waist. I will meet you at a local gun dealer to do the transfer."
