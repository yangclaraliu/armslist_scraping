In white light mode, a recoil-proof LED generates a versatile 350-lumen tactical beam capable of temporarily overwhelming an aggressor’s dark-adapted vision and disorienting him. In infrared mode, the 120-milliwatt LED produces a beam invisible to the naked eye, for use on stealth operations involving night vision devices—no filter required. Switching between the two lightspectrum modes is intuitive and easy, even on the fly, and is achieved by twisting a no-look, self-locking selector ring on the bezel. The low-drag M622V attaches quickly and securely to any MIL-STD 1913 rail—even out-of-spec rails via a field adjustable American Defense Manufacturing (ADM) throw-lever mount—and is activated by clicking its pushbutton tailcap switch or, for precision fingertip control without altering your grip on the weapon, by pressing its pressure-activated tape switch (both included). Constructed of lightweight aerospace aluminum with a hard anodized a Mil-Spec finish, and O-ring sealed to keep out the elements, the rugged M622V is built to endure combat-like conditions without any sacrifice in performance or weapon maneuverability. For sheer versatility, unprecedented reliability, and legendary SureFire quality, the M622V is the right choice for your weapon. Available only from SureFire.

That was before Benelli applied Italian engineering and style to this most American of shotgun designs and the innovative Nova Pump took the market by storm. Doubters predicted that American shooters would never accept a gun that replaced the traditional wooden buttstock and separate external receiver with a single unit that encased the steel action directly in lightweight, weather-resistant polymer. They couldn't have been more wrong! American shooters flocked to the stylish, ultramodern 12-gauge and for more than four years the Nova Pump has established an unchallenged reputation of dependability capable of handling everything from dove loads in the autumn haze to thumping waterfowl loads in driving rain. Shoot the Benelli Nova you'll never think about pump shotguns in quite the same way."

Price - $240 FIRM, I have this priced to sell. Only trade I would consider is .556 ammo. I will only meet at the Howland Police station parking lot for both of our safety.
 
I also have 10 hand picked Romanian surplus mags that are in excellent to like new condition that I have never used. They are the nicest metal AK mags you'll ever see. Some have slight scratching but the finish is overall excellent and no rust anywhere. If you're interested in them they are $20 a piece or $160 if you take all ten.

Lower was built with the same magpul furniture as comes from the factory on the rifle. Only difference is I went with a Spikes Battle Trigger over the ALG ACT (very similar). I also installed an ambi safety selector. There is zero rounds thru the lower and 30 thru the upper. It is in 99% condition. You would be hard pressed to even tell that it has been fired. I may consider partial trade vcog, vortex razor hd gen II 1-6, PWS MK214, other 14.5-16"" 308's, MPX. Text is best, call or email works too.

Carry with ease, draw with confidence, fire with precision.The Sphinx SDP Subcompact Alpha is the smallest and lightest of the SDP line up of pistols. The Subcompact Alpha is the perfect choice for concealed carry, or professional duty use, with an overall weight just under 25 oz and an overall height and width at 4.9"" and 1.2"" respectively. Though the SDP Subcompact Alpha is small in stature it does not sacrifice in quality or performance. Through precision machining and hand fitting by a master gunsmith, the SDP Subcompact Alpha shares more than just high performance figures with the larger pistols in the Alpha line. It also features a steel slide machined from billet. The upper frame, machined from billet aluminum, features full length internal guide rails which provide very smooth slide operation as well as solid barrel lock up. The pistol grip is polymer and textured from maximum ergonomics and grip. The pistol grip is also contoured to offer high hand placement to compliment the low bore axis, which assist the shooter with managing recoil. Ambidextrous features include the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Subcompact Alpha. The white dot front sight is easy to see in contrast to the black rear sight. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth, in both double and single action mode, with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. Every component of the SDP Subcompact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Defined by precision, the Subcompact Alpha is the only choice for discerning shooters that demand the utmost in build quality and performance.

I love this rifle, but I have bills to pay. This is the legendary scout rifle designed by Jeff Cooper. Comes with two 5 round magazines. The second magazine is stored under the buttstock. 3 point leather ""ching sling"" that helps you create a rock solid base for shooting from the standing position. The sling alone costs around $80.00.  3 position tang safety. 2 position magazine allows you to load from the top even with a full magazine. (i.e. drop mag to 2nd position and top load a FMJ when needed if you have a magazine of hollow points).  This rifle is designed for an intermediate eye relief (IER) scout scope, but if desired, you can mount a scope in the traditional location, as rifle has a picatinny rail over the rear receiver. Manufactured in Austria and imported by GSI in Trussville, AL. Pop-up integral backup sights. 6.6 lbs / 20"" fluted barrel / 39.6"" OAL.  The only real blemish on the rifle is on the picatinny rail.  The guy I bought it from (original owner) started to tighten down scope rings before they were properly aligned.  It scuffed up the surface a little bit (see pic) but it does not affect scope mounting.  I just removed a Zeiss Conquest before I took the pics.  No issues whatsoever.  Cosmetic flaw only.  The scuffs could be painted black if you mount an IER scope.  If you mount a scope in the traditional location, you'll never see the marks anyway.  Check Gunbroker and you'll find that this is a great deal. This is a great deal and I know I'll regret selling it! I can meet at the Greeneville Walmart or downtown, whichever is closer for you. If you're coming from a distance, I can adjust the meet location some but I'm not able to drive across the state. Please call or text Matt @ (732)213-seven nine four six. $950 firm.  Trade value is $1100. You won't find one cheaper in this condition on Armslist or Gunbroker! Check out my other listings."

What we are offering is a 4” Colt Python that is a true new in the original box revolver. This Python is 99% and it would be hard to improve upon this Python because it would be like stepping back to 1979 and purchasing new from the gun store. Serial #V94400 places this one made in 1979 and as you can see from the pictures, this one is truly amazing and a must have for any serious Colt collector. It shows no signs of consumer firing and they only thing we can find is a few very light marks on the barrel that are hard to see unless picture is taking up close. The finish is so dark and so amazing, it was very difficult to capture the sheer beauty in this Colt so if you do purchase it, all you will say is WOW when you open the box and have your first look at this Python. Comes with everything seen in the pictures (original box and paperwork). Think about it. A 1979 Colt Python complete with original box that is in 99% condition with just a very faint turnline. Pythons like this one don’t come around often and we see so many listed as NIB when in fact they are used and less than NIB condition. Don’t let this one get away from you as you as this one represents a true unfired mint condition Python from 1979. Shipping is $25 to your FFL and free for all military, veterans and law enforcement.

It is in great working order and good cosmetic condition. It has some minor holster wear on the left side of the barrel and on both sides of the frame forward and above the trigger guard.  It has minor speckles of rust that may have begun to pit slightly. Its very difficult to make out in the pictures, but it is at the outskirts of the grip on the left side. This occurred in the month I had the larger Hogue tamer stocks installed on the pistol. I would imagine it can be buffed out ny a skilled hand, but is reflected in the price. The Ruger sp101 is the shooters snub nosed revolver. It's built like a tank and can steadily digest a consistent amount of even the nastiest .357 rounds. The stainless steel construction adds more weight than its aluminum framed counterparts which decreases recoil tremendously and increases shoot-ability. I love this gun and I had some big plans for it. If you've never seen a Gemini customs sp101 and you like Ruger revolvers you need to check out their custom Rugers. But beware, they are costly! However, There's nothing quite like an all steel gun in a sea of polymer, and to have a craftsman tweak the snub to its max potential is a thing of beauty. I also have 100 rds of .38 spcl40 rounds of 158 gr. Soft point .35730 rounds of Buffalo bore 158 gr. ""Tactical short barrel lower recoil low flash .357 mag."" I know that's a mouthful but these rounds are, in my opinion, the best .357 defensive rounds to carry in a snub. The recoil is a bit stiffer than a .38 +p but way less stiff than a full power 158 gr .357 magnum and deliver great velocity.I'll add those in for a grand total of $525."

It is serial # 703784, manufactured approximately 1913. It has the standard 24"" round barrel. Special features include the half magazine, takedown option, and very rare 2X uncheckered stocks, along with a shotgun style butt stock (with Whelen-style fluted comb) and hard Winchester rubber butt plate. Barrel and mag exhibit 80% blue with some scratches and wear at the edges, as well as the typical marks from the operation of the takedown lever. Beautiful burl walnut 2X stocks have never been sanded or refinished, do not have any splits or cracks, do not have extra swivel holes, and show only normal usage marks/dings. They are still proud to the metal and fit tightly. Takedown operates normally and is tight with no wobble at junction. Action is crips and strong, half-cock seems to function properly and should make a good shooter upon inspection by a competent gunsmith. Bore has good rifling with very light, scattered pitting typical to the model, also is slightly dark and could use a good cleaning, should clean up to a 7 or 8 of 10. Receiver and lever are in the white, not sure if they were cleaned or just exhibit the normal flaking that was a problem with the bluing process due to the high nickel content of the receivers during this time period. According to Madis's rarity table, 1 of every 3 rifles had a round barrel, one of every 600 guns had special wood, one of every 670 guns had a special butt plate , 4 of every 5 guns was 44 caliber, 2 of every 3 guns was a rifle (no mention of percentage of rifles being takedowns) so this one gets into the highly collectible class with all of its features, especially having deluxe, straight-gripped, uncheckered stocks. The pictures don't do it justice, the flash makes everything too red, the last few pics really show it the best. 3 day inspection allowed and returns accepted as long as firearm has not been fired or taken apart."

Every design feature on the SDP Compact Alpha is tailored to maximize performance, quality, and ergonomics. The competition inspired trigger is very smooth with a clean break and short, crisp, reset. The steel slide is machined from billet and is hand fitted to mate perfectly with the interior, full length guide rails, of the billet aluminum upper frame. The polymer pistol grip features interchangeable back-straps to adjust length and width of the grip, the grip inserts are specifically designed to maximize contact with the support hand for added control. Also for added control, the high trigger guard shape and beaver tail allow for high hand placement on the pistol frame to compliment the low bore axis of the barrel, which allow the shooters to easily manage recoil. A Picatinny rail on the frame allow for the addition of modern tactical shooting accessories. The front and rear cocking serrations offer different options of firearm manipulation and the dotted front sight contrasts with the black rear sight for quick target acquisition. Ambidextrous features included the decocking lever and a magazine release that can be switched to either side. The slide release lever also serves as the take-down pin and is located on the left side of the Compact Alpha. Every component of the SDP Compact is manufactured to the highest standards and tolerances are extremely tight. Derived from competition and built for duty use, the SDP Compact is the ideal gun to suit your needs on the job, in the home, or in the shoot box.Technical SpecificationsSKU  S4-WWSXX-E018  UPC Code  REDACTED39  Caliber  9mm  Overall Length  7.4"" / 188mm  Overall Height  5.35"" / 136mm  Overall Width  1.37"" / 35mm  Weight  28.18 oz / 799g  Barrel Length   3.7"" / 95mm  Barrel Threading  13.5 x 1 LH  Sight Radius  5.7"" / 148mm  Sights  Front : Iron blade with white dot Rear : Serrated fixed sight  Action   Double Action / Single Action with ambidextrous decocking lever  Trigger Pull Weight  Single Action : 4.0+ lb / 1.8+ kg Double Action : 10.0 + lb / 4.5+ kg  Slide Material   Steel  Slide Finish  PVD Coating  Frame Material  Upper : Hard anodized aluminum Lower : Polymer  Grip  Polymer incl. finger molds Interchangeable Inserts : Polymer base with rubber Size : S,M,L  Magazine Catch  left / right - reversible  Magazine Capacity  15+1"
