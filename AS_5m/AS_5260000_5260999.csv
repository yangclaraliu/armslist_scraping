List Price: $20 Extra Magazine: $1.50 original cost Holster: Fink Custom High Standard .22 Cal. Holster w/ Bird Design Fink Leather Shops Kansas City, MO This High Standard Model B was manufactured in 1939. The Model B is a self-loading, recoil operated, semi-automatic pistol that is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. The pistol originally had a blued finish but it is starting to turn a brownish patina color now. This pistol has a 6 3/4 inch round barrel that is not easily removed (as seen on other High Standard pistols such as the Supermatic S-101). It is fed by a single column 10 round detachable box magazine. On the pistol's butt there is a European style heel magazine release. The pistol does not employ a slide hold open feature to inform the operator that the last round has been fired. There is a manual thumb safety lever located on the left side of the receiver and behind the grip panel. The High Standard Model B was first introduced in 1932 starting with serial number 5000 and it is basically the same pistol as the Hartford Arms 1925 automatic. The Model B was the company's first pistol design. The Model B along with later models such as the C, A, D, E and S designs have come to be known as the letter series. The company manufactured approximately 65,000 of these Model B pistols. The Model B was offered with either a 4 1/2 inch or a 6 3/4 inch barrel. The Model B and the Colt Woodsman look almost like identical pistols, although they are not. They were both derived however from the same earlier Browning design."

NO TRADES MEANS NO TRADES! This is a Century Arms WASR-10 with a ""battlefield pickup"" finish. This was an original, brand new rifle produced in 2013 with an aftermarket finish- not a contractor/overseas rifle. The rifle also has a polished bolt carrier to eliminate the WASR sticky bolt issue and a polish fire control system to make the pull/break smoother. The sights are not canted and the rivets are fine. This is a WASR, not an IO Inc rifle with all the issues... this comes with the original wood furniture, a Magpul MOE pistol grip (I have the original if you want it), and one 30 round Romanian magazine with the ribbed back. If you think this rifle is too much, go buy one in stores for this much or try to find one online as Cugir isn't shipping rifles into the US until the end of summer. Most of the ""budget"" AKs like IO Inc are garbage and newer budget rifles aren't putting the scope mount on the side. RAS47s are having quality control issues (see videos online about trunnion issues) Price dropped to $550 on 3/18 from $625 so if you're trying to throw less than $500 at me don't waste your time. Go buy a crappy IO Inc with messed up rivets for your $450 or sell something off to get the extra $100."

He only put about 200 rounds through it. The package includes the pistol, an 8-round magazine, a 7-round magazine, a plastic case, a lock and the original box and paperwork. I haven't shot it at all. It's just too small for me. I'm a big guy -- 6'2"", 250 -- and my hand is too big for it, even with the 8-round magazine. This gun is designed for conceal-carry, and there aren't many handguns better for that than this one. It's less than an inch wide. It's light weight. It has a reputation for firing accurately without stovepipes or anything. It's got a unique stippling pattern and stands out with its gold highlights. If I were smaller, there's no way I'd let go of it.As is, my index finger doesn't sit properly on the trigger, and I have to contort my thumb in order to drop a magazine. I was really excited about buying this, so I'm bummed to admit it's not going to work for me. I'm not trying to get rich. I just want to get back what I paid for it yesterday. Not really interested in trades.I'm a solid guy and a public figure in OKC. I've been at the same media job for 16 years. I'm responsible, law-abiding and easy to track down, so you can rest easy that you're dealing with someone legitimate. Thanks."
