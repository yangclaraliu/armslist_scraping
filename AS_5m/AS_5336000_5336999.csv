The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable back straps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.  All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.SpecsModel #: VP9 Night SightsType: Pistol: Semi-Auto Finish: Blue Hostile Enviroment Stock: 3 Interchangable Backstraps, 6 Lateral PlatesSights: FT: 1-Dot Night RR: Low Snag 2-Dot NightBarrel: 4.09 Hammer Forged with Polygonal RiflingOverall Length: 7.34Weight: 29.84 oz (with Magazine) Caliber: 9MM Capacity: 15+1 Action: Striker Fired# of Mags: 2Receiver: Black Polymer Frame with Picatinny RailFeatures: Striker Fired, Made in Germany, Ambidextrous Slide and Magazine Release"

This one was purchased new in 1973 by my father, who told me he'd not put more than 150 rounds through it.  I've probably fired it less than 50 times myself since inheriting it.  It's a fabulous shooter.  A fun, accurate cowboy rifle, without the kick or the cost of a full caliber.  It can handle .22lr as well as .22 Long and .22 Short.  It will NOT fire .22 Magnum.
This rifle is about as close to mint as you can get.   The stock, receiver, and barrel are all pristine with no blemishes or discoloration. 
Unfortunately, no original box, but it does come with an early-70's vintage soft case and a printed version of the factory manual.

The sweet 16 was released into the general public in 1937, however the gun was release to a limited test market in 1936. This makes this browning very rare due to the already low production numbers of the 1936 16 gauge shotguns (around 2300 total) Very few true 1936 browning sweet 16 shotguns still exist today. Before emailing me saying this is not a sweet 16 because it is not stamp please do your research. ""sweet 16"" was not stamped on the guns until the 40's. The 1936 and early 1937 models also do not all have the gold trigger or safety. The only way to prove this year is by narrowing the gun down by the serial number, inspecting the ejector portion of the receiver, and looking at the factory installed barrel to see if it has the holes drilled out of the barrel ring. I have done my research and had several browning enthusiast go through this firearm to verify it is a sweet 16. The gun appears to be all original, all numbers match on receiver and both barrels. Sometime post war the gun was shipped backed to browning to be converted from 2 9/16 shell to 2 and 3/4. Browning stamped the conversion marks on the barrel. This is one of the few modifications that raise the value of the gun. wood finish is in amazing shape. receiver and barrels are all in great shape for age. Barrels have not been altered. The original finish looks great with minimal wear for the age. If the gun was 99% I would be asking three times more for the gun. Email me for any and all details, price is very firm at 1,000. Not only is this a numbers matching 2 barrel set, but it is also a sweet 16. my price is more than fair. By the way, the serial number is 104332 on the receiver, and both barrels."

Chambered for the .22LR cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a rimfire revolver."

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a rimfire revolver.Specifications:- Caliber: .22 LR and .22 WMR- Barrel Length: 6.50""- Cylinder Capacity: 6 Rounds- Barrel Material: 1215 Steel- Cylinders Material: 12L14 Steel- Frame Material: Aluminum Alloy- Finish: Blue- Grip: Cocobolo- Land and Grooves: 6- Land Width: .076""- Length of Rifling Twist: 1 Turn In 14"" RH- Sights: Open fixed type Notch at Rear- Style: Bird Head Fixed- Trigger Pull: Approximately 6 Pounds- Length: 11.785""- Weight: 33.4 oz."

The patented Anti Dry Fire Trigger has a spring loaded redundant safety bar that remains in place until the arrow is seated properly, which finally allows the user to switch the safety off and shoot the bow.- Carbonlite: CRT Carbon Riser. The most technically advanced riser ever created for a crossbow. It removes nearly 43% of weight from the front end which dramatically shifts the balance point to the shoulder. This allows for the steadiest, and most accurate shot possible.- Shoot Thru Riser: Patented by Barnett this unique and sought after design lengthened the power stroke of a bow without placing the cocking string beyond arms length. This allows for increased speeds and stored energy levels unequaled in the industry. FEA (Finite Element Analysis) testing enabled the design team to minimize the weight and maximize the strength, (a process used by NASA and now in Barnett Crossbows) making this technology truly a step above the rest.- Metal Injected Mold: MIM (Metal Injected Mold) trigger is metal injected molded which allows for the tightest quality tolerances available. This accounts for the refreshingly smooth trigger pull at 3.5 pounds. Less jerking and ultimately tighter groups."
