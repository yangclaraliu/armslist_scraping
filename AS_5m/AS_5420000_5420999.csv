I am looking to sell this as either a 1) FIREARM / ACCESSORIES (w/ NO AMMO), or, 2) as a WHOLE PACKAGE (PISTOL AND AMMO, all included)​ …. since, if it doesn't sell, ​I don't want to be sitting here with a pistol and no ammo...

*I am asking ​$750 for everything​, or $500 for just the pistol /

I believe its only been fired once to at the most 6 times becuse it's been in the family since late 1987.Comes with speed loader, trigger lock, 2 sets of keys for lock, the locking carrying case with the key inside the lock attached to the case. 2 full boxes of Hollow Point ammo and 6 rounds of law enforcement ammo looks like it is in a tupperware jar. Must have been either special custom made rounds or 6 rounds that I personally have never seen. The perferct carry conceal. I've found ONE of the EXACT SAME MODEL, after 5 .25 hours searching for pricing and past similar model sale prices. 2.4 years ago, 2014 (Jan), same EXACT MODEL WITHOUT speed loader, locks, locking cases nor ammo sold for $1895.Price;$1350 OBO REDUCED and/or Trade plus Cash"

I am willing to ship the brass within US. If you want to purchase or trade through mail, I am requiring Paypal to do all the transaction so that there is some kind of paper trail. Yes, we can use Paypal to ""back up a trade.""This is how online trade backed up by Paypal works:1) Send a money request to each other. Treat this “trade” like a sale. For PayPal’s purposes, carry out the transaction as if you were selling the other person your goods.2) Each of you must pay the received money request. As you see, you will essentially be swapping $20 bills with each other. PayPal will ultimately deduct 88 cents from each of you for the transaction. 3) Send each other the items in the agreed upon fashion. If you are both sending it through mail, make sure you send it with some kind of shipping tracking number. 4) Enjoy your traded item, and send a quick thank you message to your trading partner so he knows you received the goodsNote: In your money request, include a note outlining the details of the sale. Something along these lines:“For 100 9mm brass for 100 .25 ACP brass shipping at buyer’s risk.” Ofcourse I am willing to trade in person; but I will only trade through mail using the way outlined above. If you are not willing to trade using the above method, I will consider you either trying to scam me, and I will ignore your email.In your email please let me know how many of what kind of brass you need and whether you want a trade or purchase. I will email you with the availability and the price (the brass will be from 10 cents to 25 cents. The more you buy the more discount I will give per brass)."

Scope is an nice older Simmons Pro 2.5-10x50 WA made in the Phillipines. Has covers on scope. Rings are non-fancy Weaver 1"" and are steel. This package comes with original factory foam-lined hardcase, two mags, factory packaging and paperwork plus the warranty card yet to be filled out. Includes a very nice stainless adapter in 1/2 thread for a muzzle brake or suppressor mounting. This is 100% factory built Rock River rifle. I put on this scope and rings pictured for accuracy claims here in this ad, and shot the pictured target immediately afterward with multiple kinds 50gr to 68gr factory shelf ammo. It shows this rifle easily shoots within 1 MOA guarantee as each square on target is a true inch square. Each target zone is five shots, and you can see four holes in two groups, and three in another. The loads were listed at the top of the page and marked by the groups. I shot leaning on a wobbly spool like the one in the pics, and the time was right at sunset. Rifle was not cleaned before or during shooting. Each group of five was shot within one minute, and there were 3 minutes in between groups. This rifle is not picky, and lives up the Rock River Arms quality. Total rounds fired thru this is around 300, and you can see very little marking on the brass deflector. Rifle has a lot of fuzz on it from the foam case, but you see some fine scratches and marks on it. The outside of the barrel has marks from using the adapter. The rifle has accounted for wild hogs in Mississippi and varmints here in the Midwest. It is ready to shoot. All laws apply and owner will need to furnish a valid Iowa permit to carry for me to see. I travel around the state for work and might be able to meet you on the road."

This is a lightly used (300-400 round shot count), but in *LIKE NEW* condition, Daniel Defense model DDM4V11 in mil-spec brown cerakote with Daniel Defense furniture. The rifle features a 16” barrel chambered for 5.56/.223 with 15” keymod rail system. The DDM4V11 weighs 6.28 lbs, and is between 32 ¼” – 35 7/8” long. I assure you, there are no cosmetic or function issues with this rifle. The rifle comes with a hardcase, lock, and paperwork. Thanks for looking.
The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular). KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, cold hammer forged, 16” government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense buttstock and pistol grip. This rifle is finished in Mil Spec + Cerakote.
EOTECH 512 TACTICAL HOLOGRAPHIC SIGHT
Best pricing is around $400
Mounted on the rifle is a lightly used (6-7 range sessions) EOTech 512 (black). Again, I assure you, there are no cosmetic or function issues with this optic.
EOTech's most popular holographic weapons sight, the Model 512 is perfect for people who want the best in close-quarters-combat speed and versatility but don't need night vision. The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch picatinny or Weaver rails.
MAGPUL INDUSTRIES MBUS GENERATION II SIGHTS
Best pricing is around $80
Also, there are brand new - front and rear - Magpul MBUS Generation II sights added to the rifle.
The MBUS (Magpul Back-Up Sight) is a low-cost, color injection molded, folding back-up sight. The MBUS Front Sight is adjustable for elevation, the dual aperture MBUS Rear Sight is adjustable for windage, and fits most 1913 picatinny-railed hand guards, but is specifically tailored to the AR15/M16 style rifles platform.
BCM GUNFIGHTER KAG-KM
As an added extra, I will include this kinesthetic angled grip designed by BCM.
Designed to complement modern shooting grips, the Kinesthetic Angled Grip (KAG) uses a biomechanically efficient forward rake to create an interface for positive retention and joint relief to the wrist, elbow, and shoulder, allowing for smooth weapon manipulation without substantial increase to the girth of the weapon system. Textured on both front and back, the profile of the KAG creates a channel for consistent and positive engagement which translates directly into improved efficiency in weapons manipulation and target to target transitions."

Features an integral Weaver-style base, uses AA batteries ( the most common battery, and is relatively inexpensive) and runs 600 hrs on alkaline or 1100 on lithium.I used this sight for only a few shooting outings over a period of several months.
