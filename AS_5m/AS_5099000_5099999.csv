These hand-built revolvers were first introduced in 1955 and produced until mid the 2000's, the now discontinued Colt Python is one of the most highly regarded revolvers in the world. Formerly manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. The Colt Python is sometimes referred to as a ""Combat Magnum"" or ""Python Magnum"".  Some firearm collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper, Ian V. Hogg, Chuck Hawks, Leroy Thompson, Renee Smeets and Martin Dougherty have described the Python as the finest production revolver ever made.  This specific firearm was produced in 1976 and features a ""Bright Nickel"" finish and a 4"" vent rib barrel with original wood handle. I have personally owned this firearm for over 20 years. I has sat in my gun safe for most all of that time. I bought it used but, it was like brand new when I bought it and since then I have only shot a box of shells through it. Firearm is still exceptionally clean with very light signs of carbon on cylinder face and very mild scoring on the cylinder gap. Gun is at a 96% condition. Action on this firearm is smooth, double and single action pull is perfect, crisp & tight. Bore is bright and very clean along with the rest of firearm. There are a few very light surface marks that have to be seen only under scrutinous inspection. Unfortunately, the original box and paperwork is NOT included with this firearm, as I never had it to begin with. Pictures are of exact firearm you will receive, Please feel free to contact via email if you have any questions or interest. Please leave a contact number and I will call you back as soon as I can. Thanks for looking!  Mark"

Manufactured in June, 1971. The Model 788 is known for its accuracy and reliability. Comes with one 3 round detachable box magazine. Iron sights. Drilled & tapped for scope bases. Equipped with sling swivels. Metal has some dings and wood has some dents and scratches, but the rifle is in overall excellent condition. Beautiful grain in the blonde stock. As usual, my interests have shifted and it's time to trade this one off for something else. Look it up: this caliber is rare in the 788 line. Spare magazines and parts are available at Numrich and eBay. I live in South Greene and can meet out this way, downtown or at Walmart; whichever is closer for you. TN driver's license required. I will fill out a receipt for the rifle and will provide you with my TN driver's license and carry permit for your part of the trade. Trade value is $650.

No junk, please.Disclaimer: As per our dear leader's executive orders, I hereby affirm that I am not selling this firearm for a profit. My intention is to trade this firearm in an effort to better my collection. I am not engaged in the business of selling firearms; I am a collector/hobbyist who is trading a firearm from my personal collection and this firearm was not initially purchased with the sole intention of reselling it for a profit. I will ensure that the potential trader is a resident of the state of Tennessee and will do everything in my power to avoid trading my firearm with a potential felon or other person who cannot legally possess a firearm.

Sure to create a fun and friendly atmosphere in any location, these commercial quality machines are available as a counter-top model or with the matching trolley.All of the Street Vendor poppers feature stainless steel food-zones, 20 mil anodized kettles (for easy cleaning), heated warming decks, old-maid drawers (for un-popped kernels), tempered glass panels and an industry longest three year parts warranty.FeaturesStreet Vendor poppers are available with your choice of three different size kettles to meet your production needs:4 ounce = 85 quarts per hour6 ounce = 127 quarts per hour 8 ounce = 170 quarts per hourThese kettle inners are constructed of thick gauge anodized aluminum for maximum performance and easy cleaning. Aluminum provides the best heat transfer of any ""cookware approved"" alloy while the 20 mil thick anodizing armors the kettle for durability and provides a super-slick surface for easy cleaning. The kettle jackets are made from stainless steel for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning.Heated Warming DeckAll Street Vendor poppers have a 50 watt heating element in the base to keep the popped corn fresh and warm. Since heat rises, bottom heating is preferred to heat lamps that only heat the top layer of popped corn. The heated warming deck will keep popcorn at the ideal serving temperature for long periods of time. The warmer is necessary for situations that require that popcorn is available on demand like concession stands, convenience stores, parties or retail establishments.Unpopped Kernel DrawerYou won't have to worry about biting into an un-popped kernel with the Street Vendor's old-maid drawer. The perforations in the bottom stainless tray allow the un-popped kernels to fall into the drawer leaving only fresh and fluffy popped corn in the holding bin. Simply ""rake"" the popped corn with a scoop and the old-maids fall through the openings.Simple Two-Switch OperationStreet Vendors are designed to be simple to operate making them ideal for locations that have multiple operators. The Master Switch turns on the warming deck and the interior lamp. The Kettle Switch turns on the agitating motor and kettle heat for a popping cycle. For safety, the kettle switch will not operate without the master switch in the ON position.These high quality poppers have been engineered to provide years of service under even the most demanding of conditions.The user-friendly design of these poppers allows for in-field repairs to be made easily with standard household tools.
