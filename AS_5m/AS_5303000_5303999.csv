Here is a WSJ article from 2001 discussing the overpenetration issue on planes and quoting Sinterfire.SPECIAL REPORT N - MAINAmmunition Makers Target Bullets That Are Safe for PlanesBy PAULO PRADA Staff Reporter of The Wall Street JournalUpdated Dec. 14, 2001 12:01 a.m. ETWith governments adding air marshals to planes to subdue would-be hijackers, and some U.S. pilots asking for permission to carry handguns, ammunition makers are scurrying to produce an airplane-safe bullet. The ideal bullet: one that could kill an adversary, but not pass through a cockpit door and kill the pilot or wreck electronics.""In an aircraft with people, hydraulics, pneumatics and electronics, you'd be foolish not to be concerned about a miss or the problem of overpenetration,"" says Bob Giuda, chairman of the Airline Pilots Security Alliance, a Warren, New Hampshire, group that lobbies to arm pilots.Ammunition makers are focusing on so-called frangible bullets, which disintegrate on impact with the first hard substance that they hit, eliminating ricochet and reducing the chance that bullets will pass through a body. Frangible bullets usually consist of a copper cladding packed with ground metals or plastics. They were developed to meet new demands on the firearms industry: ammunition that is less deadly for use by police officers in urban neighborhoods and cause less pollution than lead.AdvertisementBut frangible bullets are often inaccurate because the ground up materials inside them tend to clump or break apart, throwing off bullet trajectory and making shots behave unpredictably upon impact. By contrast, a conventional bullet, generally a homogeneous slug of lead, flies straight and hits as a solid mass, although with too much power for the inside of an airplane.Exploring OptionsManufacturers in Kersey, Pennsylvania, and North Hollywood, California, believe they have come up with better alternatives, using such materials as copper, tin and bismuth. Packing frangible bullets with more consistently machined powder or crystalline metal reduces the problem of clumping and makes the shots more accurate, they say.Manufacturers also have fine-tuned the material to make sure the bullets are powerful enough to kill, but not so powerful that they penetrate metal. Technicians have tested the rounds against a variety of materials, including gelatin globs that model human tissue.The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Training Center say they are testing frangible bullets for their effectiveness in police handguns. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also is looking at new weaponry for use by air marshals, but wouldn't say whether they were examining frangible bullets.The prospect of midair shootouts makes many aviation experts gun-shy, even though they dismiss the idea that bullet holes could lead to a loss of cabin pressure. Unlike the villain in the James Bond movie ""Goldfinger,"" passengers wouldn't get sucked through a window punctured by a bullet. Aircraft manufacturers say pressurization systems are designed to compensate for leaks, and that pilots are trained to fly planes safely even in cases of depressurization.Instead, airlines worry about insurance liabilities if an errant bullet kills a passenger. United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., backs stun guns and is seeking FAA permission to have pilots and flight attendants carry them. But stun guns may not be potent enough to stop a determined group of hijackers.""Passengers, when they buy a ticket, ... aren't signing up to go into a war zone,"" says Michael Wascom, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, a Washington airline group that opposes firearms on airplanes.In Europe, where air marshals operate on a country-by-country basis, aviation regulators haven't even raised the issue of bullets. There, individual countries have authority over air safety, making coordination on security issues complicated enough without the added controversy of weaponry. Few European airlines are pushing the gun issue either.""The whole thing is fraught with dangers, from accidental discharge to issues of proper training,"" says Iain Jack, head of security for British Airways PLC. ""We don't want bullets flying around inside an aircraft.""Bismuth ShellsSinterFire Inc., a Kersey ammunition maker, says its frangible bullets are more airplane-friendly. Its rounds consist of a baked metal powder that is 90% copper and 10% tin. By pulverizing, compressing and heating the metals, the company says, it avoids the clumps in other frangible bullets, making the bullets more reliable. ""Our bullet can penetrate a bad guy's head, but it won't come out the other side,"" says Dan Smith, SinterFire's director of technology.SinterFire works closely with Sigarms Co., a handgun maker in Exeter, New Hampshire, which sells firearms to the FAA. Air marshals work for the FAA and use government-issued weapons. The two companies, Mr. Smith says, are discussing a new gun designed specifically for the frangible bullets.Ken Elliott, president of Bismuth Cartridge Co., North Hollywood, says his company recently developed a bullet made of bismuth. Those bullets shatter more easily on contact than lead, because bismuth, a metal slightly heavier than lead, has a brittle, crystalline structure.Mr. Elliott already sells bismuth shotgun shells in the U.S., and is the publisher of hunting magazine ""Sports Afield."" He began investigating new ammunition several years ago, when President Clinton's administration began pressing bullet makers to move away from lead, which poisons groundwater and soils.Most frangible bullets, he realized, were ""sintered"" -- that is baked, not melted into a single unit. But he cast his bismuth bullets from the molten metal, forming a solid, yet breakable mass. The result, he says, is a truer flight path.To help test their potential for marshals, Mr. Elliott paid $1,500 for a five-window-length span from the shell of a discarded Boeing 727. Standing 270 centimeters from the inside wall of the section, he fired a 9mm Ruger pistol loaded with the bismuth rounds. The bullets cut through the plastic lining and insulation, he says, and ""turned to dust when they hit the metal wall.""But some pro-gun pilots fear the push toward fragile bullets will produce ammunition that wouldn't stop terrorists. Mr. Giuda, of the Airline Pilots Security Alliance, says he would prefer short-range versions of standard bullets, whose lethality is unquestioned, but which would be less likely to blast through cockpit doors."

Because this weapon does not technically have a stock and is well over 26"" in fixed overall length it is classified as simply a ""firearm"" under the ATF. Heres the link to the letter from the chief of the firearms technology branch of the ATF confirming the legality of the firearm.  http://www.franklinarmory.com/XO-26_Letter__c_.pdfSelling my 11.5inch barrel AR with shockwave brace, shockwave adjustable length of pull pistol buffer tube, and thordsen custom cheek rest w/battery tubes. Though it closely resembles a stock it is %100 legal because the pistol brace and cheek rest have been approved for ""pistols"". Also AR pistols cannot have a vertical foregrip on them unless it is over 26"" in overall length which re-classifies it as only a ""firearm"". This firearm is 27.5"" so it is well within the legal boundaries. This allows you to attach any accessory you want and have the functionality of a short barreled rifle without the extra money on a tax stamp, legal paperwork, and many months worth of waiting. And of course since its a ""firearm"" it can be taken across state lines.  The AR was assembled completely by a gunsmith and has had only 50 or 60 rounds out of it, and is completely free of scratches and marks.Comes with one Pmag with magpul floor plate, magpul back up flip up sights, magpul vertical forgrip, M-lok handguard, and one M-lok rail section, and BAD Lever. $1100  (may drop the price if you can meet at an FFL near me and can meet on my strict schedule)Will include Eotech512 Holographic for $400 more.Questions are welcome and i will answer them ASAP."

ALL PICTURES ARE ACTUAL GUN The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard models are evolved copies of the famous CZ-75 pistol design, with manufacturing improvements. Tanfoglio introduced the firing pin block before CZ, and its operation is different from what is employed in modern CZ's. The firing pin block is kept in an upwards position, blocking the firing pin until the trigger is pulled. This causes the pin to fall, allowing the firing pin to move. As a result, the overall trigger operation is improved by the block (the CZ design actively pushes the block out of the way when the trigger is pulled, increasing overall weight to the pull). The Browning-style safety is improved to allow operation with hammer cocked or down (the CZ allows the safety to operate only when the hammer is cocked). The frame is simplified by omitting the magazine brake, reducing complexity as well as simplifying machining. The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard is offered in several variants in full sized, compact and subcompact pistol frame sizes. The steel surface finish can be military blued, polished ""Wonder"" finish, blue ""Wonder"" finish or hard chromed finish. The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard is a short recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a Browning Hi-Power style linkless system. All T95 Standard and Combat models have the capability of being fired single- and double-action.The T95 Combat models feature an ambidextrous frame-mounted combat ""switch"" style manual safety that locks the sear so the trigger cannot be moved rearward as well as an internal firing pin block safety which stops the firing pin from traveling forward. The manual safety allows the Combat models to be carried with the hammer back, ready for use just by switching the safety off, a configuration known as condition one.The T95 Standard models feature slide mounted hammer drop safety/decocker lever (ambidextrous as an option).Unlike most other semi-automatic pistols, the Tanfoglio Combat/Standard slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside, similar to the SIG P210. This provides a very tight slide-to-frame fit, very good barrel lock-up and contributes to accuracy. A new slide with a slide-mounted safety/decocker lever is available as a factory option. Most variants have fixed iron sights with three dots for increased visibility that can be adjusted for windage. The Tanfoglio Combat/Standard models feature high capacity ""double stack"" magazines."

The action was cleaned, polished and re-blued along with some trigger work that reduced trigger pull to a crisp and clean 6 pounds (+/- .5). The most captivating part of the rifle is the inlaid Combat Infantryman's Badge and Army Parachutist Badge. I was stationed in Fort Bragg, NC as an 82nd Airborne Infantryman. I earned my CIB in Iraq and proudly had 37 jumps under my belt. It is fitted with Leupold rings and bases. As well as a Hawke Optics Sidewinder 4.5-14x42 Mil Dot scope.
