The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4″ up to the 3″.This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.Features:Gauge: 12 GACapacity: 6Barrel Length: 18.5""Finish: Tactical GrayAction: Semi-AutomaticHeight: 7""Chamber: 3"""

Something like a p226, Cz 75 sp01 tactical, or beretta 92FS Brigadier Stainless. I will only consider guns in excellent condition and I will throw in extra if you have something that is a true target pistol.  I do appreciate all the interesting offers for trade, but I do not want any polymer frame pistols, rifles or shotguns in trade. I'm trading this because it is too big for me, personally, to conceal carry with my shirt tucked at work so I had to get smaller guns for carry. I want a longer barrel 9mm with high capacity mags to take to the range. Thanks."

No manual safetyI also have the original sights, a trijicon front sight and a blacked out rear that will be included -it currently has TRUGLO TFO sights, green on green. -I have 5 10 round magazines-included a Raven Concealment VG2 IWB Kydex trigger guard holster with soft loop. Will fit compacts too but not shield.-An excellent Coyote Kydex holster, left handed of course, is included. Great retention -About 1500 rounds through it with the only issue being .358 sized reloaded polymer coated hard cast lead boolits that do not like to feed, .356/.357 work great though. Also, the take down lever capture wire escaped. The outcome of this is after the slide has been removed, the lever can be removed. Does not affect the gun in anyway. It can be acquired for under 2.50, it has never affected the gun, so I haven't bothered buying itThe ONLY trade I'm considering Is a Gen 4 Glock 19 with similar goodies, FDE frame is preferred but all black can be discussed.Flat out prices is 1,000I'm in Moreno Valley, willing to meet as far south as Temecula, would prefer Bullseye in Riverside not willing to do business with Ammo Bros."

Also included are the factory walnut grips and green Remington factory case along with a stainless Wilson Combat 10 round magazine.  (The ratings showed higher reliability with the stainless mag over the blued carbon steel mag). I have not even gotten a chance to use this magazine in the gun yet.  I care for my firearms religiously, and this gun has been 100% stripped and cleaned after each range outing, along with occasional field strip/clean out of bordem.   Armslis only is letting me add one photo, perhaps something with listing from my phone but I have tons of pictures and can take pictures upon request. Gun is flawless except for one pinhead size scratch behind the cocking serrations on the left side of the slide and wear from the safety and slide stop on the frames finish. Also included is the box for VZ Grips, package for magwell and 4 stainless grip screws also hex head and two allen wrenches and Remington bushing wrench. Factory flat mainspring housing included. Also included is all the spent brass (which I was able to retrieve at the range, missed some)169 Perfecta Brass37 Federal Brass44 Remington BrassIt kills me to sell this pistol, but my car was hit on Tuesday and I need money for my deductible and extra fuel for my truck while its in the shop. $575 for everything , and this is the final price drop.

The course retails for $2000. But I'm willing to sell it to you for 50% off at $1000! Here's the course description:This fast paced and exciting course is for law enforcement officers, military personnel and private citizens who want a complete understanding of the defensive handgun and a skill level that surpasses 95% of those who carry a gun for a living.Regardless of your experience prior to entering this course, upon completion, your gun handling, marksmanship, and tactical skills will be better than they have ever been and you will be able to safely and easily present your weapon from a CONCEALED holster and fire two, sighted shots to the center of a target 5 yards away - all under 1.5 seconds! That`s right, from a concealed holster in 1.5 seconds!You will understand the principles of tactics and have multiple opportunities to use your acquired skills under the stress of simulated, lethal encounters. This course is a must for anyone who chooses to own or carry a handgun for self defense.Lecture Topics and Firing Range Drills: As outlined in Two-Day Defensive Handgun with added emphasis on Concealed Carry; Tactical Training Simulation using Realistic Targets in Shoot/No Shoot Scenarios; and Target Engagement from Arms Length to 15 yards under Time Pressure. Course also includes Supplemental Lectures on Shotgun and Rifle topics with Single Elimination Shoot-off, and Distinguished Graduate Skills Evaluation.Sounds great, right? Military, law enforcement, and professional contractors and operators consistently train at their facility. This would make a great birthday/graduation present, an anniversary present for couples who love to shoot together (I can sell you more than one course), an employee appreciation or motivation gift, or an auction item.I also have All-Inclusive Diamond LIFETIME Memberships. These memberships retail for $15,000 and have a net worth of $75,000. Here's why: you can take over 50 courses (and more are being added each year) for the rest of your life. That's just one of the many perks of this membership but you can find out more by going to the membership page (www.frontsight.com/diamond-membership.asp). You will be shocked at how much I can sell this membership to you. Email me to find out how much you can have them for.I am willing to trade this course for one or a combination of the following: Glock 30 (.45 ACP) and between $400-$500; Sig Sauer P250 Compact (.45 ACP) and between $300-$400; Kimber Ultra Carry (.45 ACP); or, a AR chambered in .223/5.56 with good optics (if it comes with Trijicon and it's a quality AR, I'll make it (2) Four Day Defensive Handgun Courses).I'm simply trying to make a living, supporting my family by trading/selling goods that I've been blessed with. Plus, if you love firearms and would like to know more about how to effectively and efficiently use them, then the world becomes a better place. Let me know what you think. And even if you don't want it, you may know someone who does - spread the word. Have them contact me. Thank you for considering my offer."
