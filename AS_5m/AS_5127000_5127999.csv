Nearly all Security-Sixes were chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge, which also permitted the use of the shorter .38 Special cartridge. As with all Ruger firearms, the Security-Six revolvers were robustly designed with large, heavy-duty parts for durability and to allow for investment casting. The line enjoyed sales success because of their basic features, solid construction, and competitive pricing. Various models were issued by U.S. government agencies and numerous police agencies. The Security-Six and its derivatives also became the standard issue service weapons of a large number of police departments, in addition many were exported overseas. While Ruger's Security-Six line has been out of production since 1988, they remain well-liked and respected, as well as highly sought after by collectors."

The harshest issue on the gun us a fairly deep gouge in the metal on the back of the bolt near the safety. Included is a Centerpoint 4-16 Illuminated $100 cheap scope that is not considered in the price, i just dont feel like taking it off. It has a 2 piece Leupold base and ring set.

I just bought two pistols from a retail store, that nobody has ever touched or shot or went home with. That's new in the box folks!!!!!!  And got them cheaper than I could find on armslist, for one!!!!!! Unless you have an antique gun??????  I understand they are worth more than the average firearm, So Don't wonder why its not selling on armslist after 90- 100 days later.  .It's because your asking more than its worth!!! Check around, you'll see that the gun you purchased back in 2007, is not worth NOW, what you paid then!!!  They have made newer updated versions.   And please don't get mad when someone makes a reasonable offer. Just say no thank you. Thank you for your time and May god bless this country."

After machining and hand finishing it is sent off for Type III MilSpec 8625 Hard Coat Anodizing to protect the surface and provide years of every day use. All hardware as well as the mag release system is made from alloy steel and cerakoted. The mag release system is easy to reach with a small ""wing"" on either side for trigger finger manipulation. The stock itself rides on two aluminum rails and has adjustment for length of pull as well as cheek rest elevation. The buttpad mounting plate also has a minor adjustment for smaller shooters.Underneath it has a removable picatinny rail and the fore end has a sling swivel for bipod mounting. On the model shown below we have a standard bipod adapter mounted with a 6""-9"" bipod. Please note that bipods and other accessories can be used without the rail or adapter by simply screwing a sling swivel into one of the 5 various mounting holes on the bottom of the forend. The chassis system is very light while maintaining rock solid rigidity. It uses standard Accuracy International Mags and weighs in at a mere 4.1 lbs with the fore end and stock. One of the lightest chassis or stocks on the market! The trigger area has been generously machined to allow for larger aftermarket trigger options such as Timney, Jewel, and Huber.Be advised, orders will include the chassis system only (buttpad and hogue grip included), chassis will NOT include a bipod or bipod adapter, nor will they include an action, barrel, scope, magazine.

I had no idea how much this thing keeps me on target for follow up tags until I started shooting my buddies set up and this brake keeps everything flat and controled, only down side is... dont stand next to it shooting.Daniel Defense Cold Hammer Forge 14.5"" length, mid length gas, medium contour, chrome lined, 5.56 Nato 1:7 twist, M4 feed ramps= cold hammer forged barrels are the strongest most durable long lasting barrels made because of the manufacturing process of how they forge it (cold hammer) only draw back is they are expensive but well worth it)The Handguard is fully customizable to have the perfect fit for any style the shooter likes (the extra parts will be shipped with this rifle along with all the coyote tan plastic and covers I have)Coyote tan Magpul furniture, rail covers, and single point to two point sling (use the ""I kick hippies back plate"" and a magpul ring mount to make it a two point otherwise leave it on the back plate and keep the sling in the single point position. Includes Magpul flip up back up sightsIncludes Surefire Flashlight with 45deg picatinny mountThe Carging handle is a BCMgunfighter large latch = this this is a tough charging handle and will not break like regular charging handles underpressure!Aero Precision upper reciever AGAIN JUST THE UPPER, funiture, stock, handgrips, and etc. NOT LOWER RECEIVER."
