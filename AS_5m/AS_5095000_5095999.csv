I had them professional installed by a gunsmith.  I then went about collecting the very best MILLED parts I could find.  I got lucky and found an unissued (marked) scant stock out of the Rock Island Arsenal.  The pull of the scant stock usually runs about 1/2 inch longer which is great as the pull on the original 03 stock is notoriously short.  This is a incredible shooting rifle and easily exceeds my skill limit.  With old Military surpus ammo ( Greek HXP) I can easily hold 2 MOA all day.  I have not shot this rifle in the last 10 years and am comfortable in saying the total round count through this barrel is under 700.  I can not post all of the photos needed to truely represent this rifle.  Please feel free to conact me for other photos or maybe some specific shots you would like to see.  NO parts have been refinished, they are all the original GI parkerization.  I have done the best job I could in matching the color.  Yes, those are Russian mag pouches in the photo, they work very nicely with the 03 stripper clips.  Everything in the photo is included."

Having survived the Eastern Front in an elite Gebirgsjaeger (Mountain Troops) unit, he brought his family to the United States in 1959 by way of Canada. From 1959 until his retirement in 1971, he was the gun designer for O.F. Mossberg. L.W. Seecamp Co. was founded in 1973 as a family business specializing in Ludwig's patented (#3722358) double action conversion of the venerable 1911 semi-auto pistol (Colt .45). This conversion, done during a period when the single-action versus double-action controversy was at its peak, resulted in the first commercially available DA .45 autoloaders anywhere in the world. Nearly 2000 such DA conversions were done from the early 70s to the early 80s. Ludwig had become a firm believer in the value of DA after a Walther P-38 saved his life in WWII. That incident, which left him with a cheek-long scar and some missing teeth from a bullet wound, also convinced him point shooting rather than sight use is the reality in close range combat. Having been a fan of the 1911 but being also an advocate of DA carry, commercial conversions were a natural outgrowth of the Colt 45 that Ludwig had converted to DA for his own personal protection. In 1979 Seecamp Co. introduced as part of its gunsmithing package the telescoping recoil system that has become the predominant spring system used by modern short-slide short-recoil autoloaders. This system is the subject matter of patent #4201113 issued to Ludwig's son and Seecamp Company co-founder Lueder (Larry) Seecamp. In the September/October 1979 issue of American Handgunner in an article entitled ""The Rolls Royce of Bobcat .45's,"" Mason Williams said, ""This is such a major development in the field of (miniaturization of) automatic pistols that it could easily be considered the most significant development in a hundred years in the field."" While the patent was still active, the system was used by Glock, Colt, Kahr, Cylinder and Slide, Para-Ordnance and Lasermax (for use in the laser units for the mini-Glocks). After the expiration of the patent in 1998, other manufacturers such as Kimber, Taurus, IM Metal, Springfield Armory, etc., quickly adopted the system for use in their short slide autos. By the late 1970s a number of DA .45s, including the excellent Browning BDA (later SIG), had appeared on the market. Gunsmithing was thus abandoned for manufacture. Introduced in 1981 was the LWS .25 to fill a niche that had fallen into neglect. After the Gun Control Act of 1968, small quality pistols were hard to find. Moreover, the brilliant concept of double action only had lain dormant for over a quarter century and was due for a revival. All DA only pistols, more properly referred to as trigger cocking only pistols, are the grandkids of either the Czech CZ36/CZ45 design if they have hammers or the French LeFrancais design if they are striker fired. The LWS is a descendant of the Czech line. The Glocks and the Keltecs are descendants of the French line. Credit should be given where credit is due. The LWS .25 helped revive DA only and small pistol manufacture. It was the world's first stainless steel DA only pistol, and it was also the first DA only hammer fired semi-auto made in the USA. This design was covered by U.S. patents 4,428,138 and D269,896 issued to Ludwig (Louis) Seecamp. The LWS design has remained essentially unchanged since 1981 except for caliber - the numbers after LWS designating the caliber upgrade. Prior to the introduction of the LWS .25, firearms manuals did not address the issue of self-defense. It was pretended in the manufacturers' instruction manuals, no doubt on the advice of high priced lawyers, that every pistol was a target pistol. Extensive sections of our first manual were reprinted in gun magazines because a manufacturer officially acknowledging self-protection as a legitimate reason for owning a firearm was a"

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol.

The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly.

Serious weapon lighting for those who demand quality and durability. Very lightly used in excellent condition. Ambidexterous pressure activation pads, constant on option, lock option and a momentary on pressure switch for the blue LED navigation/covert dual lights. Runs on 3 lithium 123 cells, included, to provide up to 225 lumens from the MN11 ultra high output lamp. It also features a nitrolon non conductive high impact aramid glass filled polymer housing, Pyrex lens window, shock isolated aluminum bezel with anodized finish. Same with the rotating control. All this provides Surefire's flawless blinding white light in a platform that is tough enough to use as an impact weapon. As I mentioned, serious weapon light for those who demand the best. These units sell for about $500+ new and up to $300 used for this model. I have cared for this one well, used it very little and never abused it. Unit comes with an extra bulb and spring assembly, wrench for the throw lever base (although it has never needed tightened) and includes 3 lithium 123 batteries just installed. This weapon light is ready to lock onto a rifle and run. The cheapest retail price I could find on this hard to get item is $455 plus tax and shipping. I'd like to trade this one for a quality snub nose 38 spl revolver (or other centerfire cal) or I'd go as low as $200 cash FTF here in central IN. That's pretty fair.

The rifle is in good shape and shoots extremely well. Zero failures (it’s an AK) and good accuracy. The furniture is solid wood picked from a rifle used in the Balkans war. I bought the stock set with the intention of refinishing it, but the used look kinda grew on me so I never got around to it. If you’re not a fan of the wood, this rifle would be an excellent candidate for that badass new Magpul stock set. It was imported by ACC/ Intrac and is the ARM model. One of the more sought after models that the Egyptians produced, due to it being manufactured on Russian machines. All numbers match and the rifle has the Factory 54 and Pharaohs hat markings. I love the rifle, but I haven’t shot it in months and I’d like something new and different. I’m open to all suggested trades so feel free to throw one at me. Things of particular interest: 12 gauge Shotguns (not hunting oriented), nice 9mm handguns, 9mm carbines, Aim points, interesting ARs/ tactical rifles, and bolt guns.
