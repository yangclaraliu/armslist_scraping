I bought this new many years ago, installed a modern bolt carrier in it, and mounted it on my other AR lower assembly, fired about 30 rounds through it, and then cleaned and stored it. I was amazed at how accurate it was. It has triangular hanguards and a birdcage flash hider. I am also including a fiber optic front sight and a new and rare rear target sight for it, along with the original front and rear sights. This upper can be used to make the lightest and best balanced AR15 possible and it's a very accurate and rare piece that's been out of production for a long time. The O.D. original type cotton strap and closely matching buttstock are available for 35.00 more."

Awesome gun. Runs perfectly with mil spec AAC BCG. Comes with box and all paperwork. On an Anderson lower with fantastic trigger. Magpul stock and Bravo Company BCM Mod 3 grip. No Trades. Cash Only. I'll include 100 rounds of ammo with the sale. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Please feel free to contact me.Thanks for looking!A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

I beleive this is a 1994 sorry about not know the exact date i am posting this for my parents.This camper was purchased brand new by my parents. It has gone on at most 10 camping trips. We would go typically once a year but by 2004 my parents started renting out the cabins that the campsite had for rent. Us kids all had our own tents and would sleep in that and i think my dad just got sick of arguring with my mom about where the best place to put the camper was. But damn that was good entertainment watching him back that camper up and her yell at him,, sorry got a little off topic. This camper has 2 pull out beds 1 queen size the other a double. The kitchen table converts to a bed. It has a stove top, sink and heater. My parents optioned for 2 mobile clip on lights that also have extra electrical outlets and an extra storage area and access door for storage area. It also has the screen porch, stove, The GoodThe camper was always cleaned after we got home from camping and put away clean and dryIt never had any water damage or moldWindows still perfect no tears.Optional equipment as stated aboveTires are still goodThe BadThe elastic rope that goes around under the pull out beds needs to be replaced due to age the elastic dried out. I read on some coleman pop up forums you can use some elastic rope that kayakers use and just string it in.There is a crack on the plastic in the front storage area.One of the legs had the foot get detached. It works just fine putting a small piece of wood down but my father still has the metal foot it just needs to get welded back on."

This rifle is the synthetic stock variant, the stock has been painted camo and the factory plastic open sights removed. The ""Sniper"" means it is a ""suppressed"" air gun. Thr ""Vortex"" means it is a gas piston as opposed to a coil spring, which means more consistent power regardless of weather, and a smoother overall cock/recoil cycle as compared to a coil spring gun. It it will come with a mounted 3-9x32 Centerpoint scope and a tin of 25gr JSB Exact pellets. Which I have found to be the best pellet for this rifle. Delivering 28ftlbs of muzzle energy. This can handle raccoons reliably. The scope will handle the shock/recoil of the spring action, many scopes (even high end) will not. This is is a fantastic air rifle. About as powerful and accurate as you can get without moving into a PCP gun.

The 50-round drum magazine is also available (now holds only ten rounds). Both magazines are legal to own. This Thompson, like its famous forebearers, fires .45 ACP ammunition, revered by both law enforcement and military personnel, so it could be used to protect your home and family. Each is numbered between 001 and 500 with the prefix “RT”, for “Roaring Twenties.”Here is a link to the website for any other information: http://www.ahffirearms.com/product/roaring-twenties-limited-edition-thompson/"

This is an all factory original machine gun that was built by Colt in Hartford, CT in the late 1970's. This was sold to the Federal Government, and the widely accepted story is that these were issued to the Department of Energy (DOE) to protect nuke sites across the country. A small number of these were sold to civilians in the late 1980's.As you can see, this was a carried weapon and has some great patina and lots of character. It is so hard to find a M16 with honest wear - it is actually much harder than finding a new one. This rifle mechanically is in excellent condition including the bore. It appears to have been fired very little.One of the things that attracts me to this rifle is with the US Property markings, it is 'the very thing' for so many different military builds that you could do, like a MK18 Mod 0 build, or a MK12 SPR build, this is the exact lower - it wouldn't even be a clone."

PWS manufactures top quality weapons and except for the Slide Fire stock, the lower is, as built by PWS. Primary Weapons Systems manufactures their lowers; they are not an assembler of lowers made by others. The Slide Fire stock allows the lower to be “bump-fired” this technique allows the AR to be rapid fired. I have fired about 45 rounds through the lower. The first rounds as a function test and then a complete magazine fired none-stop. After test firing and a mag-dump yahoo, it has stayed in the lock-box. I am selling to raise cash for medical issues. The Primary Weapons Systems web site has priced the Lower at $479.95 MSRP and Slide Fire web site stock is priced at $179.95 MSRP, thus there is a lot of value with this package.
