Hard black checkered grips. 4.25 inch barrel, double-action/single-action trigger, 13 rounds, ambidextrous thumb safety, 3-dot red dot sights, Mil-Std 1913 picatinny rail. Includes box, papers, extra 13 round magazine and lock.From Beretta: The M9A1 is an evolution of the legendary Beretta M9 military semiauto pistol, developed with the advice of several law-enforcement and military agencies around the world. The M9A1 Compact With Rail Inox is a smaller and lighter variation that features an attractive and super-resistant stainless-steel (Inox) finish. Its many tactical features, ruggedness and absolute reliability make it a great choice for on- or off-duty carry, as well as personal defense or concealed carry. Compared to its full-size counterpart, the M9A1 Compact Inox is a full ¾” shorter and 2.3 oz. lighter, making it even more comfortable for all-day carry. Also, its shorter trigger-reach will make it simple to shoot even by users with smaller hands--and even for that first double-action pull. While in the holster, its super-resistant stainless-steel finish makes it stand up to sweat even on scorching summer days, while also making it more impervious to corrosion between shooting and cleaning. This handgun offers a great number of useful tactical features, without compromising on its military-style sturdiness and toughness. The magazine well is beveled, for lightning-quick tactical mag-changes without taking your eyes off the target. The combat trigger guard facilitates the use of the handgun while wearing gloves, as well as an ideal and secure placement of the off-hand; also, the front and backstrap are checkered to ensure a positive and consistent grip. Lastly, an integral Picatinny rail enables the easy mounting of tactical accessories such as lighting and sighting systems--without any gunsmithing or modification to the pistol. Engineered to withstand the hardest use in the most demanding conditions around the world, the M9A1 meets and exceeds the standards of reliability of professional military and law enforcement. This handgun will reliably feed most commercial ammunition designs, including the wider hollow-points and the hardest-hitting +P. An attractive, perfectly-engineered pistol for most uses including competition."

Also has the HK LEM trigger system, which is very smooth and consistent with each trigger pull. Great compact carry pistol!CASH PRICE ONLY: $650.00Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 - 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines."

I understand this to be one of approximately a dozen-14 total handguns available in the ""S"" series such as this handgun. The engraving on one side shows the serial number with S-100 on the barrel, next to the barrel it reads High Standard Mfg. Corp. and next line reads Hamden, Conn., U.S.A.; next line reads: .22 L.R. On the other side of the bluing it reads: Supermatic and Hi-Standard (there is a lightening bolt on both sides of the word Hi-Standard). Please feel free to text or call with questions."

All are electric rifles, with full metal construction and real wood. All are brand-new in box. Prices below include shipping, insurance, and tracking already, to make it as simple as possible.     Pictures are in order with the items below; I have additional pictures if needed. Please note that Item 1 is currently on a 3-week backlog; I cannot get them onto the shelves fast enough before they've sold out, so they are coming directly from the factory temporarily. There are only three left in the factory; do not wait if you wish to purchase one.Item 1: $250.00     M1928 Thompson 'Chicago Typewriter' 'Tommy Gun':               This weapon needs no introduction. The quintessential American submachine gun, used by gangsters and soldiers alike. In the modern world, a real-live example of the fully-automatic Thompson runs regularly over $24,000; get a 1:1 replica of this infamous firearm for less than a hundredth of that price. Created of heavy metal and real wood, this example looks, feels and more importantly, feels, like the original. Includes batteries, charger, and a 450-round drum magazine. Dominate the competition in any battle with an American classic; every collection deserves a Tommy Gun. I personally own one of these, and it has started more conversations mounted on my wall than I can count. Additional magazines, three available, only $50 each, can be added to any order.Item 2: $210.00    AKM Under-Folder:                    A staple firearm that has served in almost every war since the 1970's. This quality model is fully constructed of metal and real wood. It is an exact replica of the AKMS, both in weight and feel. Fully automatic with select-fire available. A classic firearm and perfect for the beginning airsoft competitor. Solid construction won't break down under combat conditions.Item 3: $800.00        MG42 w/ Bipod:                          Another firearm that needs no introduction, this is the epitome of airsoft combat, as well as realism. Fully constructed of steel and wood, this is an exact replica of the infamous MG42. It looks, feels, and even shoots just like an MG42. Features the infantryman's best friend; the drum magazine, but can be used with the belt-fed varieties as well. A steel bipod is included. If you're looking for precision and total suppression (or you just really like the classics), this is for you. I do not own one, but I've shot one a few times, and it's almost as fun as shooting a real MG42.       I do have several other machine gun options in stock, all of the same precision build and heavy construction steel. PKM's, M60's, essentially all the classics. Email me anytime to place an order or if you have questions."

I will entertain serious offers though, so don't be afraid to contact me about it.
