I have a century arms mini Draco that I call Pooch. I call him pooch because he hangs out usually sleeping behind the seat in my truck or next to my bed. He's pretty laid back and likes to be pet with an oily rag every couple days but he doesn't ask for much. I take him to play at the park (gun range) a couple times a year and this little fellas bark temporary silences the others and the guy holding the leash has made a few friends while discussing our noisy pets. He's very handsome and still a pup only having digested less than a half case of puppy chow. I like pooch but he's a second line of defence in my life. Pooch probably deserves to find a home that can give him the chance to really run and be a dog more than a couple times a year. I'm a bit more of a fan of classic black and tan (AKs with wood furnature) full grown hounds.

This ""law"" was swiftly rebuked and nullified in a majority of Oregon Counties all over the State through local governments. When this happend, this 'law' became void, therefore unenforceable, therefore not a law at all.When you see post that require an FFL for a private purchase, flag that post for removal. Save the screenspace for lawful NON FFL private transers. Do not be afraid. It is unenforceable. If your looking for a private transfer and you don't want to do it through the internet, simply identify another free citizen (somewhere like a bar or a military surplus store) and just ask them. It's sometimes easy to spot gun owners, and believe it or not, everyone in Bend has a gun!

Make any REASONABLE offer."

Other milled-receiver AK's are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability. Summary: The SAM7R is a 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, with a milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length butt stock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger. Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology. Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber. Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor butt stock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies. 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines. AK scope rail. This gun is brand new and never been fired. I have several Quality AK's and decided to sell off one of them."

Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AK's are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability. Summary: The SAM7R is a 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, with a milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length butt stock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger. Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology. Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber. Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor butt stock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies. 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines. AK scope rail. This gun is brand new and never been fired. I have several Quality AK's and decided to sell off one of them."
