Bowtech Archery, the industry leader in archery innovation, has once again developed technology that will shift the archery industry forever. The brand new 2015 Prodigy, featuring the revolutionary new PowerShift Technology, is now available in all new Mossy Oak® Break-Up Country™.

PowerShift Technology is a brand new innovation in compound bow design that allows the shooter to have every bow he wants with zero compromise. A quick shift of the PowerDisc changes the bow from its Performance setting (maximum speed and knock-down power) to its Classic setting (hard-hitting but smooth) or its Comfort setting (effortless draw). Combined with the effectiveness of the Break-Up Country pattern, the result is a revolutionary compound bow. 

Mossy Oak Break-Up COUNTRY combines digitally enhanced, life-sized natural elements with the perfect color tones to help you blend in and shadowing elements that truly break up your outline like no other pattern available today. 

The Prodigy measures 32 inches from axle to axle, has a generous 7-inch brace height and weighs just 4.2 pounds.

Additional Bowtech technologies featured on the bow include OverDrive Binary Cams for impeccable tuning and consistency, Center Pivot Extreme for unmatched accuracy and speed and FLX-Guard to eliminate riser torque.

Everything seems to be free and clean on it but I've never tried to load or fire it so I will not guarantee that it will. Research that I did do on it was that this Robin Hood Co. was from Norwich Connecticut. The top reads ""ROBIN HOOD No.1 LONG"". Side of barrow reads, ""CAST STEEL PAT FEB.23,75 MAR14,76.

 The other rough shape pocket pistol is made by ""LITTLE GIANT"" AND made about the same time also in Connecticutt. Looking for offers. Through research, I found this: The Robin Hood No. 1 was a 7-shot .22 manufactured by the Hood Firearms Company of Norwich, Connecticut under patents granted to F.W. Hood . The “No. 1” has a fluted cylinder, while the plain “Robin Hood” has an unfluted cylinder. These guns had no rifling in the barrel, though they did have some notches at the muzzle to make the buyer think the barrel was rifled. This one has walnut grips--some had hard rubber. The gun is marked “CAST STEEL, PAT. FEB. 23, ‘75, Mar. 14, ‘76.”"

Very slightly used, bet you can't tell the difference with new.  Only on the 45 a few magazines, just not my cup of tea.  Laser is bright, batteries are still fresh.  Everything still in box new as seen in pictures.

Best price I could find for these was on eBay at $304.95, Amazon had them at $315.00.  Selling to fund another pistol and priced to give someone a great deal, if you can recognize it.

The Crimson Trace Maser Series Lasergrips are precisely machined to fit hanguns seamlessly, all while bringing both artistry and rugged engineering to the classic 1911 design. Featuring both ergonomic and beautiful cocobolo diamond pattern side panels, these grips feature a rubber overmold activation button. Standard to Crimson Trace Lasergrips, the LG-921 features Instinctive Activation. This means that the laser sight automatically springs to life when the weapon is held in a natural firing grip.

Master Series Lasergrips are fully compatible with ambidextrous safeties.

Fits Colt (Officer’s and Defender), Kimber (compact, ultra-carry and ultra-elite), Para-Ordnance (compact, single-stack), Springfield Armory (compact and ultra-compact) Wilson Combat and most other 1911’s with grip screws measuring 2-11/16"" apart."

Price is $100 for both, firm. I am selling both of these together (not willing to break them up into separate sales). Cash sale only, FTF in the Portland area, around my schedule. I prefer to meet in the Oregon City/Gladstone/Clackamas/West Linn area.

I am willing to ship in state or out of state (assuming your state has no restrictions on these lowers, and yes, I will check), shipping cost is on the buyer. I typically use USPS Flat Rate boxes (medium).

Designed and manufactured in the USA, the new U22 Neos is a single-action .22LR Caliber plinking semi-auto pistol. Although designed with the entry-level pistol shooter in mind, it is also ideal for training and can be adapted to the needs of experienced users. Its modular construction makes it easy to modify with a variety of options and accessories, while still being affordable both as a base pistol and as a fully-accessorized system.
Cool, Futuristic Design
Even while designed a plinking pistol to be used for informal shooting, Beretta did not cut corners. The lines of the Neos bear the unmistakable flavor or renown Italian designer Giugiaro - the same mind behind several of their most attractive offerings. The result is a sleek and ergonomic rimfire pistol that feels as good in the hands as it pleases the eyes.
Fully-Modular Construction
The Neos is constructed of five modular parts that may be easily disassembled and reassembled without any tools. The ergonomic grips are constructed of super-durable fiberglass-reinforced technopolymer with non-slip inserts for a comfortable and warm hold. The barrel is available either in the classic Beretta blue finish, or in stainless steel (Inox), to satisfy the tastes of every shooter. Most of these elements may be replaced with the rich assortment of accessories that is available for this fun .22 semiauto.
High Performance
Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and remarkably accurate, the Neos features an integral rail that accepts Weaver-style scope mounts as well as a fully-adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack, 10-round stainless steel magazine features an easy-grip knob that allows you to compress the spring from outside, thereby making loading extremely quick and easy. The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged with the firing pin cocked or uncocked. If you are in the market for a superbly-engineered plinking or practice pistol, give the Neos a close look - it won't fail to surpass your expectations.
Features

Adjustable Target Sight
This fun training and plinking pistol offers users of all experience levels the ability to adjust the sights quickly and easily.
Weaver Accessory Rail
Easily accessorize this pistol thanks to the built-in Weaver accessory rail, which can accommodate sighting devices and much more.
Ambidextrous Safety
Train and shoot with both hands thanks to the ambidextrous safety on the Neos.
Tool-Free Disassembly Wheel
Taking your Neos apart and keeping it clean is easy thanks to its tool-free disassembly design. Simply turn the disassembly wheel with your fingers, and the barrel unit becomes separated from the rest of the pistol.

Maybe a few 100 done with Alliant Unique when powder was hard to get but most done with Titegroup. All done for 800fps to make for a reliable load but nothing for bleeding edge high power.

Has shot accurate and true even when warmed up. This 20"" barrel is more accurate than the 16"" and 14.5"" pencil barrels on most.  The lower is an ATI Omni.  Scope and removable rail is a less than 1 year old Simmons 4-12x40...shoots 200yds accurately which is the longest distance I've been able to shoot it. It is easy to remove/reinstall.  AR Extras: Spare Bolt carrier group, Metal quadrail handguard, Vice block for the Upper, Red Dot sight, AR Multi wrench, Trigger kit, 30rd Magazine, Extra front sight if you wanted to go to a pencil barrel, Extra handgrip, and probably some other things too                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mosin is modified but can go back to 100% original. Mosin is rare as all serials are matching...most are pieced together, this one is original. Mosin has Archangel Stock, 10rd magazine, 5rd magazine, Heavy duty Muzzlebreak, 2-7x long eye relief scope, Bipod that converts into vertical handgrip, 200+rds of ammo (fmj and some soft points), and a bunch of extras, as well as all of the original parts including bayonet. Once again, last time I shotthis 200 yds I was hitting the target. Even if converted back stock with the iron sight, me and my buddy were shooting 20 ounce bottles at 75-100 yds. If you have ever shot a Mosin, they aren't the most comfortable gun and they kick like a mule. The way I have it set up it is very very comfortable and I would have to say the recoil is cut in half and is more accurate than stock. Looking to sell both as a package for best offer...I have bills to pay and don't get out to shoot very often. Will require a signed receipt and would prefer a ccl. As for trades, not too interested in more hunting/shooting items."

The capped windage turret maintains the scope’s sleek lines and prevent it from hanging up on clothing, rifle cases or pack scabbards.

A forgiving eye box with increased eye relief gets shooters on target quickly and easily.
