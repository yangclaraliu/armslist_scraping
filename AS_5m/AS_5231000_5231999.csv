Available in two compact models—PT 111 and PT 140—the Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment.Taurus Security System (TSS)sTaurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.Loaded Chamber IndicatorTaurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.Accessory RailFeatures the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessoriesALSO INCLUDES- 400 Rounds of 9MM- 3 - 12 RD Magazines- 1 Tactical Knife and Sheath- 1 Cleaning Kit- 100 Rubber Gloves (Disposable)- 1 Tactical Backpack$375 or Best Offer****PLEASE ABSOLUTELY NO TRADES****"

Are you interested in getting into the sport? Come on out and join us March 26th for a day of outdoor shooting fun! We are looking for cool people that enjoy guns as much as we do. If you don't have any guns, or aren't familiar with them, don't let that stop you from coming out. We would be happy to teach you how to safely handle and operate them. Ammo will be available for purchase and we will let you shoot our guns for free. There will be SBRs and suppressors for you to check out if you are curious about them or considering getting some of your own.All we ask you to bring is eye and ear protection. Food and drink is welcome, but no alcohol will be permitted. There will be a grill available if you'd like to use it. You can bring your own paper targets if you want, but we have plenty of steel targets to shoot at. We have a plate rack, a dueling tree, and many other handgun targets set up at various distances. There will be rifle plates set up from 100 to 500 yards. Can you hit steel at 500 yards? Prove it!Safety is a big part of our club, so be prepared to hear all the same rules that you've likely already heard a million times. You will be asked to sign a liability waiver for everyone's protection. Nobody will be getting hurt at our event. Nobody will be getting muzzle-swept. Nobody will be shooting without eyes and ears. Unlike most ranges, we do allow drawing from a holster and shooting if you intend to practice that. We will have multiple stations set up in different areas for different types of shooting to keep everybody safe and comfortable. So don't be shy and join us! We are great people to hang out with. There will be beginners there as well as ex-military so don't feel like you won't fit in. $10 is a very small amount of money to shoot all day in a terrific setting such as this. We obviously aren't doing this to make money- we just pay the landowner for the privilege to shoot on his property. Our intent is to encourage people to enjoy this wonderful sport with us. Feel free to to contact me with any questions or comments, even if it's as simple as 'This sounds like fun and I'd love to join you!'.  My name is Cody and you can call or text me at REDACTED.

Ruger LCRX-3"" 38SPL +P. SA/DA..... Sale/Trade /OBOBrand new never fired. Perfect size, weight and feel KIT GUN. light and powerful made to handle +P loads. UNDER 1lb.!Includes OWB holster., Perfect for trail, camping, backpack, car,boat, tool box, purse.I allready have one for daily carry. Bought this one for the wife but she perfers a .22 Bobcat.(never fired it just like the way it looks.)LCRx™ with a 3-inch barrel, the newest variation of the revolutionary Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR®). Chambered in .38 Special +P, this LCRx features an exposed hammer that allows it to be fired in either double-action or single-action mode.
“The newest LCRx is the perfect revolver for backpacking, concealed carry, home defense, or just plinking,” said Chris Killoy, Ruger President and Chief Operating Officer. “The 3-inch barrel, adjustable sight and modest weight create a great all-around gun.”
This latest addition to the LCR line maintains all the features of the original LCR, including a uniquely engineered double-action trigger pull and patented Ruger friction-reducing cam fire control system. The double-action trigger pull force on the LCR builds gradually and peaks later in the trigger stroke, resulting in better control and a trigger pull that feels much lighter than it actually is. The LCRx also incorporates crisp single-action functionality for precise shooting.
The LCRx rear sight is fully adjustable for both windage and elevation, and the full-length Hogue® Tamer™ Grip without finger grooves makes for comfortable shooting. The LCR chambered in .38 Special +P has three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aerospace grade aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. When it was originally introduced, the Ruger LCR revolver was one of the most significant new revolver designs in over a century, and it has since been awarded three patents."

I've fired around 500 rounds through it,  just starting to break in,  it's been well taken care of and kept very clean and oiled. It's my carry gun and I really do love it but I'm looking to get a p228 or a m11-a1 soon so I'd prefer to sell this one.  I have two 7 round magazines and one 6 round. Comes with the made in Texas D.M. Bullard holster (think I paid around 100 for it). The holster is reversible for IWB carry and 4 adjustment holes, really a nice holster. I'd be interested in trading but prefer to sell, 750 for it all or equivalent in trade."

The small grip on this pistol is very similiar to the large grip size on a Glock 17.   It comes with 5 magazines (3-15 rd and 2-10 rd) and the glock case/cleaning rod/bore brush. Also included is approximately 650 rounds of factory loaded ammunition. The ammo can has ~500 rounds of 180 grain FMJ ammo from Master Cartridge. The boxed ammo is from Buffalo Bore, Underwood Ammo and Hornady. If you happen to be a lefty, I've also got two holsters that will go with it. One is a Safariland belt holster and the other is a kydex holster (I can't remember who makes it).  I am only selling this pistol because I'm trying to consolidate calibers.  If you have any questions either email or text at REDACTED.  Thanks for looking."
