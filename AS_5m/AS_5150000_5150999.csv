Stock is bedded at the recoil lug, top of action and full length of the barrel.  Bedding is very well done.  Stock weighs 34.5 ounces on my scale.The gentleman I purchased the rifle from was a bench shooter. This stock was never used for hunting which accounts for its exceptional condition with just a few hard to see rub marks from being in the safe.I prefer wood so I purchased a factory walnut stock and am selling this B&C stock.Will ship but buyer pays the cost.$125 cash only"

First $1200 or best reasonable offer by Sat morning takes it. Text/call me @ 314.threefoursix.4298 or email via armslist with the ""Contact Seller"" button.For sale is a very early pre-war commercial C-96, chambered in .30 Luger and manufactured in 1905. Pre-war commercial variants start at SN#39000 with this example having SN#39699 making it one of the first produced. All numbers match, including the grip panels, with the exception of the bolt stop which is numbered 2999. Has the correct early short extractor (see pictures), long barrel, and 1000 yd sight. Bluing is fading to gray, with considerable bluing loss to the high edges. There is also a minor dent to the magazine well on the right hand side which doesn't affect funtionality. Barrel has significant wear with little rifling remaining. Overall, a very good example of this collectible gun from a desirable SN range.Please contact me with your email address for additional pictures."

This medium frame, 6-shot revolver features comfortable rubber grips and a deep, lustrous finish. With fixed sights and a custom Single Action/Double Action trigger for improved accuracy and speed, the 65 is the perfect partner for whatever trouble lurks around the corner.Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.Features:Caliber: 357 MAGCapacity: 7Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Matte Stainless SteelGrip Black RubberAction: Double/SingleWeight: 38 ozRate of Twist: 1:16.5""Height: 5.48""Frame: MediumWidth: 1.496""Front Sight: FixedLength: 10 1/2""Grooves: 6Safety: Taurus Security System Transfer BarRear Sight: FixedHand: Right"

I'll include extra green and red pipes. There is some holster wear on the front left edge from lots of drawing in dry practice. The rest of the slide is in great condition.Lower: G17Gen4 frame with less than 1000 rounds. For some reason I sold my original G34 frame and then sold off the slide from this G17Gen4 frame. So this frame and slide have been married since last summer. With the frame comes all of the factory stuff like the case, 4 backstraps, brush, etc.The low price is because I am only including one 17rd magazine. If you use this for Production you'll need a bunch more mags anyway.I will meet at your choice of Portland Metro FFL, even in Vancouver."

This is a second-series gun with the thumb button release. This gun shows wear, handling marks, and a couple of dings or two, but is extremely accurate and functionally sound with the colt magazines (a local dealer rated it as NRA 'fine'). It sports the ""Colt wood"" grips, but the previous owner built up the thumb rest with some wood filler (ugly, but actually pretty comfortable IMHO). The barrel and chamber needs a good scrubbing.I am selling because I want a .22 that I can mount an optic on. I will trade for a Smith and Wesson Model 41 with 5.5'' barrel (will throw in case, depending on the value of the M41). If you have some other .22 you want to trade, let me know. Maybe we can make a deal.Any kind of payment is accepted, though I prefer payal. I prefer Connecticut transfers, but of state transfers are fine. Shipping with insurance will cost $20.00.I will ship FFL to FFL only.Please e-mail or text to 860-eight one nine-seven six two three. Thanks for reading!"
