There is a small chip out of the stock where the rear sling swivel is, but it is only 0.5cm long.  Overall a very accurate gun in great shape, I just don't shoot it very much.I work nights so the best way to get ahold of me is to text and REDACTED and i will get back to you as soon as I can, or call and leave a message.  Located in Nacogdoches but willing to drive a reasonable way to make the sale.  Armslist only let me upload one picture, if you want to see more just let me know.

The Tacoma, Washington, P.D. extensively tested Pro Carry models, finding them to be the most dependable firearm put through the paces in over 20 years. They checked the records, comparing Kimber not only with other pistols, but with rifles and shotguns as well. When you carry a Kimber, you carry with absolute confidence.Specifications:Caliber: .45 ACPHeight (inches) 90° to barrel: 5.25Weight (ounces) with empty magazine: 28Length (inches): 7.7Magazine capacity: 7Recoil spring (pounds): 22.0Full length guide rodFrame: Material: AluminumFinish: Matte blackWidth (inches): 1.28Slide: Material: SteelFinish: Matte blackBarrel: Length (inches): 4Material: Steel, match gradeTwist rate (left hand): 16Sights: Fixed low profileRadius (inches): 5.7Grips: Black syntheticDouble diamondTrigger: Aluminum Match GradeFactory setting (appx. pounds): 4.0 - 5.0Powerful. Dependable. Safe. The best pistols for carry.The Tacoma, Washington Police Department recently completed a testing program to determine what pistol their officers would carry. The test involved nine brands, 39 models and three calibers of semi-automatic pistols. Kimber won, and officers now have the option of selecting a Kimber Pro Carry II or Pro Carry HD II for duty.The test results are staggering. Other than Kimber, pistols had a failure rate as high as 22%. Kimber had the lowest failure rate Tacoma PD has recorded in over 20 years of testing for any type of firearm – less than one half of one percent! They also determined that the Kimber was safer than other test pistols when the safety was in the “on” position.Compact and Pro Carry pistols are similar to Custom models. Their 4-inch bushingless bull barrel makes them easier to conceal and reduces weight. Keeping barrel weight forward also reduces recoil, allowing faster recovery from shot to shot. Each one has dovetail-mounted low profile fixed sights with rounded edges to prevent snagging, and some models have Meprolight Tritium three dot (green) night sights.The Compact Stainless II features a stainless steel slide and frame. The frame itself is .400 inch shorter than the full length Pro Carry but still holds 7 rounds. Pro Carry models are available with either stainless steel or aluminum frames. Kimber aluminum frames are machined from solid blocks of 7075-T7, the hardest and strongest available. Moreover, these frames are run on the same machines and hold the same tight tolerances as steel frames. Tested to 20,000 rounds with no meaningful wear, the weight savings they offer does not come at a compromise."

Featuring the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 .45 ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry. From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD Mod.2 .45 ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry's slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2 .45 ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45 ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3 inch barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal. Like all XD's, the Mod.2 Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System all work to make the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone ergonomics set the XD Mod.2 apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2 Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you'll probably find that you've got a new favorite to carry.

If you have ammo with your sale and it is old (when it was .08 a round) don't expect me to pay you current prices of $20 for 50 rounds. I have done a lot of research and again hasd one I put over 2,000 rounds through myself.Not trying to be a dick, but am sick of people charging way more than what it is worth. The value will all depend on condition of the pistol. Not worried about exterior appearance, more concerned with internals condition (barrel, slide, if the firing pin has been replaced or original and of course true round count). If you have one of these and are asking a fair price let me know.

The gun comes brand new in the case with two 18rd magazines, lock and all factory literature. These can be hard guns to locate so nows your opportunity to snag one. The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."
