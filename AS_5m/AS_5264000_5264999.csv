Will handle  +P loads too. The no dash versions like this one are 38 special only. The 640-1 came out in 357 magnum, though most would agree that the small J frame platform is not pleasant if not downright punishing to shoot 357 magnum loads. 38spl +P is a solid self defense round. Enclosed hammer for snag-free, dust-free concealment, fitted with the classic rubber Uncle Mike's boot strap grips. Frame is stamped with a production date of 4-95 . These older Smiths do not have any MIM parts and the trigger pull is smooth and not heavy like current model Smith & Wesson revolvers. These all steel versions weigh more than the lightweight models, but the 23 oz weight does wonders for recoil management and thus, accuracy. Nice tight lockup with minimal to no end shake, no disappointments with this one, folks.$510REDACTED"

There were only 50 of these ever made by Rhino arms and I believe they decided to move on to other projects. I met an FFL with the last of them. I had one before and it sold quick. Just recently got a call from the FFL and he had one last one with a lower parts kit installed and upgraded stock with QD sling point. I was told people are trying out different mag releases like the saiga mag release, cmmg mutant release, etc which is cheap. All that holds it is a roll pin. This is obviously a project but this is the only Rhino lower in Colorado. This is the final price drop, I'll even throw in a slingI the links to the parts that will complete the upper. This rifle is worth well over a grand completed."

I received this brand new in case Springfield XD9 4"" Full Size Service Model 9mm pistol from my local gun shop last week after ordering it online. It is the ""essentials"" package which includes the Springfield XD9101HC 4"" Full Size Model 9mm Black pistol, two 16 round stainless steel magazines, bore brush, gun lock, plastic Springfield case, and manuals. This gun has never been fired since coming from the factory. The warranty information has not been registered with Springfield. 
I love the Springfield pistols, with the only reason I am selling this one is to purchase a new XDS 9mm that is more to my liking as far as size. 
From the Springfield website: ""The XD® 4″ Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD® 4″ Full Size has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD® 4” Full Size is the original XD® offering from Springfield Armory®, and the most basic XD®. This is the XD® that started it all.
The XD® 4″ Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4” Full Size. Where you point is where you shoot.""

From 1959 to 1970 the M14 served with distinction as the standard issue rifle of the United States military. When Springfield Armory® in Geneseo, IL made the civilian legal variant – the M1A™ – available to the public in 1974, shooters were finally able to enjoy the same rifle that so many servicemen had utilized in the past. The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck. The Standard M1A™ is ready for its next mission.

This highly requested pistol was developed through Ruger's Voice of the Customer program and incorporates the features and rugged reliability desired by Ruger customers. The LC9 has a 3.12"" barrel, is 6.0"" long and 4.5"" tall, making for a very compact 9mm pistol. The LC9 is impressively narrow at a mere .90"" wide, and weighs only 17.1 ounces with an empty magazine. Featuring a black polymer (glass-filled nylon) frame and blued alloy steel slide and barrel, the lightweight, full-featured Ruger LC9 offers the versatility and capability of the popular 9mm cartridge in a highly compact, reliable, and user-friendly pistol. ""On the heels of the overwhelming and on-going success of the LCP®, customers repeatedly requested a lightweight, compact 9mm pistol. Frankly, they wanted an LCP chambered in 9mm"" said Ruger CEO Michael Fifer. ""Delivering an American-made, compact 9mm that provides the same legendary Ruger reliability as the award-winning LCP, LCR® and SR9® became our focus. Meeting customer expectations is our goal and key to Ruger's continuing success,"" Fifer continued. The LC9 is a double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull. Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing. One seven-round, single-column magazine is provided with each LC9 pistol. The magazine's standard flat floorplate aids concealability, while the provided finger grip extension floorplate offers an option to shooters who prefer a longer grip surface with more hand-to-pistol contact. Seven-round magazines, holsters and other accessories are available for purchase at ShopRuger.com. The wider rear aperture of the dovetailed, low-profile, two-dot rear sight aids quick acquisition of the single-dot, dovetailed front sight. This high-visibility, three-dot sight system provides fast, positive sight alignment. The slide locks open on an empty magazine and the external slide stop is easy to reach and manipulate for positive firearm functioning.

The match-grade, Spec II chambered 16"" barrels are capable of pushing a .277 caliber, 85 gr. bullet to over 2900 FPS. 110 gr. bullets easily achieve 2500 FPS with factory loaded ammunition.

No visible serial number on the exterior surface, however, a three digit number is stamped inside the trapdoor of the buttplate. In my estimation, which is inline with a professional appraisal, this rifle is all original, with the possible exception that the hammer fly might or might not have been removed at the factory, enabling the rifle to come to a full-cock upon each cycle of the bolt, like that of the Model 1878 Experimental Rifle, rather than half-cock like that of the Model 1880. Condition in my opinion is NRA Antique Fine to Excellent considering that the hammer fly might have been removed at the factory. The action is strong and very smooth. The screw heads are mostly perfect with but a few showing evidence of the slightest use. In my estimation, the metal finish ranges in quality from a bright blue to a rich patina mix of varying shades, coupled with scattered light freckling mostly on the octagon part of the barrel with some on the hammer. The hammer retains most of its case colors. The trapdoor of the buttplate automatically snaps shut upon attempting to close it manually. The wood finish also shows the lightest of scattered handling marks. There is a very thin crack in the wood that starts at the rear of the upper tang and curls about 5/8ths of an inch to the edge of the checkering as pictured. The crack is possibly due to the over tightening of the tang screw, and it gives every appearance of being superficial and insignificant when it comes to the extra solid wood to metal fit and function of the rifle. Bore: Excellent. All in all, this is a very rare and well cared for special order rifle according to its features and the information contained in reference material including Remington catalogs."

Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies. The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period. Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class. This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the 92FS the choice of military and police professionals all over the world, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection."

This rifle is 1917 dated with a C.A.I. import mark under the handguard on top of the barrel. The flat ejector spring on this was broken, a very common failure. It was replaced with a coil spring and new ejector from Numrich. The stock is dark and smooth with a nice grain. No cracks that I've found, but it does have a small ding on the fore end, shown in the pics. No rust, and I would rate the overall finish very good but I'm not an expert. The bore looks good, and I've had no issues the Prvi ammo. This thing is very accurate and is a real pleasure to shoot. I don't want to let it go, but my interests have changed and I'd like to fund some other projects. I'm asking $550 shipped and insured to the lower 48 from my FFL to yours, or to you with valid C&R.
