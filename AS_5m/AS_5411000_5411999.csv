I purchased it from HKParts.net on 12/27/2014 for $253.94 shipped. ~300 round went down the pipe, never had an issue and cycles perfect with Griffin Armament Revolution 45. The barrel is NOT an original HK part, its made by http://www.rimcountrymfg.com/. I'm asking $160 FTF or $165 shipped for the barrel.I also have a 13.5 X 1 LH piston from Griffin Armament that was used exclusively for the VP9, cost me $80 on 4/2/2015. Since I'm selling the barrel, I no longer need the piston. From my understanding, it's also compatible with SilencerCo and other brands that use the same design. I'm asking $60 FTF or $65 shipped for the piston.If you take both, I will take $210 FTF or $220 shipped."

Of course the typical other glock stuff . I do have a cheap nylon holster for it but it just sits on the night stand and has about 50 rds through it .

Made by gunsmith John Buck in the late 90's I fired it quite a few times back then, and cleaned and dried it properly, however it does appear to have mild  rust on the outside, I shined an incandescent light thru the touch hole, and from what I could see, I just saw what appeared to be superficial rust in there too, similar to the way the outside of the barrel looked. This breech is the type where the breechplug was either part of the barrel, or welded in. The other cosmetic issue, is I had a hard time getting the rear tennon out, and enlarged the hole in the stock in a somewhat crude manner, it's not a big deal though, a dab of titebond 3 and you wouldn't even notice. I'm going to sell this as a non functioning replica, even though I would feel confident about still using it, after checking it out by a professional (the barrel is about 1/4 inch thick) If you do make the decision to fire it, make sure you properly clean the barrel, and inspect it professionally. The walnut stock looks great, he really did a good job on it. .50 caliber. I cannot begin to explain how fun to shoot these are.Priced to sell at $120 and $25 shippingMake sure these are legal in your area before you buy, thank you."
