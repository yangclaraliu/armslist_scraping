I will throw in a round of cartridges.On a personal note, I own one of these myself and LOVE it!!!I am asking $300.  I know there are ad's for cheaper and I know that stores sell them for less but nobody has them in stock.  If you can get it for cheaper than just pass this ad up and buy it elsewhere.  But remember that at a store you will have to pay a background check fee and if you transfer it from another place you will have to pay shipping and an FFL fee too as well as State and Federal taxe.  So basically, in the end, my selling price will be just a little higher that what you will end up paying. May as well buy from me.  I have a valid CCW and you must too if you want me to ship it!  You will have to pay all the shipping plus handeling.  IF LOCAL PICKUP: I will need Two forms of ID. A Drivers License or preferably a CCW Card and/or a Social Security Card.  I will CCAP you before we do the deal and a receipt will be written with your DL # and info.This firearm is in MINT NEW CONDITION!!!Thanks for reading and I look forward to working with you!"

First up, is 6 boxes of Winchester Ranger RA9T 9MM 147 grain. This ammo is by far one of the most sought after SD rounds on the market. I'm asking for $250 for all 6 boxes and I'm looking to sell them as a whole lot, not by box. I'm also interested in a partial trade for .223/5.56, 9MM, or .45 ACP plinking ammo plus cash on your end.Next, I have 13 boxes of the rare and discontinued Silver State Armory 5.56 70 grain Barnes TSX that's barrier blind and by far the best 5.56 round for hunting, as shown by various people on online forums who've posted their personal results. This ammo is identical to the military's 5.56 70 grain ""brown tip"" that everyone lusts after. When they are available on the market, they command a ridiculous amount of money per round. SSA has been bough by Nosler sometime ago and does not produce this ammo anymore. The only other top tier producer of this ammo is Black Hills, which makes the 5.56 70 grain GMX, which is similar, for $75 per box of 50, not including shipping and tax. ASYM also offers this round in .223 for $80+ for a box of 50, without shipping and tax. I'm asking for $25 per box, or partial trades for .223/5.56, 9MM, or .45 ACP plinking ammo and cash. Last, I have 10 boxes of Silver State Armory .308 168 grain Barnes TSX ammo. This ammo is lead free and CA compliant for hunting. This round is ideal for hunting and if I'm not mistaken, great barrier blind ammo. Top tier producers of the same ammo like Black Hills and ASYM sell for $50 per box of 20 without shipping and tax. I'm asking for $40 per box or partial trade for .223/5.56, 9MM, or .45 ACP plinking ammo plus cash."

It also has a rail on top for optics, outfitted with a Burris Speed Dot 135 red dot sight.

756,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5050756,"For Sale:  Hammerli 208 S (S model, not 208 International)","Far NE IL, or NH, New Hampshire, United States","$ 2,500","Listed On: Monday, January 11, 2016",Handguns,no type,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Hammerli 208 S, the end version of the legendary 20 /International, offers a 2 stage trigger with adjustable trigger position.
The basic sight system, and interchangeable barrel weights with rail that can accept an optical sight mount were retained.
Important note: some have said the Armslist email system is NOT forwarding inquiries. If you receive no response within a day, please email directly at REDACTED, or start by emailing directly.
The model offered is a commemorative version. Same as the other S models, but with a better finish, and gold lettering. The Morini grip is original to the gun, and has been modified slightly to correct the problems with the stock Morini grip shelf. The S model uses a modified trigger system from the older 208, but basically a similar trigger to the 215 and the later 208 guns. These changes were made to reduce production cost. Trigger quality was not improved, but was not decreased either.
Like the S&W41, the 208 and the S model evolved from the Walther Olympia of the 1930s, which itself was an adaptation of the Reising Target Pistol. After an unsuccessful adaptation by Hammerli following WWII as the Hammerli Walther Olympia, the International saw the gun revised extensive with a far superior result. The 208, and by pass-through of the inheritance, is, in essence, the ultimate S&W41 that Smith and Wesson never made. The barrel is a solid unit with the frame, with superb (close to 0.5 MOA) accuracy resulting.
The trigger is excellent for consistency, and readily adjustable from about 400 gms to about 3000. In addition to having a ""fine"" adjustment, this gun offers a coarse adjustment system for rapid adjustment from heavy to light pull weights. The S model is slightly less accurate than the older 208 guns, but the difference is very difficult to detect, and many prefer the S due to the adjustable trigger position and 2 stage option. Gun weight can be adjusted by change in barrel weights (0-240 gm available). The original Hammerli grip is one of the best ever offered for a handgun. Additional magazines (OEM Hammerli) available, and optional weights as above. This gun is NOT a SigArms import, and has no safety. Email if other images needed.
