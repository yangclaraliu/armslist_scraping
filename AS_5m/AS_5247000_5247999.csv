THanks for looking.Bell & Carlson's Medalist Varmint/Tactical Stocks were designed from the ground up to help maximize a rifle's performance by providing a rock-solid, ergonomic firing platform incorporating the accuracy enhancing characteristics demanded by today's serious shooters with the resilience necessary for use in extreme environmental conditions. All Medalist stocks are constructed of solid structural urethane combined with aramid, graphite and fiberglass materials to enhance strength. A precision, CNC-machined Aluminum Bedding Block makes contact with the full length of the rifle's action, ensuring a perfect metal-to-metal fit and serving to align the barreled action, stiffen the forend, and eliminate the need for conventional bedding methods. This M40 Medalist Stock features an adjustable cheek piece for proper eye-to-optic alignment and a 3-way adjustable butt assembly that allows for changes to the length of pull, cant(left/right) and height (up/down). The stock's forend is tapered to allow for minute elevation adjustments when slid back or forth upon a forward rest, and is equipped with an integral aluminum forearm rail to allow for the attachment and positioning of accessories (such as a bipod) at the shooter's discretion. Technical Notes: This stock is designed to fit Short Action Remington 700 BDL rifles with a Hinged Floorplate and Heavy/Varmint Barrel Contour. Weighs 5.6 lbs."

No wiggle in the trigger pins (found in older high round count guns) and great tight fit between the upper and lower receiver.  The trigger is everything you would expect from a milspec colt, and will pass any colt afficianado's pull test.  Has the correct .155 trigger pins, so no ban era wierdness to worry about. The front takedown pin on these are the factory double flat-head, again all stock gun, but people always ask when they see them for the first time. Has (1) stock Colt 20 round straight GI mag and a new 2 point simple sling.  Will throw in a cheap rifle bag if you need one to get it home as well.  I am looking for high end NATO caliber rifles, high end optics, IR, NV are ok but will need to be worth a little more than the rifle or with cash on top if worth less.  I can trade up as well with cash or additional trade on my end, just let me know what you have.    Call or Text,Ryan REDACTED"

The safety is very easy to operate, not like a Shield it is more like a 1911 and very intuitive. However if you do not like the safety, it can easily be removed altogether and the finishing plugs inserted. The gun is brand new in the box and has never been fired. This is the 4.25"" barrel, not the 5"". Has 17+1 capacity.It includes the box, all paperwork, lock, 2 magazines, and extra palm swells for larger or smaller hands. Everything that is included as new. Also includes a LED Radetec ammo count grip. This grip replaces the factory palm swell and has a color changing LED to let you know when you are running low in ammo. The last pic shows the LED advisor on my own M&P carry weapon. It lights blue when I have 4 shots left, green at 3, red at 2, and flashing red at one and empty. Stays dark until you have 4 shots or less.My own M&P 9mm has been a workhorse...5,000 rounds and not one single malfunction! These are excellent weapons.Nobody from Knoxville, too many times I have been left sitting waiting with not even a text saying they can't make it.If you spam me with ""Do you still have the item in question?""

Final price reduction!! This is the Standard Model M1A with 20” GI barrel dropped into the Sage EBR Mod 0 stock. This is the rock solid setup that the U.S Military used to repurpose many of the M14 rifles that were in storage and bring them up to a modern platform with increased accuracy.This M1A EBR features an adjustable stock and adjustable cheekpiece, pistol grip, and plenty of picatinny rail space for added gear. Included with the stock is the Sage Detachable Cantilever Sight Base (DCSB) that provides an absolute rock steady solution for mounting a scope to the rifle. (The scope pictured is also included with the sale). The attached scope is a Nikon Monarch 3 4x-16x BDC reticle and has been sighted in at 100 yards.A few internal upgrades to the rifle were also added such as a Sadlak Op Rod Spring Guide and a SEI Muzzle Brake. The combination of the muzzle brake and the EBR stock produces almost no felt recoil and allows for very quick follow up shots. This rifle is very accurate, typically producing 1 MOA goups, and has been my favorite hog hunting rifle. However I am now looking to sell it for my next project.

I am selling to finance my .308 ambitions. The gun has always run great it is just a duplicate gun for me. I would estimate this gun to have been fired far less than 500 times and run flawlessly.
 
The red dot is brand new. I mounted it last week and have yet to shoot it.
 
Included will be all original back straps, 4 magazines, all brochures and packaged information that I am able to find for both the RDS and the CORE. I will also include a Kydex holster that I bought for the gun. It is left hand draw so the usefulness will depend on you.
 
I am willing to remove the RDS to sell the gun if you are not interested in that. Not interested in removing the RDS to sell that by itself unless you really want it.

Picatinny rails on both sides of the forearm allow installation of other devices.The cheekpiece is vertically adjustable for 1 inch of adjustment without the use of tools so that each shooter, regardless of their facial features, can obtain an optimum cheek weld while still achieving a clear sight picture.The buttstock can be adjusted without tools for lengths of pull from 13.6 to 15.6. This makes the AR-30A1 ergonomically correct for shooters from the 5% female to 95% male. Shooters can also quickly adjust length of pull to accommodate changes in clothing or shooting position. In addition, with a single allen wrench, the buttpad is adjustable for height. A 1913 accessory rail at the bottom of the buttstock allows for installation of additional accessories such as sling swivels or monopods."
