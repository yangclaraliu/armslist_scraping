This rifle is a family gun, owned by my Dad and now by me, since new. I'm pretty sure it's a Pre-Garcia model as I don't see any import marks. It was hunted and shows a few rubs and dings but it's in very nice shape for it's age. It's all original and includes a newer scope. Included with the rifle and scope is some premium ammunition. It shoots like a dream and the chambering is naturally accurate. Nothing wrong with the gun, it's just too nice for me to hunt and my .223 covers this base well. The scope is a 6-24x44 Pursuit. Not fancy but accurate and clear. I prefer a cash FTF deal to an OH resident leagally able to own a firearm.  I'm willing to ship but the rifle but it can only go to an FFL holder in the continental USA at the buyer expense. Shipping (Fed Ex ground) will include insurance.  Please ask questions.  Pictures readily available."

Our hours are M-F: 9am to 530pm and Saturday: 9am to 2pm. RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.   The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"" available as the hunter variant. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.Item #: RFB18UPC_Code: REDACTED78Description: KEL RFB CARB SA RFL 308 20RD BManufacturer: Kel-TecModel #: RFB Rifle Forward Ejection BullpupType: Rifle: Semi-AutoFinish: BlackStock: Black Polymer BullpupSights: No SightsBarrel Length: 18Overall Length: 26Weight: 8 lbsCaliber: 308Capacity: 20+1Action: Semi-Automatic# of Mags: 1 Receiver: Black Polymer With MilSpec Picatinny RailChamber: Muzzle: Flash HiderFeatures: Accepts Standard FAL Type MagazinesRifling 1 in 10"

No visible serial number on the exterior surface, however, a three digit number is stamped inside the trapdoor of the buttplate. In my estimation, which is inline with a professional appraisal, this rifle is all original, with the possible exception that the hammer fly might or might not have been removed at the factory, enabling the rifle to come to a full-cock upon each cycle of the bolt, like that of the Model 1878 Experimental Rifle, rather than half-cock like that of the Model 1880. Condition in my opinion is NRA Antique Fine to Excellent considering that the hammer fly might have been removed at the factory. The action is strong and very smooth. The screw heads are mostly perfect with but a few showing evidence of the slightest use. In my estimation, the metal finish ranges in quality from a bright blue to a rich patina mix of varying shades, coupled with scattered light freckling mostly on the octagon part of the barrel with some on the hammer. The hammer retains most of its case colors. The trapdoor of the buttplate automatically snaps shut upon attempting to close it manually. The wood finish also shows the lightest of scattered handling marks.I will ship ."

Speaking of, I just ordered a hogue grip, replacement stainless guide rod and a stainless 13lb recoil spring to help with recoil. 2 full boxes of shells. And alien gear iwb holster. $400 trade value. That's American money not pesos. Mainly looking for Handguns. Semi auto or revolver. But will listen to any firearm trades. In case you never held one, this gun is small so I tried to show the scale in the picture next to my Walther and my beretta. I live in columbiana/ Chelsea but I work in Inverness so I will prefer to meet on 280. Don't send me the email saying ""call me 555-5555   -bob"" cause I won't. Cause that email is a waist of phone battery. Send me a email with what you have to trade. It's trade only by the way, and if I like it we can work at swapping numbers. Thanks for looking."

Through superior engineering, we have condensed the parts needed to mount a free-floated handguard to a mere 8 screws. Since the handguard mounting surface and upper are of the same forging, not only is it a stronger system, but we are able to make additional lightening cuts to save weight and allow for more efficient cooling.

Ease of installation - Simply insert your barrel assembly into the M4E1 upper, tighten it using the provided barrel nut and wrench, slide your rail on and tighten the rail screws. Within minutes you have a modular, free-floated rail.

The crisp Axis trigger has a pull weight of approximately five pounds. The bolt design is the same as the bolt on the trusted Savage 10/110, a design that allows the lugs to bear evenly on both sides in their respective bolt lug recesses at the front of the action, making for very even pressure on the rear of the cartridge case and assuring consistent alignment of the cartridge with the bore. The uniquely designed recoil lug of the Axis action is not sandwiched between the barrel and receiver as in many rifles, but is inserted into the synthetic stock, meaning that when the stock is removed from the barreled action, the recoil lug goes with it. The bolt handle is a unique design as well, having a skeletonized look from the top side, much like the underside of some bolt handles. The detachable box magazine of the Axis is well-crafted, and easy to insert and remove, even while wearing gloves. Among other premium features, the highly accurate Axis includes an attractive, smooth receiver, a heavily textured grip, a free-floated sporter-taper barrel, a very effective recoil pad, and sling swivel studs. The Axis Predator Package comes with a Bushnell 4-12x40mm scope, mounted and boresighted and is painted in a Mossy Oak Brush camo pattern."
