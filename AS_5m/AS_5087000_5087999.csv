The skeleton frame was made entirely of castings, stampings with coil springs and completely nickel-plated. To load the rifle the barrel pivots to the left at the frame junction, exposing the chamber. A small arm manually ejects the spent case. Clarence Hamiltom and his partners owned Plymouth Windmill Company. Clarence and another fellow made metal air rifles that were sold or given away with windmills. The air rifle buisness soon bacame better than the windmill sales. Plymouth air rifles models 1-6 were made at this plant. Clarence wanted to make a low cost boys rifle and the Hamilton Model 7 was born. He sold off the air rifle and windmill companies and focused on building rifles with his sons. In 1942 the company stopped building rifle to support the war effort. The company never rebounded after the war partially due to failing health of Clarence. Plymouth Air Rifles changed their name to Daisy and you know the rest of that story. The Hamilton No 7 still holds the record for the longest firing pin on a shoulder fired rifle at 9"" long.44,700 No. 7's were made from 1899-1901, of which Mr. Ringbauer, Hamilton Rifle Historian, Author and Collector, estimates 99.9 percent have gone to ""Rifle Heaven"". Reguardless, very few of the rifle exsist. This rifle is fully functional. It does cock and fire. The bore is in great shape but it s missingsome of the plating.The email function has not been working since ArmList  upgraded their site.

Holds 2 bullets in the guns internal magazine. ( Very hard to find from what I've read ) It has a $100+ Weaver 4x28 scope on Weaver mounts. This version has a 14 in. barrel ported with a muzzle break that can be turned on or off. ( It having no stock and the barrel being under 16"" is what classifies it as a pistol which makes it very sought after in states that allow pistols during any type of hunting such as muzzleloading season! ). Please check ""Extra's"" for more on that. ) -Mfg. 1998-2005. These have been out of production for awhile.  Here's the forum I found where a few people said it was legal during muzzle season and also this thread is a good read all around about this gun. http://www.predatormastersforums.com/forums/ubbthr eads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1497998  It's very easy to tote around if you hunt or walk around in treacherous territory and hits hard! If you aren't familiar with the the 7mm-08, like me before the purchase, you will be amazed at the power it has combined with its low recoil.  Please search gunbroker before making a trade offer. Whatever you find also consider this has a $100+ 4x28 Weaver scope and shoots the 7mm-08 ( have yet to find one in this caliber for sale locally since I've had it ) and I have read that these guns are awesome and highly sought after. Either this caliber wasn't made much or no one wants to get rid of there's recently. Factory Pistol Grip Mossberg 500 or Factory Pistol Grip Maverick 88Kel-Tec Sub 2000 ( ones that accept Glock Magazines will be worth more in trade ) PRICE: $680 FIRM will not separate scope. Trade value is $750 unless it's something posted in the items I'm looking for then I'll still consider it close to $700 depending on the item and how high it is on my list. Will be selling this on GunBroker by the time the weekend is over!They seem to be extremely rare and wanted judging by gun broker. Even the none 7- 08mm ones that most people are after sell for $700+ all day. These haven't been manufactured in 10 years. Any state that allows pistols during muzzle loading season you can use this! Which hits much harder than most pistols you will get ahold of for this price without the kick.Thanks! I look forward to hearing offers! Please text at 904-509-zero517. Located in Baker County, but willing to travel the 30 miles to Jacksonville or Lake City if the deal is right.       ""EXTRAS""  Can only be legally used in states that allow you to use pistols during that season. -How I aquired it and why I'm trading or selling it. My original intentions of this purchase was to buy it for a friend that was telling me he has been looking for one a few years so I bought it. He gave up looking for one recently and bought something to take its place. He said he would still purchase it, but if I wanted to try to get a nice trade out of it first to go for it. There are a few things I'm currently wanting so I'm going to give that a try first. If all else fails then I'll sell it on gunbroker right before muzzleloading season because I know it will fetch big money then."

It has a 26 inch light contour barrel and the enhanced engraving on the receiver.  It has all three chokes, choke wrench, and two safety keys that are still attached to the trigger guard.  It also comes with two sight beads on the vented rib, one small metal bead halfway up the barrel and the standard white bead at the end.  The little bit of discoloring you see on the stock is no longer there.  I wiped it down and it came right off.  Not sure what that was.  Buttstock is in great shape.    Remington order number 25057. This is a discontinued model. You can no longer purchase it new in the store. I have more pictures upon request. I acquired this from a friend whose father won it at a DU meeting around 1999 or so.  It has been sitting in its box since then (roughly 16 years old).  It is NOT a DU branded gun (just to be clear).  It did not appear to have ever been fired or assembled when I received it.  I put it together one time to check functionality.  The pump works flawlessly on it and the action is smooth as butter.  It is flawless.  No rust, dents, dings, or even fingerprints to speak of.  I ran some oil over it last night and put it back in the box.  The only thing that seems to be missing is the instruction booklet.  To be honest, I have been torn on whether I want to sell it or not.  It is a really nice gun.  I have other projects I am working on and too many guns in the safe as it is.  The pictures tell the story.  It is a beautiful piece of Remington history.  Grab it before it is gone.  My price is fair and my trades are too.  I am interested in a NEW ONLY Vortex Strike Eagle AND a Vortex Sparc II for an even trade.  I would take one or the other and some cash to boot.  Cash price is 600 firm.  I will not budge on that so please do not ask.  Anything comparable I have been able to find online is between 750-900 bucks and most of them are used."
