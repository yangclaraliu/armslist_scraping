The GLOCK G34 Semi-Auto Pistol is meant for competition shooting, though it also serves well for a tactical handgun. The G34 has a long slide that reduces muzzle flip considerably to keep the user on target during rapid fire. This semi-automatic pistol utilizes a dual recoil spring assembly that substantially increases spring life. A modular back strap allows shooters to instantly customize the grip to an individual shooter's hand size, or to cold weather gloves. The polymer frame has a ""rough"" texture that provides a sure hold on the pistol in adverse conditions, and the enlarged magazine catch is reversible, accommodating left or right-handed shooters. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of a plethora of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The GLOCK G34 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable, accurate and extremely controllable handgun, making it an ideal choice for USPSA and IDPA practical shooting competitions, as well as self-defense.

The conversion has run well with the stock 40 S&W extractor and has allowed me to practice with 9mm lead bullet reloads.   This gun has one the best triggers of all of my Glocks (which I’ll miss). I also have an extra “extended” magazine release I’ll include.  If you really don't want the conversion kit I may consider selling the gun by itself.Please include a valid phone number with your email our I will not respond.  I'll remove this listing when this is no longer available.

Retailer description follows:Product Description730131 Features: -Gun sight.-Reticle: Red dot.-Multi-coated optics.-Amber-bright high-contrast lens coating.-Dry-nitrogen filled.-CR2032 battery.-Magnification: 1x.-Objective lens: 28mm. Construction: -100pct Waterproof / fogproof / shockproof construction. Color/Finish: -Color: Matte.From the ManufacturerEngineered with Amber-Bright optics which quickly help you distinguish between a brown tree and an equally brown critter, the Trophy riflescopes have long been heralded by hunters as the ideal scope for the autumn deer woods. For those willing to admit their addiction to hunting goes far deeper than an opening day drive, you'll appreciate the multi-coated optics for increased brightness in low light conditions. Fast-focus eyepiece and a wide-angle field-of-view ensure instant target acquisition, and 1/4 M.O.A. fingertip, audible/resettable adjustments make windage and elevation tuning quick and easy. With 100% fogproof, waterproof and shockproof construction, they're designed to excel during the day's most important times.Specifications for this Bushnell scope include:    Power: 1x    Objective lens: 28mm    Field of view at 1,000 yards: 68 feet    Reticle: 6 M.O.A. Dot Tech TalkMagnification (Power): scopes are often referred to by two numbers separated by an ""x"". For example: 4x40. The first number is the power or magnification of the scope. With a ""4x"", the object being viewed appears to be four times closer than when seen with the unaided eye.Objective Lens Size: The second number in the formula (4x40) is the diameter of the objective or front lens. The larger the objective lens, the more light that enters the scope, and the brighter the image.Field of View (F.O.V.): The side-to-side measurement of the circular viewing field or subject area. It is defined by the width in feet or meters of the area visible at 1000 yards or meters. A wide angle binocular features a wide field of view and is better for following action. Generally, the higher the magnification, the narrower the field of view.Reticle: A reticle is the crosshair or pattern placed in the eyepiece of the scope which establishes the gun's position on the target."

You point, pull the trigger and they go “bang.” The G 21 holds 13 + 1 when fully loaded, and it still weighs less than a full sized 1911 empty. Pull out a 1911 in an emergency and forget to take off the safety (if carried in a cocked and locked position) or forget to cock it in a panic situation, and you just might be a “long gone pecan.”Pull out the G 21 and pull the trigger, doesn't get any more complicated than that, plus you have party favors for (14). Only $545. You can't even come close to buying a quality 1911 for that. When you put your life on the line, only buy quality and proven track record firearms no matter what caliber you choose.Everything I own is either in LNIB condition or NIB and Un-fired condition. I am a gun enthusiast and a private gun owner, and don't need to sell anything, but just re-adjusting what I have.Will need a signed “Bill Of Sale” for the both of us. ""PLEASE NO TEXT"
