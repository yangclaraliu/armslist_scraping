""The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing 45 ammo, Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol."" NOT my words but a great explanation of this amazing Pistol."

(Amazing rubberish material on the grips) Accessories: Lone Wolf 4 port barrel RYG Phantom Adjustable Trigger Lighting Strike Titanium Slave Plunger Ghost/Wolff Ultimate Competition trigger kit (3.5lb) Tru Glo Brite Sites Green/Red Glockstore Gold 3 pin kit Glockstore Gold Slide Release Glockstore Gold Slide Lock Glockstore Big Mouth Magwell w/3oz. insert RYG Extended Mag Release RYG Engraved Slide Plate (see photos) RYG Engraved Mag Base Plates (see photos) I have the factory parts as well, if the theme isn't your style (pink isnt for everyone! just going for unique) The gun shoots amazing, trigger is extremely crisp and the ports help tremendously with muzzle flip. I'm setting a price somewhere in between price of what I'm seeing stock G34s going for, and what i have in it (1200ish) But feel free to make me cash offers.. nothing insulting of course. ASKING PRICE IS $750 OBO Thank You Justin REDACTED (Text or Call.. Faster than email response) REDACTED"

I bought it new in October (the date stamp on the barrel is 8/2015) and have put exactly 50 rounds though it.  I was given a 6.5 Creedmoor barrel that I want to play with, so I am putting this 308 barrel up for sale.  This pics look terrible, but it really is in great shape.  There is no corrosion or dings.  It was broken in properly, cleaned with a wet patch between each shot for the first 40.  It shoots very well.  I only shot from a bipod, but didn't have any trouble shooting 1 MOA groups with factory loads.  I suspect it would do very well with 175 Fed GMM.

This rifle comes with a factory 10-round magazine and shows a few handling marks but is in overall very good condition. It has a couple of modifications made by a previous owner. I was going to accessorize and restore the original features, but as noted, I have too many other projects and I'm invested in another proven platform. I have not fired this rifle. The forward sling mount has been modified with a sling stud presumably for mounting a Harris bipod but that's just a guess.

1. PC Armament enhanced trigger guard with screw kit: $20
This is perfect for those folks that hate pounding in roll pins on OEM trigger guards. This one screws right in. 6061 aircraft aluminum with A-8625 milpec coating.

2. UAG single point rear sling mount quick disconnect with QD swivel: $20
This is another quality product from Ultimate Arms Gears. Replaces your rear buffer tube plate for the best, properly weighted single point sling mount location.

3. UAG 45 degree offset reflex sight mount: $15
Perfect for mounting that offset reflex sight. From Ultimate Arms Gear. Incl. allen wrench.

4. UAG 1/2"" riser scope/reflex sight mount with QD lever: $20
When using smaller red dots or reflex sights as main optic, you already know they don't co-witness with your iron sights. You will need a 1/2"" riser to accomplish this. Another great product from Ultimate Arms Gear.

5. Yankee Hill style front and rear flip up sights (A2 co-witness): $25
These are decent metal flip up sights that are basically patterned after the YHM ones. You already know how much those cost. These would be fine to use as backup sights in an emergency situation if your optic battery dies. It would be better than nothing for sure!

6. OEM milspec PSA .223/5.56 1/2x28 cage muzzle brake: $10
Your everyday milspec OEM cash flash hider/muzzle brake. Nothing more to say!

Will sell the lot for $75. My minimum meet price on these individually will be $25 out here in S. Hill Puyallup.

.223/5.56 = 300 rounds (brass only. Commercial reloads okay; no personal loads)
30-06 = 200 rounds (brass only; clean military surplus or commercial okay)
12 GA 3-1/2"" BBB steel/Hevi-Shot 1500 fps (or better) = 150 rds
12 GA 2-3/4"" or 3"" 00 buck (Rio okay) = 200 rds

Featuring the TriNyte Corrosion Control System, the Model 700 XCR stretches
the durability limits of stainless steel by coating the stainless steel
barrel and receiver with matte black TriNyte for a more classic look with
less glare for superior stealth. It's every bit as impervious to extreme
conditions, with the same proven track record in accelerated saltwater
testing. TriNyte delivers scratch and corrosion resistance dramatically
superior to standard stainless steel as well any protective coating by any
other manufacturer. The Model 700 XCR II is also optimized for sure
handling in adverse climates. Its feature-laden olive drab green synthetic
stock is a technological marvel that looks and feels the part with Hogue
rubber overmolding featured at the grip and forend areas. These
revolutionary enhancements give you a positive grip in the slickest
environments. Shots are made infinitely more comfortable with the SuperCell
recoil pad. X-Mark Pro Trigger System gives a level of crispness and shot
control once only available through high-dollar customization. Choose from
a wide range of hard-hitting big-game cartridges, all delivered with the
track-driving accuracy only a legendary Model 700 barreled action could
produce.

This model can cycle anything from 2 3/4"" trap/skeet loads to 3 1/2"" Turkey loads with the stability of a 28"" barrel. This model has the ribbed high-grade polymer so no constant upkeep of a wood finish and less steel area for risk of rusting. Also has the Forend Shell Stop Button which Benelli designed to allow you to cycle out the live round without having to empty the entire magazine. The gun is used, but has been very well taken care of. It does have some light scratches not very easily noticed on the stock and one small blemish on the rib of the barrel (as shown in pictures). Overall the guns looks great and has never let me down, only reason i'm selling is to upgrade to a Super Black Eagle II. 

Gun comes with:
- 2 choke tubes 
- Black Adjustable Sling for ease of carry to the blind or setting decoys 
- Max-5 RipGut Pattern Floating Gun Case with Padded Strap 

Will take $375 cash for everything

Local Pickup Only. I live in Carrollton, TX, but travel often to Fort Worth so would be willing to meet up if more convenient.

There is no more durable, reliable pump shotgun than a Model 1300 Black Shadow. The non-glare matte finish of the barrel and receiver won’t give away your position to wary waterfowl and the durable composite stock and forearm are up to any abuse a day afield can dish out. The hard working Speed Pump action fires all factory steel, tungsten, bismuth and lead shot compatible 2¾"" and 3"" magnum loads. 

This is the 12 gauge 28"" barrel Winchoke model with modified choke installed. The shotgun has never been shot and is like new. It does have some very fine handling/safe marks but is truly in new condition.

$1,300 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.  Will also sell just the rifle for $1,100, the scope for $150 and I'll keep the mount.

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal and the value is there, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now and am needing some tires in the next month or so.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? so I know the deal.

Trades considered: 

I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos right now.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.

Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Also, Pmags for both AR-15 and AR-10.

Ammo to help complete a deal in the common calibers 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.

1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.

Different optics, red dots like Eotech and Aimpoint and nice scopes, Leupold, Nikon and Trijicon.

The Remington Model 1858 was one of the most powerful and rugged single-action revolvers of its day. Easily removable, replaceable cylinders made reloading extremely fast. A compact version of the original, the realistic Pietta Model 1858 New Army .44 Caliber Black Powder Revolver boasts the same performance with a polished brass trigger guard, blued steel construction, octagonal barrel and walnut grips. The 5-1/2” barrel makes it easier to holster and handle. So, you get 2 cylinders, the .44 blackpowder & .45LC conversion cylinder, like 2 revolvers for the price of one. Also comes with the sturdy leather holster in the pictures. I Fired it once at the range to test it out, both the blackpowder and conversion cylinders, and it's one powerful beast. Everything is really new, as in almost new condition, as I've had it about 6 months, and initial cost for me was around $535.00 for everything. Selling b/c I need money to travel & see dad in FL. If you pick it up locally here in Sheridan Wyoming, I'll give you almost 2 boxes ammo- 90 rounds.

Up for sale is a DSA SA58 FAL Carbine with 500 rounds through it. It is chambered in 7.62x51mm. The rifle   is in VG+ condition, with the exception of some finish wear on the rail from a Larue Tactical mount, minor handling marks, and typical finish wear on the dust cover from ejected brass. I am the original owner and I bought it NIB last January. This gun has a forged receiver, versus the new ones which are all cast. If you are looking for the poor man’s SCAR-H, this is it! As best I can tell, this gun is all US made with the possible exception of the bolt carrier, which has a small star and a square on the front face. The original case, paperwork and take-offs will be included. Here’s the rundown:

Forged type 1 receiver

16” barrel

Full length gas system

DSA railed handguard

Larue Index Clips on 3 sides of the handguard

DSA railed top cover

The SureFire X400U-A-RD Ultra WeaponLight integrates powerful, high intensity 500 lumen white light illumination and high visibility laser aiming capabilities in one compact rail mountable package, an extremely effective combination for close to longer range engagements in law enforcement, military, and self-defense applications. 

A high performance LED generates 500 lumens of brilliant white light that is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a beam with a bright central area, providing greatly extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The X400 Ultra produces tactical level lightï¿½enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark adapted visionï¿½for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

The X400 Ultra's laser is located below the primary light, and its aiming adjustment mechanism uses Nylok screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The X400U-A-RD Ultra features our original high visibility 5-milliwatt / 635 nm red laser.

The versatile X400 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock system permits rapid attachment/detachment to either universal or Picatinny rails. Its integral ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional DG grip switches are available for use with a pistol, and an XT07 tape switch permits the X400 Ultra to be activated when attached to a long gun without altering your grip on your weapon. 

The high strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture.

And thatâ��s exactly what youâ��re going to get with Vortexâ��s new Strike Eagle 1-6 x 24.

Whether youâ��re burning through a 3-Gun Stage, logging some range time, or holding for hair on a coyote youâ��ve duped into thinking youâ��re lunch, the Strike Eagle is up to the task. High-quality, fully multi-coated lenses deliver a clear, crisp sight picture and optimal low-light performance. A true one-power on the low end of its 6x zoom range provides quick target acquisition in close quarters scenarios. Need to engage targets at distance? Crank it up to 6x and let it rip.
