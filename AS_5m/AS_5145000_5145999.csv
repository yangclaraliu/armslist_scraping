I'm looking to purchase a small pistol, or a snub-nose revolver. Recently there have been a number of break-ins close to me, and my home doesn't have a security system installed. This worries me immensely as my fiancee and I live by ourselves. It would be put into a small gunsafe and used in emergencies, and to plink at targets so that we may aquaint ourselves better with the gun. Please email me with any offers. Pictures are very much appreciated, and where you aquired it is always nice. Thank you, and have a fantastic day."

First, a Burris FastFire III red dot reflex sight with custom base plate mount (currently unmounted) but mounts quickly and easily where the factory rear sights mount. The Mark II is equipped with adjustable sights and a front blade sight for silencer clearence. Also included is the EFK Firedragon threaded barrel. I did my research and the EFK is without a doubt the best threaded barrel one can buy for the Five Seven. (factory barrel also included). The EFK silencer adapter is included as well. Ammunition is a big part of this deal as I have about 450.00 worth of it. You get all the shooting loads like 5+ boxes of American Eagle FMJ, you get 6 boxes of FN ammo (3 boxes of SS197 and 3 of SS 195) You also get some carry ammunition, 2 boxes of SS 198LF (green tips - 6 rounds to make sure the gun liked it) and the topping, 2 boxes of Elite Ammunition's  T6 armor piercing...this is very expensive. To round it out, a belt slide OWB holster. Total you are looking at almost 2,400.00 here not including taxes. This gun is LIKE NEW! I put 300-350 rounds through the factory barrel, and 1 box (50) throught the threaded barrel...that's IT! This gun was purchased brand new last Fall, again it is like new. No trades please.

Also included is the EFK Firedragon threaded barrel. I researched this at lenght and the EFK is heads and shoulders above the Jarvis barrel. You also have the factory barrel as well as a thread protector and the EFK Thread adapter for a silencer. Ammunition is a big part of this deal as there is 450.00 worth of it. First the target ammo, 5+ boxes of American Eagle FMJ. You have 3 boxes of FN SS195 and 3 boxes of FN 193. Also included is some carry ammo, 2 boxes (100 rds)...make that 94 of SS198LF. This is the green tip Law Enforcement round and I did shoot 6 of them to make sure the gun liked it. Finally you get 2 boxes of Elite Ammunition's T6 armor piercing ammunition. This is very expensive stuff guys and impossible to get. To round it all out, a nice belt slide OWB holster. All in all, you are at $2,400.00 here not including taxes. Again this gun is like new! I have put around 300-350 rounds through the factory barrel and 50 through the threaded barrel. email, call, or text 423 737-36O TwoThanks, Michael"
