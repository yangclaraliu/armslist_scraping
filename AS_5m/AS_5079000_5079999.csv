Some marks on it but still looks very nice. It holds air perfectly and does not leak an ounce even over long periods of time. I would like to sell but would entertain trades like 22 rifles. It just doesnt get used and i prefer my Discovery because its easier to pump and you get more shots per fill. This however has crazy speeds. I checked its speeds at up to 1200 fps with JSB jumbos. On low setting youll get around 24 shots and all shots touching at 25 yards. Very accurate for an airgun. I would keep it if it was my first pcp but its not so it needs to go and actually get used. Will come with a ton of pellets but no pump. It is fitted for the standard nipple like what comes on the desco. I can sent more upclose pictures upon request at 419 three450688

Other milled-receiver AK's are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability. Summary: The SAM7R is a 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, with a milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length butt stock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger. Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology. Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber. Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor butt stock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies. 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines. AK scope rail. This gun is brand new and never been fired.

645,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5079645,For Sale:  Enfield No4 Mk1T sniper made by Long Branch in 1945,"Texas, Texas, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Tuesday, January 19, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This No4 Mk1* (T)sniper rifle was manufactured at the end of WWII by the Long Branch Arsenal during 1945 which manufactured a total of only 992 No4 Mk1* T's. It has matching serial numbers on the receiver, magazine, forearm and bolt. It has an excellent 25 inch 5 grooved bore with bright and sharp lands. The headspace is good on a 0.067"" armourers gauge with a No '3' bolt head. The firing pin protrusion is 0.045 inch. The action is very good, tight and clean. The metal shows 99% of the blue finish with a little wear on the edges. It has a good BLO finish to the walnut stock with no cracks or major dings. The butt stock is stamped with the serial number of the scope it was set up with (1890 over another which is illegible). The scope mounts are original with no indications of the screws being re-locked (piened). The scope was produced by REL (Research Enterprises Ltd) with excellent optics and adjustments, complete with original leather lens cover with the broad arrow marking (maybe British as most Canadian equipment was marked C broad arrow). This appears to have been refurbished. Some witness marks of usage on the tube from the leather scope cups are present. The REL scopes were thought by some to be superior quality to the British scopes. The Brits may be excused as they were being bombed during production by the Germans. The wood forearm and hand guards are dark walnut wood. The rear hand guard has a arsenal repair applied at the rear. The butt stock is lighter in color and is stamped and painted with numerous numbers. The cheek piece appears to be of oak wood. This rifle has seen service in the Far East WWII theatre (India) from little patches of green paint on the metal which they used as a secondary protective. It has a serialized standard ten round magazine. This excellent condition is commensurate with one of the WW II Enfields' which has seventy years service. This will complete a collection with a rare Long Branch snipe.......NO TRADESEMAIL ME DIRECTLY @   rolleven659@gmail.com"

The SAIGA-12 features world renowned AK47 reliability! The factory tactical conversion moves the original trigger guard next to the magazine latch and installs a customized USA G2 trigger group and a premium CAA pistol grip with interchangeable back straps to fit any size hand. Next, the barrel is cut and a monster muzzle break is permanently attached. This gives you the shortest legal barrel length, including the muzzle break, of just 18.25 inches! We install a Galil style folding stock system. This is mfg. in the USA from aluminum for maximum strength and minimum weight. The folding / locking mechanism is rock solid- no wobble, it locks up super tight. When folded, you can easily access the trigger for compact hip firing. It includes a side swivel for attaching single point or other tactical slings. We also install a custom rubber recoil pad on the stock butt to help reduce felt recoil. The SunOptics 250 lumen LED light / red laser combo is ultra-compact. You can chose from 3 settings; light only, laser only, or light/laser combo. The toggle switch is ergonomic and can be adjusted and turned on/off with just one finger. The 250 lumen LED light is blinding, and the red laser allows for instant target acquisition at night, indoors, and during low light conditions. It comes with two CR123A lithium batteries. The aluminum quad-rail system gives you maximum flexibility for mounting any optic, sight, tactical light, or laser sighting system. It is both lightweight and provides maximum strength. We include protective black rubber rail guards with the aluminum quad-rail. The UTG machined aluminum vertical foregrip is rock solid and folds flat under the bottom of the quad-rail. The SAIGA-12 side-folding tactical package also includes: Promag 12rd drum magazine, Promag 10rd stick magazine, Promag 5rd stick magazine, and a MaxOps A-Tac single point sling that features the HK style positive hook system with quick release option**"
