My trusts are 20+ pages and cover the numerous issues related to NFA items for you and your beneficiaries. A gun trust enables you to purchase suppressors, short barreled rifles and fully automatic rifles without the hassles (and often impossibility) of a chief law enforcement officer signature as well as other bureaucratic red tape. As a firearms enthusiast, I want to see more people enjoying the benefits of NFA items and, because this isn't my primary source of income, I can offer my services at $199 for a trust. This includes an initial in-person or phone consultation to determine how to best serve your needs, all fees and documents, an electronic copy of your final trust documents, a guide to how to best use your trust as well as an appendix of ATF advisory letters and forms. While there are cheaper “fill-in-the-blank” trusts available online, the ATF has given negative feedback on many of these as not being well drafted and having the potential to expose the user to criminal and civil penalties. Not only am I licensed and in good standing in Florida, but I am also licensed and in good standing in Arkansas and Texas and can assist with trusts in those states as well. I prefer cash, but am willing to accept trades of equivalent value at my discretion. Please contact me, David Kronenfeld, at 2ndamendmenttrusts@gmail.com to inquire about my services."

UPDATE: TRADE OFFER PENDING tonight, but rather have cash than trade.  Please do some research before responding; this is NOT the base version that Walmart sells for $275.  Most are asking $400 for this model (H004) before taxes (Academy, Walmart, etc).  Gunbroker prices are around $450."

Prefer all cash but will consider Glock Gen4 magazines in 9mm, 45acp or 10mm in trade. I value them at $25.00 each since that is what I can buy them new for. Also, standard capacity, not 10 round, except for the G26 and G30. Also consider a 9mm conversion barrel for the Glock 27 Gen4.
Don’t send a text/email asking “what’s your lowest price?” I am not going to bid against myself. Make an offer and include your name and a valid telephone number. I will not respond to emails/texts without a name and number.include “stock” in any text."

With its low felt recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down.For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made.As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot.The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it’s transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining zero. The rifle’s M1913 optics rail has a 27 MOA taper to take full advantage of the scope’s elevation travel.Price: $7999.99 eachA credit card fee will be charged for this particular firearm."
