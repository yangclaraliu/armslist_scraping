417,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5437417,"For Sale:  Kahr PM9 DLC 5 mags, leather","Ozark, Dothan, Alabama",$ 600,"Listed On: Monday, July 4, 2016",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Reluctantly I'm selling my long time carry gun - due principally to my better hit-abilities with the new baby Glock.  This Kahr PM9 has been carried much/ shot little (660 rounds).  Mind you this premium brand is of a much higher quality than a Glock (fit, finish and materials used) but the facts are what they are and results are what's important to me.  So while many people shoot better with a Double Action gun (like this one) I shoot better with a striker fired Glock.  This version, Model# PM9094, uses drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights and has the upgraded DLC treatment; now with complimentary love-hug marks from holster carry (not a concern with a DLC finish).  It comes with 5 OEM magazines (2 x 6 rounds, 3 x 7 rounds) and can be carried in a plus 1 condition.  Additionally this sale includes the original hard case (with all its' original packagings), two extra magazine base plates and two pieces of leather: an outside waist belt carry holster (right hand side) and a separate spare magazine carrier.To see if this gun suits you I'm willing to meet you at the Tristategunclub.net range in Daleville; bring your preferred 9mm ammo (if not a member you'll need to first sign a club waiver).  I generally use cheap 115 gr. FMJ for range training.  For defensive use, with its 3.1"" polygonal rifling barrel I load heavier 124 gr. hollow points.  I've previously tested (successfully) loading/firing 147 gr. FMJ ammo.  One more additional feature, this Kahr is rated for +P ammo but as I worried about long term use I have only occassionally shot any; of course it too worked.The only ammo I've found that wasn't reliable came from Freedom Munitions (FM).  FM defensive ammo often hung up chambering the very first round - but if/when it chambered it always went bang, ejected properly and then successfully chambered the following round.  Allow me to modify that, recently I had some Winchester white box (WWB) rounds that were struck but didn't fire (but in fairness, that same box of ammo demonstrated the same problem with another gun); previously my older stock WWB worked fine.The legalese still applies: to purchase this you need an Alabama drivers license, or alternativly be active duty military and stationed in Alabama.  Also a concealed carry permit to make me feel better; without one I'd question - why look at a concealed class of handgun?  Finally ... under those conditions this private sale will incur no FFL fees or sales tax!  Note: without those docs we can still complete this sale thru an FFL dealer, at an additional expense (typically $25). More photos are available; just email your phone and/or email addy and I'll forward them to you.  Same thing for any questions.  As I previously stated, I'm reluctant to see this go but the Glock is now my go to weapon and my safe has only so much room.I'm trying real hard to think of any trades that'd peak my interest - No long guns/shotguns and I already have my glock limit (17,19,43), except for the 34.I would give preference to a quality name full size handgun in 9mm or a flat sided .22 Buckmark w/many magazines + cash.  I'm really pushed for room in the safe and don't need anymore toys."

I love the gun, however I don't shoot it very often bc I don't want to damage it because it is so nice. I took it on a trade and have shot it 20 times and the previous ower did not shoot it much either. I just want it to go to a new home where it made be used more instead of being a safe queen, as it is now.I will sell outright, but am more interested in trades really. I am in no hurry to get rid of it so please no low ball offers.Tades interested in would be an OD/Battle Field green glock 19, 26, or 17 (preferably gen 4). I am also interested in any Glock MOS models in 9mm (19,17,or 34) or possibly a custom Glock (Zev,etc) with boot on either end. Also, high end aks (no underfolders), or a benelli m4(h2 or h2o?) edition, other handguns or multi gun trades would be considered of course ( OD Fnx 45 Tactical), can add money if yours if worth more or would take cash to even out the trade value (1400) but that is what I'm looking for. I will post pics but can send more if needed, I would like to meet in the Nashville area or close to it, but I will travel for the right deal. All trades considered other than black powder or archery (have never been into that sort of thing) but the right offer won't be over looked. Also looking for a good plate carrier with plates, I'm a L/XL. I am not interested in shipping. Must be able to LEGALLY own a firearm in Tennessee. Handgun carry permit holders will be considered, but no felons or out of state residents. Thanks, serious buyers will get my cell phone number and we can exchange pics there or through email, whichever is easiest. My absolute desire would be a Gen 4 OD/Battlefield green 19 or 17 and 26 for which I would probably trade straight up for 2 of them (or close to it). Thanks for looking and I am very busy with work so if i don't immediately respond, don't take offense, I may have you sign a bill of sale, I'm not sure yet but wanted to mention it. No resanable offer will be turned down, I can use the cash to buy the guns I am wanting. Thanks and have a great day. I also have a Leupold Mark 6 for sale as well. I have been away from my email lately and terrible at getting back to people's offers. This is still available and the post has been updated slightly.

This was after they moved to NC in 2011 so I know their customer service survived the transition.Buy from me with confidence."

This gun shoots amazing, it only has 200 rounds through it and that was only for breaking in the barrel and then sighting it in. It shoots 5 shot groups at 200 yards the size of a nickel and has never given me any issues. The only reasonI'mselling is to fund a different project. Have over 1700 into the gun. 1300 or  make a offer  .REDACTED thanks"
