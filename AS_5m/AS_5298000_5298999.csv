You will not find a better deal than these. The ammo cans are GRADE 1. They show very little use. Some a little surface rust and dings, but there are no dents or holes. Any flaws are simply cosmetic. These ammo cans have been converted into great handgun cases! There are two options for these gun cases: military grade foam or regular foam. The military grade foam only has cutouts for 4 magazines. The military grade foam is much more rigid than the other foam option, which has cutouts for 8 magazines. The picture should give the general idea about the gun cases. You can get full size handguns in these cases. A full size 1911 is about the maximum size. These gun cases are great because you can just grab them and go. I charge $55 for the military grade foam and $50 for the regular grade foam. I will do deals on purchases of 5 or more cases. Please feel free to contact me with questions. Thanks!

KRISS Vector CRB Gen. 2: Carbine / Semi. / 16"" barrel / M4 stock / 13 rds / .45ACP / FDE

Experience one of the most innovative developments in modern firearms technology with the patented KRISS Vector Platform. At the heart of each Vector is the Super V Recoil Mitigation System. This unique operating system redirects energy down, and away from the shooter, which eliminates felt recoil and muzzle climb.


The KRISS Vector GEN II is the next evolution of the Vector platform, taking it from a firearm into a multi-caliber weapon system. Chambered in .45ACP and 9mm, the KRISS Vector is compatible with the ubiquitous Glock magazine. Changing between calibers can be done in seconds, without any tools. The KRISS Vector GEN II is more ergonomic with a redesigned trigger, a short throw ambidextrous safety lever, and a more comfortable pistol grip.


The KRISS Vector CRB is the non-NFA, semi-automatic, carbine variant with a 16â�� barrel. The DEFIANCE KRISS Stock provides a wide range of adjustment and length of pull. Additional standard equipment on the KRISS Vector CRB are the flip sights, full length picatinny top rail, lower picatinny accessory rail, and a Glock magazine. The CRB is civilian legal with compliant models available for most states."

No, this is a gun to be kept at the bedside, ready for behavior modification on bad people who want to go bump in the night. Loaded with up to six rounds of 2 ¾” or 3” shot, its twelve gauge bite is even worse than its thunderous bark, and that says a lot. This H&R shotty is crafted in China by Qiqihar Hawk Industries Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China North Industries Corporation. Commonly referred to as Norinco, most gun fanciers know China North Industries as a major producer of inexpensive SKS and AK-pattern rifles. Hawk confines itself to making shotguns, including a slew of clones of the classic Remington 870 sold under the H&R name. Oh, and H&R is an affiliate of Remington, which is part of the Freedom Group, which is owned by Cerberus Capital Management. Got that? Thus, the H&R/Hawk alliance reflects the modern era where money-loving American capitalists and money-grubbing Chinese communists come together like lions and lambs to sing “Cumbayá” and peddle inexpensive defensive firearms to a grateful American public. The deal twixt the two companies might not be Mao Zedong’s idea of a Great Leap Forward, but the rest of us can enjoy one of the fruits of this cross-cultural incest: the H&R Pardner Pump Protector."

While in the holster, its super-resistant Bruniton finish makes it stand up to sweat even on scorching summer days, while also making it more impervious to corrosion between shooting and cleaning. This handgun offers a great number of useful tactical features, without compromising on its military-style sturdiness and toughness. The magazine well is beveled, for lightning-quick tactical mag-changes without taking your eyes off the target. The combat trigger guard facilitates the use of the handgun while wearing gloves, as well as an ideal and secure placement of the off-hand; also, the front and backstrap are checkered to ensure a positive and consistent grip. Lastly, an integral Picatinny rail enables the easy mounting of tactical accessories such as lighting and sighting systems--without any gunsmithing or modification to the pistol. Engineered to withstand the hardest use in the most demanding conditions around the world, the M9A1 meets and exceeds the standards of reliability of professional military and law enforcement. This handgun will reliably feed most commercial ammunition designs, including the wider hollow-points and the hardest-hitting +P. An attractive, perfectly-engineered pistol for most uses including competition. Also available with stainless-steel finish."

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾”  threaded barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.

A long recoil spring is located in the butt of the stock, simplifying assembly and allowing it to cycle a wide variety of loads across the power spectrum in both 2 ¾” and 3”. In addition, the rearward spring design makes required cleanings less frequent and easier when they are needed. Removal of the installed magazine plug is simple, requiring only the magazine cap to be unscrewed. Without the plug it gives the upland hunter a 4+1 capacity. With superb balance and an average weight of 7.4 lbs, the 912 is well-suited to the pursuit of both birds and clays. Less then 150 rounds fired. Comes with Three Chokes & Key in Original Box."
