Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have PLENTY already, so...1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics to help, but I have nice optics sitting now for future projects.Ftf in the Dallas area or will ship insured for $40 more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

Well, a couple of days after we got the new tv my wife finds warranty papers on the tv that quit. Long story short, the warranty replaced the television today and we don't need it. We can't use the Yamaha receiver due to it not being 4k(which kind of sucks because it is a beast, much stronger than the new Sony 4k receiver).The TV was picked up today at Plaza Electronics in Athens, TN and the price is $799 plus tax. The Yamaha receiver can be found online for $238.50.TV is a Sanyo DP58D33B 58"" LED-LCD 1080p HDTV and the receiver is a Yamaha HTR-6040 5.1 AV receiver with a second set of speaker hookups for another room.TV is $500 OBO and the receiver is $100 OBO, or $550 OBO for both.Would like to trade for a Kel-Tec PF9 or something similar plus cash.Looking mainly for a summer yard/fishing handgun or revolver(Kel-Tec PF9, Ruger LC9s, .38 or .357 Mag Revolver, .22lr or .22 Mag Revolver or Semi)Feel free to make any offer.

This kit is for the gen 3 model not the gen 4 and works in 9mm glocks except the 43. So that means it'll work in the 17, 19, and 26. If I missed a model sorry. But if you have any questions feel free to ask, again this trigger was only installed and dry fired that is allllllllll. Paid 180$ for it asking 150$ which I think is fair considering."

The lower was initially from a complete M4A1 rifle and the upper was purchased later directly from Daniel Defense using the ""build your own"" feature they used to have on their site, made to the same specs as the M4v11. The rifle is 100% Daniel Defense factory built with matching Cerakote and is exactly the same as a DDM4v11 but has no M4v11 markings. $1200 firm, FTF sale in the Crystal Coast area. I'll drive reasonable distances but will not ship.NO TRADES PLEASE.REDACTED"
