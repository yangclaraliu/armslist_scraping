I did put this grip on just to see how it looked and felt, but ended up going with the other grip. The gun was never fired or carried with this grip on. So, other than being put on and then immediately taken off, this grip is brand new. LG-344 laser sights feature Crimson Trace’s® rubber-overmold construction around a sturdy polymer grip frame. Providing equal comfort and control compared to stock Ruger grips, the LG-344 is compatible with Ruger wood panels (Super Redhawk). Lasergrips® with your Ruger revolver are ideal for personal protection from threats walking on four legs as well as two. Fits GP 100 & Super Redhawk, including Alaskan. Stock wood panels from GP 100 will only fit LG-344 Lasergrips® if you have a GP 100 with adjustable rear sights. The fixed sight panels are too small, but you may purchase compatible panels from Ruger. Accepted forms of payment include certified check or money order. Will ship next day after receiving payment.

Comes with its original box just like new, with all paperwork, cleaning rod, lock and mag loader.  Includes the 3 mags that all Gen4s include, plus an extra Gen4 mag purchased in addition.  The 4th mag has had its baseplate changed to a Pierce +2 Grip extension, but also includes the original baseplate should the purchaser decide to put it back to OEM.  

Changed out the factory white sights for XS Big Dot Night Sights after a couple training courses and trying them and based on extensive favorable reviews raving about them.  Great sights and these $100 sights will stay on the pistol.  Including the packaging for them as well as the original factory sights.  Also includes a Glockmeister plug to fill the void in the handgrip.

If you wanted to put together a similar package Glock 23 with night sights, and an extra mag, you could expect around $700.  New Glock Gen4 23s in Ft Wayne are running right around $550 to $600 without night sights, only 3 mags and definetely without a holster.  My package was probably around $750 total (G4 G23 is @$600 new + XS Big Dot Night Sights $100 + Extra Mag with +2 Pierce Grip Extension $25 + Blackhawk Serpa CQC Holster $25 = total cost of $750)"

Only selling because I am selling my Glock 23 to fund the purchase of a long sought after 45 pistol instead.  This laser sight has been well taken care of.  I am not a law enforcement officer and this sight has only been on my pistol a short time and most of that time has been in my bedside pistol safe.  I have kept the original box with inserts, swabs, push tool, foam and instructions plus grip pin and batteries.  The batteries were just opened and tested.  I have cleaned this laser sight after each range trip following the instructions.  It performs 100% as all Crimson Trace lasers do.  All of my defense pistols wear Crimson Trace lasers of one form or another and if I had a Glock 19 or another 23, I would definetely be keeping it.  Crimson Trace customer service is amazing, as well.  I placed a call about a rail mounted laser and asked about batteries, and they were nice enough to send me batteries for all 7 of my crimson trace products FREE OF CHARGE!  There is a reason Crimson Trace is considered the best out there.  I have tried many other laser sights years ago, including some that are as expensive or more expensive and Crimson Trace just does it better. 

You will not find a nicer or cleaner used LG-851, this unit will serve you for many years and for $20-40 less than new.

I am just a regular guy who protects my family so I stand behind something that I sell you that you may use to protect yours.  If you have any questions, send me a message.  If you are not satisfied with this CT lasergrip, send me a message and we will work it out."
