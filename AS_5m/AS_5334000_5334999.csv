No I don't have the original wood before anyone asks. I would be keeping the rifle, but needing something a bit shorter for classes since we're required to run carriers. The slant brake in the pictures has been replaced by a comp/flash hider. Any questions about the rifle, feel free to ask. If you'd like, I also have an additional 8 magazines and 600 rounds of ammo we can work a deal on.If you want everything, all the mags, all the ammo, I can cut a deal as low as $825 cash. That's basically 3 magazines for free, the ammo at .23 per round, and the rifle at $543. I happen to think that's a pretty damn good deal, and I'm putting it out to you guys cause I'm just awesome like that. I can best be reached by email, or by text at REDACTED. Thanks."

I have never shot this weapon but I have shot the Vickers Glock 19 and at 40 and 50 yard You can ring 8 inch steel targets all day. There is a misconception Vickers models are just leftover 17s they've added a fancy name to to off load products. So my recommendation is to get on and do the research yourself to see all of the stuff that has been done to make this a more combat affective tool. The MSRP for this fire alarm is $729. Given that this fire arm is about four years old and since there have been eight Vickers models lost or stolen.  This being a rare gum only increases the value every time one goes missing or is damaged beyond repair. So my starting price is $750 for this 17.

It is in pretty good shape and comes with only 1 magazine. No box or anything else. Have about 19 +/- rounds of .25 that will go with it.Full disclosure- I bought the pistol used, obviously, and the seller told me it does not fire. So I took it apart and used Ballistol to clean all the gunk accumulated. The firing pin is in decent shape, whereas most don't work due to breakage from dry firing- so if you come to check the gun out, do NOT dry fire unless you have your own snap caps.I went to the range with a full box of 50 and as you can see, I shot off 31 rounds.However, when I loaded the magazine full of rounds, it jams, and had to take out a round. Then I shot off @ 2 rounds consistently with no FTF and then jammed.Then, I tried loading only 3 rounds in the magazine and it cycled all 3 with no problem. I ran 3 rounds at a time in the magazine.So, it may need more cleaning, the ramp polished, or a new magazine spring?I am looking to trade towards a Mossberg something shotgun. No single shots please. Or, trade towards an anything 9mm or .40, plus cash on my side."

I have 1 seven rd mag and 3 eight rd mags included as well as plenty of self defense .45 included. Also will include the factory springs and parts from srt install so you can verify the springs are new and can take srt out if you choose. Gun has had about 200 rds through it since I rebuilt it and added the trigger. Mostly to test reliability and as you would expect from a sig, there were no problems there. Extremely accurate gun. Great shooter. Bought it as a project to turn into a collector safe piece so I was in the process of making it up to date and I was going to duracoat it. I would keep it but I have purchased too many guns and would like to just sell it for some extra cash. Not going to give it away though. It's my only .45 at the moment so I'd like to sell as a package but I may negotiate price if I keep the ammo. Thanks for reading. For more information, pictures, or questions you can email or text REDACTEDArmslist would not allow me to upload pictures from my phone. They're high quality and exceeded the upload limit. I'm happy to text or email pictures upon request of any part you'd like to see. The frame has minimal wear on the slide rails, and a stainless match barrel. Slide has some holster wear but frame is in great shape. Only reason I was even thinking about duracoating it was to make it look new again since it was going in the safe. Thanks again.
