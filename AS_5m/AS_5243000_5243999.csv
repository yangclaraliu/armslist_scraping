I think it must have been a little heaver construction. Anyhow, I have only put about 60 rounds through it. I  had it apraised by Bass at Bass's Gun Rack in Missoula. He said it is a  600.00 Riffle because of the open sights, which they don't make any more. So my price is 600.00 cash, FIRM. I can text pictures, possibly meet somewhere if you are serious.

Shoot me an offer if you are interested.  If you are out of state, you will need to use your credit card or paypal account to pay through my paypal account.  That keeps us both safe and makes this a smooth transaction.Thanks"

This gun will handle light or heavy loads and your welcome to shoot it right here at my house to test it fully.

I am not gonna list a price but in my head 60% to 70% of what you can find it on the internet, the condition is much better but shotguns are a little hard to move on this site. I will add cash to any gun that gets my attention and will help complete a deal.

Gen III Billet Upper and Lower Receivers cerakoted FDE, Noveske marked Raptor Ambi Charging Handle, 15"" NSR Handguard, FDE Magpul STR stock and Miad Pistol Grip, Magpul MBUS Pro Sights. The rifle started life as a complete rifle factory built by Noveske. The previous owner purchased a different upper so he could shoot suppressed. I purchaseed the factory built upper from him and went to Rainier Arms, bought a Gen 3 Noveske lower and sent it for cerakote before I even picked it up. Lower was built with the same magpul furniture as comes from the factory on the rifle. Only difference is I went with a Spikes Battle Trigger over the ALG ACT (very similar). I also installed an ambi safety selector. There is zero rounds thru the lower and 30 thru the upper. It is in 99% condition. You would be hard pressed to even tell that it has been fired. I may consider partial trade vcog, vortex razor hd gen II 1-6, PWS MK214, other 14.5-16"" 308's, MPX. Text is best, call or email works too.
