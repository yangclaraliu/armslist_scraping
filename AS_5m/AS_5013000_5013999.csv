The upper comes standard with a VLTOR Modular Upper Receiver (MUR), match stainless barrel, and standard bolt carrier group. I had Noveske mount an OPS Inc. brake and collar at the factory so rest assured it was done professionally. I brought this to the range once, zeroed it, and shot steel at 700 yards with match 77gr ammo. It works as advertised. That means that this upper has less than 100 rds. fired through it. It's fantastic. Only the upper is for sale, but it is pictured here on the full rifle build so you can see what it looks like in action. I bought this new (straight from Noveske) in 2010 for $1400.00 and used it once. Nearly the same upper currently being sold by Noveske is now over $1500.00! So do the math on the price I am asking . . . it's priced to sell. Happy New Year and happy bidding! Purchase through ""BUY NOW"" and I will include a box of 77gr MK 262 mod 0 match ammo . . .

At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile.

Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue. Price is firm at $400.00 Cash.

To our poor knowledge, this is the very smallest subcompact that Sig makes in 9mm, while the venerable 239 was just not quite small enough. Like its lesser Ruger and Kel-Tec competitors, it is still quite a handful when the operator pulls the trigger. Manufacturer is Sig Sauer of Exeter, NH. Type is double action only, hammer fired, locked breech semi automatic sub compact pistol. Construction is Nitron® finished stainless slide, steel barrel, trigger, and internal parts, all built into a high impact steel reinforced polymer frame. Overall length is only 5 3/8 inches from the muzzle to the back of the grip frame; 4 1/8 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the butt; and thinness of only .945 inches not counting the slide release lever. Barrel is 2.9 inch flared muzzle, 6 groove right hand 1:9.84 rifling. Weight is only 20.5 ounces empty. The P290’s .350 smooth faced trigger pulls at a steady 9 pounds, with 1 inch of travel. Sights are classic dovetailed Sig White Dot Front and white bar notched rear. This Sig P-290 comes with One factory stainless bodied factory magazines made by Mec-Gar for Sig,Comes with a  a flush fit 6 rounder.

To our poor knowledge, this is the very smallest subcompact that Sig makes in 9mm, while the venerable 239 was just not quite small enough. Like its lesser Ruger and Kel-Tec competitors, it is still quite a handful when the operator pulls the trigger. Manufacturer is Sig Sauer of Exeter, NH. Type is double action only, hammer fired, locked breech semi automatic sub compact pistol. Construction is Nitron® finished stainless slide, steel barrel, trigger, and internal parts, all built into a high impact steel reinforced polymer frame. Overall length is only 5 3/8 inches from the muzzle to the back of the grip frame; 4 1/8 inches from the top of the rear sight to the bottom of the butt; and thinness of only .945 inches not counting the slide release lever. Barrel is 2.9 inch flared muzzle, 6 groove right hand 1:9.84 rifling. Weight is only 20.5 ounces empty. The P290’s .350 smooth faced trigger pulls at a steady 9 pounds, with 1 inch of travel.
