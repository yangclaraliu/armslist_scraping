1944 Mosin 91/30 PU Sniper from the Izhevsk arsenal. 
The 91/30 PU sniper rifle is an upgrade of the standard Model 91/30 rifle. The functional and robust bolt and magazine remained essentially unchanged except for the bent bolt which allowed it to clear the scope so a round could be easily chambered. The sniper rifles were highly respected for being very rugged, reliable, accurate, and easy to maintain.
The 91/30 PU's were generally built to more exacting standards than their standard issue counterparts. The standard M91/30's were thought to have been fired and the best of the lot were selected to become sniper rifles. Once selected the triggers were reworked and the finish on the later PU snipers were better than the standard infantry rifles.
This rifle is in wartime stock, has an original 1944 scope and mount. Been refurbished, as most have, and the numbers on the magazine is lined out (forced matched), looks to been done at the refurbishing arsenal (Russian letters with numbers). Optics are very clear. Fun and accurate to shoot.

This is one of the earlier imports and the conversion from double stack to single stack wasn't as pretty as it should be. The rifle fires fine and is already sighted in at 100yds. The magazines had to be sanded down slightly to fit the mag well that wasn't cut perfectly but the tree provided mags are perfect and function flawlessly. Any new magazines purchased just need a few minutes of tweaking and you're good to go. I am disclosing this because I'm honest and that's why the rifle is so inexpensive.

Please read the entire listing.
Ruger 77/22, 22 Hornet, professionally converted to 5.7mm Johnson. Beautiful blondish laminated stock, Ruger grey all weather finish, Burris 3x-12X scope with peep-plex reticle. Ruger scope rings. This rifle is in excellent to almost new condition and has never been in the field. Round count is ~ 100 rds before conversion and ~150 rds after conversion.
The 5.7mm Johnson cartridge is a 30 Carbine case necked down to 22 cal. It offers much better performance and accuracy than the 22 Hornet and is easier to load. It features increased velocity and accuracy with very little recoil. 5.7mm Johnson ammo is very hard to find, so you will have to load your own. See below.
I had this rifle built by a professional gunsmith about 10-12 years ago as a light weight walking or short range (out to 150yds) varmint rifle. It has so far, with limited load development, exceeded my expectations. It was impossible to convert the rotary magazine to 5.7, so this is now a single shot. Since I am getting too old, with failing eyesight, to really enjoy the rifle, I am making it available to someone who will use it for its intended purpose. Here is what I will include with the rifle:
RCBS 5.7mm Johnson full length die set
RCBS complete 5.7mm Johnson case forming die set
134 loaded cartridges with 40gr Hornady V-Max bullets
90 once fired formed 5.7mm Johnson cases
270 new, unfired and formed 5.7mm Johnson cases
I also have more 30 carbine cases and 40gr V-Max bullets for additional reasonable costs.
GUYS! I really hate to sell this rifle, but I have to face reality. My eyesight is just not good enough anymore with getting old and all that. I have over $1500 invested in this setup not counting the gunsmith work or the ammo and components. Will sell for $1000 FIRM!
I have a few more pictures that I could send you via email if you request them, but PLEASE, serious inquires only! If you wish to shoot this rifle prior to purchase, I have my own shooting range where you could try it out.
