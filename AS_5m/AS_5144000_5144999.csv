635,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5144635,For Sale:  Glock 21 ZEV Ultimate Trigger Package,"Sterling, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 200,"Listed On: Friday, February 12, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale a NEW, never used Glock 21 gen 1 to 3 ZEV Technologies™ Professional Fulcrum UltimateTrigger replacement kit for the Glock is the single most important upgrade a user can make to their GLOCK. Online price from ZEV is $260 plus shipping, I will sell it for $200 cash. Price is FIRM, i don't need to sell this item so don't ask for a lower price. One of the first things a GLOCK® owner should consider is upgrading the stock trigger. ZEV™ builds the best triggers in the business and ZEV's Professional Fulcrum® Ultimate Trigger Kit components were used to set a world record.The Professional Fulcrum Ultimate Trigger Kit only requires one tool (a standard 3/32nd punch), and 15 minutes of your time. You will immediately notice these differences in your gun's performance after installation: The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy. Because of ZEV's proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull. The trigger's crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. This feedback improves the user's ability to ride the reset to improve follow up shot speed and placement. The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy.The pre- and over-travel are machined in to allow for a shorter pull, crisper break and faster reset. Trigger presets will give the benefit of shorter take up, post break travel and will result in a shorter reset. Note: The differences between ZEV's Drop-In Kit and the Ultimate Kit are a Skeletonized Firing Pin. The benefit of adding the Skeletonized Firing Pin is its lighter construction, polished, and the tip of the firing pin is extended for more positive primer ignition. ZEV™ Parts always incorporate design, feel and performance. A Fulcrum Professional Trigger kit will upgrade the look of your gun as triggers come in a variety of color combinations. Finally, ZEV Trigger components are designed to last; replacing plastic stock parts with aluminum or stainless steel assemblies."

This is a FANTASTIC rifle for the money. I have not seen a nicer one for less than $800. Fully free floated 12"" handguard, Ergo Grip, MPI Bolt, Dust cover, forward assist, Troy battlemag, collapsible stock, and hard case. It has everything you need for a nice AR. This is every bit as nice as a S&W MP15, and MUCH nicer than the MP15 sport. This is one of 7500 rifles with a ""RIP####"" serial number. Pretty cool gun. Must be legally able to own this gun. CCW preferred.Mostly looking to sell, but might be interested in quality trades. Please include trade info, and trade value in your email."

These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite.
