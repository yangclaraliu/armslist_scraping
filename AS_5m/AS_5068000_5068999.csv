The original stock was not in the best shape (which is understandable given that most were issued about 50 years ago) but I was able to find / buy another that’s in excellent condition.  I refinished the stock / forearm wood so they more closely match and also re-blued the metal stock / forearm components. I paid $1,050.00 for the rifle plus another $88.50 for tax / Nics. I also purchased four (4) more fifteen (15) round H&K 91 aluminum magazines ($25 each), a POF H&K91 Port Buffer ($34.95) - new / never installed, and the additional stock ($30).  In total, I have $1,303.45 into this rifle but I’m willing to sell it for $1,200.00."

In the period this gun was manufactured 40 years ago, FN was sending new Hi-Powers to Browning in plain cardboard boxes. Browning then placed the Hi-Powers in black, “Browning” marked pouches made in the U.S. I have collected Hi-Powers for years and this is the first pouch I have seen with the original Browning white label still attached. This label is hand numbered to the gun. In those days Hi-Powers were sold in the black “Browning” pouch with red lining instead of a box. The holster was custom ordered and purchased by the original owner at the same time he bought the gun. During years 1976 – 1978, Browning offered a special, custom order BHP holster. This custom holster was produced by El Paso Saddlery Company in El Paso, Texas. The holster is lined, basketweave stamped, and bordered, with the Browning logo on both the front and back. The standard Browning Hi-Power holster was unlined, plain, made in Mexico, and was marked as such on the back side. Price: $1,250 FTF. No trades at this time.

This gun displays very well but needs some mechanism attention, it works, but the magazine tube can be difficult to remove sometimes for no appearant reason, and spent shells are difficult to eject. Small problems, but this type of rifle is not within my area of expertise. I have fired it but must advise against doing so with anything stronger than CB ammunition due to its age. Visable loaders are quite rare these days, as most were used to the point of failure or not properly cared for."

$900 firm in cash or higher in trade value.  No hurry to sell, just wanting to free up some cash to finish some projects.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any ammo deal will need to be good.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do. Trades considered:  I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns. Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both. Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any ammo deal will need to be good. 1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer. Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash. Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

This is accomplished by polishing the sear surfaces smooth and HardLubing the trigger components. • Sear geometry has not been changed from the standard profile so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged. • Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness. • Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness. • Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications. • A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition. • Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. Both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated. • Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.0lbs."

When I was researching them the Winchester historian informed me that they both left the warehouse the same day and shipped to the same location. Seems a shame to separate them after after 110+ years!Both rifles have worn bores, but still are reasonably accurate. Both rifles are unusual in that the rear sights are set back to the receiver like the later versions. The Winchester historian said it was very unusual, but not unheard of. There are no extra holes in the barrel. One sports the 1902 Krag rear sight and the other the much rarer Hotchkis sight. Both are flat spring high walls, circa 1905. Please feel free to ask questions. Can arrange test firing in Sheboygan."

It wont last long at this price, I'm only letting it go because I'm going into the AR way. It comes with everything from the Ed Brown shop. The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest! In addition to the features on the main handguns page, the Classic Custom features the following: 5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy. Weight: approximately 40 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted. 25 LPI checkering on forestrap and mainspring housing. Special mirror finished slide, with 50 LPI serrations on back of slide to match serrated adjustable sight, top of slide is flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI. Traditional ""square cut"" cocking serrations on rear of slide only. Adjustable rear sight buried deep into slide, cross dovetail front sight. Two-piece guide rod for smoother cycling and easier disassembly. Mag catch with Oversize 40 LPI checkered button"

$500 firm in cash for the pistol and mags only or $540 firm with the DeSantis rig, this rig will also work with other small pistols.  Higher in trade value as I am really wanting the cash right now.
Might look at trades as long as it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know the deal.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and bolt-guns.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers 9mm to help complete a deal, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY, but will consider an all ammo trade if it's really good.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Garland area.  Thanks for looking!"

German engineering & quality proven design break action air rifle. I bought this for my son to shoot. He probably didn't put 100 pellets through it. Pellets are less likely to ricochet then BB'S. I think they are safer in general.  It’s been in my gun safe for 14 years. This is a youth model or small frame adult gun. It is pretty much identical to the model 34.  They are capable of 5/16 groups at 30 ft. If you miss it's not the gun. It has a real nice adjustable iron site and a scope rail. It has a 2 stage non-adjustable trigger. It's shoots at 700 fps. It is easier to cock then the model 34 and has a shorter barrel so it's not as fast.  It has a scuff on the stock but overall in really good shape. Break the barrel from the muzzle by pulling on the barrel, it's hinged; load a pellet, close the barrel, flip the safety off and shoot. Reliable, repeatable fun.  These are referred to as springers. They do not store air, a piston is spring loaded when you cock the barrel. Pulling the trigger releases the piston and pushes air through orifices to propel the pellet.   Questions ask for Jim REDACTED.
