I only know of one available right now (it's on Gunbroker) and the seller wants an extreme premium for it (double what a new 1895GS is selling for). I am willing to pay a fair amount but I will either hold out or just customize an 1895GS to make it what I want if I have to. If you have one of these rifles and you would like to part with it I would love to talk with you. If you lead me to one and I purchase it I am willing to give you a ""finders fee""!

Perfect conceal carry pistol and that's what I've used it for. It's only had roughly 120-130 rounds through it and never an issue. It does have some wear on the slides finish(like on the sharper edges) from being carried in a Kydex holster and spending time in the center console of my vehicle. I don't have the factory box anymore but it comes with two 12 round mags and a new Blackhawk hip holster that holds the gun and a extra mag. Here in Three Rivers our local Dunham Sports sells this gun for $399, I recently replaced this gun with a Glock and they offered me $200 on trade...... So I kept it and would rather see someone else get it for $200! That being said here's the deal. Give me $225 and I'll sell you the gun and throw in a box of personal defense ammo($25value) and the Blackhawk holster($20value) or I'll sell the gun with the two mags for $200. My prices are firm and do some research, all the reviews I've read say you cannot beat this 9mm for the money. I may trade for a little 38 snubnose but cash is king. Call or text me at REDACTED if interested. I have my CPL and prefer you did to but if you don't make sure you have the proper purchase permit for your county. Thanks for looking."

Just what is the GUNNER profile? The GUNNER (all caps, as it is that awesome) is the pinnacle of performance, weight, balance, and value. Designed by our competition shooting staff for those who value performance and versatility, the GUNNER profile is a blend of two of the best performing profiles of all time, Gov't and Pencil.  Proving that every once and awhile, the Government can do something right, the GUNNER's profile from the extension to the gas block mimics that delicious taper. From there, common sense takes over and the GUNNER moves to a .625"" gas block journal and our famed pencil profile out front. Removing the weight from the front of the barrel ensures maximum versatility and keeps material to the rear to maximize heat resistance and mitigate whip. The GUNNER is for real gunners.   Faxon Firearms barrels are the pinnacle of value. Manufactured 100% in-house from cradle-to-grave, these barrels are button-rifled and air-guage tested to ensure superior accuracy.
