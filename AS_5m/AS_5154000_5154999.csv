The bore disk shows no markings which means bore condition zero (least wear). This rifle was purchased directly upon entrance to the US from the importer, so the disk should be accurate. The numbers on the reciever and bolt as well as all bolt parts match. The stock and bluing are first rate for its age with a nice wood grain. The bore is spotless and rifling is sharp. The bolt cycles like its made of glass. This is really a rare find for a swedish rifle. Most have beat up stocks and worn bluing. I really love the caliber but I want to put the money into something else. Price is $600 cash. (Pictures up shortly)"

I have a almost new just purchased Kahr CT380 Pistol for sale. I got this for my wife to carry and learn to shoot but the slide is to hard for her to rack comfortably. She can do it but struggles with it. The gun itself we shot about 20 times and she liked the way it shot but I dont feel safe knowing she struggles with a tough slide to rack. The gun has a NEW not even used yet extra magazine that costs 39.99 alone kahr mags are not cheap. The mags hold 7 rounds and I get a full 3 fingers on the grip so shooting this is wonderful. She also got all 3 fingers on the grip. I have NO issue with racking the slide but it is tite and a little stiff and im sure it will loosen up some after the 200 round break in Kahr reccomends. I have my CCL And so will you or find another deal. sorry No trades unless you make a stong offer of something I like. The price is FIRM the gun is less then a month old.

The SN: 1083xx dates production to 1940. The blued finish of the receiver rates at approximately 94% with finish on underside of the trigger guard, lower tang and receiver beginning to turn slight patina. The bluing on the barrel and magazine tube show only the slightest occasional freckling too small to photo. The top of the barrel behind the rear sight shows some light, shallow dings for some unknown reason. The walnut stock and fore end show intermittent handling marks. While the stock and fore end have never been sanded, I believe that a very light coating of varnish or tru-oil was applied at some time. The action is smooth and tight, and the bore is very shiny and crisp. This is an excellent rifle for someone to carefully clean up and bring back to original and the price is right!"

This is an all factory original machine gun that was built by Colt in Hartford, CT in the late 1970's. This was sold to the Federal Government, and the widely accepted story is that these were issued to the Department of Energy (DOE) to protect nuke sites across the country. A small number of these were sold to civilians in the late 1980's. As you can see, this was a carried weapon and has some great patina and lots of character. It is so hard to find a M16 with honest wear - it is actually much harder than finding a new one. This rifle mechanically is in excellent condition including the bore. It appears to have been fired very little.  One of the things that attracts me to this rifle is with the US Property markings, it is 'the very thing' for so many different military builds that you could do, like a MK18 Mod 0 build, or a MK12 SPR build, this is the exact lower - it wouldn't even be a clone.  This is in dealer inventory and is ready to transfer to a C3 dealer in your home state. The fact that it is in dealer inventory means that you will get it MUCH faster than if it was privately owned. If you are thinking about buying another M16, please ask if it is in dealer inventory - I have noticed other dealers play games with this simple fact. If it is individually owned, or 'incoming', it will add 6 months onto your transfer time!FREE SHIPPING WITH BUY NOW!"

He's been a good boy, he puts them right where I want them without any kinds of failures out of 250 attempts. He has three little dots that glow green at night.He really needs a new home, and I really need something smaller. I'm not opposed to a trade, but adopting this bad boy without a trade will run you $500.Trades are pretty specific, though. I really like how tiny a Shield is, but that would need extensive grooming or boot in my favor. I also like the temperament of a PPQ M2, even if it's a little big. Generation 4 G19's are also nice, but I don't like any of the Gen3 or earlier. I also don't mind the G43. I'd like to use the food that I already have, and all of it is about 9 millimeters in diameter. Trades for those Siberian Wasrkies will get boot in your favor. No shotbulls.So, can we give this good boy a new home?"

Bore is excellent and with a centerfire breech block would make a fine shooter. Stock exhibits honest use as a military carbine, including marks on the stock which are consistant to being carried on a McClellan saddle. Action is solid and works great, safe holds at half cock and secure until trigger is pulled on full. Only flaw on this is the missing barrel band, I do have an original barrel band for it but its too sloopy to stay in place. A gunsmith could resisze this band to work fine. As said this is a great collectible and shootable example of this gun, and is even price below the cimmaron replicas."

Check around, this is a very reliable brand and gets excellent reviews online at half the price!This is a solid gun and has very few rounds through it. It is a PSA upper and lower. It has a 16"" heavy barrel, not the wimpy 'pencil' barrel, and is not the common ptac blemished version. Gun comes with one new E-Lander mag. Does NOT come with a rear sight OR the scope shown in the picture. **No rear sight or scope**no case included, I will pack it in original PSA shipping boxes.  (I can send you all the specs, but I assume you already know what an AR-15 is!)Can meet in Savage or within reason for the price. Buyer must have PTP/PTC and show ID.
