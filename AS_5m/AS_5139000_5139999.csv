The lower is manufactured by Aero Precision which they call their ""freedom"" model which has a unique serial number and an engraved American flag on the other side of the lower. Inside is a parts kit from Rock River Arms. All equipped is a Bravo Company (BCM) buffer tube, buffer, buffer spring, and their receiver extension tube QD end plate allowing for mounting of QD sling swivels. The pistol grip is a BCM gunfighter Mod 3 which has great texture and has a water tight compartment within the grip. The Stock is a B5 Systems Enhanced SOPMOD stock that has a QD cup for sling attachments and two removable waterproof battery tubes for storage. Lastly the lower contains a Geissele SSA trigger group. The lower has two small noticeable blemishes on the lower which I saw once I received the lower but won't affect the rest of the firearm finish nor hinder its performance. All parts were installed per Mil-spec torque specifications and manufacturer instructions. This lower has never been connected to an upper or used to fire in any way. All parts are new and unused. If you have any questions feel free to contact me through email or by phone and text at REDACTED."

Small ring diameter of 1.3"", and overall length of 8.50"".  These receivers may be perfect for your do-it-yourself gun build-do some research online and check the pics.  I can take more pics upon request.  These receivers show pitting and according to one expert I spoke to, these were probably taken off rifles and sandblasted at some point in the past, leaving them in their current bare metal condition.  They need to be cleaned up (see pics) and are not ready out-of-the-box.  They are both stamped, ""ESTADOS UNIDOS DO BRAZIL"" and ""MANUFACTURA LOEWE BERLIN 1894.""

If I end up ordering the part and fixing it myself, raise the price again.U.S. Army Model bolt action rifle, the 1917 Eddystone produced for WW1 allied forces. The 1917 is Remington's modification of the Pattern 14 .303 rifle, chambered for the 30.06 cartridge. This one was made at the Eddystone Arsenal in Pennsylvania, a subsidiary of Remington. The arsenal was tooled up at the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Eddystone, Pennsylvania.The serial #2013XX dates it to November 1918. Like most of the 1917rifles, this one was overhauled and parked over the original bluing for service in WW2, and has a dark, stained stock. We needed weapons for the war, and the 1917 became our new rifle. This ""American Enfield"" was used alongside the M1903 Springfield rifle and quickly surpassed the Springfield design in numbers produced and units issued. By November 11, 1918 about 75% of the AEF in France were armed with M1917s. If you're local and want to check it out feel free to send an email to set up a meet.

There has been stippling added to the polymer frames, the barrels have been fully polished and there has been a color fill done on the lettering. Frames and all magazines have color fill. The guns looks great! I know a few guys that have these and they absolutely love them, but I need to sell mine. The Taurus PT111 Millennium G2 comes with the factory box, paperwork, safety key, sight adjustment key and 2 twelve round magazines. The PT111 is lightweight at 22 oz, has a polymer frame, thin profile, and ramped 3.2 inch barrel, which makes the newly designed Millennium G2 ideal for a concealed & carry handgun. The Millennium G2 features an accessory rail, high-profile sights, an aggressive textured grip and melted edges for added comfort and easy concealment! If you are unsure on this one, check out the video on YouTube by hickok45 and you will see that this is definitely a quality and dependable gun to have, without breaking the bank! It has similar features to the Glock, including the easy and & fast way to field strip it, and has similar weight and dimensions to other Glocks, like the width and weight of the Glock 26, and the overall height that is similar to the Glock 19.....................Like I said, these are BRAND NEW and I have NEVER FIRED them! There have been a few upgrades made, including FULLY POLISHED BARRELS, POLISHED FEED RAMPS, SILVER LETTERING and CUSTOM STIPPLING! Stippling was added to the sides of the frames, at the thumb areas and really helps with gun control!...................I am asking $325 (obo) each but might consider a lower price if you take both!"

This particular model retails for $7995.00 so this is a prime opportunity to pick one up unused and in mint condition at a great price!687 EELL Classic: Premium Looks and PerformanceThe 687 EELL Classic is the top of the line of Beretta’s 680-series over-under shotguns. It features sideplates that act as extra canvas for the lavish hand-chased engraving, as well as a specially-selected walnut stock that gives it a true heirloom quality. But while it certainly figures well while on display, the Classic’s worth as a game gun is equally striking. Weighing about 7 lbs (12-ga version), and with the point of balance right at the hinge-pin, it is a shotgun that comes up naturally to the shoulder while still having enough of a lively feeling forward of the supporting hand. This is an over-under with the feel and allure of a classic, for the discriminating hunter who appreciates all the finer points of a perfectly-made gun.Premium Hand-Chased Engraving, StockThe full sideplates of the 687 EELL feature a super-fine classic game scene, and are enhanced by intricately detailed motifs of branches, leaves and flowers which extend to the trigger plate, trigger guard and fore-end iron lever. The proportions of the engraving blend wonderfully with the dimensions of the shotgun, giving you the sense of a work of art within a work of art. The stock is a classic semi-beavertail, with premium-quality European walnut and a newly designed fine-line checkering. An oval brass shield, inlaid on the stock, will allow you to personalize your gun with initials or a family crest, while the handsome and durable carrying case will protect the shotgun for generations to come.A Classic Choice for HuntingThis shotgun will shine in any hunting situation. This is because it is built on a receiver that is equally strong and low-profile. The 687 action has two conical locking lugs at mid-height, meaning that it will always lock up strongly and positively while not requiring the extra bulk and weight for a top locking lever. This further means that when you bring it up to the shoulder, the vertical distance between your eye and your supporting hand is minimized: this shotgun will follow your sight easily and instinctively. And in spite of its beauty, the 687 action is noted for its strength, so this is a shotgun that you can confidently pass down to the next generation of hunters."
