It was the first polymer-framed pistol, 12 years before the Glock 17. The VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional firing pin. It is double action only so the trigger pull is relatively heavy. In lieu of a blade front sight, the VP70 uses a polished ramp with a central notch in the middle to provide the illusion of a dark front post. The VP70 does have a manual safety. It is the circular button located immediately behind the trigger and is a common cross-block safety. The ""Z"" designates the civilian variant is a semiautomatic only version. The VP70 was produced from 1970 until 1989.
This pistol is chambered in 9x19mm Para. For the pistol it comes with two original magazines. I believe all are 21 round magazines. The HK VP-70 Z in 9x19mm comes in a 1970’s pristine box that is still dark grey, magazine loader tool, has the original target from the factory in a wax package and the original operation manual.
Thank you for looking and please let me know if you have any questions.
Sorry not interested in trades at this time.
If this is to be transferred inside of Iowa it has to be with another CCW holder, if you currently do not have your CCW then we will have to use a local FFL for the paperwork. If this is going from one state to another then it will absolutely have to be from one FFL to another FFL. No exceptions."

It was the first polymer-framed pistol, 12 years before the Glock 17. The VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional firing pin. It is double action only so the trigger pull is relatively heavy. In lieu of a blade front sight, the VP70 uses a polished ramp with a central notch in the middle to provide the illusion of a dark front post. The VP70 does have a manual safety. It is the circular button located immediately behind the trigger and is a common cross-block safety. The ""Z"" designates the civilian variant is a semiautomatic only version. The VP70 was produced from 1970 until 1989. Four hundred VP-70 Z pistols were made chambered in 9×21mm IMI; these samples were made primarily for the civilian market of Italy, where the use of the 9×19mm Para is a sole privilege of military and law enforcement agencies.
This pistol is chambered 9x21mm. For this HK VP-70 Z pistol comes with three magazines. I believe all are 21 round magazines. The 9x21mm comes in lighter grey more warn box that is still strong just lighter than the other pistol I have listed. Included with this is 500 rounds of 9x21mm ammunition.
Thank you for looking and please let me know if you have any questions.
Sorry not interested in trades at this time.

It comes with a couple hundred rounds of Hornady .308 TAP ammo which is pretty much the best stuff you can shoot out of this. The Manfrotto tripod and PIG saddle rifle clamp/rest also come with of which was around a $500 setup. I also have a nice rifle bag and pack especially made to carry the tri-pod setup. I just used a cheap paint on the barrel and scope. It comes off very easily with some none corrosive spray on paint remover. I did the same thing on my Bushmaster ACR, and you couldn't even tell it'd been painted. Only reason I'm selling is I just don't get up north enough to shoot it, and I'm far from broke so don't send me any lowball offers.I'm looking for a really nice enclosed trailer to pull my racing motorcycles around in, and it must be a bumper hitch small enough for a 2013 Touareg to pull. Only other trade would be a newer Yamaha R6, Triump 675R, or Honda CBR600RR for a track bike. I have over $5500 in this setup. I'm open to best offer, but I'm not loosing my ass. If you plan on lowballing don't waste your time. The price is set at trade value."

It is a factory savage,  varmint countour, fluted, threaded 5/8-24 on the muzzle, 10"" twist barrel that I took off of a new FLCP-SR.  The chassis was used last year only and is in very good shape. The JP chassis is over $1000 by itself. The recoil lug set screw and folding stock that locks up solid sets it apart form other stocks and chassis systems. I have shot this setup to verify everything is ready to go. Also included is a set of Forester Benchrest dies and 100 pieces of federal brass. I switched to left handed actions for competition which is the only reason I am selling. Bipod not included. $1000. No Trades. No Offers."

Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories."

If you're looking for a good, solid, reliable pistol at a great price...  this is it.  But, if you prefer to pay full retail price for a used pistol, keep looking, there's plenty of them on Armslist. Please understand if trade is involved, I will likely require trade value a little closer to the $800 I have invested. I've had buyers in the past that wanted full retail value for their used trade-in, but wanted to hold me to the cash price of mine.  If you're realistic on yours, I will certainly be realistic on mine.PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:Due to lessons learned the hard way, I adhere to a few rules.Please do not respond to this add by asking me my cell number. I prefer to start by email. If it looks like a deal can be made, then we can text to fine tune arrangements. If you want to trade, just respond with the description of the item and preferably some good, clear pictures. NO, I will not meet you in another city or ""meet you half way"". Been there, done that, got burned twice.  I'm old, but not an old fool.  If you are sincerely interested in buying my pistol, I will provide my office address or we can meet close by (within reason), where you can come and look at it."

Both are smooth bore.I picked up the longer barrel before I fired the gun, and still haven't used it. (That barrel costs about $200 new). I fired the gun using the 18"" barrel, and it's too powerful for my old shoulder. So I'm looking to trade the 12 gauge off for a revolver. Something that won't bruise me.I do have the original pistol grip, but right now it has an ATI adjustable stock & pistol grip on it. I think ATI calls it the Scorpion stock. The angle of the stock wasn't right for me, so I installed some spacers that gave the stock the correct drop.Looking for a .22 or a .357 revolver. But all trade offers are welcome.About $375 trade value, will sell it for $300.HowardCall or text REDACTED"

I may be interested in a partial trade, just let me know what you have to trade on and we'll talk about it. I bought it back in the 90's and almost immediately sent it to Wayne Novak's custom shop up in West Virginia. I wanted to make a great pistol even better and of course, they did. They did a very nice bead blast job on the finish, a reliability package and put new Novak springs in it...although the .45 was new. I had only shot it a  handful of times when i sent it and it was flawless... even better when I got it back. I shot it another 8 or 10 times, cleaned it and put it away. It comes with 2 magazines, Wilson cocobolo grips (ambi cut) & an ambi safety since I am a leftie. This is collectible and a wonderful shooter and would make a great carry gun (if you have your permit)The Colt box is not the original but would go with it, if wanted. I also have a nice black plastic/foam case for it. Thanks for looking. I will sell to a legal Tennessean with a carry permit. Just let me know if you have questions!"
