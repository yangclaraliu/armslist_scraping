Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Remington's Exclusive ArmorLokt process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3-1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built- in. Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18-1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail. I am asking $300 firm for it and no trades please It sells new for $499 I lost my job and it's the only reason I am selling it. I am located in Jasper Al.

This firearm is in excellent condition with 100% of it's finish, and has had less than 100 rounds shot through it. This Bersa comes complete as a kit with:-Custom Rosewood Grips-Original Hogue-Like Grips-Three 7 Round Magazines-One Extended Grip 9 Round Magazines-Dual IWB/OWB Black Leather Clip/Belt Holster-Cleaning Kit-All Factory Paperwork, Manual & Test Shots-Factory Soft Padded CaseThe Bersa Thunder has consistently reviewed higher and in my personal experience performed better than firearms twice the price. From a huge list of features on the firearm such as adjustable sights, larger magazine capacity, decocker, slide lock and an alloy rail many believe it to be an improvement over its pricier companion. With aftermarket component/accessories both affordable and abundant it is easy to customize your Bersa however you choose. This Bersa Thunder maintains nearly 100% of its finish, and has no blemishes so to speak of. The Rosewood grips compliment the firearm perfectly, and are just as ergonomic as the rubber grips that came factory. With a balanced weight achieved from the alloy slide, the weapon is easy to handle and comfortable to carry. When you combine everything together it's easy to see what makes the pistol not only accurate but makes quick follow up shots a dream. This pistol also has an internal safety lock not often seen on a pistol in its price range, along with another internal safety mechanism that keeps it from firing if a magazine is not inserted leaving you with peace of mind if a child ever stumbled upon it. Whether you're looking for another pistol for your collection, or a well rounded weapon for self defense this is the the firearm that feels good on the range, your waistband, and your wallet.*I am asking 375 OBO for this package deal but will consider other offers. I currently live in Owenton, KY but I am able to meet in any of the surrounding areas on most days with notice. Feel free to email me at REDACTED if you have any questions about this firearm. But please leave a phone number as I am not able to consistently communicate by email.* I am not willing to utilize an FFL service at this time, but will for the right offer."

I can GUARANTEE its in Brand New Condition without a scratch on it. Please dont hesitate to consider it, You won't be sorry. (see photos). And of course if you have any questions or want to see it just message me with subject line as Matrix CrossBow or similar so it doesn't end up in my junk folder.  Please do not confuse this bow vs the Excalibur Matrix 380 bow that does come with these extras minus stringing aid for a higher price.Which is about the price I have into this bow. But the 380 is a slight bit faster than the 355 but more money than whats listed here.

Great size for conceal carry, and 15+1 capacity is perfect for personal protection. The gun is too nice for for me; I'm looking to downgrade to a compact pistol, particularly one chambered in 9x18 Makarov with cash on your end. That being said, I'm more than willing to listen to other reasonable trades, including rifles, as long as I can get a good bit of cash with it. Description copied from Sig website: PISTOL, COMPACT, 9MM, M11 Issued to US Naval Aviation and key units in every branch of the Armed Services, the M11 is proud to serve. Upgraded with a stainless steel slide, a Short Reset Trigger and three 15 round flush fit magazines, the M11-A1 variant features the same phosphate coated internals, SIGLITE® night sights and MIL-STD UID label of the standard-issue M11."
