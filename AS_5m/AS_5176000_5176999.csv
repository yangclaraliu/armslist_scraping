The Upper has a 9"" Billet handguard and a large Panzer Muzzle Brake. I have it on a Spike's Tactical The Jack billet lower with Spike's LPK. Upgraded POF 4.5lb trigger, KNS anti-walk pins, Magpul B.A.D. Lever. Also have a Hogue robber overmold grip and Magpul Front & Rear MBUS rights.

The rifle has an adjustable gas system so if you want to suppress it, you can fine tune the rifle so it runs perfectly. The rifle takes Metric FAL magazines and comes with 6 magazines with 5 being new in package. Everything comes with it from the factory, including a sling which I just haven't attached. The red dot is a Sig Sauer Romeo4b. The optic can switch between a straight red dot and a circle with a dot in the middle. The red dot is rated for 5000 hours of use on medium brightness, and has an auto off if the rifle is still for 2 minutes. The optic turns itself back on immediately once there is any movement to the rifle. Because of this, the actual operational time on one battery is much longer than 5000 hours. It is on a quick detach mount as well and holds zero from what I've seen when removed an placed back in the same spot. It has a rough 50 yard zero currently but could benefit from a little more fine tuning. I can be reached best by email, or by text at 770-549-5963. Please be patient, I do work during the week. Thanks for looking!"

484,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5176484,For Sale:  NFA Trust (Complete package including free assistance with ATF Forms),"Dublin, Ohio, United States",$ 199,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 15, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"100% Success Rate.  Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back. Period. No questions asked.  Attorney Christopher Gasper: 614-845-1923 or chris@gasperlegal.com  http://www.gasperlegal.com/nfa-trust/  What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.  As an Ohio lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!  This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.  I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.  Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.   What the Trust includes:  - The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages) - Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms) - Appointment of Trustee (1 Page) - Trustee resignation (1 Page)  I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.  Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***  Attorney Christopher Gasper www.gasperlegal.com chris@gasperlegal.com 614-845-1923  7652 Sawmill Road Suite #166 Dublin, Ohio 43016"

The blued finish of the receiver rates at approximately 94% with finish on underside of the trigger guard, lower tang and receiver beginning to turn slight patina. The bluing on the barrel and magazine tube show only the slightest occasional freckling too small to photo. The top of the barrel behind the rear sight shows some light, shallow dings for some unknown reason. The walnut stock and fore end show intermittent handling marks. While the stock and fore end have never been sanded, I believe that a very light coating of varnish or tru-oil was applied at some time. The action is smooth and tight, and the bore is very shiny and crisp! If the wood did not have the light varnish, we would rate it at over 95%, but alas, we cannot. This is an excellent rifle for someone to carefully clean up and bring back to original and the price is right!"
