The gun is in very good condition but it has been shot (as it should be). My understanding is that S&W started making these with the idea of competition shooters using them, but shortly after they started producing them, they banned the cartridge from competition so they stopped making them. These guns are very hard to come by. If you check gun broker completed says for ""646"", you'll see that they have been selling for over $2k. This gun comes with the original ""performance center"" style aluminum locking case as well as all original paperwork. Please contact me for more pictures or to negotiate trade/price.Asking $1500."

Price $395**Harvey Special** Inventory # G-1004593-1 Manufacturer Smith & Wesson  Model 469 Caliber 9mm Type Pistool Barrel Length  Fun Fact The Model 469 is an early model in Smith & Wesson's well-regarded 59-series, envisioned as pistols that could be easily concealed, but possessed sufficient firepower to serve as service weapons as well. It was a traditional double-action weapon with a 3.5-inch barrel, equipped with a slide-mounted safety/decocker. Magazine capacity is 12 rounds. When Smith & Wesson introduced its ""third-generation"" series of semiautomatics, several similar pistols succeeded the Model 469. These included the Model 6904, which had an alloy frame with black finish, the Model 6906, which was the same pistol in a stainless steel finish, both operating in double-action/single-action mode. The Model 6946 was similar to the 6906 but operated in double-action-only mode. Although the 69-series of pistol is no longer produced, the polymer-framed Smith & Wesson M&P compact possesses similar dimensions, and the same barrel length and magazine capacity (in 9mm). The 469 is often referred to as the 'little brother' of the 459 and will even accept the 14-round magazine of the 459. Some other features of the gun is the 'no fire' without a magazine and the 'safe' half cock mode (if you pull the trigger lightly, the hammer will go half way back and lock) and de-cocking lever/safety on the slide."

It's in excellent condition. I bought it not too long ago but I could tell it had barely been used and was kept in great shape. Outside of some normal wear like a turn line, some wear under the barrel and by the back plate near the firing pin, I can only see one minor flaw on the frame/finish and it's a couple tiny scratches on the bottom of the underlug. The Blued finish on this gun really looks spectacular. Not sure when they stopped producing them with this finish, but this one was produced in 1985. It came with Hogue rubber grips that didn't seem to line up well so I replaced them with a nice set of Rosewood Hogue grips that I paid $115 for. Gun will come with both sets of grips. This is a great gun that is built like a tank and is very hard to find in such great condition. Asking $650 OBO. Any questions feel free to ask. More pictures: http://imgur.com/a/lU6jy"

On June 26, 1888, a patent for the new design was issued to John and Matthew Browning.[1] Under this patent, Winchester created the first repeating slide action .22 rifle ever successfully developed and manufactured. The Model 1890 would prove to be the most successful repeating rim fire rifle for general all around shooting ever made by Winchester. Approximately 849,000 Model 1890 rifles were produced between 1890 and 1932, after which the Model 1890 was replaced by the Winchester Model 62 rifle. A final cleanup of stock on hand was completed in 1941.[2] For many years, the Model 1890 was considered to be the standard for use in shooting galleries, hence its nickname of ""gallery gun."" Design and Features The Model 1890 was a slide action, top ejecting rifle with an 18 inch magazine tube under the barrel. It had a 24 inch octagonal barrel, a plain walnut stock, and an overall weight of approximately 6 lbs. Calibers for the rifle include .22 Short, .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle, .22 Winchester Rimfire. The Model 1890 will only fire the round specific to that gun (e.g. a Model 1890 stamped "".22 Short"" on the barrel will not fire .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle, or .22 WRF; despite there being other 1890's chambered in those calibers). The .22 Long Rifle version was added in 1919. Pistol grip stocks were available on later rifles. Variants The Model 1890 was produced in three distinct versions. The first model had a solid frame, a case hardened receiver, and a fixed rear sight. Approximately 15,000 of these were produced between 1890 and 1892. The second model was designed as a takedown rifle. It also had a case hardened receiver, but had an adjustable rear sight. In August 1901, the case hardened receiver was changed to a blued version. Approximately 100,000 second model rifles were produced with case hardened receivers, and 200,000 were produced with blued receivers. A deluxe version was offered, which featured a fancy checkered walnut stock available in either straight or pistol grip and a grooved slide handle. The third model was also produced as a takedown rifle, and featured a modified receiver that allowed the breech bolt to lock externally. The third model was also available in a deluxe version, which, similar to the second model, featured a fancy checkered walnut stock available in either straight or pistol grip and a grooved slide handle.[3] This particular gun has the standard wear for a gun of this age. One missing screw on the top of the receiver and one incorrect screw on the bottom. One small crack in the stock on the bottom but not a functional harming crack like the ones on the side of the stock. It has some scratches and bluing wear that is to be expected but in general it is in good shape for what it is."

Colt 1911 pistols and their descendants were in the hands of confident World War I, World War II, Korean War and Vietnam-era servicemen. Colt customers today can purchase reproductions of these weapons, each faithfully manufactured to the original specifications from factory blueprints. Despite Colt’s storied history, we know that our legacy for the 21st Century will rest on our continuing responsiveness to customer needs and the same inventiveness, innovation and commitment to quality and excellence that made Colt firearms famous 150 years ago. Accordingly, while we continue to offer classic model Colt pistols, we are proud to offer new pistol models designed to meet all the needs and to exceed the highest expectations of the most demanding customers."

Rare Camillus Cuda ROBERT Terzuola design CQB serrated 6 in. Military knife. The knife was beautifully crafted and the design is simply exceptional. It's an ""all performance, all business"" kind of design. The knife has a solid, sure feel in the hand and presents an aggressive profile. The thick blade was crisply ground from 154CM (Post ATS-34) high speed steel and displays clean, sharp lines. It has a soft, bead-blasted finish and the markings are bold. The blade has a combo edge with the final 2"" being a deeply scalloped, wickedly sharp section of serrations. This produces a highly efficient cutting action that's ideal for rope, cord, netting, etc. The straight edge is probably the sharpest I've ever seen on a Camillus. The spine has a pronounced thumb ramp with deeply milled ridges on both sides. There's also a long section of deep ridges on both the top and bottom of the handle. The handle is of canvas micarta and offers excellent slip resistance. The butt was drilled for a lanyard (by manufacturer) and the handle has an outstanding feel all the way around. The sheath is the original Kydex, attachment that releases easily and is reversible / ambidextrous - right or left handed. It offers excellent versatility with at least six different carry configurations. It can even be configured for jump-safe inverted carry, although this requires an additional safety strap for use when parachuting. This knife is beautifully balanced, offering the feel and handling of a fine custom knife. It's quick and agile with great blade response. The blade is 5-3/4"" and the knife measures 10-3/4"" in overall length. This model was designed by noted Knifemaker's Guild member Bob (Robert) Terzuola and it was designed to offer top-level performance and durability. If you're a Camillus collector/enthusiast, this knife is one of the finest they offered. It's also as nice as they come. An awesome, premium-quality fighter from this American icon!! Will make great companion for any hunting or field work expedition. Beautiful execution with elements suggesting hand made (or benchmade)  $150 this is a 1ST Gen $175 to $200 when you can find them no longer made."

John Browning designed the Remington Model 17 (which was later adapted by Ithaca into the Ithaca 37), which served as the basis for the Remington 31. The Model 31 was well liked, but struggled for sales in the shadow of the Winchester Model 12. Remington sought to correct that in 1951 by introducing a modern, streamlined, rugged, reliable, and relatively inexpensive shotgun – the 870. Sales of the 870 have been steady. They reached 2 million guns by 1973 (ten times the number of Model 31 shotguns it replaced). By 1996, spurred by sales of the basic ""Express"" models, which were added as a lower-cost alternative to the original Wingmaster line, sales topped seven million guns. On April 13, 2009, the ten millionth Model 870 was produced; the 870 holds the record for best-selling shotgun in history. The 870 features a bottom-loading, side ejecting receiver, tubular magazine under the barrel, dual action bars, internal hammer, and a bolt which locks into an extension in the barrel. The action, receiver, fire control group, safety catch and slide release catch of the Remington Model 870 shotgun are similar to those used on the Remington Model 7600 series pump-action centerfire rifles and carbines. The basic fire control group design was first used in the automatic 11–48. Twelve gauge stocks will also interchange on the older 12-gauge-sized 20-gauge receivers, although modification is needed to fit the smaller sized 20-gauge receivers employed since the late 1970s. Several parts of the 870 will interchange with the semi-automatic Remington 1100 and 11–87. The original 870 models were offered with fixed chokes. In 1986 Remington introduced the new Remington ""Rem Choke"" system of screw-in chokes (also fitted to Remington model 1100 auto-loading shotguns at the same time). Initially, the Rem Chokes were offered only in 12 gauge in barrel lengths of 21"", 26"", and 28"". The following year the availability was expanded to the 20 gauge and included other barrel lengths. Production 870s for over 30 years had a design whereby a user could fail to press a shell all the way into the magazine when loading such that the shell latch did not engage the shell, and such actions could tie up the gun. This was caused by the shell which slipped out of the magazine under the bolt in the receiver to bind the action, requiring rough treatment of the action or even disassembly to clear by the uninitiated. The potential issue was resolved with the introduction of the ""Flexi Tab"" carrier. Guns with this modification can be identified by the ""U""-shaped cut-out on the carrier, visible from below the gun. The cut-out, combined with a modified machining on the underside of the slide assembly, allows the action to be opened with a shell on the carrier."
