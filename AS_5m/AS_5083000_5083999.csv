Maybe you need a light, laser or vertical foregrip – there’s ample space for all of these. Co-witnessed night vision and low-magnification optics are commonly found on rifles in this class, and the extended rail option gives you plenty of room for this. The SOCOM II has the same specially-engineered 16 inch barrel and proprietary muzzle brake as the SOCOM 16, so you can expect the same excellent recoil reduction and low muzzle rise. The two-stage military trigger and fast acquisition sights – a ghost ring rear aperture and XS Tritium front sight – are more features that make the SOCOM II a great choice for a tactical rifle. The SOCOM II is the next step in the evolution of the powerful, compact tactical rifle. Bring Enough Gun™.

I have included the old trigger though I cannot see someone wanting to switch it back. I fired two magazines through it to test reliability and feel the trigger. It was originally meant as my carry weapon but rough times has forced me to sell. I know I will be buying another one soon. Comes with two magazines, manual, OWB paddle holster and case. I urge you to read up on this gun as most people give it great reviews. Most say it is better than the Glock 19. The versatility is awesome. This one is the Compact Medium size. You may switch the internals (without being a gunsmith) and drop them into either a Compact small or Compact Large sized frame. I feel this size is perfect for carry. It comes with night sights and is extremely accurate after shooting just two magazines. No trades please. I am willing to travel to meet at a reasonable distance (30 minutes)."

Had less than 200 rounds through it when I got it, and I've put another 50 down the barrel. Shoots flawlessly, extremely accurate.It comes with a lot of extras. Original grips, hogue rubber grips, fancy hardwood hogue grips (Kingwood), six magazines, magazine holster, two leather holsters, a plastic sig sauer holster, and a set of crimson trace laser sight grips, as well as the original box.I don't really need to get rid of the gun, but I don't need to keep it either. Just seeing whats out there and if anyone is interested. I am willing to sell the gun outright, trade it, of do a mix of cash and trade. For a cash price I'd ask $1100 (there is $400-500 in grips alone, and 6 magazines). I'd be interested to see just about any firearm trade, as long as its a quality gun. Not looking for junk."

I understand the magazine compatibility can be a changed, so a gun set up to accept PX-4 magazines would also be ok, but not a gun chambered in .45 ACP.My local FFL has confirmed that it would not be a problem to transfer a CX-4 into California but the light modifications needed to make it CA legal would have to be performed by the seller prior to shipping. The two necessary modifications are having the magazine release button replaced by a ""bullet button"" type release and having a butt pad installed to increase the overall length of the firearm. I already have both of the parts required for these modifications. Magazines with capacity above 10 rounds could not be included in the sale. (Maybe a bonus for the seller that could sell them separately?)I would love to find an out of state shop with a 9mm CX-4 available that would be willing to make these modifications to make a sale. I will ship the required parts to you, and pay you a reasonable rate for the gunsmithing labor required to make the changes, as well as (of course) paying a fair price of the Beretta itself.Please contact me if this would work for you, I'm ready to buy!"
