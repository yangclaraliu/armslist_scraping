I've put maybe 1500 shots through it, and it's worked great the whole time I've had it. The only reason I'm selling it is to save up for a PCP air rifle. There are a few scuffs on the butt of the stock that actually were on it from shipping, but they're not very big and could easily be covered with stain, if you so desire. You can see the scuffs in one of the photos. Other than that, it's in excellent condition; fires great and is accurate."

There are 300 rounds, some on stripper clips and some in the magazines. The case is specifically for M1 carbines. The belt is Vietnam era and the personal first aid pouch is WWII. As for the magazine pouches I'm not sure if they are WWII, Korea, Vietnam or repro. I don't feel like looking them up so there may be a good one or three in the bunch. As for the rest there is a spare Winchester firing pin, 24 stripper clips, a barrel condom (not sure if original or repro) and an original wooden ammo crate for .30 carbine (50's era) if if the add is up its still available, however I'm letting the add fade into oblivion.

Stock is a Bell and Carlson. Groups under 1 moa with bulk ammunition and close to half moa with hand loads. Out of the factory ammunition I tested blackhill seems to be the best if you don’t reload. The scope is included at the price and would prefer to sell it with the gun. I also have roughly 200 rounds of .308 that go with the gun.
