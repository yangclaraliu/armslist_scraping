History: In 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa. Just prior to the opening of hostilities the Soviet Red Army had started re-arming its infantry, complementing its older bolt-action rifles with the new semi-automatic SVT-38s and SVT-40s. This proved to be somewhat of a shock to the Germans, who ramped up their semi-automatic rifle development efforts significantly. The SVT series used a simple gas-operated mechanism, which was soon emulated by Walther in the G41(W), producing the Gewehr 43 (or G43). The simpler, sturdier design and mechanism of the G43 made it lighter, easier to produce, more reliable and also much tougher than the Gewehr 41; elite German mountain troops would use them as ladder rungs during climbing. The addition of a 10-round detachable box magazine was an improvement over the fixed box magazine of the G41(W). The Gewehr 43 was intended, like the G41, to be loaded using 5-round stripper clips without removing the magazine.[citation needed] Soldiers armed with the weapon typically carried one standard stripper clip pouch and a Gewehr 43 pouch with two spare magazines. The Gewehr 43 was put into production in October 1943, and followed in 1944 by the Karabiner 43 (K43), which was identical to the G43 in every way except for the letter stamped on the side. The name change from Gewehr to Karabiner (carbine) was due to the fact the rifle was actually two centimetres longer than the standard Karabiner 98k and therefore the term Gewehr (meaning: long rifle) was somewhat unfitting. The Wehrmacht intended to equip each grenadier (infantry) company in the army with 19 G43s, including 10 with scopes, for issue as the company commander saw fit. This issue was never completely achieved. Gewehr 43s were made by Berliner-Lübecker Maschinenfabrik in Lübeck (Weapons coded ""duv,"" and later ""qve""). Walther (Weapons coded ""AC"") and the Wilhelm Gustloff-Werke (Weapons coded ""bcd""). Walther used their satellite production facilities at Neuengamme concentration camp in addition to their main production facilities at Zella-Mehlis to make their rifles (It does not appear that complete weapons were assembled in the camps, similar to how Radom P35 pistols were assembled in occupied Radom, Poland sans their barrels which were built and installed by Steyr in Austria), Wilhelm Gustloff-Werke used some slave workers to augment their depleted staff from Buchenwald concentration camp.[2] The total production by the end of the war is estimated to have been 402,713 of both models, including at least 53,435 sniper rifles: these G43/K43s were used as designated marksman/sniper weapons, fitted with the Zielfernrohr 43 (ZF 4) telescopic sight with 4× magnification. The weapon was originally designed for use with the Schiessbecher rifle grenade launcher (standard on the Karabiner 98k as well) and the Schalldämpfer suppressor, however these accessories were deemed unsuccessful in tests and were dropped even before the rifle made it to serial production. The rifle also lacked a bayonet mount. The Gewehr 43 stayed in service with the Czechoslovak People's Army for several years after the war. Likewise the East German border troops and police Volkspolizei or VoPo were issued reworked G43 rifles, which are recognizable by a sunburst proof mark near the serial number and the serial number engraved by electropencil on removable REG: PG160109B"

History: In 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa. Just prior to the opening of hostilities the Soviet Red Army had started re-arming its infantry, complementing its older bolt-action rifles with the new semi-automatic SVT-38s and SVT-40s. This proved to be somewhat of a shock to the Germans, who ramped up their semi-automatic rifle development efforts significantly. The SVT series used a simple gas-operated mechanism, which was soon emulated by Walther in the G41(W), producing the Gewehr 43 (or G43). The simpler, sturdier design and mechanism of the G43 made it lighter, easier to produce, more reliable and also much tougher than the Gewehr 41; elite German mountain troops would use them as ladder rungs during climbing. The addition of a 10-round detachable box magazine was an improvement over the fixed box magazine of the G41(W). The Gewehr 43 was intended, like the G41, to be loaded using 5-round stripper clips without removing the magazine.[citation needed] Soldiers armed with the weapon typically carried one standard stripper clip pouch and a Gewehr 43 pouch with two spare magazines. The Gewehr 43 was put into production in October 1943, and followed in 1944 by the Karabiner 43 (K43), which was identical to the G43 in every way except for the letter stamped on the side. The name change from Gewehr to Karabiner (carbine) was due to the fact the rifle was actually two centimetres longer than the standard Karabiner 98k and therefore the term Gewehr (meaning: long rifle) was somewhat unfitting. The Wehrmacht intended to equip each grenadier (infantry) company in the army with 19 G43s, including 10 with scopes, for issue as the company commander saw fit. This issue was never completely achieved. Gewehr 43s were made by Berliner-Lübecker Maschinenfabrik in Lübeck (Weapons coded ""duv,"" and later ""qve""). Walther (Weapons coded ""AC"") and the Wilhelm Gustloff-Werke (Weapons coded ""bcd""). Walther used their satellite production facilities at Neuengamme concentration camp in addition to their main production facilities at Zella-Mehlis to make their rifles (It does not appear that complete weapons were assembled in the camps, similar to how Radom P35 pistols were assembled in occupied Radom, Poland sans their barrels which were built and installed by Steyr in Austria), Wilhelm Gustloff-Werke used some slave workers to augment their depleted staff from Buchenwald concentration camp.[2] The total production by the end of the war is estimated to have been 402,713 of both models, including at least 53,435 sniper rifles: these G43/K43s were used as designated marksman/sniper weapons, fitted with the Zielfernrohr 43 (ZF 4) telescopic sight with 4× magnification. The weapon was originally designed for use with the Schiessbecher rifle grenade launcher (standard on the Karabiner 98k as well) and the Schalldämpfer suppressor, however these accessories were deemed unsuccessful in tests and were dropped even before the rifle made it to serial production. The rifle also lacked a bayonet mount. The Gewehr 43 stayed in service with the Czechoslovak People's Army for several years after the war. Likewise the East German border troops and police Volkspolizei or VoPo were issued reworked G43 rifles, which are recognizable by a sunburst proof mark near the serial number and the serial number engraved by electropencil on removable REG: PG160109B.

The only way it can be damaged is with some form of aggressive abrasive, like sandpaper. It will last a lifetime as long as you dont abuse it!Each set we create here at Wicked Grips is based on hours of art, style and design… with each art piece created to flow with, and not against the shape of the grip, and the firearm. Because our ideas are so often “borrowed” by others in the industry, we limit our production to 50 pieces, and then discontinue the design. Why? Because we can. We don’t have to wait for someone else to think it up.. create it.. then “borrow” itBASED ON OUR WICKED GRIPS GRAPHICS AND MADE FROM AN ALUMAGRIPS PANEL, EACH SERIES WILL BE LIMITED TO 50 SETS, THEN DISCONTINUED PERMANENTLY."

The only way it can be damaged is with some form of aggressive abrasive, like sandpaper. It will last a lifetime as long as you dont abuse it!Each set we create here at Wicked Grips is based on hours of art, style and design… with each art piece created to flow with, and not against the shape of the grip, and the firearm.

Good shooter with blued round steel barrel, straight walnut stock and a steel butt plate.  - Bluing is good on the barrel and lever, even at muzzle!  - Front and rear sights are in perfect condition  - Bore is excellent - bright and shiny with sharp rifling  - Action is smooth and locks up tight, lever does not sag  - Feed ramp shows minimal wear  - Receiver has surface rust spots on both sides, not affecting reliability or functionality (read more below)  - Walnut stock has no scratches or dents - shows slight staining where the forearm touches the receiver The rifle's serial number dates it to 1966 production. The rifle has been family owned since 1974. It was unused since 1985 until I cleaned it and took it to the range last November and put five shots into a 4-MOA group while kneeling over a wobbly wooden crate. That's with open sights, which is not my forte. Like all of the Winchester model 94 rifles made between 1964 and 1981, the receiver was machined from a graphitic steel casting that does not accept normal blueing.  Furthermore, between 1964 and 1968 Winchester used a Du-Lite 3-0 process that often discolored to copper, plum, or even red.  This rifle's receiver has a plum hue.  The lack of blueing leaves the receiver prone to surface rust, which this rifle has.  It doesn't affect usability or durability in any respect.  The surface rust hasn't progressed since 1985 when it went into a humidity controlled environment.  Today we affectionately call it patina.  Sure, it can be parkerized or cerakoted, but that is SACRILEGE!More Winchester model 94 rifles have been sold than ANY other gun, ever. This is a fantastic caliber, and has taken more deer than any other caliber in the world. This rifle even dropped a bull elk at 125 yards back in '80.  You can get ammo in practically any store that sells ammo - it's that common. Over the rifle's 50 years, I'm unsure how many rounds have been through this rifle. Likely not many given that it's not a target rifle, rifling is SHARP, and was unused for the past 31 years. It is super reliable, shoots well, and is an iconic western classic."

Other than the shell, she has been redone including the sights, the recoil spring, the barrel, the trigger, the beavertail, as well as the now full length guide rod. I put on an underrail to mount lasers and/or flashlights, of which I chose to purchase a brand new, green, Lasermax laser that ran me $195. It's significantly more to go with the green vs standard red, I found out. This pistol will also come with 2 extra sets of grips, an extra magazine, the original bushing tool and an aftermarket one I bought (that's much easier to use), close to 200 rounds of ammunition (of which hollowpoints are included in that), a conceal carry holster, and the original carrying case from Remington. I assure you that this pistol will excite you just as much as it has me. There are about 20 rounds that have been put thru the barrel and her condition is stunning. There isn't much more you could do to it and she's set up perfectly for reliability, as well as performance. I've got almost $1600 into this firearm, not including the ammo, bushing tool, and holster. I had no desire to sell. If it hadn't been for being diagnosed as terminal with my cancer, I would not be getting rid of her. Don't worry about doing anything thru a dealer for legality, just bring me cash and we're good. My asking price is $1100. I want to ask for more, but I figured it would be hard to ask for that much, so yea. I'm pretty firm on the price just considering. I would consider partial trades, but nothing straight across because I need the money. My price will give you everything I listed and I live in Arvada. My name is Justin and my cell is REDACTED. If, for whatever reason, you can't text or call, my email is REDACTED. I need to sell asap. Thank you."
