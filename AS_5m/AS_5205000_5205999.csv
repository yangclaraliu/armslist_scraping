The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs.

Toledo Tactical,"Toledo, Toledo, Ohio",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 23, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I had a one and only experience with Toledo Tactical.  A company that has there name posted but there are apparently nowhere to be found.  Maybe for reasons such as mine.  I bought a lower receiver from this company at one of the local gun shows.  It appeared to be nice and the price was right for me.  It was a billet New Frontier with Toledo Tacticals stamp on it.  Once I began assembly of the parts, I found the any magazines mounted in the mag well we're so sloppy loose that the bolt catch pin would release the magazine follower essentially making last shot hold open null.  I also found the take down and pivot pin holes were grossly oversized about 7/1000th which when any upper receiver was installed on it that it was so sloppy loose that I could clearly see daylight through the entire gap between the two receivers.  The issues with the receiver is not my problem.  It happens.  It may say something about a low budget receiver like what New Frontier has always built, but it's not a retailers fault they are built that way.  It is however the retailers fault for selling such items, whether knowingly or not, and not dealing with the customer to potentially resolve the issues.  I tried calling the only phone number I could find for Toledo Tactical, four times.  Two times, a guy answered and said he would pass the message along to his partner to have him get back in touch with me.  That never happened.  I called two more times thereafter and received only a voicemail.  I gave up trying two months ago with hopes of maybe seeing them at another gun show.  They never went there again either.  So, it is what it is.  If nothing ever amounts to anything for me on this, at least I am passing this along for others to understand.  And I may just keep posting this as long as I keep getting my kicks out of it and for the fact I have nothing to sell currently.  Happy shootin,  be safe."

The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.  Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage.  An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.  The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few and is available in 10, 20 and 30 round capacity with a translucent or opaque polymer body.PayPal: For PayPal transactions please send us your PayPal email address and we will send you an invoice for the products you would like to purchase.

L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.  Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage.  An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.  The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few and is available in 10, 20 and 30 round capacity with a translucent or opaque polymer body.

My wife yells at me all of the time because I spend too much time cleaning my guns. I'm selling it to fund a M1 Garand. I put the mandatory 200 rounds through it to break it in plus maybe another 30 rounds of Hornady Custom XTP rounds. If you look up any reviews for this sized pistol, those are ranked near the top.  I haven't had a single problem with these rounds or the first 200. It is amazing what a good cleaning can do. I am willing to sell the remaining XTP rounds plus a few other boxes of defense ammo I had planned to test out. If you're interested I can send a picture of that inventory. I travel throughout northern and central Illinois, so I am willing to meet you near Chicago, Rockford, Peoria, or Bloomington. Of course you will need your FOID card, and we will need to find a dealer to do the transfer once it is decided."

Comes as a package deal with everything shown in the pictures; Rifle, original magazine, spike Bayonet and frog/scabbard, and sling. Chambered in 303 British. Stock is in great condiditon and is equipped with a brass buttplate instead of the zinc one. I love the thing but I really want an AR15 so Im liquidating a small piece of my armory here. Appears to be a beechwood stock in an oil finish of some type. Bluing is 85% and all of the hardware (Barrel bands, action screws, magazine etc.) are in good + condition. Electropenciling on the reciever is difficult to make out and a bit rubbed off. If youre looking for a good looking shooting rifle, this is it. Im able to manage 4-6 inch groups at 100 yds depending on ammo and what kind of day Im having, and I'm sure an experienced shooter could coax more accuracy out of this thing. Bolt and sights are in good condition and everything functions as it should. Ive deep cleaned this rifle with soap & water, solvent, JB bore polishing compound, and lots of elbow grease. The bore is mirror finish up until the last 2 inches by the muzzle with minor frosting and pitting. Id love to keep this thing and take it hog hunting, its got a nice little pig sticker, but I have to qualify with an AR so Im doing the prudent thing and buying one of those to familiarize myself with that platform. I'm in no rush to sell this rifle, I dont really want to let it go and I dont need the money, but the highest reasonable offer takes it. Email and text are fine. I work nights so the only time I cant respond is in the mornings. Thanks, RobREDACTED"
