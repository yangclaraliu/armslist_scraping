The CA with the crossed barrels marking (faint but visible) above it denotes that this was repaired/refurbished at arsenal. The rear sight style dates it as a 1901 variety. Unlike many examples out there, THIS one has a great looking bore to it too! The action is exactly what you would expect from a Krag as well. Nice and smooth.

I am really digging these pistols. They have the best trigger of any striker fired pistol I have ever experienced. And they are very reliable. The TP9SA is the next evolution of the popular TP series pistol. With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm. Comes with two 18 rd. mags., paddle holster, two interchangeable backstraps, cleaning rod, brush and a limited lifetime manufacturer's warranty. Tax not included. Dealer Sale. Price is firm, no trades. Credit cards accepted (no fee). Visitors by appointment only. Located in North Phoenix. Call or text REDACTED to set up an appointment.

Never fired except for at the remington factory. Reason I am selling so cheap is the rifle is refinished in flat dark earth duracoat and the duracoat has some chips on it. The parkarized finish is perfect under the duracoat however. The duracoat was just added to make the rifle more corrosion resistant and protected. Was gonna use this rifle for a nice long range build but plans have changed. My loss is your gain. These rifles cost $640 new and this one has a $75 larue tactical 20moa scope base. I'm asking 400 for the gun so you're basically getting a brand new rifle for a $315 discount. Comes with original box.

If you are a tinkerer or budding gunsmith this is your chance to get a neat little rifle at a bargain price and have a project to do in your spare time to boot!This will come with a bunch of additional parts including a new main spring and buffer, another trigger pack, a hammer spring, a second set of scope rings and some other stuff so you can start your trouble shooting right away! It probably just needs a little tweak or two and you will have a smooth running little rifle. This will be the perfect gun for a new shooter, as a truck/tractor gun, or just for plinking. This will come with a different scope as shown, since I found out the one I initially mounted would not adjust properly, and I'll throw in 100 rounds of 22 to get you started.Contact via email or text to 610-three four nine- 2750.
