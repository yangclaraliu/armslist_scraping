All of the above items will be sold as a set as I will not separate. I also want to mention that the above items total $849 new with tax and all of the above mentioned are still brand new.

Let me know if you have any questions.The BowTech Experience compound bow has started with the technology that has ensured the company is one of the most respected in the industry and then added to it to create the smoothest and most forgiving bow possible. Every aspect of the design of the Experience has been developed to improve the shooting experience of the hunter with a smooth and vibration-free shot every time.Part of the process of dampening any vibration or noise has been developed with the introduction of carbon core limbs with impact resistant skin. The carbon centre means that there is increased vibration dampening at work and it acts with intense efficiency.The bow makes use of the Overdrive Binary synchronized dual cam system for plenty of power but, even more importantly, a high level of tuning and consistency. It is this cam system that provides a comfortable draw cycle and ensuring greater accuracy through the stability that is achieved.The Bowtech Experience is the type of bow that aims to ensure the hunter appreciates everything that is enjoyable about drawing back a quality bow. It also remembers that part of the enjoyable experience in the process is shooting accuracy.The bow was available in Blackops and Mossy Oak Infinity finish to complete the total hunting suitability."

I will include a full chamber of ammo as a bonus.  The pictures don't do it justice.  There is no rust or pitting.  Only the nickle has warn off over the years but could be be re-nickled or powder coated. Would be worth hunders if the finish was restored.  Or you can strip it and bule it easliy.  It takes S&W 32 caliber center fire ammo that can be purchased in Kenosha at 'The Gun Store' on Sharidan Rd. north of Carthage College or online."

It is a 6 shot revolver with a 4"" barrel. It was recently graded at 95% on grips - 98% on blueing - by a licensed gunsmith.  The Serial Number is D3873XX and this was a S&W that was issued to a Green County Kentucky Sheriff's Department in 1972. This is a great item ... A gun this age in this shape is hard to find. I had rather sale and would take $600 for the gun ... Or would be open to trades for a trade value of $650 to $700. I also have a rare S&W Miltary and Police gun box from the mid to late 40's. The box is in the picture. On Ebay these boxes are going for anywhwer from $150 to $250 ... some even more ... and this one would be on the better end of what is selling on Ebay. I am asking $200 for this collector's box. I would also consider trading it. On the revolver I would consider a 1911 ... a Walther PPK ... Certain Sigs or KimbersOn the box I would consider small .25 caliber, .32 caliber, or .22 semi auto pistols and riflesPPP or CCW needed for purchase of gun - Make an offer ... Worst I can say is ""no thanks"""

Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45. Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45."

Most feature our exclusive InterLock® design--a raised ring inside the jacket that is embedded in the bullet's core that keeps the core and jacket locked together during expansion to retain mass and energy.SECANT OGIVE DESIGNPioneered by Hornady® for use in hunting bullets, this technology broke new ground in ballistic engineering and is now used in bullets for everything from match to varmint shooting.The secant ogive is a geometrically developed design that creates the most ballistically efficient profile, yet retains the optimum bearing surface. The combination of the slender point and increased bearing surface results in lower drag, increased stability, flatter trajectories, and amazing accuracy."

It has obviously been buffed and refinished a while back in its career. It was born just after the turn of the last century and shipped to Simmons Hardware Company, St. Louis, Missouri, August 11, 1908, with 29 other guns. The bore is slightly pitted, but certainly shootable, with strong rifling. Here's what else I know. The grips are proper vintage original Colt, but not numbered to this gun. Both the trigger guard and back strap are NOT numbered. Since the factory rarely missed these numbers, it is safe to assume these parts were replaced at some time. The hammer notches and lock up are very good. Accompanying the Colt is a vintage carved basket weave holster of unknown origin."
