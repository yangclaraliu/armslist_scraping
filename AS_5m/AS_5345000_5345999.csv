It has only been fired less than 50 rounds, never carried or holstered. The pistol comes with two higher-capacity factory stainless mags, a nice USA-made DeSantis holster, all original packaging & paperwork, factory spent shell casing, and original box. There in no wear of any kind; this pistol could be sold as new and you would never know. It's that clean.Both magazines have been upgraded with Corso Inc. MagGuts, which include stainless steel followers and their patented dual-spring system. This upgrade also increases the capacity of each magazine by one, so instead of the mags holding 7 and 8, they now hold 8 and 9. They also feed more reliably than the factory plastic followers and single springs. The original parts are also included. The upgrades were $23 per magazine.The holster is a DeSantis all Leather ""Sof-Tuck"" inside-the-waist band holster in new condition. The holster is custom made for this pistol, and fits literally like a glove. It's made in the USA to very high standards. The holster cost about $30+.Buyer pays transfer fee; a local FFL in Mt Vernon only charges $25. No taxes or other fees. The price of $400 is firm. I'm not in a hurry to sell, so please don't direct me to a site where you can find it cheaper. With the upgrades, no tax, and holster, it is worth my selling price. Any less, and I'll keep it. I might be interested in trades for antique or unique firearms.  Partial trades are OK... I can add cash for the right trade.   I'm no interested in any non-firearm trades, sorry.Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

This gun was made by a very good private GunSmith, utilizing all quality parts. The gun was fitted with an (oldschool spot-on) point of aim shooting American Military Colt/Springfield National Match team barrel with the 7791193 number rollmark. I am not a history perfectionist about the 779 NM barrels, but I did research the net like crazy to conclude this as factual. The National Match numbers are shown on the barrel hood in the photos and match the time line of the U.S. Military's 1960's production barrels (sometime around or before 1963). This barrel is hard as the dickens and was RC hardness tested by my GunSmith to prove it. He schooled me on the fascinating history of military barrels and all the great stories behind them. It is configured and fit to shoot fast and on target. This entire 1911 gun has a black duracoat finish. Please stop to look at the great condition and nice looking 45 Gold Cup style 1911. It has a really nice flat top and serrations, Gold Cup Style like the Colt Gold Cup. Please also review the photos to see the Gun's set up and well put together configuration. This very well balanced and professionally fitted combo, sports a full size 5 inch 7791193 Match/Military barrel. The Slide to frame fit was well executed and the gun is filled with good parts. This oldschool Goldcup Style 1911 was outfitted with a real nicely lined up sight combination with a front night sight shown in the photos, that blows away the 10 Ring on targets. I personally test fired it with my local GunSmith Steve Fischer who is a well known GunSmith here in Florida. We were impressed by the old National Match barrel. The rear sight is really nicely lined up to the GoldCup style flat top serrations, making it a nice aesthetic combination. The gun was neatly fit overall and has functioning a Match grade extractor and ejector fitted to it. The hammer is a Chip McKormick Kimber style hammer. The Caspian frame also has a high ride Chip McKormick grip safety fitted to it for a high hold grip so you can line up a nice point of aim shot. This full size metal monster has a great Magwell and Kimber grip set, which provides a positive purchase grip when held. This nice grip it has also helps to blast your target's bullseye away. The frame Magwell and high hold allows fast magazine reloads. It has an ingenious Caspain integral MagWell that really does make a real difference when reloading. As you can see in the photos, it also has a race extended Magazine thumb release for super speedy reloading action. It was coated very nicely, as shown in the pictures and sports some nice and neat Kimber full size magazine-well grips. This gun is a nice treat to take to the range or to your local 1911 gun shooting competition. It has a very low round count, which were fired during the professional test fire my GunSmith performed. I got to shoot a couple magazines worth while he test fired it and I was impressed with the GoldCup style flat top sight plain, and it's sight line up. I am pricing this one lower than my other high end auctions, for what should be an easy and quick sale. It handles more like shooting a 6 inch or 7 inch length barrel 1911, because this gun is solid steel throughout the entire gun. It is filled with quality american parts. I will hate to see this gun go but I need the money. It's another 1911 work of art I photographed with a high quality and high resolution digital camera with 14 megapixels. So what you see is what you get, and is without a doubt quite the shooter for race competition or home defense. This 1911 comes with one Colt magazine that was tuned to the gun by Professional Master GunSmith Steve Fischer, from here in Sunny South Florida. Happy bidding and good luck. Thank you for looking at my auctions. There will be more to come so keep in tune. Before we move on to the rules and payment section of the description... Please allow me to take this time to expand on Fischer's background and facts, as a true Master GunSmith. Steve Fischer is an old buddy of the world famous Wayne Novak, whom I have had the pleasure of meeting. They went to GunSmith School together in the same Class in Colorado over three decades ago, and they graduated from the GunSmith school together. Both men graduating from the same class set out to be partners and legends. They started their careers together working for Armand Swenson. Swenson stole the first idea on Dovetail sights that Wayne Novak firstly invented back then. After a confrontation in regards to this fall out with Swenson... Novak and Fischer quit. Both acclaimed men told me the story along the lines of that in addition to Wayne's idea and first sight design being robbed of him... they both told me the story with a smile, that the Armand parts were out of spec all the time and so hard to work with. They both claim and explained, they ""made one gun in the time they could have made 4 if they were using better parts."" So they learned a hard lesson and broke free, quitting Swenson's ""sweatshop"" and workbench. They left the mediocre Armand Swenson outfit and assembly line, to begin their personal rise above the rest of the 1911 world at the time. They began expanding their explosive careers as GunSmiths, and the rest as you know is history. We all know Wayne Novak for his sights and great gunwork. Steve Fischer, Novak's old colleague went on to work for Colt as one of the lead GunSmiths. From there Steve Fischer went onward to open his own successful GunSmith operation, which has stayed open in sunny south Florida for over 3 decades. Steve is also a champ competition shooter, and he still wins Shotgun matches held yearly in Minneapolis to this day. Additionally Steve is so Old-School, he even knows how to shoot from the hip and smokes the competition in whatever style of shooting he chooses. He looks like a battle troll when I go shooting with him. It is a strange unexpected and powerful metamorphosis to see this 71 year old man go from a regular guy into shooting mode. It almost looks like an ora glows around him and he transforms into like some kind of troll or a stalky looking battle dwarf-thing from Lord of the Rings. A real treat to learn from and have as a friend. I have seen the old battle hound at work and it is no joke. Fischer is also the first GunSmith to make a compensated 40 caliber 1911, shown in an old 80's Gun News Gun Magazine back in the year 1980. Steve worked and built up the gun shown in the photos, helping to make it a real master piece in gun mechanics. In addition to the work Fischer did on this gun for me to tune it up, Fischer tuned a nice magazine up to be mated to this speedy and highly responsive race gun... What Fischer did was he timed and tested the innards of the mag in mention, utilizing a CobraMag spring for this gun's Colt Magazine. F.y.i. CobraMag and CobrMag parts are made by the ever famous 2010 American PistolSmith Guild's award winner. Whose CobraMag from Trippreasearch dot com, holds the world record of the only 1911 magazine to pass a 55,000 (sick and grueling) round test without failure. That's right, astounding and out of this world! You heard/read it right... 55,000 rounds blasting off without a hiccup, jam, or hitch. Damn that is a nasty record my friends!!! So in other words this gun including the magazine has been tuned to run superbly for your enjoyment at the range, shooting tactical course, or save your bacon in a self defense situation when the chips are down with your a** on the line."

It's the perfect and most popular caliber for this type of pistol. .25 has low velocity and is too weak to have any practical use for protection. .32 ACP is powerful enough but way too expensive to use for anything except strictly personal defense. .22LR has enough velocity to penetrate and do the job you want it to, and it's the cheapest most common round on earth so this pistol also doubles as a really fun little plinker or range toy. It's also one of the smallest pistols you can find in Mass      It's a pre 98 pistol and the newer ones are not MA compliant so these are hard to come by in Mass.      The pistol is in very nice shape, the finish is in surprisingly good condition considering that these guns get a little beat up the way people traditionally carry them bouncing around in a pocket. I test fired the gun a week ago and it cycled two mags back to back flawlessly. It comes with the original box, owners manual/ paperwork, and an extra mag.I'm using the proceeds from this sale to find another gun project so I not interested in trades unless it's something particularly rare and interesting. Im all out of FA10 transfers so the transfer will need to be done through an FFL (buyer pays transfer fees)"

Take a look at the pictures and ask any questions. The action is smooth, the gun is clean, the markings are crisp and the finish is excellent. The serial puts this in the early range of the 1943-1948 records that were lost, but it's clearly a pre-64 production model. Please feel free to ask any questions. I'm looking at an upcoming move and need to pair down the ones I don't shoot as much as I should. This is a beuatiful genuine vintage 1894 Carbine that shoots and looks great! Plenty more high quality pictures on request. This rifle may qualify as a C&R, depending on your local rules. If so I'm willing to ship and transfer on your dime according to local, state, and federal laws.  It is your responsibility to determine and certify the eligibility in accordance with your local and state laws. It is your responsibility to determine the safety of this and any used firearm who's history you are unfamiliar with. If you are unable to do so, consult the services of a qualified gunsmith. US only. FTF in MD anywhere south of La Plata, North east of Dalhgren and southwest of Prince Fredrick. Willing to travel extra for time/gas compensation possibly."

Comes with 5 - 35rd mags. The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army.  The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied. This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol.  The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position.Product Specs   Caliber:  9x19mm Action:  Semi-automatic Mag capacity:  35rd mag Length:  615mm Barrel length:  250mm Effective Range:  200 meters"

These go for 15-16 bucks at gun shows for average ones, 24 bucks at Sportman's guide and a lot more for Chinese-made ones at other stores.

It was restocked (ugh!), and also someone changed the front and rear site (double ugh!).The rifle still fires and I've included close ups of all the stamping. Please contact me for questions and/or additional photos. Below is a better explanation of this rifle:The Mannlicher Gew.98/40 German Infantry Rifle was known by the Germans as the Infanterie Gewehre G98/40.These German contract guns were made from 1941 to 1944 by Fémáru Fegyver és Gépgyár, Budapest, (German Ordnance code “jhv”), with some or all of the work possibly subcontracted to Danuvia Gépgyár, Budapest (German Ordnance code “jua”). {Note added by Claven2: During the war, the German’s referred to Fémáru Fegyver és Gépgyár, Budapest as Metallwaren-Waffen und Maschinenfabrik, Budapest (HU). After the war, the arms maker became known commonly as “FEG”. A full list of codes, including jhv, and most WaA's can be referenced in the following Milsurps Knowledge Library entry: ""Das Heereswaffenamt"" (Detailed Listing of German WaA Markings and Codes)}The Hungarian-made G98/40 is not a mauser, and shares nothing significant with the G98, rather it is a mannlicher-based receiver design patterned after the Hungarian 35M, the only firearm ever purpose-built for the 8x56R cartridge. The G98/40 was contracted as a war-expedient, to exploit the existing 35M tooling. They were issued primarily to the Luftwaffe.Distinguishing features of the G98/40 include:- mannlicher-based receiver design with all steel parts blued;- two-piece bolt with detachable bolt-heads, and bolt handle positonned ahead of the receiver bridge;- chambered in 8x57;- two-piece stock system (similar to that found on the Lee Enfield). Early stocks were walnut, later laminate; and- mauser sling, bayonet and staggered row magazine designs, allowing the use of the K98 sling, bayonet and stripper clips.In 1943, the Hungarian Government, adopted a variation of the G98/40 known as the 43M, which differs slightly in sling and bayonet arrangements, but is otherwise identical to the G98/40."

The gun is in great condition with very minimal wear. Fun to shoot with low recoil. Used this one to teach my wife, son and neighbor kids how to shoot.  Can be used for self defense as well (10 rounds on target sure beats a lot of larger caliber misses). Low cost of ammo leads to more shooting/practice too ($2.50 for 50 rounds vs $12 for 50 rounds of 9mm). Let me know if you are interested. I have a membership to the Hampton Superior Pawn and gun if you would like to shoot it before buying (I will need to see the cash upfront though). Please don't try to talk me down on price as this is less then half of what the gun costs."
