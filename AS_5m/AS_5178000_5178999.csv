This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game.Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it's not a descendant of anything. Available in. This rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.Its straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide."

After 35 rounds shot in comparison to a TRP Operator that had been fitted with a traditional 1911 barrel system, instead of a bull barrel, I sent the gun back for some changes. This Operator had work done by Springfield Armory Custom Shop to replace the bull barrell with a new fitted match barrel, bushing, and slide with original springfield factory parts. The adjustable sights were replaced with Springfield's fixed night sights and I elected to not have ""TRP"" engraved on the side of the slide(to save money and because I dont like it). The bushing system also eliminates the use of a tool for field stripping
It has been shot 35 times since then and is absolutely amazing! It shoots better, feels better, and looks better.I will have to buy it again when I can.
