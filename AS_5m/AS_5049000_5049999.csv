Besides the standard rear conversion i've also had some other work performed for me by Legion USA including the installation of a Russian front sight with a 24x1.5 mm threading as well as a standard 74 brake. The rifle is currently wearing all Magpul Zhukov furniture (as well as a Magpul AFG-2) which I've painted with high temp rustoleum to match the brown 74 magazines that I usually run with it. I had to replace the Saiga gas tube with a standard Russian one to allow for the installation of the upper handguard. I'd say that the rifle has seen no more than 500 rounds down the tube. Ive always had a larger stockpile of 7.62x39 than 5.45x39 so the 47 gets more range time unfortunately. Everything lines up perfectly--there is no cant in the trunnion or the sights--or anywhere for that matter. Its a straight shooter and Ive rung steel out to 300 yards pretty consistently with the bushnell scope you can see in the pics. The rifle would come with everything pictured as well as three 30 round magazines.Mostly looking to see what's out there in trade but if nothing interesting arrives I might consider a cash sale. I'd be looking for $1150. Buyer will need to take care of the transfer fees at an FFL location convenient for us bothIf you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me.

Glocks are also popular weapons amongst civilians for home/self defense and concealed/open carry.The company's founder, engineer Gaston Glock, had no experience with firearm design or manufacture at the time their first pistol, the Glock 17, was being prototyped. Glock did, however, have extensive experience in advanced synthetic polymers, knowledge of which was instrumental in the company's design of the first commercially successful line of pistols with a polymer frame. Glock introduced ferritic nitrocarburizing into the firearms industry as an anti-corrosion surface treatment for metal gun parts.The Glock 19 is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the ""Compact"" by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19 has a barrel and pistol grip that are shorter by approximately 12 mm (0.5 in) compared to the Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19, and 33 rounds. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, the mass of the slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19.Features:Caliber: 9mmCapacity: 15Barrel Length: 4""Finish: Polymer/NickelGrip: Black PolymerAction: Semi-AutoSafety: RHSights: FixedWeight: 1.88625 lbs"

The choice of America’s best shooters. Kimber is the most popular 1911 pistol in the world and Kimber quality is unequaled by any other manufacturer. The Custom family is where it all began.
The Custom II .45 ACP established the Kimber legacy by offering custom pistol performance for a production pistol price. Standard features ensure the kind of accuracy and dependability that made Kimber the most popular 1911 brand in the world, and 1911 ergonomics make it ideal for carry and defense. The Custom II has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Custom II is ready for everything from duty carry to recreational shooting and personal defense.Kimber Custom II Specifications

The gun has been Cerakoted Flat Dark Earth. It also has a grip reduction, which allows for a more complete and higher grip. It has also been stippled which significantly increases the texture, meaning grip is vastly increased. The stippling is aggressive, but not harsh on the hand making this gun very easy to shoot. The stock barrel has been upgraded to a 1/2x28 threaded KKM Precision match grade barrel and comes with a thread protector. The upgraded barrel has been Cerakoted black and the feed ramp has been polished to a mirror finish to increase reliability. The gun has had extensive internal modification. An APEX Tactical Solutions Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit has been installed as well as an APEX Aluminum Trigger Kit, APEX Failure Resistant Extractor, APEX Reset Assist Mechanism (helps create a sharp, audible reset), and Warren Tactical two dot night sights. In addition, all critical internal surfaces have been polished to a mirror finish to make the trigger pull smoother and more crisp. The gun comes in its original S&W hard case (matching serial number) with all of it's included trim (additional back straps, gun lock, paperwork, test bullet/case, etc). The gun comes with the two original 17 round magazines. Also included are all of the stock parts which were swapped out including the stock barrel (which has also had its feed ramp polished to a mirror finish) and sights. The packaging for the APEX upgrades is also included. I am selling the gun to make room for other projects, but am in no rush. Therefore, the price is $1000.00 firm. Consider; Warren Tactical Night Sights: $129.99, APEX Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit: $92.95, APEX Aluminum Trigger Kit: $76.95, APEX Failure Resistant Extractor: $45.95, APEX Reset Assist Mechanism: $23.95, Cerakote: $200.00, KKM Precision Barrel: $230.00, M&P9 Pro: $689.00, Total: $1488.79. This total excludes the cost for the Action Polish, Feed Ramp Polish, Grip Reduction, and Stippling. The asking price reflects the fact the gun is used. No low ball offers will be considered. The buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale (which will include their name and driver's license number). I will not ship the gun. I am willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet and complete the sale if necessary and am willing to go as far as Phoenix, but the price would increase to $1200.00.

The description of his highly acclaimed products such as match-grade uppers and custom reloading supplies, including detailed information on the 6mm AR Turbo 40° Improved highlighted here, can be found at his website: http://www.6mmar.com. To achieve this level of performance, please note that this round is a custom cartridge that requires reloading. The case must first be resized using the 6.5 Grendel brass with a special custom sizing die and then ""fire-formed"" to achieve the 40° case shoulder. If you are not familiar with these reloading steps and techniques or do not want to perform these necessary steps to reload your own ammunition, this is NOT for you. Commercial ammunition is not currently available.This upper has a 26"" Krieger match barrel with a heavy-walled DPMS upper receiver and has the right-side charging handle. It comes with 100 pieces of lapua brass, 100+ cci primers, 1 lb keg of reloader 19, 1 box of hornady 105 gr 6mm projectiles, bore guide, 2-10 rd mags, 1-25 rd mag.  The rifle you see in the picture is this upper.  I purchased this new and fired about 70 rds through it.  Listing is not for lower, scope, scope mount or rings.  That can be sold separately.  Only selling this because I no longer have time to reload due to my family situation.  No 6 month wait for an upper from AR-X.  Check the predator forums, this is the best AR-15 coyote hunting option out there.  $1,650.00  Any questions text 336-4 seven 9-0686."
