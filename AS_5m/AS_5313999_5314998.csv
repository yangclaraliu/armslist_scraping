Picked up a g43 so I'm looking for a bigger gun for range/home defense use, so that's the only reason why I'm selling or trading it. Looking for a glock 17, has to be gen3 or gen 4 so I can hang my stream light off it. If it's a gen 4 I will add a tiny amount of cash on top but not more than 30 bucks, or I could work out a trade for some 9mm or 45 ammo. If I were to sell it the glock will come with 1 square notch pre ban 15rd mag, that I can include with/or without depending on the purchase price. The g19 has trigger work done by a certified glock armorer known well in my area, a glock extended mag release, and a glock extended slide release. Don't have the original Tupperware I think I misplaced it when we moved last year. I can also throw in a used but working alien gear right hand draw iwb holster too. Looking for either a trade for a g17, or cash price for just the glock no mag, 600. For the glock with the square notch 680, and depending on trade or sale I can throw in the holster. Thanks for your time! May also consider an ak74 or a ptr91 as a trade as well, worst I can say is no. Thanks! All laws will be followed."

Sling seems to be the original. Pretty dinged up as most of these are, but solid without cracks. Some TLC would make it much nicer. This was on a K98 but I switched it out. Based on the markings on the butt plate and large ""7.62"" on the bottom of the stock, I believe it to be Israeli origin or from a K98 that was rearseneled by the Israelis.

Sometimes you need something a little different. A full sized battle rifle can be a tight squeeze in your truck or in the heavy brush. The Springfield Armory® M1A-A1™ Scout Squad™ combines the legendary power and reliability of the M1A™ with the quick handling and fast sight acquisition of a scout style rifle. From the two-stage military trigger to the aperture style rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation), you’ll find that the Scout Squad™ is packed with all the standard features that make the M1A™ great.
The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil. Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle.

Excellent shape with original box, Hogue grip, Serpa Holster, Sig Nite Sights and 2 magazines. Firm on Price - onpen to trades but it has to be something I can't live without. Update - don't ask my bottom dollar - I won't respond - ""firm"" should tell you what you need to know. For those not familar with the DAK trigger, here is the description:DAK-(for Double Action Kellerman, after the designer of the system). When firing the pistol the first trigger pull is only 6.5 lbf (compared to 12 lbf for the standard DAO). After the pistol fires and the trigger is released forward the trigger has an intermediate reset point that is approximately halfway to the trigger at rest position. The trigger pull from this intermediate reset point is 8.5 lbf. If the trigger is released all the way forward, this will engage the primary trigger reset and have a trigger pull of 6.5 lbf. To engage the intermediate reset the trigger must be held to the rear while the slide is cycled, either manually or by the recoil of a round being fired.In bare-bones description, the DAK mechanism provides a hammer-fired full-length double-action trigger pull, with complete repeat-strike capability, that is notably lighter than other full-length DAO pull mechanisms. Developed by the engineers at Sauer in Germany, the new DAK trigger system delivers a smooth, consistent 6.5-pound full-length trigger pull that is much closer to the weight of a Glock than any conventional DAO but also has complete restrike capability without any pretensioning or prestressing of the internal firing mechanism. There is nothing magical about the design; everything is accomplished by simple mechanical advantages in the trigger/hammer linkages. The key is that the engineers were able to extend the ""leverage arm"" of the hammer from the pivot point (like sitting farther from the fulcrum of a seesaw) so that less force is required from the trigger while remaining within the existing dimensions of the P226 and P229 frames. Externally, the only visible difference between a SIG DAK mechanism and a conventional SIG DAO mechanism is that the DAK trigger has a slightly slimmer profile and the DAK hammer sits completely within the frame when at rest, while the DAO hammer protrudes slightly. Other attractive features include the fact that the slide must be locked back and the magazine removed to disassemble, and it can be disassembled without having to pull the trigger."
