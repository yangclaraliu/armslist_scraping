All metal frame reduces recoil. Two 6 shot magazines, one with an extension that makes it easier to hold on to.The reason the slide is polished stainless is because after being carried in a pocket holster for three days, the finish started to wear off. It looked terrible, so I simply removed the finish coating. I think the gun actually looks better this way.I've shot less than 100 rounds through the firearm. It has been completely reliable. It has less felt recoil than either the Ruger LCP or the Smith & Wesson Bodyguard.Comes with the original box and all that was in it.  My reason for selling is that I bought a CZ 83, which is chambered in .380.There is absolutely nothing about this gun that I don't like. It is well made and as accurate as you can expect a pocket 380 to be. I just need the money.You will need a valid permit and license to purchase. Lowball offers will be ignored.

Their are some cosmetic issues to the sub woofer box (please see pic) box was damaged by the moving company, does not affect performance of the unit. Head unit works good, all cables are there, factory remote, all 5 speakers, some brackets missing from the speakers, you will have to purchase speaker wires as the ones I have are all cut/damaged.  All items that are missing or damaged can be sourced from Ebay or Amazon. The price I am asking is way below its actual value! The price reflects the missing and or damage to the unit. This is a great opportunity to own a really nice Bose system for a fraction of the price. What you see in the pic is what you get no instructions or box. Please feel free to call me for more info or detailed pics. Asking $750 or best offer. This system if perfect would be over $2000  Please call or text David at REDACTED.

It runs surplus 7.62x25 flawlessly with the included mag block and two lightly modified PPS-43 mags.This upper is equipped with a FULL AUTO bolt carrier group and it FA ready.I have run about 750 rounds of Polish surplus through this upper.The cool part - When I ordered this upper, I had Ron throat the chamber and use a 1 in 10"" twist barrel. The result is the ability to launch the 208 grain A-Max at 1050 fps. For this application, regular AR mags are used. Ron tested the subsonic load and assures me it runs fine.Barrel is threaded 5/8""x24 and comes with a standard AR-10 flash hider.Most 9mm cans should run fine on this setup. I really love this upper, but I have a new project that requires safe room and $$Along with the upper, I have a Redding die set, and 400 pieces of brass. I have the original mag that came with the upper, and 10 more unmodified PPS-43 mags that will accompany it.This is a big setup that I invested heavily in.Asking price for full package - $950I'll split up, but would prefer to sell the upper first.Trade options - Maybe an Aimpoint T-1 or T-2 2moa or Kimber Mountain Ascent in .308 (cash either way to even)PM or email interest to REDACTEDThanks!"

Produced in 2013. 7.62x39mm caliber. Has a ""worn finish"" on it to look like battlefield pickup but the upper handguard and stock are not worn/finished which do not have any scratches or scuffs on it. There's some small gouges from the previous owner on the top of the stock which can be easily sanded out. The rifle does not have a ""sticky bolt"" issue or gritty stock trigger on it as it was polished. It's a very fine shooting rifle and action is very smooth. I've put about 200 rounds through this rifle without any issue. Don't believe what you've read on the Internet about WASRs as it applied to old WASR rifles. Comes with 2, 30 round steel mags and the original wood lower handguard, original grip and screw, plus the black polymer upper handguard. I just like the two-toned poly/wood look. One is Chinese (flat back) and one is Romanian (ribbed back, double thickness). I can ship if you are out of state if you overnight a US Post Office Money Order plus add $40 for s/h which is the cost of the last rifle I shipped but won't ship to a gun unfriendly state (California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, etc). I have shipped a few items out of state with very satisfied buyers. I'm available to meet at River City Marketplace in Jacksonville at anytime.

If you love fine leather, fine craftsmanship and a superbly functional, useful sling, our Competitor Plus is going to make you extremely happy! What you get is a no-compromise reproduction of the original 1907 Military Sling; the one that's become the standard among hi-power service rifle shooters and many knowledgeable hunters; the one that's sought after by collectors and restorers of pre-WWII military firearms and the one that's carried more guns, more miles on more shoulders than darn near any other. Ours has all the good stuff: 1) It's all U.S. made of the finest, oak-tanned, top grain, U.S. steer hide. 2) It's fitted with thick, forged, blued steel hooks. 3) Each hook is attached with three rivets. 4) The Keepers are stitched and fit TIGHT! Once we eliminated all the shortcomings of the current crop of '07 copies, we convinced a sling maker that folks who use their guns really do want better not cheaper. Once the maker believed, they gave us suggestions concerning the leather."

I recently took my truck in for service and low & behold (never used that phrase before) when I picked up my truck the knife was sitting on my console, found by a technician. I had looked hi & lo (another first time) for it in my truck! Anyway I was so happy and couldn't believe it was actually found. I had it all of a week before losing it A-FREAKIN-GAIN! My wife is proven correct again - I'm an F'n idiot! Actually the fact a pocket knife is so important to me makes me a freakin idiot - but its really all I got. Anyway, I just found out, that particular model w/the charcoal dymondwood has been discontinued by Buck. I would like to buy or trade if someone has one - it has to be the exact model though (Gray/Blue Dymond tree wood - I know). Ideally your a knife freak who just happens to have one sitting around that is still new in the box (or like new). There is one place I found online that still has inventory (or 1) and its selling for $42. I will order that if I can't find a nice pre-owned one shipped to me for cheaper (or trade) from an Armslister. Let me know, Thanks."
