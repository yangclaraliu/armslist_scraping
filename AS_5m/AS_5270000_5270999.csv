I received this brand new in case Springfield XD9 4"" Full Size Service Model 9mm pistol from my local gun shop last week after ordering it online. It is the ""essentials"" package which includes the Springfield XD9101HC 4"" Full Size Model 9mm Black pistol, two 16 round stainless steel magazines, bore brush, gun lock, plastic Springfield case, and manuals. This gun has never been fired since coming from the factory. The warranty information has not been registered with Springfield. 
I love the Springfield pistols, with the only reason I am selling this one is to purchase a new XDS 9mm that is more to my liking as far as size. 
From the Springfield website: ""The XD® 4″ Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD® 4″ Full Size has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD® 4” Full Size is the original XD® offering from Springfield Armory®, and the most basic XD®. This is the XD® that started it all.
The XD® 4″ Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and accuracy you’d expect from a standard sized pistol. All Springfield Armory® XD®’s have several features that make the XD® easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See how it all started and check out the XD® 4” Full Size. Where you point is where you shoot.""

I contacted him and explained my situation, expressed my utmost apologies and he was forgiving and said he understood and said he would like to reschedule and that it wasn't a big deal because we were going to meet very close to his job which he could leave at anytime. So I don't know what he meant by he ""traveled"" to meet me. What this is really all about is he is mad that I decided against trading him because I noticed in his pics that the base of one of his mags had epoxy on it which means he probably hacked the mag so he could install the mag base and epoxied it up. I can't trust my families life or mine to a gun that's been tampered with. When I inquired about it he tried to say it was factory and came that way. Hmm two mags in the pic and only that one had epoxy on it. Also that model of gun only comes with one mag so he straight lied to me in response to my questions. I will not do business with a person that is going to lie about working on a mag and probably opened up the gun and fiddled with it's insides as well. I've met a lot of great men and women on this site that have been very honest and happy with business conducted.Too everyone that pointed this crazy persons post out to me and offered your kind words I greatly appreciate it. I only hope he does the right thing and takes the mag out of service and becomes more honest with people rather than try to deceive people, rip them off and put them in a potentially life threatening situation."

Clamps directly to barrel for maximum stability and accuracy. Solid, one-piece 6061-T6 hard anodized aluminum body. Comes with 4140 steel clamps, screws, allen wrench, and instructions. No gunsmithing required. Made in U.S.A.This particular mount was installed on one MAK90 (twice) and is being sold off only because I want to return my rifle to a traditional configuration. I’ve run the same TRS-25 for several years on the mount and never had a single issue. I don’t know 100% if this will work on standard AK’s but I’ve got a hunch that it will because it’s necessary to modify the lower handguard on a Chinese AK to make this fit. In other words, I think the only real difference is the vent holes in this model which (if you know anything about AK’s) isn’t going to effect the operation of your weapon one way or the other. If you want to bring your AK over and try it out, that’s not a problem.It’s a solid piece of aluminum that clamps on with 4 screws, so no opportunity via moving parts for “wear and tear” here. The price is fair…and firm. $75 at my place in Saint Clair Shores."

I purchased it, work got busy, put it in the safe, and never took it to the range.
 From the internet: “The NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semi auto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement. Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. The PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextrous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering. The lines of the pistol are snag-free and make un-holstering and re-holstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable back-straps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand. This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame. Whether it is for official military and law-enforcement use, for home defense and concealed carry or as an accurate and high-quality pistol for recreational shooting, the PX4 Storm is one piece of gear that will never let you down. ”"

Best miniature gun I have found, just don’t need something this small anymore.  Comes with original case, docs, (2) 6 round flush fit mags and (1) 7 extended magazine.  Just installed fresh springs and disassembled/cleaned the mags. I ran Precision One hollow points when carrying, HPR, Remington or 95 gr reloaded ball ammo for practice. Gun was not reliable with the solid Leigh machined projectiles, (the cross shaped nose would not feed consistently) and did not chamber Fiocchi ammunition due to the case crimp they use on their rounds.  Price is firm, not interested in any trades.
