The lower receiver is an Aero Precision Gen. 2 and has a CMMG springs and detents. Almost all of the lower parts themselves are upgraded. For starters, the magazine release is made by Odin Works. Strike Industries provided the takedown pins, ambidextrous short throw selector (60* or it can be set like a standard selector at 90* by reversing it), and enhanced trigger guard. A Phase 5 EBRV2 (extended bolt release) makes it easy to change mags and stay in target with easy trigger finger manipulation. The take down pins are also Strike Industries and make it very easy to detach the receivers. The trigger is mil-spec, but has had the surfaces mirror polished and JP springs installed to lower the trigger pull. The polishing eliminated a lot of the creep, but will also smooth up more over time. A bonus of using the Aero receiver is the small set screw in the back that eliminates the slop between the upper and lower receivers. This provides an easy way to facilitate accuracy that some more expensive receivers lack. The rifle also has a 6 position buffer tube and an ambidextrous sling mount to accommodate all shooters. The stock is a MFT Battle link Minimalist stock. The upper receiver is also an Aero Precision, and is sporting an MLOK style free float 15” handguard. The barrel is an 18” fluted with a 1:8 twist chambered in .223 Wylde (shoots .223 and 5.56). The back up iron sights are Magpul MBUS. The flash hider is a Strike Industries Checkmate. The forward assist, dust cover, charging handle, extended charging latch, and gas block are also from Strike Industries. The lightweight nickel boron BCG is fromAIM. All components of this build are brand new. 5 rounds fired for a function test. I will include a box of ammo with this sale as well, but I dont currently have any magazines. Those can be purchase most anywhere though. Cash preferred. Trades plus cash welcomed. Trades I would NOT be interested in include, but are not limited to: black powder, bows of any kind, hunting rifles, shotguns, novelty calibers, low end guns (hi point, Jimenez, etc.), popular hunting calibers, any Ruger (except Mini-14 in stainless), any Savage, any Remington, any Winchester, any Taurus, any Glock, any Sig, any XD, any Walther, 4 wheelers, jet skis, vehicles; just ask.

The new Walther SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. How Walther SOFTCOIL™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have  The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Call or text Four Points Armory @ REDACTED.

This is a feeler, no hurry to sell.This firearm is manufactured by Special Weapons, it is a SW5. It is a clone of an HK MP5. This one is one of Special Weapons cast stainless receivers. During my research I have found that most cast receiver SW5's had extra metal in the rails for the stock so it couldn't use collapsing stocks. I have taken this to a very good machinist and had him cut to receiver to HK specs. The rifle now takes collapsing stocks. I also couldn't fit my 3-lug on the end of the barrel so the machinist turned down the end of the barrel to accept Silencerco 3-lug mounts. It is SEMI AUTO ONLY, but required a tax stamp for SBR. It also has a very rough finish on it, the machining is fresh and I havent refinished the gun since. It also needs a little minor tinkering which I can tell you about later.This package deal comes with; 8 total 30-round mags (2 asian straight mags, 2 HK straight mags, 1 HK curved mag, and 3 brand new POF curved mags)MFI Scope railFixed A2 and US made collapsing A3 stocksStandard A2 handguard, Surefire forarm, and a US made MP5K grip and adapterFreshly installed firing pin spring and extractor springIts very hard to price it because there arent many out there.

Looks perfect. Laser is the higher end crimson trace LG-431 which is grip activated, unlike the less expensive defender series that you have to turn on manually. Comes with orig box etc., as well as hogue grip and pocket holster. No prob selling pistol and laser separately. Have some other goodies for the right deal.Guardian: .32 ACP. Comes with custom black leather Talon pocket holster, 3 mags (one 6 rd with pinkie ext, one 6 rd flush-fit, and one 10 round extended grip. The flush and extended are new in packaging.)  Orig owner put few rounds thru it and I only put a couple of mags thru to function test it. Almost perfect except for a small ding at the front of the barrel--not near the crown, so doesn't affect function or accuracy. To be sure, I took it to my regular gunsmith who gave it a once over and said that because the ding was not too deep and was on matte stainless, it would only cost about 30 bucks to fix it properly with a little filing and bead blasting. I never bothered because I'd been planning on sending it to NAA for custom finish work, which the folks there would eliminate anything on the surface anyway.so that's what I got.
