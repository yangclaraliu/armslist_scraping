IC-A5 SBR Uppers with LWRCI Monoforge design includes an integrated rail-base that is stronger and lighter.  The user configurable rail system with individual rail sections allows the shooter to place accessory rails where they are needed while maintaining its low profile ergonomic fit and function.   IC-A5 SBR Upper Design allows for easy access to the LWRCI two-position gas block with normal and suppressed settings enabling the user to pre-restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure from running a suppressor. . The LWRCI Gas-piston system can be accessed quickly by loosening two thumb screws and removing the top rail section. The IC A5 SBR Upper includes a full length Picatinny rail to accommodate accessories – both day and night optics. Our IC A5 SBR Upper uses LWRCI manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged spiral fluted barrel that are 20% lighter than unfluted barrels of the same diameter.  The increased surface area reduces heat – speeds up cooling.

Colt first named it Detective Special Two but Colt never used that designation, so the correct model name is the DS-II. The DS-II is built on the same ""SF-VI"" frame as the SF-VI model, and is in fact nothing more than the SF-VI with a new barrel stamp and a slightly thicker top strap to increase strength. This one comes in satin stainless with black Pachmayr grips with the molded Colt banner and logo. It is in mint condition and from the turnline, was either fired very lightly or action used without firing. Only distraction is one idiot mark on the right side of the back strap that can been seen from the photos which looks worse in the photo than it really does as it is zoomed in to show the mark. If it wasn’t for this small mark, this Colt DS-II would be much higher in price so this is why this Colt is steal at this price. This beautiful and rare Colt comes in the original box with documents. Please let us know if you would like to see any other pics of any part of this Colt. If you have been looking at a DS-II or just seeing this one for the first time, this is your Colt. Own one of these hard to find and rare DS-II and top off your collection Shipping is $25 to your FFL. Please visit our FB page at:DCF FB Page"

These are immensly more accurate than the stock sights. I also have a lone wolf barrel for this pistol to allow you to shoot lead reloads through the glock without the leading problems that stock glock barrels are known for. Will come with a blackhawk serpa holster and 5 magazines (2 original glock and 3 pro-mag, all function flawlessly) I've used this pistol for competition and it has served me well, but I'm wanting to try something a little different, with this setup and a magazine pouch you'd be ready to compete tomorrow. To build this set up would cost you much more than selling price, but I want to try something new.

I am not sure if it is a Finnish,Finnish capture, or just a standard M91 as i am no expert. It is in great shape. Numbers match bolt and receiver. It is stamped SA in a rectangular square on the very lower left side of the receiver just above the stock. There never was any numbers stamped on the floorplate but i see a couple small letters and some king of marking near the edge. Nice bluing. Nice pine tar finish stock-which i believe is what they called this finish.The stock was previously repaired in one ""quarter size"" spot on the left side near the rear of the stock and also a small area near the left/center of the rear of the receiver. It is solid though. The gun overall looks great and clean. Barrel has been counterbored at the end of the barrel. All original rifle including cleaning rod. Cleaned and ready to shoot. No issues with this rifle. I have a Mosin repro green canvas sling to go with this not pictured. Priced fairly at $325.00 (Lowball offers will be ignored) Cash preferred but may accept trade value of at least $375.00 of Factory bulk ammo or a quality handgun only-Nothing else i am interested in and no 22 ammo or junk trades. If your trade value is higher and i want to do the trade i can come up with cash on my end to make things fair. I do have my CPL License.  Please serious inquirers only and i am unable to meet you halfway at this point so this is pickup only in Commerce Township which is next to Walled Lake. -No emails.

As of 2007, Ruger has discontinued production. It is a semi-automatic carbine using a blowback action. The Carbine uses the same ammunition and magazines as the Ruger P Series 9mm and .40 S&W caliber pistols.Both the PC9 (the 9mm version) and the PC4 (.40 S&W) are patterned after the highly successful Ruger 10/22 carbine. The Carbine is intended as a shoulder weapon for police use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well. The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available (for example, in his/her patrol vehicle) as a shoulder weapon if needed. Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol. The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol."

Crimson Trace presents the MVF-515 Green; a revolutionary, patent-pending concept that combines three tactical tools for your AR style rifle into a single modular package. With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a green laser sight and a 150/200-Lumen LED light module. The MVF-515 Green leverages advanced technology to ensure long battery life and rugged durability through a wider range of conditions than consumer grade green lasers. Hot or cold, light or dark, the MVF-515 Green readily provides the most complete sighting and target identification system available anywhere. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light. Being a modular unit, users may separately purchase a red laser module for direct replacement."

This is not be confused with the wasrs and other inferior Romanian guns. This gun is not made by century, only imported by them. Made by Romarms 100% in Romania including barrel and receiver. Look at the dimples. Before you try to lowball me on the price, look at how much the accessories alone would cost. This Ak was made in the Clinton ban period and did not originally have a threaded barrel. It was threaded professionally by adco. It is wearing a $250 set of ironwood grey laminate stocks which are gorgeous. It has a now discontinued ultimak rear peep sight which is fully adjustable. It has a Krebs safety and also the original safety included. And lastly it has a FULLY ADJUSTABLE TRIGGER which is pretty hard to find for an ak. Included will be 5 magazines. One steel 30 round Romanian, a steel 40 round mag, a 30 round magpul mag and two 30 round tapco mags. A nice soft case will come with it as well. If you only value the gun at $750, there is still almost $1400 worth of gear here. My price is very reasonable. No I will not sell you just the stocks or trigger. Lowball offers will be ignored. $1050 cash. This is obviously not a weatherby gun. They don't have a catergory on here for Romarms. More pics available"
