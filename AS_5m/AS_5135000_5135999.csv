Comes with tons of extras. Two holsters, one Winthorp OWB pancake holster in black and one Chiappa IWB holster in soft suede. I have both factory grips as well. The stock rubber black grip and the Walnut wood grip. I like the feel and look of the wood grip better. Also includes the 5 Star Firearms speed loader designed just for the Rhino, some use J frame loaders but they don't fit quite right, the 5 Star works perfect, and also includes a speed loader pouch. Lastly a new box of Hornady Critical Defense .38All in all you are getting over 200.00 of goodies that you would probably buy anyway and since new White Rhinos are selling for 900.00 alone, I feel my price is quite fair. Gun has always been babied and cleaned meticulously. If you ever shoot a Rhino you will be ruined for other revolvers. I will always have a Rhino in my stable, they are just too much fun to shoot and extremely accurate! You can reach me at the email link or call or text 423 737-36OtwoSorry, no trades.

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. Our stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle.Matech BUIS, U.S. Army Standard-Issue Backup Sight For M4/M16A4Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights.All New PartsNo hassle, No paperwork, No felons"

It has a capacity of 8+1 & the flip up barrel that allows you to load a round into the chamber manually without having to pull the slide back like normal, you simply press a lever to release the barrel and then manually load a round into the chamber by hand. I read that the ""flip-up barrel"" is designed for everyone to use easily but unlike most guns, anyone with reduced hand strength from an injury or those with arthritis can easily operate this gun without having to deal with the usual stiff slide operation that comes from the internal recoil spring assembly & lots of guns have dual recoil springs now which makes it even harder. As a side note- i have operated the slide on this PT-22 Several Times but prefer prefer using the flip up barrel due to the ease of use. Now, as we know, All guns are test fired from the factory and this one was no different but I did take it a step further & thoroughly cleaned the gun upon receiving it & fired two full clips of ammo through it to be certain everything worked perfect & everything works great so after doing so the gun was thoroughly cleaned again and properly lubricated before being properly stored  It's definitely one of the lightest and easiest guns to carry concealed, plus it's even safer to carry with a really smooth double action trigger & manual thumb safety located at the left rear corner of the gun- it has a drop safety, disconnect safety, and the trigger will not pull with the manual safety activated so this is a great little gun that's safe, reliable, and shoots incredibly accurate. *********Comes With the Gun in its original Hard Plastic Storage Case with Foam Lining, an extra 8 Round Magazine sealed in the Factory Taurus Packaging, a great Uncle Mike's Holster great for pocket carry and/or belt carry, plus it'll come with some .22 LR 40 Grain  Ammo that Taurus recommends for this pistol.  I paid about $375 for Everything Included and will sell for $300 Cash or Trade for a Complete AR Pistol Lower Reciever****************FOR SALE OR TRADE FOR COMPLETE AR PISTOL LOWER RECIEVER and as much .223/5.56 Ammo & as many AR Magazines/Clips as I can get!

It contained the set of field binoculars, a case for them, and a small carboard box with what looks like some sort of nazi badge. I don't know what the other thing is. All was ( still is) wrapped in 1930s newspaper, inside a small carboard box that i think was for pistol ammunition ( also WWII german).I am keeping the case. This listing is for the WWII binoculars, the wooden crate, and the small carboard munitions box with contents. I am NOT a badge or medal expert ( nor have desire to become one). I am enclosing them as part of this listing. The badge is really cool, and has a small tank on it, with a swastika. The material seems to be some sort of old tin or pot metal. The clip in back is broken.   $250. Shipping anywhere on the US for $20. I accept PAYPAL. Feel free to EM or call with questions. REDACTED"

The pistol features black grips marked ""Baikal"" and ""Made in Russia"". Included are a factory holster, lanyard, combination tool, cleaning rod, factory paperwork, original box, three magazines and 200 rounds of ammo.Because a MAK 90 requires a USA made buttstock, pistol grip, handguards, trigger, hammer and disconnector to correctly and legally convert to 922r compliance, this is not cheap. That's why a used MAK 90 appeals to me. I enjoy the conversion process, but I can't pay $600 or more for the host receiver/barrel plus the nearly $300 for the correct parts.When you add the cost of a new Makarov plus about 75-80 dollars for a third magazine and 200 rounds of ammo, trading your old MAK for a new Makarov is a pretty good deal.The only requirement (besides a MAK 90 in good shape) is that the receiver be ""square cut"". I can't use an angle cut receiver for my project. If you're unsure what is meant by square cut, there are several YouTube videos that explain this. At the time of trade, the buttstock on your MAK will have to be off for me to confirm that it is a square cut receiver.Many thanks."

It has around 75 games a lot of controllers 2 Atari 2600 adapters. I don't know if they work or not but I have super action controllers. 2 roller controllers. And a steering wheel. There is around 175 Atari games. Joystick controllers. Paddle controllers. And keypad controllers. There is also a big box of controllers some work and some are in pieces. If I get full price or a trade that I am happy with I'll throw in a Atari 5200 that has a bad but repairable power cord and around 10 games. If you are interested please contact Kevin at REDACTED. I do not want to be bothered by scammers, bots, low ball offers, and I don't want for you to ask about a payment plain. I will consider a trade for a nice hand gun, shotgun, or rifle. Please make the trade worth around my asking price. Also no hi points. Thanks"

Bought it a while back and finally got a chance to shoot it and it's not my thing. It comes with one ten round factory mag which works most of the time and a pro mag 15 round which goes nose up every round just about. There are videos on how to fix it but I don't care to put the time into it. This is the original version so it does not lock back after the last round and it has a ati tactical stock which makes it look like the betetta cx4 Storm. I added a rail under the stock for a foregrip it also has a flash hider and a red laser with a pressure switch. These come with a great lifetime warranty
