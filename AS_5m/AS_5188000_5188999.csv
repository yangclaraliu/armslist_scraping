Toledo Tactical,"Toledo, Toledo, Ohio",FREE,"Listed On: Thursday, February 18, 2016",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"just want to share my one and only experience with a local company called Toledo Tactical.  I met the owners at one of the gunshows.  I got talking with them, and as they seemed respectable enough, I bought one of there stamped lower receivers.  It seemed like a fair enough deal and the product looked fine.  I got around to begin assembly about a month later.  Soon, I found that the mag well was so out of spec that the bolt catch readily slipped free of the magazine follower.  Then, when I assembled the pivot and takedown pins, I found that the receiver holes were about 12/1000ths too big.  I tried numerous uppers and they were all so free that you can clearly see through the slot of the receivers.  So, a bad part is a bad part.  It happens.  But when I called and talked to one of the guys, twice, he said he would have the other guy call me to discuss the issue.  I left two messages on top of this and to this day, I have not heard from anyone.  That's all.  It sounds like they may be a struggling company trying to get into there new building in downtown Maumee.  Maybe stuff like this is why they can't afford to do so.  I personally would have liked a small arms dealer in Maumee.  But I will now never buy from them if they ever do get established."

(i.e. just like Marlin made guns marked Westernfield for Sears and Mossberg makes the Maverick linand, etc. . .)Arms made under the U.S. Revolver Co. name were cheaper versions of the Iver Johnson line. U.S. Revolver Co. paralleled the solid frame Iver Johnson Model 1900 and has the safety hammer feature. They also had some consequent minor changes in the lockwork and a lesser quality of finish. U.S. Revolvers were offered in .22, .32 and .38 calibres, and were sold at the same time as the main Iver Johnson line until the 1940s. The pistols were marked 'U.S. Revolver Co.' on the barrel, and had 'US' molded into the grips."

Handcrafted with exacting detail, it is a spectacular firearm used by both Union and Confederate forces during the war.On the right side are the inscribed words from Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, delivered November 19, 1863 at the site of the battle – “We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.”The left side of the barrel bears the 24-karat gold inscription, “Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, July 1863.”On the cylinder, this highly detailed panoramic etching captures the drama of Pickett’s Charge. Note the detail in uniform and armament, and the Gettysburg farmhouse in the distance. With each rotation of the cylinder, another piece of the drama unfolds. A mounted officer falls to a rifleman’s shot. A Confederate infantryman swings his empty rifle at a sword-wielding Union soldier. On horseback, on foot, and down on the ground, the battle is waged with pistols, bayonets, and knives. All the excitement and fury of this moment are immortalized in this 24-karat gold panorama.To display and protect the Gettysburg 1863 Revolver, we have created this handsome display case. The lid, inset with leather, features the striking silhouette of a general at Gettysburg, stamped in gold above the title, “Gettysburg 1863.” Inside the case are a replica of the Gettysburg Address on parchment paper and two solid brass buckles, as worn by each army’s officers to secure their holsters and swords. The rectangular buckle bears the Union’s eagle and shield image; the circular buckle bears the initials of the Confederate States. In addition, each case features a brass plaque on the inside of the lid, “Gettysburg 1863 Revolver, United States Society of Arms & Armour.”"
