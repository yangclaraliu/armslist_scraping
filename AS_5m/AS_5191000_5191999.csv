This rifle was new in the box when I bought it, but unfortunately, I threw it out thinking it was unimportant. I do still have the SN I cut off of the box however. Since buying it, I have fired less than 100 rounds through this rifle. The special thing about this rifle is that it was factory made to readily accept steel AK mags. Also, very few of these were imported into the country. This is a BETA ARMS import. I have not tried it with anything else. The magazine in the picture is NOT included. The firearm functions flawlessly as you would expect. It came basically unfinished so I have finished it using a mixture of plant resins, linseed oil and beeswax. This rifle has basically been a safe queen. There is a cleaning rod, cleaning kit and oil bottle also included with this rifle. A bayonet is also attached to the rifle. The bore is excellent and it is as clean as the day it left the factory. If you want any other pictures, I can e-mail or text them to you. These are a rarity for the most part, and I would like a collector or somebody who appreciates them more than I to have this rifle. Buyer is responsible for transfer and background check fee.
