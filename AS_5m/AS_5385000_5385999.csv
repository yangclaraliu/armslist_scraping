There are several benefits to getting your AR built rather than buying one at a gun store. The first benefit is cheaper price: i ask for a $50 compensation for my time, beyond that you only pay for parts. A good medium quality build can be done for somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 comparable to a 900-1000 dollar gun at the store. Also you can customize your rifle before it's built, saving you time and money, also ensuring that your components work together perfectly. If you wish to have you're AR built, contact me and we'll set up a time and place to meet and go over the details of what you want on your rifle and how much it will cost."

Barrel length is 7.5 inches.  This special Super Blackhawk was only produced in 2009 for the 50th anniversary.  Plain jane Blackhawks are bringing $500-700.  I think mine is fairly priced at $725.
