Hogue grips are installed, but the factory stocks are included.  This gun has factory #8 sights front and rear, so it shoots to point-of-aim vice the typical ""combat sight picture"" that most Sig's have.  Quite consistent and accurate. The roll pins are in emaculate condition.  Springs are relatively new.  All service was conducted prior to me purchasing the firearm almost three years ago.  The P220 has never malfunctioned on me.  I have shot it less than 300 times.  More pictures are available.  Please email with any questions."

Troy flip sights, four mags and maglink. Must have CCDW and sign bill of sale. If we trade, I'll sign one for you. This is a great gun. Sig quality and reliability. Around 450 rounds fired, very light wear. This rifle is well loved and well cared for. I won't take less than my asking price, it's over a $1,000 gun with $160 sights and extras. Things keep going the way they're going, you won't be able to buy a crappy AR for less than $1,000.I'm asking $900 cash or $1,000 trade. If you have a trade, please don't ask a new price for a used gun, there's an awful lot of that going on here lately and mine is priced as used.I can meet half-way in Campbellsville, Springfield or Bardstown. I can throw in some ammer for the right deal."

Will sell for $975.00 or preferably trade for new in box Benelli Montefeltro in 20 gauge with walnut stock in either a 24"" or 26"" barrel. My wife purchased this shotgun for me as a Christmas/birthday gift and mistakenly purchased a 12 gauge when what I wanted was a 20 gauge.  Obviously, returns are not possible on firearms so I am either selling or trading it for what I really wanted. This shotgun was purchased at Gander Mountain in Woodbury and the price at Gander including sales tax was $1,074.00 so I would prefer to trade rather than take the financial hit of $100.00 on the deal but am willing to do either a trade or a cash sale. The retail price at Cabelas is somewhat higher on this shotgun than at Gander so $975.00 is a decent savings.  Anyone shopping around for Benellis probably has noticed that the retail prices seem to be tightly controlled and do not vary more than a small amount between stores. If interested please send me an email with your contact information and I will make contact by whatever means you prefer - email, text, or by phone."
