This rifle has been my baby for years. It has been properly broken in, and is capable of insane accuracy. I've shot clover leafs at 20 yards off hand with this rifle. I have upgraded the scope mount, putting an expensive BKL one-piece mount on it. This mount is designed to stop your scopes zero to shift after each shot, a common problem in many break barrel air rifles. I have also put on a Weaver 4x32 mil-dot scope on, made specifically for Airguns, to stop that same shifting of accuracy mentioned earlier. On top of the accuracy of this rifle, is the power. This combination make it excellent for hunting. I've shot everything from raccoons and jackrabbits to doves with one shot out of this rifle. Despite being such an investment of time, money, and energy, I am selling as I have moved states, and no longer have access to good small game spots. I'll also throw in what's left of a tin .177 match ammo, which this rifle shoots best with. This rifle will not let you down. Contact me at REDACTED."

Shipping as is with a Vortex Viper 6.5-20X, 50mm objective lens with mil dot reticle and medium height Vortex matched 30mm steel rings. The optic also has a Vortex brand sunshade and a set of Butler Creek scope caps. Additionally shipping with Harris 6-9inch swivel bipod mounted on a GG&G Harris bipod adapter, a Butler creek padded two point sling, two steel 20rd DPMS mags, and two Gen2 20rd PMAGs. Barrel is well maintained with a grand total of 450 rounds through it. Didn't swap out the POF drop in trigger system but with a smooth 4.5 lbs., there wasn't reason to. She's a tack driver out to 900m with a steady hand and hand loaded rounds. Built the buffer system myself from scratch to get the perfect amount of pressure going back into the BCG. The one thing is she's picky about ammo so I greatly encourage hand loads to maximize performance. Personally I don't suggest running anything larger than 168g unless you run a suppressor instead of the factory triple ported muzzle break. You also might want to consider running it suppressed or investing in some good ear protection; she's about as loud as a standard length .338 bolt gun. Very balanced with surprisingly good recoil mitigation for a 20"" Piston .308."
