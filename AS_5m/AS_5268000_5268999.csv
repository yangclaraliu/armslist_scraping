At the time of purchase, new SKS rifles had to be sold without bayonets, so one is not included with this model.  This model features a milled trigger guard/housing and a threaded barrel and all serial numbers match (receiver, receiver cover, magazine, trigger guard, bolt, and bolt carrier).
The appearance of this gun is typical of a Norinco SKSs from the era, which means somewhat hasty bluing and stock finish.  So even though this gun has been used very little, cosmetically it's somewhat rough.  Included with the gun are the original box, instruction manual, tool/cleaning kit, cleaning rod, oil bottle, and sling.

$1,940 firm for everything or higher in trade value.  I can also take some more off if you don't want the MI sights or all the mags, just let me know.I might consider trades only if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal.  Are you wanting the rifle, all the mags and the sights or?? and are you wanting a straight trade, trade +/- cash or other?? please be specific.  Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns and bolt-guns.A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Ammo in common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have PLENTY already.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics to help, but I have nice optics sitting now for future projects.Ftf in the Dallas area or will ship insured for $40 more and must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

$780 FIRM in cash or higher in trade value.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a red laser sight and a 150/200 Lumen-LED light module. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light. Being a modular unit, users may separately purchase a green laser module for direct replacement.

$1,050 firm in cash or may look at trades.I might consider trades, but only if it's a good deal as I don't need anything right now.  If it's not a good deal as far as the value goes, then there is no reason to offer it, sorry, just trying to save everyone some time.  If offering a trade, please be specific on exactly what you have and exactly what you are wanting to do so I know the deal. Trades considered would be in this order, semi-auto rifles and pistols, revolvers, then tactical shotguns and bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Ammo in common rifle and pistol calibers to help with a deal, but I have PLENTY of ammo.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Maybe optics to help, but I have nice scopes, Aimpoints and Eotechs just sitting right now for future projects.Ftf in the Dallas area and must be legal to own a firearm in TX or I can ship for $30 more.Thanks for looking!"

$680 firm for the package or $500 without the CTC grips, I can put them on my 5"" model.  Will straight trade the package for an XDM 5.25"" .45ACP Bi-tone with night sights or maybe the black model 5.25"" with night sights and you add some cash or ammo etc.
I will consider trades only if it's a good deal, otherwise, I will not be interested as I do not need anything right now.  If offering a trade, please be specific on what you have and what you are offering on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash or other, so I know what you are wanting to do.
Trades considered: 
I will consider most firearms, but mostly interested in semi-autos.  Will consider, but less intrested in revolvers, shotguns and then bolt-guns.
A few specific trades wanted, a nice SS(not matte SS) 1911 .45ACP for my brother, let me know make/model etc.  A few rails that will fit DPMS and CMMG(I think it's the same pattern) AR-10 rifles.  One needs to fit a DPMS Oracle, around 7"" or so because the front sight block will remain, it can be as simple as just replacing the stock glacier guards or it can be a free float model.  On the other two rails, they need to be free float and lightweight modular rails, one needs to be 9""-13"" for a 16"" DPMS and the other needs to be around 12""-15"" for an 18"" CMMG.  I know the sites to get all these at a good price, but will consider them as part of a trade, if it's a good deal.  Also, if modular, let me know how many rail sections are included and of course, make model etc.
Will consider several stripped AR-15 and AR-10 lowers for future projects, depending on brand and the value you put on each.  I will also consider complete lowers as well, but I can build quality lowers much cheaper than buying them complete, so the value to me on a complete lower will likely be lower than your value, just a heads-up.  Would also like more Pmags for both.
Ammo in the common calibers to help with a deal, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Mag, .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54.  I have PLENTY of ammo, so any all ammo deal will need to be a good one.
1oz. Silver Eagles, rounds and bars.  Gold in grams.  Please check current prices before making offer.
Again, I am more than covered on everything, but I don't mind trading for more of the same as long as it's a good deal, otherwise I'll wait for cash.
Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  FTF in the Dallas area.  Thanks for looking!"

I am the second owner of this conversion kit and have absolutely loved it. It comes with 2 (10 Rd) aluminum magizines, a whole upper conversion that can be switched out with the stock glock 19 slide in seconds, a hard-plactic factory box, and all appropriate papers. Save money while still shooting your favorite 9mm or 40 cal gun. I have used it to practice with my Glock 19; however, I just sold the Glock 19 and have no use for it anymore. It has been meticulously cleaned after every range day and was stored in a climate controlled safe. I am asking very little for it, but only because I want others to enjoy it and I need the money for another project/bills. I have some extra high velocity remington thunderbolt .22lr rounds as well (roughly 200-300) that I will add in for NO EXTRA CHARGE. The exchange kit has been a blast to shoot at the range and has approximately 300-500 rounds down the tube. From doing research this is roughly the recommended break in period for these conversion kits. Some forums I have read even said that you could use your regular .22lr standard velocity rounds after this break in period. I would love to see somebody enjoy it for little-to-no cost. Price is firm. Must be 21 years of age and legal to own in the State of Kansas"

German A3 collapsible stock for $125 (if purchased and you are going to use the A3 stock to make an SBR, you must be keep in seperate location until stamp has been obtained, stock will ship from Arkansas to buyer as I do not have it in my possession).In 2001 I had the opportunity to train with an MP5. I loved this platform and wanted to get one for myself. Well, not being able to buy (or afford to buy) a real MP5 I decided to build one for myself. I did extensive research and purchased an A2 parts kit with a pistol end cap from Adam at HKParts.net. Adam referred me to Jeff at Parabellum Combat Systems (Jeff is fantastic, check the HKpro.com board for comments regarding his work) for advice on building my MP5. After several conversations with Jeff, I was quick to determine that building this platform in my garage was a little out of my league. I called Jeff and he mentioned that if I was ever in Oklahoma I could stop by the shop and he would help me with the build. A couple months later I was able to setup up a trip to Oklahoma to meet with Jeff. Once in the shop Jeff had me place the US made flat into the bending jig and bend it using his shops press. Once I had bent the flat to shape, Jeff finished the process (welding, placement and alignment of parts, etc) over the next few weeks and transferred the platform to me. I was able to purchase 6 curved, 30 round mags (3 have HK restricted markings on them) and run about 1000 rounds of 9 mm through it over the next several months. The platform ran beautifully and was a blast to shoot. It’s been stored in a humidity control safe for the last 12 years or so, as I have not had a lot of time to shoot it. You can by a demilled MP5 parts kit for around $1790, 6 magazines at $45 to $75 each, flat and parts kit for around $200 and have a reputable builder put it together for you for an additional $1400 (the builder is key if you want a great platform). So, for around $3600 you can have an MP5 clone from a German parts kit or you can consider this already built platform for $2200. So what do you get for the $$$? A completely built MP5 clone pistol that has the following: •HK 3-Lug MP5 Barrel - cold hammer forged •Cocking Tube •Front Sight Tower •Wide Fore arm - Black •Bolt Group - MP5 Full Auto •2 small and 1 large Push Pin •3 - 30 Round Curved Magazines - Genuine HK •3 - 30 Round Curved Magazines – HK•Rear Sight Assembly •Pistol End Cap •MP5 Sling •Manual •Trigger Group (modified to semi-auto only) It would not take much effort or dollars to make this into a really cool MP5 rifle. Weld on a fake suppressor (US Made MP5 3-lug barrel extension, Fake suppressor from HKparts.net) and add an A3 collapsing stock and you have a really cool looking platform. I am not in a “have to sell” situation and am not interested in any trades or offers at this time. You must legally be able to purchase a gun/rifle/pistol in order to buy this MP5 clone. FTF in Middletown, KY is perferable (must be willing to provide proof of KY residency). I will ship to an FFL at your expense. FFL must be willing to accept item from non-FFL."

Will sell for 750 or best offer or trade for quality firearms. Will include 1 meatal 30 round mag. REDACTED. Here is the info on the upper Once upon a time, a ""dissipator"" AR was created by taking a 20"" rifle-length gas system upper and cutting the barrel down to 16"". This allowed the shooter to keep the long sight radius of a rifle for accuracy, but keep the carbine length barrel for maneuverability. The proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, however, played havoc with timing and made reliability a hit or miss proposition. Advances in AR technology have produced reliable carbine and mid-length gas systems, that can be hidden using low-profile gas blocks. This allows for a front sight base to be pinned in the rifle position for the longer sight radius without the worry of the unorthodox gas port location affecting operation.
