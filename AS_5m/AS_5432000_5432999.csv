This armor is real and was issued to me during OIF6-7. It is legally mine and can be sold because it is a ""combat loss"". I was hit by a VBIED while wearing this armor and it saved my life. It has some small fragmentation holes peppered throughout the front face but it's not really noticeable and in no way decreases the functionality of the armor. I wore this system for 17 months overseas so there is sweat stains on it, they can be washed out if desired. It comes with the Outer Tactical Vest (OTV),The OTV features a carrier shell, and three main ballistic panel inserts (left and right side panels, and a rear back panel), which are made with a finely woven kevlar  KM2 fiber. It also comes with Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBIs). It also includes the Throat yoke and groin protector that both have kevlar inserts in them. I don't have the Front SAPI or back SAPI plates due the explosion but I can vouch this armor system will do what it was designed to do with minimal trauma. I don't what this exactly goes for but if interested send me a message with an offer and we'll take it from there. God bless and I hope you never find yourself in a situation where you would need this system but if you do, it will work."

Trijicon ACOG rifle scope
 
Enhance precision and pinpoint accuracy when using the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Scope w/ Red Chevron BAC Flattop Reticle & Flat Top Adapter. This rifle scope by Trijicon is designed to be zeroed in using the tip at 100 meters and the width of the chevron at the base is 5.53 MOA which is 19"" at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets. Trijicon TA31F ACOG 4x32 Scope w/ Chevron BAC Flattop Reticle features Dual Illumination (Fiber Optic provides daylight illumination and tritium illuminates reticle at night). The ranging reticle is calibrated for 5.56mm (.223 cal) flat-top rifles out to 800 meters. Trijicon TA-31F 4x32mm ACOG Advanced Tactical Optical Gunsights hit fast in any light. Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Riflescopes are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bind on Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Rifle Scope w/ Flat Top Adapter is designed for use with the M16 family and every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without failure-prone batteries."

I put about 100 rounds through the weapon and it's been sitting in my safe ever since. Figured it's time to sell the safe queen. The AK came with a six position collapsable TAPCO stock and wood furniture up front. I took off the wood and put on an aluminum quad rail. I have an NC STAR holographic sight with 4 reticule choices. The glass can be switched to either a green or red sight. I also have a NC Star green laser attached to the rail with a pressure pad activation. The pad is attached to a composite vertical foregrip with adhesive. The foregrip can be folded to a 45 degree slant style also. The trigger was also upgraded to a TAPCO trigger. I have 2 steel mags and 7 boxes of ammo (20 rounds in each). Most of the boxes are full....some came open and a few rounds dumped out. They are pictured. I also have a soft rifle case which is pictured. This AK has a removeable ""slant"" style muzzle brake. A simple push of the retention pin and it unscrews right off if you want to put on another. This was my original plan but never got around to it. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN ANY TRADES WHATSOEVER! PLEASE DON'T ASK. CASH ONLY.  I am not hurting for money and am in no hurry to unload the weapon. Please do not send lowball offers. Any other questions feel free to get a hold of me."

This is my first time utilizing ArmsList; so let's see how it goes.I'm selling a pair of Spectre's - One in .45acp ( Extremely rare ) and another, in 9mm. Both guns are lightly used and well taken care of. I would rate these at an 8 out of 10, condition wise. I have the original box for the 9mm and a Pelican for the .45. The Pelican stays with me. Also, the black marks on the Spectre's are where I blacked out the serial numbers; that's all.I had acquired these in a trade and have not fired either one of them in years. They have lived in a safe and they have absolutely no wear from neglect; the guns do have normal wear, though from normal function. The finish on the .45 is nearly 100% - About 85% for the 9mm. The .45acp has a 30-round stick magazine. The 9mm has a 30-round quad-staggered magazine. Very cool! Very hard to find! These Spectre's are very unique and have many mentionable attributes. If you aren't already familiar with these things, please research them! There are less than 2000 of  the 9mm variant and less than 100 of the .45acp. They don't get much more hard to find than that. I have lots of pictures and will gladly take more pictures if you would like; just ask! I will definitely consider interesting trades. I am a huge fan of Sig and H&K. I have a brand new OEM fore-grip for the .45.. I am really not interested in splitting them up, but let's see what's out there. Let's talk.. Let's make a deal!"

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."
