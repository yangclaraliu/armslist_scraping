This listing is for a large lot of Sig MPX parts left over from a rifle we sold. Included is the original Sig MPX fitted hard case that Sig no longer provides with new rifles. A Like-New thin folding stock for 1913 interface / Picatinny rail that works on the Sig MPX and MCX and should also work on Rock River Arms RRA LAR-PDS pistols due to having the same mount style. This was installed on our MPX for about a week, but never fired with it installed. This includes the original STOCK-X-FOLD-THIN-BLK bag, the thin folding stock, the original installation screw bit, and SIG decal. Original Sig Sauer Mil-Comm TW25b grease pack and 9mm Jag. Original Sig MPX non-ambidextrous charging handle. New KAK MPX Buffer tube adapter with used buffer tube. This allows you to use standard AR-15 stocks on your MPX pistol (once you've filed to have it registered as a SBR of course). KAK adapter is flat black anodized and is made of 6061 T6 Aluminum. The last thing is the original SIG MPX pistol grip with storage compartment in the grip. This looks similar to the Magpul MOE grip with beavertail. The hard cases have been selling for around $100, I paid $300 for the folding stock, $50 for the KAK adapter, plus the charging handle, buffer tube, and pistol grip.

The crosshairs will then move from this Tag to where your current point of impact is with an arrow guiding back on target if the Tag is out of screen. Once on target, the crosshairs will go from blue to red. Just exercise the proper trigger control, and the round will end up on target. The system can even track a moving target without losing its Tag. The only thing you have to input is wind speed with an easy Left-Right button on the scope. So, just point, tag, shoot, hit, and repeat.   The Remington 2020 retails for $5,575. Now, this would also include 300rds of ammo, which I do not have as I have sold it already.

(NRA) Handgun of the Year award in 2005. The OSS models feature a 5.25 inch match grade forged barrel and a 3 position safety system - the bottom position enables the pistol to fire, the middle setting puts it in 'safe' condition, and the upper decocks the striker. This arrangement results in several carry options for the user as the gun can be carried with a round in the chamber ‘cocked and locked’ in ‘condition one’ (striker cocked with safety on), or the arguably safer ‘Condition Two’ (striker decocked and safety off, requiring a revolver-like DA pull to both cock and fire the pistol), or even with the striker decocked and the safety on. The OSS retains the loaded chamger indicator of the other 24/7 models, and additionally allows visual verification that the pistol is ready to fire as the striker can be seen when the pistol is cocked. Asking $360.00 cash no trades."

The taper pins and swivel sling rivit looked a little rough when I got the barrel assembly so I replaced those with taper pins and a sling rivit from BMC. The A2 sight post is factory drilled, I reamed the holes so the BMC pins seated properly.The New parts:The upper receiver is Aero (Cardinal marked) with LWRC small parts. LWRC standard charging handleTroy fixed battle sight with LWRC logo (ordered from LW, I guess that’s how they like them)The gas tube is LBE stainlessBMC taper pins and swivel sling rivit The barrel nut is torqued to approximately 55lbs NO lock tight was applied to the threads. Areoshell was applied between the outside of the extension and the inside of the receiver. The guy I got the barrel from said it had about 1000 rounds of .223 55 grain through it. The lands and groves are sharp and the breech looks clean. Now you know what I know and you can make the most informed decision possible, I can send more photos to serious folks as Armslist only allows three photos.Thanks for your consideration."

This Colt was shipped to Simmons Hardware July 23, 1900, in the configuration you see (5.5"" barrel, .41 Colt, hard rubber grips). A note from a previous owner dated October, 2011, says he purchased it from Texas through a magazine ad in the summer of 1955. He sent it in to Colt for ""re-barreling and conditioning"". From the appearance of the gun today, the cylinder, back strap and trigger guard were re-blued and the barrel, ejector housing and cylinder pin were replaced. It also locks up tight. Since that was before the 2nd generation guns reached production, that would account for the almost new, 1st generation, .41 Colt barrel and newer finish on the ejector housing. He states further that ""...It is very accurate as I occasionally shot squirrels and ground hogs with it. The last one being a squirrel high in a hickory tree using hand loads with bullets I cast about 1975..."".  The gun has been test fired with no problems. The Colt is housed in a basket weave carved, rawhide laced, holster and 26 loop cartridge belt stamped ""Eubanks Leather, Boise,  There is a place at the toe of the holster where the leather has torn through next to the lacing.

I also hate when fuckers email about a gun, and dont do shit but bitch about the price.  Think they know everything. But if you sold a gun to this guy or maybe switched up the price after agreeing , then you are a douchbag and need called out. Helpful hints:1. Do respond to any ad if you have no intention of buying . If you dont like the price or whatever, move on and shop elsewhere. 2.  If you agreed to a price on a gun and maybe switched the price up in the end, then you fuck off and die.  Sell your shit elsewhere..."

The barrel is also pristine. A borescope shows it is in perfect condition.The inside of the gun is perfect, in fact, the gun has ca very loe round count.
