Then you simply slap on a 9mm upper and you're good to go. Can convert from .223 to 9mm in a matter of 10 seconds. This is a very rare magazine block.The magazines are all premium quality metal mags. 2 are brand new never loaded MetalForm 32rd mags, who makes them for Colt, they are $40 each new.

A full sized battle rifle can be a tight squeeze in your truck or in the heavy brush. The Springfield Armory® M1A-A1™ Scout Squad™ combines the legendary power and reliability of the M1A™ with the quick handling and fast sight acquisition of a scout style rifle.  From the two-stage military trigger to the aperture style rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation), you’ll find that the Scout Squad™ is packed with all the standard features that make the M1A™ great. The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil.  Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle."

It's in good shape, the only thing ""wrong"" with it is some cosmetic wear and a mark on the right side of the slide, which I tried to show in the second picture. Right now I'm primarily looking to trade for something a bit more compact. Will consider 9mm pistols that are a more compact size, my top choice would be a Walther PPS. I would also be potentially interested in a Springfield XD9 Service, Ruger SP101, or basic 1911. That being said, I'll at least consider reasonable pistol offers.

This was an experimental 45-70 caliber rifle designed by James Paris Lee (of Lee Enfield and Lee Navy fame) as an idea to increase rate of fire. In total only 143 of these rifles were made at Springfield Armory. Very few are known outside of museums and this example rivals any that you will encounter. The pictures say it all. It functions flawlessly and the cartouche is as good as the day it was stamped. I fired three rounds through it once just to say that I did and it’s extremely accurate.

I wouldn't sell this but I'm taking the season off from long range shooting so I won't be using something like this for at least a year. I'm bummed I won't get to shoot it but someone else will be able to get more use out of it. Never fired other than whatever they do at the factory. The NEAR base was bought new and mounted. The IOR scope (newest version: FFP 3.5-18x MP-8 A-5 reticle, digital illumination, side focus, 20-22mils of reticle travel) was also purchased new and mounted with the rings and it's ready to be zero'd and used. I bought the scope because of the reviews & I wasn't disappointed. The reticle on this optic is amazing and I've read that they replace defective optics with brand new optics no questions asked. The glass is amazing on this thing and the reticle is one of the best designs available at any price. This whole setup was selected so that every part complimented the intended use.TRG-22 Desert Tan w/20"" BarrelIOR 35mm FFP 3.5-18x OpticButler Creek Caps 17 EYE/43 OBJNEAR MFG Base -Vortex 35mm Bubble LevelSako TRG Under Forend Accessory RailTacStrap Convertible Sling Tan w/US flag & HK HooksGunsmith Labor to install base, rings & opticSuper Sweet Custom Paracord 550 thingy on pic rail loopMake sure this is legal in your state.

Production of the .455 Mark II Hand Ejector Second Model began in 1915 and continued until 1917 with serial numbers following on from the First model starting at serial number 5001 and continuing on up to serial number 74755. Although for various reasons, as stated previously, there are some Mark I's numbered in the early part of this serial number range including those made by the using up of old parts. In total there were 69,754 Mark II .455's produced.
The Canadian Government purchased 14,500 directly from Smith & Wesson and in addition 1,105 were made for the commercial market after completion of the British contract. The rest went to the British Government.
When these guns were sold off as War surplus some were converted to more popular calibres due to the unavailability of the .455 ammunition, especially those that went to the United States. The two usual conversions were to .45 long Colt by lengthening the chambers and then either the cylinder was shortened or some metal was removed from the recoil shield to allow for the extra thickness of the rim on the cartridge case. The other conversion was to .45 ACP by shortening the cylinder and using .45 ACP in half moon clips or .45 auto rim ammunition. --------------------------  Just a beautiful, and perfect shooting gun.
