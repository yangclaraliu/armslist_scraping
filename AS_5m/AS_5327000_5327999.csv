I am the second owner since importation circa ~2000, and it has been stored in a safe the whole time. This rifle has not been fired since the the war, and I was the one who removed the cosmoline. There is still plenty of trace cosmo under the barrel band, stock etc. but for storage in my safe I didn't need the grease getting on everything. There is no pitting, the bore is mirror bright, and has sharp lands/grooves. This barrel is so nice I would caution whoever buys this rifle to never use corrosive ammo, it's that good looking. This rifle is superior to any Russian Capture I have ever owned as the Yugos took great pride in rebuilding the captured German equipment, as evidenced by the uniform bluing and the laminated stock not getting a shellac added like RC Mausers, and a lack of electro penciled serials. For the history buff this rifle is festooned with Waffenampts/WaffenEagles, and a few swastikas thrown in there for good measure as the Krauts loved to stamp everything. This rifle is a solid representation of an early/mid war production K98 as it has a cupped buttplate, milled floorplate, and midwar milled barrel band. You can rest assured this rifle saw some sort of action in the Balkan campaign and is a true war time rifle.I have come to the conclusion I will never shoot it, and I'm finally breaking down to sell it. I am going to take most of the proceeds and buy another m48 which I won't feel guilty banging around at the range. I encourage you to take a look at gunbroker and find a comparable specimen, you won't. I haven't seen a German mauser in this condition in about 15 years, and the ones that do appear are true collector USGI vet bring backs carrying a $1500+ price tag.I am selling this for $900. I am located near Ashland VA and travel to short pump, the richmond airport, and Ladysmith on a regular basis.For more pictures go to my photobucket albumphotobucket.com/user/seawolf688/library/K98"

709,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5327709,"For Sale:  300 AAC Blackout AR-15 Pistol, New  Price Reduced! Must sell.","Jupiter, Florida, United States",$ 695,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 5, 2016",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,"Edit to add: I will be glad to ship this firearm to your FFL dealer; can't seem to get the 'No shipping' box unchecked. See details in shippimg info below. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is a custom AR pistol built from high quality but reasonably priced components; see spec sheet below. No bling; just solid MILSPEC components. I have range tested it (20 rounds; both supersonic and subsonic factory ammo, Remington 125 and 220 grain) at a climate controlled indoor range for reliability and accuracy, with and without suppressor (Silencerco Harvester). It is good to go.The 4140 chrome moly Bergara 10.5 inch barrel is a good choice for both sub and supersonic use, but still short enough to handle as a pistol. It is threaded 5/8x24, correctly recessed at barrel face, for sound suppressor (silencer) and button rifled with 1 in 8 inch twist rate, Shorter barrels than 9 or 10 inches may have reliability or ammunition sensitivity issues. Heavier than SAAMI spec ammunition is of course not recommended (220 grain). The bore is not chrome lined, instead Bergara uses fine diamond honing to produce a smooth precise bore. An adjustable gas port allows custom settings for your environment and use of suppressor, or for function and reliability tuning as the firearm breaks in.This is not a super-lightweight pistol as the barrel is a heavy contour target type, and the forged aluminum quad rail is fairly heavy. However it is quite rugged and will hold up to field use as a hunting firearm. This pistol is a good choice for development into an SBR on a BATFE Form 1, in compliance with NFA rules, if you so choose and if allowed in your locale. However it is being sold as a pistol only.Trigger is the excellent Rock River Armory National Match Two Stage Trigger with approximately two pounds of pull at both stages. (First stage sets the trigger; second fires.) This is an excellent trigger for hunting accuracy and match shooting, however if you prefer a heavier single stage tactical trigger, I will substitute a premium (polished and tuned) military type trigger by PSA; also an excellent trigger. Choosing the single stage trigger will reduce cost of this pistol by $40.Note that this AR pistol has a tactical type charging handle with oversize release installed (see photos) for ease of use with gloved hands or by persons with very large hands. However it does make the pistol somewhat bulkier to the left side. If you prefer a conventional charging handle, I will substitute a new MILSPEC one, which will reduce your cost by $10. Thus you can cut the overall cost of this firearm by $50 if you elect to substitute both trigger and charging handle.I chose an Anderson Manufacturing lower receiver as the basis for this build because it is:(a) A quality forged MILSPEC receiver;(b) Reasonably priced;(c) Caliber marked as 300 AAC BLK. One does not want to confuse .556mm/ .223 and .300 AAC cartridges. Proper caliber marking helps prevent accidents.Note that most factory made 300 Whisper ammunition (e.g. Corbon) will also function in 300 AAC firearms. However this particular firearm has only been tested with marked 300 AAC BLK Remington ammunition.Anderson Manufacturing is an ISO 9001:2000 (originally MIL-Q-9858A) certified manufacturer with extensive background in automotive OEM and aerospace industries prior to becoming a full time firearms manufacturer in 2008. Although relatively new to the firearms world, Anderson has gained a reputation for building durable military pattern firearms long on value without unneeded bling. Anderson is proud to have a workforce comprised largely of US military veterans. This pistol is not treated with Andersons proprietary RF85 low friction coating; normal AR-15/ M4/ M16 maintenance and lubrication procedures should be followed.Aero Precision, manufacturer of the upper receiver, is another high quality manufacturer of AR pattern firearms and components. Finish of the Anderson and Aero components is virtually identical, with MILSPEC hard coat anodizing used by both manufacturers. For more on Aero Precision, see aeroprecisionusa.com/ap/manufacturing/.I assemble my firearms using a high quality light machine oil or grease as appropriate. Critical fasteners are lightly treated with medium grade (removable) Loctite. The castle nut on the buffer tube is not staked as these are one of the most frequently changed items on ARs.Prefer face to face sale in safe public place in my area (Jupiter, FL; northern Palm Beach County or Martin County, 33469 zip code area); you will need either a current Florida CCW card and DL or equivalent from another US state. I will give you a bill of sale. If you need me to ship, I can only ship to an FFL dealer; shipping costs to be paid by you. 30-rd Magazine cannot be shipped to states such as Colorado where high capacity magazines are prohibited; however I will reduce your cost by $10 if the magazine is not included. Let me know if you cannot receive it or do not need it and I will adjust your price accordingly. I do not have any 10-round magazines to substitute; sorry.I will advise you of actual shipping cost once I receive your shipping address. If you desire additional insurance coverage over the $100 automatically provided by FedEx and UPS, I will charge you the actual cost of this coverage, usually in the $30-$40 range. These are the only additional charges that will be added to the final auction price.I will contact you by email with instruction on where to send your payment and FFL dealer license. I can normally ship within one business day of receiving your payment and FFL information. If you have a FedEx or UPS account which you would like to charge the shipping to, this is also OK. You are responsible for return shipping costs if your FFL cannot accept this weapon; please check first!Shipping for handguns is by common carrier only (FedEx Priority Overnight or UPS Next Day Air only, CONUS and Alaska only; no HI or territorial shipping.Damage in shipping: If there is obvious damage to the package, your FFL dealer should inspect prior to signing for the package from the carrier, with any damages recorded in presence of carrier agent.Payment policy: I prefer payment by USPS Money Order; this protects both of us under federal law. Please mail this with a tracking number for your protection. Certified cashiers check or commercial money order is also acceptable, but I will wait on shipping until my bank completely clears the funds. Paypal is also OK but you will need to add 5% for the Paypal fee.Return policy: As this is a new firearm, I cannot take it back after it has been transferred by your FFL dealer. Please inspect at his/ her location prior to transfer and within 3 days of receipt; absolutely no returns once transfer is executed. If you are not satisfied, have him immediately return the firearm to me, in same packaging and condition as shipped. Please contact me first and I will email a return shipping label, unless you want to use your own FedEx or UPS account. I will refund your full payment minus shipping costs as soon as I receive the firearm.If you have any questions, please feel free to email me using the Armslist web form; I will try to answer within one business day. I am an honorably discharged US Army Airborne and SF veteran (12B3S and 18F40). All the way and then some! I am not a commercial FFL dealer or manufacturer. Selling this firearm will supplement my pension and help me with veterinary costs for my German Shepherd Dog.

This gun has literally 125 rounds through it, so is not yet broken in.  I've had it less than 2 months.  Probably not surprisingly, it shoots very well and accurately.  This model was spec'd by CZ and built by Dan Wesson, in a batch of just over a thousand.  Trigger pull was measured to be around 5 lbs. If you're looking for a high quality mil spec 1911, this is it! 
It'll come with the original grips (unless you want to add $50 for the bones), 2 spring plugs, and everything it originally came with as new.  I'm looking for $720 cash OR partial trade for a Dan Wesson Guardian (45 acp).  I'm in Chicago (South) but can meet in the near West burbs, near South burbs, mid-North and downtown.  More, detailed pics upon request or we can just meet and you see it for yourself."
