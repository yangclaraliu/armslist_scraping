Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a rimfire revolver.Specifications:- Caliber: .22 Combo- Barrel Length: 6.5""- Cylinder Capacity: 9 Rounds- Barrel Material: 1215 Steel- Cylinders Material: 12L14 Steel- Frame Material: Aluminum Alloy- Finish: Blue- Grip: Cocobolo- Land and Grooves: 6- Land Width: .076""- Length of Rifling Twist: 1 Turn In 14"" RH- Sights: Open fixed type Notch at Rear- Style: Adjustable Sights- Trigger Pull: Approximately 6 Pounds- Length: 11.785""- Weight: 33.4 oz.

It is distinguished from the 96/11 rifle by a curved buttplate and by a stock with an integral semi-pistol grip. It uses a graduated tangent sight which begins at 300 meters. The 1911 and 96/11 rifles are characterized by exceptional accuracy and were made with excellent craftsmanship. The fact that Switzerland remained neutral through both world wars ensured that they are in far better condition, on average, than the rifles of other European nations from that vintage. 7.5x55 caliber, Straight Pull.I do not have a sling for it but I do have the original barrel dust cover with Swiss markings.

All is lightly used. First is an aluminum Fab Defense rail system that is distributed by the Mako Group. It has picatinny rails on the top, bottom, and both sides. The top replaces the standard hand guard and overhangs the dust cover to mount an optic on but still allows for the rifle to be field stripped and cleaned. The rail does have a little bit of marring from where the scope was mounted.($250) Second is a scope made by POSP that I purchased from Kalinka optics a couple years ago. To the best of my knowledge this scope is no longer made. It is a fixed power scope with the power set at 4x. The reticle is a cheveron. The scope is also illuminated with brightness settings 1-5, color of illumination is red. An eye piece is also included with the scope. ($250) Last is a buttstock and buttstock buffer tube. The buttstock is just a simple AR style stock made by Command Arms Accessories. The buffer tube extension is aluminum and is also made by command Arms Accessories. IT WILL ONLY FIT ON STAMPED AKs AND NOT MILLED AKs. And I am not sure if it will fit on all stamped AKs or only some. Just for your information I had all of this mounted on a WASR 10.

This was professionally built by Two rivers Arms, Which in my opinion is the best in the business. Each rivet is done perfectly and percise,Although I haven't put many rounds through this one she is a dream to shoot and performs without a hiccup. She has been finished off in a cerakote od green which is a beautiful finish. Then she was fitted with a tapco six position stock and grip,finished up front with a utg quad rail,Also added was the extended mag release which if you haven't ran an ak with, is probably one of the best upgrades you can get for picking up speed during reloading drills.Also went away with the standard sight in favor of a rear peep sight. Which helps with target acquistion 100 fold over the factory iron sights,but also is a lot easier to run with a front mount red dot sight.Will sell for 750 Will come with two mags, Feel free to email me or you can call or text me at REDACTED"

Now Jerry Miculek is a fine guy, I known him personally, I'm a retired US Marine. But there are limits to what he can shot because he has sponsors that need to be satisfied. I put this shotgun together knowing what items needed to be added to an already fine working piece. That's why I say it is better than a JM Pro. Sure you have to go out and buy many more barrels, and a ton more of equipment to equal what Jerry brings to 3 GUN, but just the shotgun itself compared to the JM Pro, this will beat it hands down. Plus there are a few other things I set up in this so it could be useful in the field here at home as well as in 3 Gun.    9 shot *****FINE TUNED*****  Tuned by professional gunsmith using ""top of the line"" specialty parts *Special buffer non-stick, non-crimp in the magazine well sure loading/feed *Spring adjusted for 9 shot capabilities *Mag Brace  Included are the original parts so you can put it back and make it acceptable in the field (for 5 shot)  Holographic Red/Green sight system  Perfect for early morning or late evening target acquisition and sightingDoes come with the flip up sights as well, you will just have to switch them out, easy to do this yourself. There is no credit for not wanting to buy one of the other sights. I've been getting folks who want to offer less, look this is a 1200 dollar shotgun. I've taken all the cash lost I can out of this to make it at 799. I'm going to give the person who buys this 1 dollar, he/she will give me 800 and take the it period.  box of 50 Double “O” buck included  Now i HAVE OVER 1299.00 in this shotgun and I have reduced it already to 799 so this is my cash price, if you want to offer a trade (yes I have a Michigan CPL) please don't offer up your 500 dollar piece, just buy a 500 dollar shotgun. I'm sick of wasting time with kids trying too trade their tired A$$ 45 for this brand new in the box 3 Gun Shotgun. I took lots of time putting this together so please if you offer up, at least be ready to make the deal.
