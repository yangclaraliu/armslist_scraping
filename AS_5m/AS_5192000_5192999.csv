I will sell for $180, price is FIRM. I can install the trigger for free if you wish. One of the first things a GLOCK® owner should consider is upgrading the stock trigger. ZEV™ builds the best triggers in the business and ZEV's Adjustable Fulcrum® Drop-In Trigger Kit components were used to set a world record. The Adjustable Fulcrum Drop-In Trigger Kit only requires one tool (a standard 3/32nd punch), and 15 minutes of your time.You will immediately notice these differences in your gun's performance after installation:The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy.Because of ZEV's proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.The trigger's crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. This feedback improves the user's ability to ride the reset to improve follow up shot speed and placement.The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy.The pre-travel and over-travel are adjustable to allow for a shorter pull, crisper break and faster reset.Trigger adjustments will give the benefit of shorter take up, post break travel and will result in a shorter reset.The Ultimate Kit has a Skeletonized Firing Pin, the benefit is its lighter construction, polish, and the tip of the firing pin is extended for more positive primer ignition."

If your thinking about pulling it, you've already pulled it. Lock-up is tight and function in flawless. Shoot's to point of aim with 158 grain loads. It really likes the Buffalo Bore 158g +P LSWCHP's (my perferred carry load), like shooting a laser beam. And recoil even with these loads which are the hottest you can get without handloading are soft shooting in the model 64.The gun comes as-is. I didnt get a box with it when I got it. Text me anytime. REDACTED If you have pics of your trade feel free to send them. If this post is still up, it is still available. Thanks."

This is not one of the cheap Axis. The metal & bluing is 100%. The stock was upgraded to a Ram Line Hunter. There is not a mark on it but the toe of the recoil pad has a chip on the corner. I will also have a new 22-250 barrel. The only thing needed to switch barrels is a set of go-nogo gauges. They are readily available on the interenet for $30 or so. It has a older Redfield Tracker in 3-9X-40mmm. The scope works fine but it does make a faint clicking sound when the power ring is turned.  The sights work fine in the see thru set up on the gun with a rear  fiber optic sight. This is an accurate shooting set up especially around here in the brush.  Rifle  alone is $300 or with both barrels w/o scope is $375 or with scope $425.  IF IT IS LISTED IT IS AVAILABLE. I remove it  within a hour of sale so no need to ask if is it for sale.
