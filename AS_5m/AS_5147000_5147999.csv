I picked this beauty up with the desire to shoot USPSA, but my local range is closed due to Kitsap County being absurdly retarded and i dont see myself traveling to compete elsewhere at the moment.Anywyas this gun came Factory with fixed compensator, Caspian barrel, Bo-Mar adjustable rear sight and extedid magwell. It also has a newly installed Wilson Combat adjustable trigger, safety. and extractor. After doing some much deserved homework, i have found that this gun was manufactured bewteen 1993-1997 and that there were only just over a thousand made in this configuration. It has no holster wear and this finish is in 9/10 condition using the Blue Book of Gun Values grading scale. There is very light wear on the left side of the compenastor but minor is an understatement. Gun has been shot im guessing between 500-600rnds since new. Require transfer. (The transfer papers stay on site with the FFL, so NO im not requiring you to tell the state you have it as many people apear to believe with I-594. I dont agree with it at all, but i reserve civil-disobedience for more realistic and needed situations:)"

History If you’re already among the AR-cognoscenti then you probably already know general information about Rock River Arms and their line of LAR-15 rifles in particular. But the chances are if you’re in that group, this will be a refresher. For everyone else, then: Rock River Arms got into making AR-15 rifles back in the late 1990s after years of doing custom work on 1911s. They quickly earned a reputation for making excellent guns and components. In 2003 they got a big government contract to supply the Drug Enforcement Administration with a bunch of AR-15 style guns. And since then, they have continued to be one of the major manufacturers of AR-platform guns and parts. They’ve managed this because they make excellent guns. And not only are their guns excellent, they’re actually very reasonably priced. Not cheap, but not horribly expensive, either. Certainly not, considering the quality. Depending on exactly what kind of gun you want, with all those myriad options I mentioned, you can spend as little as $900. For a couple hundred more, you can get a gun fitted with extra features, maybe a nicer trigger or barrel or sighting system. Regardless, you’ll get a gun with a fit and finish better than most AR rifles available on the market right now, even at a significantly higher price. I’m talking no slop, no gaps and excellent quality. Accurate to 1 MOA, or about one-inch at 100 yards. Features Although the particular model tested for this review was a few years old and had seen plenty of use, it was still as tight as any gun I have shot. The match grade trigger (what RRA calls their two-stage) was very smooth and crisp. The reset on the trigger was smaller than I expected, so it allowed for very quick follow-up shots. I like the RRA ‘star’ safety selector, which rolls nicely under your thumb (for right-hand shooters). We were shooting iron sights only and the gun shot better than I can, in terms of accuracy. Shooting Recoil with any AR-style gun is pretty minimal, at least in the .223/5.56 configuration. That’s one of the nice things about the platform. This one was the same. We didn’t have any problems with the gun operating at all, but I didn’t expect any. As I said, this was a well-used gun and I knew the owner wouldn’t tolerate any problems. But the Rock River Arms guns have a very solid reputation for reliability. About the only thing someone might complain about is having to wait for a few weeks to get a custom gun they order from RRA. The company says on their website that most orders for built guns will take 60 to 90 days. And almost all guns are built for a specific order—it is rare that you’ll find a new one for sale someplace. Conclusion I am by no means an expert on ARs, but I do know a bit about quality firearms. The RRA LAR-15 is a quality gun, in just about any configuration you can come up with. If you’re looking for a good, dependable AR at a reasonable price, I don’t think you could go wrong with a Rock River Arms product. Get a fairly basic model as an introduction and rest assured that when you want to geek-out later, you’ll be starting with a quality platform. Or if you already have some idea of the various fancier accessories you might want, you can order it that way to start with, and trust that you’re getting lasting value for your investment"

I purchased this pistol new roughly two months ago from JJ Gun Supply and have a receipt as proof of purchase. After carrying this firearm for the last two months I have decided to switch carry pistols to something that is more conducive to environments I regularly carry in. I have never shot the pistol and it is in factory fired condition with VERY minor wear on the side of the trigger guard from the holster. Having said that, I'm also including a SAS Customs carbon fiber kydex holster. The holster is set for right hand carry with 22 degrees of forward cant, an adjustable tension device, and is reversible between inside and outside the waist carry. Also included is a Pearce grip plug and a full box of Hornady Critical Duty ammo. The above items new after tax set me back $686 and the cost breaks down as follows: Glock Pistol $540, Grip Plug $5, Ammo $25, Holster $75. As previously stated I am interested in acquiring a new carry pistol and will sell this as a package deal for $450 firm and I will also listen to equal value trades (trade value is higher) for a concealed carry 9mm pistol. Buyer must meet in Mason, cash only, all local and federal laws apply, and buyer must present state issued photo ID at time of sale (fellow CCW holders take priority). If you are interested in purchasing please respond to ad and I will get back with you as soon as possible or text only at REDACTED. Thanks for looking."

This top of the line take-down rifle comes with 3 different barrels, (1-270 Winchester, 2-300 Winchester magnum and 3-416 Remington magnum). With this setup you are covered for anything from long range light skinned game all the way to heavy African hunting. The first 2 barrel each have their own 3-12 x 50 D Swarovski scopes with Ballistic turret attachment. The 416 barrel has iron sights and a muzzle break. There are 2 complete bolts, one for the 270 and one for the magnums. The 416 barrel also has it's own forearm for the heaver barrel contour. The stock has a “kick-stop” recoil reducer. The Blaser R93 Luxus is a top of the line straight pull bolt action hunting rifle from Germany. The locking system of the R93 bolts in a straight line without rotational movement in the barrel. When repeating, the body movement is minimized. The process is faster than with conventional actions, allowing more time to aim and re-aim for subsequent shots. This is a particular advantage on drive and big game hunts. The safety system is also very advanced in that the firing pin is not cocked when on safe. Immediately prior to firing a shot, the firing pin spring is cocked by pushing the safety slide forward. This movement is virtually silent and will not alert game to your presence. If no shot is fired, simply return the safety slide to its original position for maximum safety."

All three are in excellent condition and will make a great purchase for three lucky people. This is a 1988 model with a represented round count of 17 since new. The Savage Model 110 is a repeating bolt-action rifle that was developed by Savage Arms of Westfield, Massachusetts. The Model 110 was designed by Nicholas L. Brewer in 1958 and was patented posthumously in 1963. It has been in continuous production since that time, and with the closing of Winchester's New Haven, Connecticut, plant in 2007, the Model 110 has passed the Winchester Model 70 as the oldest continuously manufactured bolt-action rifle in America. The Model 110 has competed directly with other popular designs such as the Remington Model 700, Ruger M77, and Winchester Model 70. The Model 110 is known for its accuracy and reliability. This Model 110 Savage is in .22-250 Caliber with a 22"" barrel. This rifle has a beautiful walnut stock with a very minimal handling mark on one spot on the stock. (See picture).The scope is an early Simmons Model# 1015 3-12x40 power scope. Today SIMMONS scopes are made in the Phillipines and China but this is an early model and was manufactured in Japan. The optics are brighter and clearer than some modern and expensive scopes."

This pistol comes with original box, paper work, and 3 15rd M9A1 Beretta sand resistant magazinesThis is Wilson Combat’s totally reworked Beretta 92G. I just bought this pistol from Wilson Combat and only fired it for about 50 rounds. I have decided I would rather have their CQB Elite 1911 so selling this pistol to fund that custom build.Please note this pistol has the upgraded Action Tune from Wilson Combat. This further improves both SA and DA trigger even further from the standard Wilson model. For tax reasons Wilson told me they cannot do action tunes to these pistols until after one purchases it, therefore I purchased the pistol on Wilson’s web-site and then had them do the action tune for an additional $135 that included using their carbon springs which were also an upgrade.I cannot believe how good this trigger feels and Wilson does an excellent job with fit and finish. The slide racks like it is on glass and the whole gun just feels rock solid.I also purchased Wilson’s ultra slim grips in addition the Wilson grips that come with the gun. The slim grips just give you that much more grip if you have smaller hands.All in all, I have about $1400 in this pistol that was only shot about 50 times. Serious inquires only please!The 92G Brigadier Tactical features the most sought after Beretta 92 features and all-steel Beretta and Wilson Combat custom parts right out of the box.Some features of the limited production Wilson Combat/Beretta 92G Tactical include steel ambidextrous decocker-only levers (G model), enhanced Brigadier slide, a modified M9A1 style checkered frame with accessory rail and rounded trigger guard. This model also features enhanced accuracy with an ""Elite"" style match grade stainless barrel with recessed target crown, the action features a ""D"" hammer spring for lighter trigger pulls, and Trijicon dovetail tritium front sight and Wilson Combat rear sight. Wilson Combat G-10 grips, Wilson Combat steel guide rod and numerous other features to enhance performance. The 92G Tactical is finished in Beretta black Bruniton and marked with the Wilson Combat logo and specially serialized to ensure its place in Beretta history.Although the 92G Tactical has been optimized by Beretta to meet the needs of high round count tactical and competitive shooters, further customization and finish work is available through Wilson Combat.""Being a serious Beretta collector, I have always considered the 92G SD the best model ever produced, but almost too expensive and rare to shoot. I feel fortunate to have been able to work with the fine people at Beretta USA to produce a pistol that, in my opinion, is an improved 92G SD. Having Beretta USA build my dream 92 series pistol is awesome and I’m very happy that a lot of people will be able to enjoy this fine pistol model."" -Bill Wilson"

This is their 8 shot tactical revolver. This is the model with the fixed rail. As typical with Performance Center's pieces, the design, workmanship, fit and finish and stellar. I have owned both the fixed and removable rail version, and liked this one better, but I have to sell. Scandium alloy, with stainless internals, trigger and hammer. I've owned in 8 months and purchased this new. Fired approx 70 rounds of only qualify ammo, and is in perfect working order. This has been well cared for and maintained, and used lightly at the range occasionally. There is a small scratch near the end of the muzzle that you can see in the picture, but other than that blemish, the weapon is flawless. It did not come with the metal case I have seen that come with earlier purchases, but I do have the receipt for purchase, and original case and lock. The R8 is light for its size, feels awesome in the hand, deadly accurate, fun to shoot, kind of unique, and comes with the stuff listed below.- Surefire X300 tactical light- Hornady Ammo - Critical Defense, 4 boxes (these things are sick!)- Armscor Ammo - Precision FMJ, 7 boxes- Remmington Ammo - UMC, 1 box- Hogue grips- Extra batteries for the light (although, I have never had to replace them yet)- Original safety key- Balco holster (this was made for a .44, I had to cut it to fix, and never really used it because I was affraid of wearing the finish, but you can have it if you wish- 2 Original moon clips"

All numbered parts match. The barrel and action metal is in excellent condition with smooth, deep, dark bluing and crisp markings. Stock is in good condition with a few handling/storage marks and flaking varnish, as it typical of arsenal refurbed Mosins. Bolt cycles smooth. Some evidence of past surface rust in a few areas on barrel bands, lug nut, forward of mag well. See pictures for more detail.The bore is very bright with strong rifling, a nice crown and is not counterbored. Smooth, solid action, and one of the smoothest Russian Mosin triggers I have come across. Very clean. Little/no wear. I have not fired it, but assume someone must have since it was refurbed, although I can find no evidence of it (no bluing wear, no powder residue, etc.)Comes with cleaning rod.*Note the prior owner installed a rubber buttstock pad. This makes the hard kicking little M44 much more pleasant to shoot and adds an inch and a half to the length of pull. It is attached with the 2 original screws and can easily be removed. If the buyer prefers a steel buttplate I can take off the rubber one and put on a steel one.I sold two M44s for $350 each recently. This one is just as nice for the parts that matter, but is discounted to reflect the evidence of prior surface rust in a few areas.$259 cashNot interested in trades or low-ball offers.Prefer face to face sale on the West side of Burlington, NC, but willing to ship to your FFL or C&R at your expense.
The ammo in the pictures is NOT included at this price. 
I can sell one of the 7.62x54R spam cans for an additional $150 with the rifle, or $175 without."
