The result of years of toil and sweat, the SIG MCX is proof that the dawn of a new era doesn't happen overnight. The SIG MCX is an innovative weapon system built around a battle-proven core: SIG's gas-operated, short-stroke piston system. Trust it for its outstanding performance, no matter what the conditions! Everything that you've come to expect from the leading name in firearms. The SIG MCX stands as the first rifle built to be silenced from the ground up. It also accepts a broad array of accessories, enabling you to build a complete weapon system for any scenario or environment. Flip up sights and a 30 round mag. WOW! In my opinion THE most comfortable hand guard to grab a hold of! That pretty well says it all!"

Inert, defused or whatever. My dad (WW2 vet) had it laying around forever and now i'm tired of it collecting dust. I vaguely remember a buddy of his had a big artillery brass shell case that he made a lamp out of so he may have got this from him. Anyway, it has a lot marks and knicks, etc, and the bottom of the threads are kind of mangled but could be smoothed down with a dremel. It would look cool all polished up and make a good paperweight for your desk. It weighs about 1-1/2 lbs, measures about 4-1/2 inches tall, and about 2-1/4"" diameter at bottom of the timer part. All the lettering that i can see other than the timer numbers are; 1953 (don't know if this is a date, if it is than it is not WW2), Fuze MT SO M502, and looks like an S on an alignment notch, and a small arrow above the timer scale. The base rotates freely but kind of rough. If you know anything about these kinds of things, feel free to educate me. I'd like to know anything about this thing that I've had laying around since I was wet behind the ears. Thanks for looking."

Over the years, one of the most popular improvements to a 1911 pistol has been improving the sights. Typically that has meant incorporating an adjustable sight on the rear. We use our own Wilson Lo-Mount Adjustable Rear Sight – many people consider it to be the best in the world. If you have ever encountered broken adjustable rear sights, try this one and you will understand why it is so popular. If you ever shoot in low light situations, we can add tritium inserts. If you love the traditional full size 1911 pistol, the Wilson Combat® Classic will greatly exceed your expectations. Regardless if it is for home defense, personal carry, or competition, this firearm will meet your needs."

This process keeps the plate from shifting. All plates are “comfort curve” which is achieved by a custom precision die that bends each plate to our specs. Approx. weight of plates is 7lbs per plate. The Tactical Cut plate is used to reduce weight. The plate is curved both down the center and slightly at the bottom. It is designed to enhance free movement and easier shouldering of various weapons. The Tactical Cut is widely sold to SWAT teams across the USA.Made In the USA Designed to the specs of law enforcement, SWAT, private contractors. All our ballistic plates are made in the U.S.A. We also provide ballistic steel for vehicle armor ups and safe rooms. We specialize in our customer’s needs, custom sizes available.Quality Steel All of our plates are tested, certified and batch certified on a regular basis. Our Level III quality steel will never expire, crack, or need to be replaced like other body armor. We use one of the largest steel manufacturers in the country. Dates of manufacture are with the last 6 months as we obtain steel weekly.Anti Spall Coatings We do not coat our plates with any type of rubberized coatings. The reason is that the steel plates are “Certified” and tested. We have done extensive testing on coatings and to date have not found a “coating” that can be lab tested and certified to provide anti spall ability. We recommend a rated Level IIIA trauma pad be installed if you are concerned about this issue. The reason we state this is that then you will have (2) forms of “Certified” armor that has both been tested.Rating & Certification All plates are certified ballistic steel rated “Stand Alone” and “Multi Hit” Level III Brinell hardness rating of 500+ All of our packages come with the certification paperwork.** This model complies with NIJ Standard-0101.06 for Ballistic Resistance of Body Armor.**Manufacturer certified and regularly batch tested by Tactical Armor Concepts.25 rds.

The test is achieved by applying a known load to the surface of the tested material through a hardened steel ball of known diameter.

Remember that there are many factors that influence any type of body armor, distance, position, angles, bullet type, bullet load, weapon type, cover, ect. The term ""bulletproof"" is a myth.

If you press down on the rear switch, it is on till you release, flip up to turn on constant. The lazer holds when mounted on a .40, hadnt tried it on a rifle.

Ive put a decent amount of work into the rifle such as sent her to get the trigger pack and trigger to be upgraded to the geissele brand trigger pack and the legendary lightning bow trigger, this upgrade itself cost me over $500 when all was said and done, on top of that i bought a custom made savy sniper dual point sling for $80 , magpul fde iron sights and sighted in to perfection, and magpul handgrip which cost $120 the only reason im selling is because i got a family trip coming up and kinnda miscalculated the finances, but my loss is your gain i have a buddy who wants to buy it but he wants me to wait a month and i told him i would if nobody else gets it first. So i got a guranteed $2000 for her which is $500 give or take less than what ive bought her for and put into her in upgrades.

It is a heat treatment to the metal to prevent corrosion, scratching, and rust. It does have a rail if you wanted to put a light or laser. Comes with original case and locks. The Witness is a unique pistol because of its ability to accept conversion kits. You can change this gun to a .22, .40, or 10mm all with keeping the same frame.

Only one available at this price. Stop by the shop or call Randy or Ben for any additional details. From CZ's website:
The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.
Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.
The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."
