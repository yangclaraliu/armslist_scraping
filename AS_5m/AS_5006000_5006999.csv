I'll deactivate ad when its officially sold--

For sale is my 5906, all stainless steel, ambi-safety/decocker. Early model (1989)with square trigger guard and adjustable rear sight. Includes the original numbered box, papers, cleaning rod and sight key. Box has the usual fading but is in really good shape. My posted price includes one 10rd MecGar mag and your choice of a curved grip or straight grip(both new,not old & beat up). I can add extra mags for $20 each.

Supposedly it was bought new by a little ol lady who wasnt strong enough to operate it so it sat in her closet for years before her grandson or nephew(i dont remember) inherited it then sold it to me. Ive not shot it yet havnt had the money to shoot away. I dont have any use for safe queens and I bought it with the intention of shooting and enjoying it. I have taken it down completely and cleaned all the internal parts. Aside from some outside blemishes, its a new gun.

No nicks/scratches/dings. It shows some minor rubbing marks, mostly on the frame (probably 20 years of being moved around inside the box) A fresh beadblasting on the frame would bring it back to a LIKE NEW collector's piece.

Will meet at local FFL for transfer. Feel free to contact me with any questions. Thanks.
I'll update and/or take down ad when its sold."

I was not looking to buy a 5"" 1911 but was so impressed with it, I did. It has a awesome 3.5 pound adjustable match grade trigger, a match grade barrel, awesome fiber optic sights The ENHANCED features a no-snag, Novak-type rear sight adjustable for elevation and the front sight is a long, robust post with a red fiber-optic insert that front site that makes acquiring a target fast & easy. Remington added an Ed Brown-style beavertail grip safety, which is a huge improvement over the original GI design in both operation and comfort. It also has a factory extended mag release and sweet grips. I shouldn't have bought it, because I NEED one with a 3"" barrel for work. My loss is your gain. See why Hickok45 (the most respected & knowledgeable reviewer around) compares it to his $3,ooo. plus Ed Brown. You can buy these for $ 899. to $ 949. PLUS TAX depending on where you can find them. My price of $795.00 is firm and one the best deals on armslist  on a new pistol, compared to buying it from Cabelas, Gander Mountain....you will need a purchase permit or a CPL.

NOTE: This is the ENHANCED model, not just an R1
I will consider trades for a 1911 with a 3"" barrel, and can add cash for the right pistol."

The only negative about the shotgun is the nicks in the wood from the previous owner who wore a ring when shooting. The butt stock is nearly perfect with only very small marks. There are a few small scratches on the receiver. Other than these the shotgun is great. 100% reliable with all shells I've used. I personal know the previous owner and he kept it in a safe for the life of the shotgun. If you would like more info or pictures feel free to contact me through email or phone. 281-513-713three.

Has very low round count due to not having time to make it to the range so about 150-200 if that, mostly it's been a home gun and in the safe, I've kept it very clean after every time it's been fired and has been handled with much care so no scratches or wear marks and has never had not one malfunction even in rapid fire.
I really do not have to let it go and I do love this gun and trust my life with it period but I'm willing to see if there's any good fair trades out there and I promise you will not be disappointed! If interested text me at REDACTED for some reason it won't let me put up pics but I'll be able to send them to you thank you."
