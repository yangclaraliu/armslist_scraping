It is produced in a variety of finishes, calibers, and barrel lengths.   HistoryIn the early 1950s, Westerns were popular in movies and television. Colt had discontinued the iconic Single Action Army prior to World War II, and few single-action revolvers were available to meet market demand for cowboy-style revolvers. In 1953, the new firm of Sturm, Ruger & Company introduced the Single-Six, a .22 LR rimfire single-action revolver. The Single-Six proved to be a popular seller, leading Ruger to develop and market a centerfire revolver similar to the Single Action Army: the Ruger Blackhawk.Ruger introduced the Blackhawk in 1955. Chambered for the .357 Magnum, the Blackhawk was a simple and strong design, and it sold well. In 1956, as Smith & Wesson was introducing the new .44 Magnum, Ruger quickly developed a variant of the Blackhawk in the new cartridge. Ruger achieved wide popularity with this firearm in a hotly anticipated new cartridge, which was both cheaper and more readily available than the Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver. According to popular legend, Ruger was able to field a .44 Magnum revolver at nearly the same time as Smith & Wesson due to a Ruger employee finding expended .44 Magnum cartridge cases at a scrapyard and inducing that Smith & Wesson was about to launch a new cartridge. The 1955–1962 Blackhawks are known today as the ""Flattop"" models, because their adjustable rear sights were not protected by ""ears"" extending up from the frame as later became standard. From 1962 through 1972, Ruger made the ""Three Screw"" Blackhawk in various calibers, so called by the number of screws visible on the side of the revolver. The Flattop and Three Screw Rugers were modernized compared to the Colt Single Action Army, in that they had adjustable sights instead of the Colt's fixed sights, and they used wire coil springs instead of the Colt's flat leaf springs. Bill Ruger chose coil springs due to their greater durability, saying that it solved one of the primary weaknesses of the Colt design. The early models of the Blackhawk still operated the same way as the Colt, in that the hammer was half-cocked to load and unload and that the firearm was not safe to carry with all six chambers loaded due to the hammer resting upon the sixth chamber. In 1973, in order to eliminate accidents occurring from the hammer jarring against a round loaded in the sixth chamber, Ruger introduced the New Model Blackhawk. The New Model Blackhawk did not require the hammer to be half-cocked for loading and unloading, and it employed a transfer bar mechanism which prevented the cartridge under the hammer from being fired without the trigger being pulled. The New Blackhawk was seen as limiting firearms accidents and legal liability. Ruger then began offering a retrofit program, offering free transfer bar conversions to earlier variants of the Blackhawk. Various model   Ruger Old Model Super Blackhawk     Ruger New Model Super Blackhawk and Javalina     The Ruger Old Army is a 45-caliber percussion revolver based on the Ruger Blackhawk action.      The Blackhawk is a popular base gun for custom work. This one is a cooperative effort by members of the American Pistolsmith's GuildOver the years the Blackhawk has appeared in a wide variety of models. These models include:    New Model Blackhawk: Produced in blued steel in .30 Carbine, .357 Magnum, .41 Remington Magnum, .44 Special, and .45 Colt; produced in stainless in .327 Federal Magnum with an 8-round cylinder, .357 Magnum, and .45 Colt. Multiple barrel lengths were offered in many of these configurations. New Model Blackhawk Convertible: The cylinder of a Blackhawk is easily removed, and can be replaced with a cylinder for a different cartridge of the same diameter. Ruger has offered ""convertible"" cylinder revolvers in .45 ACP/.45 Colt, .38-40/.40 S&W/10mm Auto, and .357 Magnum/9×19mm Parabellum. Other than being sold with multiple cylinders, these firearms are identical to the Blackhawk. New Model Super Blackhawk: Produced in blued and stainless, with or without a rib for mounting a scope. The Super Blackhawk is built on the same frame, but with a larger grip (in the 7.5"" and 10.5"" barrels) and unfluted cylinder (except for the 5.5"" barrel), in order to more effectively deal with the .44 Magnum's recoil. Also, the ejector rod housings and grip frames are made of steel, versus aluminium for those same components in the Blackhawk. Vaquero and New Vaquero: With the popularity of Cowboy Action Shooting came demand for a single-action revolver that was more traditional in appearance. As the standard Ruger Blackhawk departs from the Single Action Army looks due to its adjustable sights, Ruger offered a fixed-sight equivalent to cater to buyers wanting a more traditional appearance. In all other ways, the Vaquero was identical to the Blackhawk, though offered in slightly fewer variants. The original Vaquero was offered in .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, and .45 Colt. After some time, Ruger went with a smaller frame to more closely resemble the actual size of the Colt SAA, changed the name to the New Vaquero, and dropped the powerful .44 Magnum from the lineup. While keeping the smaller size, Ruger later went back to the simple Vaquero name. Bisley: The Bisley grip is a type of angled grip developed by Colt for target shooting at the end of the 19th Century. Ruger's ""Bisley"" offerings incorporated a Bisley-style grip, hammer spur, and trigger. Old Army: The Old Army is a percussion (""cap and ball"") black powder revolver based on the Blackhawk frame."

Ideally), being that it is so tight. That being said I have run some Winchester 230gr through it recently with no issues.  The reason I am selling is I have less and less use for this particular model.  This 1911 is an accurate 45acp, (if that isn't an oxymoron), and performs like guns well above this price range.  Included are two Wilson Combat magazines and everything that came with the original purchase except the Springfield holster, (as shown in the picture)."

A rare very interesting pistol. These were a collaborative project between Springfield Armory and a custom gunmaker Peters Stahl in Germany. The slide was made in Germany and mated to a Springfield frame. It has a unique dual extractor system that allows the pistol to be easily converted to multiple calibers just by swapping out the barrel. I do not have any extra barrels unfortunately but have read that parts for the upper are still available from Stahl in Germany. This one comes with a factory ported six inch slide. If you know anything about the legendary accuracy of the 10MM round, you already have a pretty good idea of what this pistol is capable of.      Another good fact about these guns is that Springfield had a lifetime warranty on their older pistols which they still honor.      This pistol is a shooter not a safe queen which is reflected in the price. It has some wear in the finish from carry or range use, but overall the finish doesn't look that bad and the gun is in great mechanical shape.it comes with one factory Springfield Armory Mag. Two extra mags one being from an AMT Hardballer which seems to fit and feed just fine, the other mag being of unknown manufacture which also appears to function well.I'm also including 300 rounds (6 boxes) or Sig Sauer Elite Performance 180 GR FMJ ammo with the sale.These are guns are rare, even more so in Mass, plus with the ammo thrown in that's a pretty nice deal, so I'm firm on my price. I'm using the proceeds from this sale to fund another gun project so I'm not really interested in trades, unless you have something particularly rare, cool or interesting.im out of FA 10 transfers so the sale will need to be done at an FFL dealer.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).Fixed Night SightsManual Safety, Safety Stop on Hammer, Firing Pin Safety2 18RD Magazines91152REDACTED26"

Designed with a decocking lever, the PCR is intended to be decocked before holstering. The trigger safety, after decocking, is designed to act like that of a double action revolver. The PCR has no need to flip a safety lever off, and the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull requires the operator to make a conscious decision before firing. The PCR's rubber grips panels, serrated front and back straps help to increase handling and a loaded chamber indicator helps to inform when the CZ 75 PCR is loaded.

Unrelated to the glock but subsequently I have to sell off my collection. So what I've done was took a standard Glock 43 and put some extras on it. First I took off the stock sights and put on the XXX ring sights. They are hands down the fastest way to acquire your target, day or night. They add some height but worth every penny. I also put on an extended mag release, extended slide stop, and extended slide release. Normally it comes with 2 mags but this has 4 mags and each has a +2 mag extension so you can carry 8 rounds instead of 6 and have a better grip for larger hands. It comes with a Streamlight TLR-6 laser/light should you need to pull it at night. Lastly, it has a silencerco threaded barrel with special silencerco piston. It also comes with all the factory items that were replaced with the upgrades as well as the box and manual. Also included are two holsters (they will not fit the TLR-6 light)Below is what this all costed me. Considering it's never been fired (minus 12 rounds by the gunsmith when he aligned the sights and laser) this is a great deal.

I am selling this Rifle with a full field kit, a Damascus Bowie knife and fully loaded possibles bag, powder horn, and other extras…
The Traditions Shenandoah 50 Caliber Flintlock Rifle was designed by Traditions to the style and feel of a traditional Pennsylvania rifle. The rifle features a 33 -1/2"" octagonal barrel with a 1 in 66"" rifling for patched round ball accuracy. The double set triggers and windage adjustable sight assure the utmost accuracy, while the full length stock with brass inlays make this rifle a great showpiece. 
This gun has never had a round fired through it. The mechanism has been demonstrated with powder in the pan, but no powder has been loaded into the barrel.
The original MSRP for the rifle alone was nearly $600. I do not believe this gun is available any longer.
 
Particulars:
.50 caliber
1 in 66"" rate of twist.
33-1/2"" blued barrel.
49 -1/2"" overall length.
7 lbs. 3 oz. overall weight.
 The rifle comes with a like new soft carrying case. 
Damascus Giraffe Bone Handle Bowie Knife 
The Bowie knife has a 6.6” blade of rainbow Damascus that has never been used for cutting. With the Giraffe bone handle, the overall length is 11.5”. The sheath is had made. This knife feels extremely good in the hand, well balanced and quick.
 
Possible Bag and Powder Horn
The possibles bag was made by me nearly 40 years ago and has been used for much of the black powder hunting I did in the 80’s with other guns. It is a great period looking bag. I also made the powder horn at the same time.
The possibles bag content and extras include: Ramrod palm saver 2 regular cleaning jags
Powder flask
Powder Measure
Patch Removal Wire Screw
Ball Removal Screw 1 Extra stainless nipple Pre-cut patches extra flints
About 80+ .490 lead balls
Patch Grease
Barrel Solvent
It does include a pouch of conical bullets, they will hit hard at close range, however, at any distance, because of the 1:66 twist, they will not be as accurate as a patched ball."

It is a modified version of the SOCOM556RC, the most advanced 5.56 rifle suppressor ever made, which was selected by US Special Operations Command as first among all competitors in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor evaluation in history, which covered all aspects of suppressor performance. Constructed of advanced high-temperature alloys and stainless steel, the SOCOM556-SB2 features a larger bore to minimize the probability of baffle strikes due to unstable projectiles, a common issue with ultra-short-barreled weapons and some types of unjacketed frangible and “green” ammunition. Advanced internal venting reduces back pressure, thereby reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section and computer controlled welding that increases durability. The patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvement in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a true technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree. A new indexing system means this suppressor mounts securely to a SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous models and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area. Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-SB2 produces minimal, consistent shift in point of impact compared with an unsuppressed weapon.   Features - Same revolutionary suppressor technology as SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, winner of US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) extensive and rigorous suppressor trials - Designed for use with 5.56 caliber rifles with barrels shorter than 10” or firing unstable “green” ammunition - Larger suppressor bore to minimize probability of baffle strikes due to unstable projectiles or “green” ammunition, a common issue with extremely short barrels - Advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, cyclic rate, and gas blowback - Integrated blast shield increases durability - Patent-pending front-plate design and proprietary gas-flow improvements virtually eliminate first-round flash - Effective attenuation of noise and dust signatures - Patented Fast-Attach® design attaches and removes in seconds - Minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with unsuppressed weapon - Lightweight and compact for minimal impact on weapon handling characteristics - Constructed of advanced high-temperature alloys and stainless steel - Long service life - Made in the USA   Specifications - Caliber 5.56 mm (.223 caliber) - Length 6.2 inches - Weight 17.0 ounces - Diameter 1.5 inches - Thread Size / Color NoVisit our ONLINE STORECalibersUSA.com"

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. Upon firing, the patented, dual-extractor system pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also one of the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face."
