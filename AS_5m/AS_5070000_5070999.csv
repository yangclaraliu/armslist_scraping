The blower chute angle and direction are controlled right from the seat. It has a manual lift arm that locks the blower in the up position.

This pistol was purchased from a Vietnam vet who kept it as a backup gun in his safe. He says less then 200 rounds have been through it, and I've put 15 downrange (hence the 35 rounds that come with it). Ther aren't even scratches on the barrel from the slide, nor are there any marks on the glossy hardwood grips. Like new for a 24 year old gun!

Comes with Manual, Gunlock and lifetime warranty in original hard case. This new 9mm pistol is a double-action, striker-fire designed platform that incorporates an ergonomically driven polymer double stack frame with a stainless steel slide. With extensive research on the form and function of the tactile-enhanced grip, the operator will find the design enhances control, while providing consistent hand placement. The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine. Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide. Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition. These are nice full sized 9mm's, no jamming, they shoot flawlessly. Like a Glock 17 for less than 1/2 the cost."

The SXR does not have the side bolt release; it has the same bolt release as the first generation BAR.          2. The SXR has a detachable magazine instead of the hinged floor plate found on the Browning.  This was the major advantage the SXR had over the ShortTrac.It is chambered in the new generation .270 WSM.  If you're not familiar with this round, it delivers as much energy at all ranges as the 7mm Remington Magnum, and has a slightly flatter trajectory than the 7mm.  Felt recoil is about the same as the .270 Winchester round, same the shooter a tremendous amount of punishment.The rifle is in excellent condition.  It has a few pressure marks on the stock and forearm but nothing that penetrates the satin oil finish.  There is some loss of bluing at the muzzle; otherwise, the bluing is near perfect.The rifle is priced with a Bushnell 3-9x50 Wide Angle Banner scope.

I can't say for sure though, I'm no expert. That being said, It's still a functioning rifle. The breech locks up tight, and the hammer, trigger and firing pin seem to be in great shape. I've never fired it becaue I could never find the ammo but I've read that people make their own using 24 gauge brass shotgun shells.

It has been 100% reliable, no malfunctions of any kind. The 25 acp, though getting harder to find, is an awesome little cartridge.

Embracing the proven concept of the .300 Whisper, the 300 BLK version of the PWS MK112 extends the capability of the platform by allowing the concurrent use of both subsonic and supersonic ammunition in the same platform – even from the same magazine if the user so chooses. The MK112 retains lethal capability out to 450 meters with ammunition such as the PWS 110gr TAC-TX™ 300 BLK round.Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK112 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15” handguard and free-floated barrel.The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2” sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper.Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER™ charging handle.

I used it as my hog gun in northern California so it has some scuffs and dings from much carrying but only approximately 150 rounds fired through it. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope mount but I no longer have the mount as I found the scope to be a hindrance in the thick brush encountered in hog hunting. When I did have the scope it would group 5 rounds into just a few inches at 100 yards easily. This is really good for a semi automatic military type rifle. I would consider a small pistol, such as a Kel-TEC Taurus, or Ruger LCP a a partial trade. I also have some ammo, both premium and plinking, that I could sell separtely. Thanks for looking"

This is Made by GSG and imported by ATI. It is a model Kalashnikov and is chambered in 22LR. This is in decent shape but doe shave obvious signs of use and wear on the paint/finish. These could likely be touched up with a paint pen, or just leave them like they are because any gun that gets used gets marks! This comes with the gun and one 24rd magazine. I got this in trade and would keep it, but I just have too many 22lr rifles as it is. I have not had the chance to shoot this, but it actions fine from everything I can tell. These are surprisingly hard to find given what they are, and this has a real pretty wooden stock compared to the armscor and other versions. I would also consider trades on this. Would be open to Glock 9mms, 357 mag/38spl revolvers, or other items that catch my interest. Some trades will need boot on your end, some will need it on mine. Just be fair with your values and I will do the same. Shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. Thanks for looking and happy hunting, JB"

Always stored indoors in humidity controlled safe.It comes with standard matte finish scope mounts (not shown), the attached EGW 0 MOA picatinny rail to attached better rings and a bigger scope, and one used / original 3 shot magazine. It has some minor use marks and scratches, nothing major. The action is as smooth as glass, and the trigger pull has been set to 2 to 3 pounds (adjustable 2-4 lbs). The bore and barrel are excellent. This is a tack driver and a great addition to any collection. I took pictures without removing the scope, so just to clarify, NO SCOPE is included with this sale.

Also, more pictures available upon request.If you are a reloader I have dies, brass, a wide variety of Nosler Bullets and maybe a few other goodies they would be a separate purchase.

The Matrix receiver set allows the build to use either Armalite or DPMS components. The build centered around a custom order 20"" Blackhole Weaponry Stainless 1/11 twist bull barrel, with 5/8-24 threads and rifle length gas. The handguard is a Midwest Industries 15"" SSK keymod (Armalite style barrel nut), with a Troy industries low profile gas block, and actual JP Bennie Cooley muzzle brake. The barrel nut is properly torqued on at 60 ft/lbs, and the bolt carrier group is a DPMS Nickel Boron coated unit sans forward assist serrations. The stock is a LUTH-AR Skullaton with a proper DPMS LR-308 rifle spring and buffer installed. It was built with an Armalite lower parts kit, and also rocks a Rock River Varmint 3.5lb 2 stage trigger, and Ergo rubberized Palm swell grip. Lastly it also has a BCM Gunfighter charging handle with the large latch. The rifle was built a couple years ago and has maybe 80 rounds through it and shoots very smooth with minimal recoil for a 308, and otherwise has just been sitting around seeing minimal use due to the high cost of 308. Only reason it's up for sale is because I already have several other 308's and I'd prefer something cheaper to shoot. This gun is a purpose built bench/target/sniper type rifle, and is fairly heavy due to the bull barrel and large frame...but is easily sub MOA accurate. With handloads or good factory ammo, it should be 1/2 MOA capable or less actually, as I've personally shot around .6 MOA with factory match ammo. The gun takes all styles of LR-308/Magpul/DPMS mags, and I can include an Armalite small parts kit you can use to swap out the mag catch to make it Armalite magazine compatible as well. I will say upfront that the bolt catch on the rifle doesn't work too well with LR-308 style mags, and doesn't hold the bolt back reliably when manually activated, but an empty mag does for the most part. It's likely due to the fact the bolt catch is an Armalite AR-10A catch, but swapping it out for a DPMS catch (A rougly $8 part) will likely do the trick. It never bothered me that much so I haven't swapped it yet. Other than that, the gun has some light handling marks and a few tiny scratches in a few places, but other than that is in excellent shape. If you wish to see more pics just email me and I can provide any angle or whatever requested. I will include everything seen in the pics (except the mag) with the gun, including the scope and mount, and bipod and picatinny keymod rail mount. The Scope isn't great...it's a Tasco 6x-24x 42mm, but it'll get the job done.I would consider shipping this rifle anywhere in state for $45 shipping.I also am willing to accept discreet paypal payment + 3.5% of the sales price.Please, no trades."

We got her this caliber because the .38 Spl +P version of the gun we had, had so much muzzle blast out of that shorty barrel that the concussion was unpleasant for her and the .22 mag is a great balance between recoil and muzzle blast. Paid over $550 brand new at Cabelas with taxes and Crook county fee so I feel asking $425 is fair. It's still in really good shape (sits in a nightstand 24/7) and has had about 300rounds through it but she no longer shoots it and I would like to get some cash for the revolver to help fund a bathroom remodel but I am open to certain trades like:Glock 23, M&Ps .40S&W, Ruger SP101 (I'm not expecting safe queens here; it can have some holster wear/finish issues but needs to be mechanically sound please.) Included in the price is 100 rounds of Winchester ammo and roughly 30 rounds of Speer Gold Dot HPs. Thank you"
