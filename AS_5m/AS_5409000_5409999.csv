Custom AR10 7.62x51 Nato/308 Win. ""Live Free or Die"" matched upper/lower with CCMG parts kit. Trigger is crisp and clean with the upper sporting a Seekins Precision red billet aluminum AR10 charging handle. With a Blitzkreig Tactical LR308 BCG with dual serration which can be used with most uppers on the market as it has the serrations for a 3 o'clock style forward assist and a pronounced shoulder for the DPMS style forward assist.
DUAL EJECTOR: ""Two is one, one is none"", a motto to live by. This BCG has a second ejector in the bolt. Building this redundancy allows the BCG to eject and extract efficiently and consistently. This is truly a remarkable and uncommon feature offered in bolt carrier groups.
Carrier: Case hardened 8620 steel, with dual forward assist serrations.
 Finish: Black Nitride - QPQ Treated
 Gas Key: 4130 steel, attached with grade 8 hardware and properly staked
 Cam Pin: Hardened 4340 Steel
 Firing Pin: Made from 8740 steel, center-less ground and hard chrome coated
 Bolt: Case hardened 9310 steel, all bolt parts are case hardened and shot peened with two ejectors and two crane O-rings and dual extractor springs installed.
 Black Nitride/QPQ: This is an extreme case hardening process which turns the steel black and hardens the surface of the steel and extends the life of the product. QPQ stands for Quench Polish Quench. This process is now commonly used in the industry. The Black Nitride is coated by H&M who own the trademark, ""Black Nitride"". Only the best here.
The Barrel is a Green Mountain Barrel which was machined by KAK industries. It is 416 stainless with a 1/10 twist. Chambered in 308 winwhich also will accept 7.62 nato. It is medium contour with a DPMS LR308 extension matte blasted grey finish.
12"" freefloating keymod Omega. 
The stock is Troy industries PDW style stock. Lightweight and compact making this rifle a battleax for our time. It shortens overall length by 2"" compared to an M4 stock. The impact-resistant, polymer cheek-piece with QD swivel mount provides stability and comfort; the aluminum thumb-latch and guide rails offer superior strength and five positions of adjustment.

I replaced the factory wood grips with black Hogue over-molded grips. Comes with the box, original paperwork and contents, two Para 8-round factory mags, and I’m throwing in two Chip McCormick 8-rounders. Factory grips are in the box, as well.Gun works well, spring is still fairly tight. The alloy frame and 4.25” barrel gives it some kick, was a surprise the few times I took it to the range. Great looking gun, selling it rather than having it sit unused. Happy to send any additional pictures if desired.

(One Mag.)* 4” Barrel* Date Code: KE 1994* Serial Number: 16-111xxx* No box or papersDescription from the web:The extremely compact HK P7M8 can be drawn, cocked, and fired more accurately and faster than any other pistol. Its overall length and width is close to many .380 pocket pistols; the full power 9mm P7M8 has a full length four inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide. The unique HK cocking lever allows the P7M8 to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip. Releasing the cocking lever de-cocks the P7M8 immediately and renders it completely safe. Made of high grade steel, the low profile slide keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110 degrees, the result is a compact, accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited for civilian and law enforcement use.
