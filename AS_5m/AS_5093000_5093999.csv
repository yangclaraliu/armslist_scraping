Example: it is legal for you to keep a loaded handgun in your car as long as you can see it from the window. If it's in the glove box or under the seat not in a locked case, it's a concealed handgun. OR, Omaha leos will try to get people who don't live in city limits to bring their handguns into the city USING THIS SITE. If you don't have it registered there, you just broke omaha ordinance and the man will do his job and will take your weapon. Good work gentlemen. Secondly, where do some of these people get their #s? The scalping is over guys, please post accordingly? Everyone that reads your post has internet,and can look at the msrp. The first post I saw today had a weapon over msrp and it was shot already? If we wanted to get screwed we'd do our wives.  Finally, use common sense. You DON'T know who is on the other side, and you can only know what YOU are going to do, not them.

I'm selling this as I've hardly ever shot it - 107 rounds in 1998 when I bought it, another 115 in 2004, and another 100 in 2015. Apart from four visits to the range, it has stood, appropriately cleaned and lubricated, in a safe. I couldn't take a worthwhile photo of the barrel, but it sparkling, in top class condition. There is no rust on this rifle. A small shot count, so not an extensive basis, but it proved 100% reliable with the variety of ammo used.The PC4 uses the same magazines as the Ruger P91, P94, P944 .40S&W pistols, which is why I originally bought it, planning to buy a companion pistol, but I settled on 9mm so never benefited from the common mags.Important Note: The Ruger safety system is overkill and each part of it detracts from trigger operation. I removed one of these, the bolt lock fulcrum set. The parts are included if you want to refit them. Note that purchase includes your full acceptance of any associated risk, no matter how low I think it is, if you don't do so.The bore, finish and stock are very good, reflecting the low bullet count, infrequent use, and care taken.$500, no trades.

I just picked it up a month ago since I never saw them in the store, and now I'm concentrating on 5.56x45 and .308. So this is literally a new in box Century RAS AK47 with all the factory goodies I got with it. All original wood furniture, bolt hold open notch on the safety lever, and a rubber charging handle cover. The sights are perfectly straight as these are all brand new parts and not made from a kit. The finish is better than I've seen on the Arsenal rifles, and the charging is much smoother as well. You can ride the charging handle home as slow as you want and there isn't a single catch point, especially on the hammer where the carrier usually gets stuck.Since this is the last of my AK's you also get a number of other items at lower than retail price. Those items include 5 magazines, of which 2 are Magpul MOE 30 round mags and the other 3 are metal 30 rounders. It also includes 455 rounds of steel cased ammo, all FMJ, and an AK/SKS all metal sight tool. Hell I'll even throw in the .50 cal metal ammo container in the picture with the mags and a Tapco 5 position buttstock new in package as well just to add some value. Selling for lower than I spent just to get it gone. I can be reached best by email or text at REDACTED. Thanks!"

One owner. Has about 300 rounds shot through her. Nearly new condition and 100% functional. I am selling as I just don’t target shoot much anymore.Call REDACTED to buy. No text mess. No trades. Buyer pays fee for FFL transfer.Everything is included that came from the factory: carry case, three 18 round magazines, all paperwork, bushing wrench, two cleaning tools, allen wrench and lock.I had it built with the optional CZC HAJO TAC tactical rear sight with relieved, angled corners to prevent catching on clothes.The Shadow platform has been known for accuracy and the new Accu-Shadow takes it to the next level. The Accu-Bushing system holds the barrel with much more precision, enabling us to cut group sizes nearly in half. In testing, the pistols returned groups substantially less than 3″ at 50 yards (using Fiocci 124 JHP). Add to that a full complement of custom work including competition hammer, lighter springs (11 lb. recoil, 13 lb. main), thin black aluminum grips, stainless steel guide rod and polished internals.A short-reset disconnector is used to greatly reduce trigger reset between shots, making this SA/DA trigger reset like a nicely-tuned single-action only trigger. The Accu-Shadow is topped with a fiber optic front and HAJO serrated target rear (adjustable for height, also drift adjustable for windage).Short of a full custom pistol, it’d be difficult to find greater out-of-the-box accuracy than the Accu-Shadow can deliver.What’s new and very exciting is the CZC SRTS short reset trigger system. People have been asking for a shorter faster reset without the trigger swinging all the way forward in SA mode, now we have it. CZC has taken almost all of the forward movement out of the single action position with the trigger moving on average less than a 1/16 (0.0625”) before stopping. They have basically created a 1911 single action on a double action gun.Product Name CZ 75 SP-01 Accu-Shadow – 9mm (CZ Custom) SKU 91730 MSRP $1,715.00 Chambering 9mm Luger Magazine Capacity 18 Magazine Type Double Stack Frame Steel Grips Thin Aluminum Trigger Mech DA/SA Sights Fiber Optic Front HAJO Rear Barrel Cold Hammer Forged Barrel Length 4.6 in Weight 2.4 lbs.Overall Length 8.15 in Height 5.79 in Width 1.46 in Safety Ambidextrous Manual Safety, Safety Stop on HammerLink to more information: http://cz-usa.com/product/cz-75-sp-01-accu-shadow-9mm-black-3x18-rd-mags-by-cz-custom/Call REDACTED to buy.
