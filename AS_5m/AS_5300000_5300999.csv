Fast and Accurate Shooting       The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.       The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy.         Maximized Safety Systems   In addition to the manual safety, the FNS features Four Major Safeties:  Trigger Safety Firing Pin Safety Drop Safety Out-of-Battery Safety        1. Trigger Safety The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a presure on the trigger.The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger.       2. Firing Pin Safety The firing pin safety prevents the stricker from passing.The firing pin safety is lifted out the way when the trigger is pulled.  3. Drop Safety Part of the fire control housing prevents the sear from rotating down to release the stricker unless the trigger is pulled.  4. Out-of-Battery Safety When the slide is not fully forwards the sear cannot release the stricker even if the trigger is pulled.       Enhanced Ergonomics   The FNS pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as:- Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better prehension- Front serrations for easy press check- Three interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt to the pistol to the shooter's hand size.            For Right- and Left-Handers   All operating controls are fully ambidextrous:- Slide stop- Magazine catch- Manual safety         Durability and Unequalled Reliability   The pistol features a 4'' hammer-forged stainless steel barrel and ultra-hard coating on stainless steel slide and barrel. The high quality material is fully tested and fired under severe conditions prior to dispatch.The pistol accepts all military and law enforcement duty ammunition."

Gun shoots very well and I have personally killed deer to 150 yards with this setup. I dont deer hunt much so its time to thin out the collection.  $300 or best offer. Face to face transaction and cash only."

Also AR pistols cannot have a vertical foregrip on them unless it is over 26"" in overall length which this pistol is 27.5"" so it is well within the legal boundaries. This allows you to attach any accessory you want and have the functionality of a short barreled rifle without the extra money on a tax stamp, legal paperwork, and many months worth of waiting.

The wood has some dings and there is a very light coat of rust all over that should be easy enough to take care of with some very fine bronze wood and some elbow grease. I've cleaned up plenty of old military surplus rifles in considerably worse shape than this gun.I've put about 50 shells though it since I've owned it, but I just don't shoot it enough to want to keep it. It functions flawlessly but it could eventually use a detail strip and some cleaning. Included (along with the originals) is also a new friction ring, new friction ring spring, new recoil spring, and new magazine plug. Asking $300 or trade for 5.45x39 ammo or 9mm ammo.Here's a few pics: http://imgur.com/a/G6T1X"

I built 2 of these rifles about 10 years ago, when the chrome lined 12.5 inch military issue barrels were still available. You will not find a better quality AK barrel than the hungarian military built barrels. The barrel has a 4"" muzzle break thats pinned and welded, for a total length of over 16 inches. The rifle was built on an Ohio arms reciever. I believe Ohio Arms makes the best AK47 reciever available. The AMD65 is a full 2 pounds lighter than an ak47 because of the shorter barrel, shorther gas system and light wieght fore grip. perfect for small people. I actualy have 2 of these rifles. so its your choice. One has an M4 style adjustable stock, and the other one has a folding wire style stock. If you want to buy both, for a his and hers or such.  I'd take 1,100 for the pair and toss in a nice 75 round drum, and the few rounds of ammo I have on hand for them.Oh, and before you ask.

The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger. Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm.  Sorry, not interested in trades.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.Buy this gun online at www.copsgunshop.net."

I’m the original owner of this Kel-Tec P32. It comes with the original; box, paperwork, manual and carry-case. I am also including (3) magazines and over $200 in ammo. You can be putting rounds down range today!
The ammo includes a full box of Buffalo Bore +P hard cast, Hornady Custom XTP, Magtech JHP, and partial boxes (see photos) of Winchester Silvertips, Fiocchi, Magtech Guardian Gold and FMC and Corbon JHP. There are some misc rounds including Glazer Safety Slugs (Blue).
The gun has had exactly 137 rounds through it and has been carried quite a bit in my front pocket and shows some wear as to be expected. This little .32 ACP has the potential to be the best gun you have ever owned if you subscribe to the axiom that the best gun that you own is the one that you have with you when you need it. Drop it in your front pocket and it will go unnoticed anywhere that you need be.
I’m not much of a horse trader so I will give a break on the gun as well as the ammo by asking $325 but that price will be firm. If you are not interested in the whole package (I’m not interested in breaking it up) then no problem, but please don’t waste our time by low-balling me. Cash, (CCW preferred) and bill of sale and it’s yours."

Never heard of Buffalo Arms?  They were machine gun manufacturers for the military during WWII.  Their first and only hand gun was the .357 magnum derringer, Model 1, which they made about 10,000 of.  The firearm design is a two shot, single action, single hammer, over/under derringer.  Each time the single hammer is cocked, it automatically alternates between the barrels."

A custom-voiced Ironman precision attenuator and specially tuned speaker cabinets deliver the ""raging stack"" experience - both tone and feel - at any volume, down to true bedroom level. A tube-buffered effects loop helps you get the most out of your effects devices while maintaining signal purity."

Because this weapon does not technically have a stock and is well over 26"" in fixed overall length it is classified as simply a ""firearm"" under the ATF. Heres the link to the letter from the chief of the firearms technology branch of the ATF confirming the legality of firearm.  http://www.franklinarmory.com/XO-26_Letter__c_.pdfSelling my 11.5inch barrel AR with shockwave brace, shockwave adjustable length of pull pistol buffer tube, and thordsen custom cheek rest w/battery tubes. Though it closely resembles a stock it is %100 legal because the pistol brace and cheek rest have been approved for ""pistols"". Also AR pistols cannot have a vertical foregrip on them unless it is over 26"" in overall length which re-classifies it as only a ""firearm"". This firearm is 27.5"" so it is well within the legal boundaries. This allows you to attach any accessory you want and have the functionality of a short barreled rifle without the extra money on a tax stamp, legal paperwork, and many months worth of waiting. And of course since its a ""firearm"" it can be taken across state lines.  The AR was assembled completely by a gunsmith and has had only 50 or 60 rounds out of it, and is completely free of scratches and marks.Comes with one Pmag with magpul floor plate, magpul back up flip up sights, magpul vertical forgrip, M-lok handguard, and one M-lok rail section, and BAD Lever. $1100  (may drop the price if you can meet at an FFL near me and can meet on my strict schedule)Will include Eotech512 Holographic for $400 more.Questions are welcome and i will answer them ASAP."

The ""new model"" or number 40, was the higher grade, with a full trigger guard and adjustable sights. The barrel is just under 18 inches, which makes it a true rifle by definition. This is the longest barrel offered, and the most sought after by collectors. She is chambered in .32 rimfire, and it is an absolute joy to shoot. The front fixed globe and rear folding sights offer several combinations that allow sighting in for several distances. The stock is quickly and easily attached, and bears the gun's serial number. The nickel is just about flawless, but the blue is blotchy and thin, although still smooth. The bore is good, with considerable shine and distinct rifling. The wood is gorgeous, with minor handling marks. All major parts bear the 20661 serial number except the ""butt plate"", which bears a factory error of 20561. One old time Stevens collector told me that this may be a ""Monday gun"", where mistakes were made after a wild weekend. Regardless, if you have been looking for the right Stevens pocket rifle, with the added clout of a long barrel and high condition, then look no further."

I would consider it 99.5% condition. There is a very small scratch on the end cap of the pistol grip.Marlin only made about 1300 of this particular model. It is the MR, meaning it has a 22"" barrel with pistol grip stock. According to Marlin this was one of the first of this caliber produced, the serial number dating it too late to 2002, early 2003 (pre-Remington merger) It also has an interesting serial number. Currently, there isonly one other 1895MR on the market nationally/internationally that I can find, and it's not near this pristine. I'd like to see this go locally, but I will likely be listing on gun broker next week. I have 2 fullboxes Hornady Leverevolution 325gr FTX for an additional $80.Obviously this isn't for everyone.

Only shot at range a few times. Under 100 rounds thorugh gun. Will have original case and extra magazines No other polymer pistol offers the M&P's combination of versatility, durability, and safety. A reinforced polymer chassis, superior ergonomics, ambidextrous controls, and proven safety features combine to make the M&P the new standard in reliability. The improved trigger weight and feel, and unique takedown method set the M&P apart from other modern lightweight pistols. The M&P is made out of Zytel polymer reinforced with a stainless steel chassis and treated with Smith & Wesson's proprietary Melonite nitriding process that produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 68 Rockwell C surface hardness rating. Its very low slide profile holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the M&P more comfortable to shoot by reducing muzzle rise and allowing for faster aim recovery in rapid shooting sequence. The M&P Compact features a white dot front sight and a low-profile carry rear sight. Every M&P comes with three interchangeable palmswell grips. This model has a unique carbon fiber finish. It ships with one standard magazine and one finger rest magazine."
