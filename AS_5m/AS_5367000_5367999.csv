This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm."

Barrel is not threaded for chokes and is marked for 2 3/4"" shells only. This barrel came off a 1973-74 Remington 870 Wingmaster. I got the gun used, but the barrel is a bit beat up - primarily surface rust. Some pitting, but not super deep. Bluing is okay where the rust isn't present. I'm restoring the receiver, bolt and wood, but bought a replacement barrel, so hopefully someone could use this one. Functionally, the barrel is in fine condition. The metal is solid, the chamber portion looks good looks good. No dents/dings - the barrel is straight and true and the bead sight is in good shape.I figure this would be a good knock-around barrel for someone. I know some folks like to 'experiment' with interesting shotgun loads - this would be a good barrel to stand in place of your original barrel. I've done some research and seen barrels with rust, etc. online anywhere from $60-$100.My cash only price is $50, FTF in the Portland Metro area (Vancouver included).

However, it's a perfectly good set of gear and I hate to see it go to waste. The equipment pictured here will let you brew and bottle your own beer and cider. I've made many batches of both, including kolsches, saisons, brown ales, and one memorable jalapeno golden ale. Show up all your friends by pairing venison burgers with your house IPA. Wow your boyfriend by deep-frying bass fillets in homemade beer batter- they'll be so good he'll be doing dishes for weeks out of graditude. I'm interested in a trade for a simple pump, single or double shotgun; alternately, I could let all this go for cash.
