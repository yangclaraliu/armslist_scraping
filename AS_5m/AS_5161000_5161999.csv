We have us here a classic, 3rd gen S&W Model 4506-1, in pristine condition, that I'm putting up fopr sale cuz I needs the money !!I got it less than a year ago in a trade with one of my oldest freinds, who bought it in a gunshop down here maybe a year before that.The pistol is chambered in .45acp, is in nearly new condition, and may have been unfired when my freind bought it. Since then it's had less than 300 rounds through it, and it shoots like a dream !! It's dead-nuts accurate, and 100% reliable with a variety of ammos, including Federal hollow points.As always, I have no problem with a test fire if you have someplace safe and convenient to shoot. The gun is fantastic, guaranteed.It has THREE factory 8rd magazines, and a black leather Bianchi holster. The trigger pull is smooth and clean, but I also have new trigger-play spring and rivet in case that's ever needed. (edit: turns out I have a spare recoil spring,as well!)The pistol has stainless steel frame and slide, with a 5"" barrel, ambidextrous safety/de-cocking levers, Novak sights, and the more desirable rounded trigger guard, versus the squared/hooked guard of earlier models.I've been following Gunbroker sales on these for the last several months, and a extra-clean 4506-1 typically ends up costing the buyer around $700-750, after shipping and transfer, so my valuation is right on the money (especially factoring in the Bianchi holster, 3rd mag, and extra springs).Any interested parties must be legal to own firearms, and a Georgia resident over age 21, with ID. I have my Georgia carry permit, so I'm good to go. Must meet very close to me (as in N. Columbus, or the Chevron on Exit 19 a little north of Columbus).Thanks for looking......M.Trade interests: I'm mostly just needing the cash, but it can't hurt to take a swing, and I'll respond politely to all serious offers (especially those involving cash!).Also, please say something indicating you're a legitimate local buyer, not another scammer. I will not respond to messages asking, ""do you still have the gun"", or, ""send me your contact info"", or, ""when can I view the gun"", etc."

That being said, I'm more than willing to listen to other reasonable trades, including rifles, as long as I can get a good bit of cash with it. Description copied from Sig website: PISTOL, COMPACT, 9MM, M11 Issued to US Naval Aviation and key units in every branch of the Armed Services, the M11 is proud to serve. Upgraded with a stainless steel slide, a Short Reset Trigger and three 15 round flush fit magazines, the M11-A1 variant features the same phosphate coated internals, SIGLITE® night sights and MIL-STD UID label of the standard-issue M11."

I bought a new car and just don't drive it much anymore. It's a 1993 S10 ""Tahoe Edition"" with regular cab and short bed. It has a rebuilt 4.3L V6 with approx. 84K miles on it. Automatic transmission shifts great. Cruise control, It has leather, heated seats and center console that were swapped into it from a 2002 Olds Bravada. It has a new Stereo installed that has a sd card slot, aux input and usb slot. It is also pre-wired for an amp/sub. It has 17"" Toyo wheels with 265/70-16 Studded Mastercraft tires that are almost new. It has a posi rear end and independent suspension in the front. It is set up and wired for 4wd. T-case and all. All you would need to do is pick up a front differential from the junk yard and install it if you wanted to go the 4wd route. It's been well taken care of. Regular Synthetic blend oil changes, recent transmission flush, new alternator and serpentine belt. No leaks. Likes most Chevy's it does consume a little oil. It is a 22 year old truck and does need a few things... A turn signal bulb, one of the windows needs to be put back on track, could use a paint job. It's a great truck and I'm looking to find it a great home. Clean NM title. Asking $2500 OBO. Also considering trades. Perfect trade for me would be an older flat bed trailer and cash, but I'm open to Motorcycles, big boy toys, hot tub, and I'm open to other offers. PLEASE TEXT ME, I get bad reception at my house so I most likely won't answer if you call. Text 505-369-7six96"

It is in very nice condition, and has only minor handling marks. It is the most accurate rifle that I have ever shot, with open sights or with the scope that I have mounted on it (Nikon 3-9x 40mm). It took some doing to get the scope mounted, as the front and rear bases are significantly different heights. The price is $1200 with bases and rings, or $1350 with the scope mounted.The action is exceptionally smooth and non-binding. It is one of the most unique designs for a bolt action rifle that I have seen, as the magazine is located directly above the trigger guard, rather than in-front of it. Thiis allows a 3+1 capacity with an overall length of about 41.5 inches, despite having a full 24"" barrel. It handles and points like a small shotgun, and I am sure that it will make a great target and hunting rifle.I will sell FTF or non-FTF, but the rifle is sold with no warranties expressed or implied. So, if you are located elseware and wish to buy this awesome rifle, it will be sold as-is. Contact for pictures."

The Multi-Level Threat Response System, is a rifle based on the AR-15/M16 Design and fires a 12.5x42mm round that’s been developed from the .50 Action Express (AE) handgun round. The cartridge case on the 12.5x42mm round has gone through a redesign from the .50 AE to enhance reliable feeding and extraction. The Leitner-Wise Mini-.50 currently sports a 16.1 inch barrel, making it civilian-legal. The actual round that you need for this rifle is a .50 Beowulf cartridge. There were very few of these made, before the maker discontinued the design (due to legal reasons in another country) so it is a well sought after firearm that rarely pops up for sale here and there. Well now is your opportunity to get one of these and see just how powerful the .499 really is.This is a brand new rifle, never shot even once before. I am asking for a fair offer on this. There is one at two different gun stores and info on the internet, so I know what they are worth. So if you going to offer a low number to see if I will take it, don’t bother. I am doing my due diligence as promised to the wifey to try and sell it to put toward our vacation, but I personally would be just has happy if it didn’t sell :) I might also be interested in full or partial trades of other firearms (if it is something I need or have been looking for) so do not hesitate to ask. Questions don’t kill, but the answers might! Ha haThank You"
