I bought these about 8 years ago and they were hand-picked by me as the best shooters from 3 crates I went through.  The bores are rust-free with strong rifling, unlike most you will see. Both are Izzy hex receivers and  rearsenaled.In the rear is a 1928r, and in the front a 1933r with factory orange infill on the serial and rear sight. Both are unmodified by me and have matching serials with no force-matching. I was meticulous about cleaning the corrosive residue out after shooting them and they remain in VG-Ex condition. Both also have matching serialed spike bayonets, straight cleaning rods and original slings. Barrels are not counterbored. Stocks are not cracked but the 1933r has two 3"" x 1/4"" arsenal-applied repairs to the very front of the stock that blend pretty well.Also for sale is 273 rounds of 148gr surplus spam can ammo, 29 stripper clips, 15 ammo pouches, 2 oil bottles, 1 oil bottle pouch, and 2 complete cleaning kits.These are good shooters that could maybe only be benefited by a bedding job, and way above average from what you'll find available nowadays. Don't lowball me because you're looking at quality here.For the whole lot, both rifles and everything, $650 cash.For one rifle and all the accessories and ammo, $425For first pick of the two, plus half the ammo, clips, pouches, an oil bottle and cleaning kit, $375If somebody takes first pick, the other rifle and half of the stuff will be $350For just one rifle, sling and bayo, $300 but I will only offer that if this ad doesn't get much interest or somebody takes all the stuff in the other deal."

This gun looks and feels amazing, although there is one minor scratch on it from the previous owner. This was the first 1911 I have owned, I just do not like the gun to be honest. I zeroed it in with a bore sight but still can not seem to hit anything, and the gun seems to rough up my hand more than a modern polymer.

Never mounted or used. Won it at an office party. This is in black and DOES come with the gas block. Will ship.""The Super Modular Rail (SMR) MK4 M-LOK™ is Geissele’s ultra-lightweight M-LOK option. These rails are purpose-built and feature integrated M1913 picatinny rail sections at the fore of the rail in the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions. Maximum venting for heat dissipation also dramatically reduces the rail's overall weight, while maintaining its same strong and rigid platform. Utilizing Magpul's M-LOK technology at the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, as well as the upper 45 quadrants. The SMR MK4 is both versatile and modular, allowing the user to tailor their platform to his or her unique needs. The SMR MK4 also features Geissele's proprietary 2"" long barrel nut. This increases the surface contact where the rail interfaces with the receiver and creates a platform that can be trusted to be straight and true the entire length of the free float rail. This increases accuracy and zero repeatability during disassembly and reassembly when performing maintenance. Bundled with a low-profile Geissele Super Gas Block, a $59 value, the SMR MK4 is not only feature packed, but it is also value packed."""

At the heart of the SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic) is the famous Model 700 action that encloses the cartridge head in 3 rings of steel: the recessed bolt face, the chamber end of the barrel, and the front receiver ring. This design provides inherent strength, while holding the cartridge in precise alignment with the bore for exceptional accuracy. The Model 700's action has been proven for reliability in combat for years with the U.S. Army's M24 sniper rifle. The SPS tactical rifle comes with a Hogue Over-molded stock with a wide, flat fore-end that rests solidly on sand bags or a tactical pack. The Hogue stock has rubber exterior that provides an excellent gripping surface in any type of weather, and is relatively quiet when knocked against objects. The barreled receiver is bedded with dual aluminum pillars, and the heavy-contoured barrel is free-floated, providing excellent accuracy and minimal shift in zero caused by changes in the environment. Barrel and receiver have a non-reflective black oxide finish aiding the shooter in concealment. An externally adjustable X-Mark Pro® trigger allows shooters to find the desired pull according to their preference. The 2-position safety at the rear of the action is quick to operate with the thumb, and can also be gripped with the forefinger and thumb and moved extra quietly to the fire position. The bolt knob has 2-panel checkering for a non-slip hold while cycling the action. The Remington Model 700 SPS Tactical Bolt-Action Rifle has a hinged floorplate for safe and easy unloading of the magazine, and comes drilled and tapped for scope mounts."

The wood is amazing, and the bluing is just as nice. The shotgun has been shot, but taken down and stored properly, and is now out for that centerpiece on your wall or man cave. The shotgun is truly is a piece of art, and even better was engraved by Watrin himself. This beautiful Superposed Pointer Grade was engraved by the Chief FN engraver Andre Watrin or Andre's Wife who was also an employed Engraver at FN. Felix Funken the master engraver since 1926 retired from FN in 1960.

Up for grabs is a pristine, unfired, new in the box VZ2008 with folding stock along with a cleaning kit & pouch, sling, mag pouch, and 4 brand new magazines. The build quality on these is very good, with a nice fit & finish on both the original Czech parts and the 922r compliant parts. If you’re unfamiliar with the VZ2008, it fires the same 7.62x39mm round as the AK, SKS, and Ruger Mini-30. They look very similar to the AK but are a definite improvement in terms of weight and recoil, and have much better ergonomics with updated features like smaller, easier to operate safety lever, a bolt hold open, etc. The receiver is milled, not stamped like many AKs. It's a great gun but after having it in hand I decided the design wasn’t for me (most of my rifles are older Garand or SKS style guns). Currently these are sold out pretty much everywhere (J&G Sales has a version with wood furniture going for $1,299 for just the gun and one mag) but I’m not looking to make a ton of money and feel my asking price is very fair. Mainly I’m looking to get out of the deal close to what I put in and make some room in my safe. The price is $600, cash only - not really looking for trades. Please be near the Ann Arbor/Saline area or willing to meet there. Purchaser will have to fill out a basic bill of sale. Nothing fancy - just your name, phone number, and a signature stating that you are legally permitted to own this weapon. I am willing to ship to any FFL01 holder in the lower 48 states if you pay for shipping. If you have any questions just let me know. Thanks for looking!"

I have loved using it on a LWRC REPR I had but I need the cash more right now. The Specter is very easy to zero and it maintains zero even better. I have used Aimpoint red dots, EOTech holographs, Trijicon ACOGs, and many other types of military grade optics in my time. That being said, the Elcan is the best of all those optics put into one package. Great glass, easy to see red dot, great field of view, and the ability to switch between a true 1x and then 4x for some finer detail work is truly something you will only find in this optic. I have used a fixed power Elcan scope on a M240B machine gun and I can testify to Elcan's superiority in military grade optics. The scope comes with the original box and manual.
