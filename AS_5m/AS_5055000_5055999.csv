I sent a parts kit to Liberty Suppressors 3 years ago to build one of their famous Leonidas suppressors.

It sat in my safe for 2 moves, so it's time to go... It's unfired and never been to the range, except perhaps by Liberty during the build. It's been in my safe and had optics mounted on it, so there are minor handling marks... This does require a registered SBR or pistol lower, as the barrel length is 8""...

I have a large tub full of wads and hulls for 12-20-410 loading. Not too many 410's though. Mostly 12 and 20. Also I will throw in lead, steel and bismuth shot, a jug of powder and primers. I also have a bunch of spare parts for these machines. 

These are set up and ready to load, and I will show you how each of them works. You can start loading the day you buy this set up.

Shoot me an email if you have any questions or want to make an offer, or if you want to come and see these reloaders.

This brand of stock is no longer produced by ATI, which is unfortunate, because it's a nice one. In addition to reducing the overall length of the original carbine by 1 inch, this stock is known for being robust and solid. This stock has been altered from the original by having the cross bar mold between the buttstock and pistol grip removed. This cross piece would block the right wrist from reaching the safety lever. With the pistol grip no longer restricted by the cross piece, a rubber grip was installed, which will come included. This model of ATI stock, unlike another model, came with a system of rail attachments. The top rail allows for the addition of red dot, optical and back up sights, while the bottom rail allows for the attachment of lasers, lights, bipods or foregrips. Two side rails--mounted on both right and left side (left side not shown in photo) allow for additional attachments of weaver sling mounts, lights, and other attachments. If you are looking for a rare piece of Hi Point firearm history that will add real ""bling"" to your 9mm carbine, while offering a host of additional functional attachment points, this is the stock for you. Prefer a face to face sale at the moment in North Central Mississippi. If I change my mind and list it for shipping, I'll alter this ad to indicate that in the future. Asking $125 OBO"

If you check out the Mosin Nagant web sites you will find that this is an extremely rare find as far as Mosins go. Very few Soviet Mosins came with the splice in the stock. I have seen these go for $900.00. Note the quality in craftsmanship with the splice. This is Pre war, and the detail in overall craftsmanship is amazing ! If you are used to seeing 1941-1944 Mosins including the Ismash models you will be impressed with this model. Weapon has matching #'s. Comes with bayonet, (not matching #). Includes strap, pouches, oil can. This is a true collector item that is a must have for the serious collector. You will notice the metal is not all chewed up from speed grinding to get it into combat quickly. Also the escutcheons are real steel, seated perfectly, even the screws are uniformly centered  in the escutcheons  for the strap. They are not cheap tin, or missing altogether. Rifle also has HEX receiver.                     PLEASE NO TEXTS! Email only! Enjoy!"

The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight. Compatibility: Weapons using AR-15 Mil-Spec style Fire Control Groups This product ATF Approved and can be mailed."
