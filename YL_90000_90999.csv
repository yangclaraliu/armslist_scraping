Chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO (223 Rem.), the FN FS2000 Series are semi-auto only variants of the proven F2000 selective-fire bullpup carbines. The FS2000 Tactical offers an integrated MIL-STD 1913 top mounting rail and emergency backup folding sights. The FS2000 carbines are gas operated and use a rotating bolt lockup for reliability and greater accuracy. Both variants have 17.44"" cold hammer-forged MIL -SPEC barrels and muzzle brakes. Fired cases are ejected through a forward port away from the operator. Models with 10- or 30-round detachable box magazines (DBM) are available. The polymer stock is fully-ambidextrous.

...This rifle has only had around 200 rounds through it (one good range sesssion), and has been exceptional.  I am only looking to see what else is out there and try new things.  This is an exceptional rifle that has a barrel longer than an M-4 to keep great ballistics yet the whole rifle is under 30"".  Points like a dream, shoots more accurate than me, not to mention it looks like a Halo gun and will turn heads wherever you shoot it.  Included is 5 30-round magazines."

And, I'm including a barely used BRW S1 magazine ($45 new) in place of the original 5 rounder it came with.

The fiberglass stock had been given a crude camo job by the first owner, so I painted the stock and handguard an Olive Drab green. Comes with box & papers, USGI fiberglass stock, and one BRW S1 20-round mag. The E2 stock in the photo is available for an extra $150.

Lyman rear sight appears to have some reasonable value of its' own as I've found them online for around $100 alone.  Barrel needs re-blueing.  Action works fine.  Some of the 1903's had a safety concern when firing them, but this s/n is outside that range.  My son inherited this gun and wants a modern firearm instead.  He's got this piece along with a Model 10-A Remington pump 12ga shotgun from 1927 if you're interested in a package deal for as long as both are still available.  Note: this update reflects a price increase from my original post.  This gun garnered so much interest, we quickly realized we were well under-priced against it's value."

Well, I bought two Hakims over the past two months, haven't had opportunity to shoot either yet, but I just got slammed by an unexpected bill so I'm going to put one of them up for sale.

I purchased this Hakim for $550.  Rifle is presented as functional in very good condition. Bore and gas tube look good. No problems feeding or extracting snap caps. This is a semi-automatic rifle that fires the 8mm mauser round from a detachable magazine, although stripper clips work well in these.

The Hakim comes standard with a 10 rd box magazine, although aftermarket 20 and 25 rd mags can be found on gunbroker. MG-13 magazines can be altered to fit the Hakim (tutorials available online).

Following caveats apply to all Hakims:

1. Never run Turkish ammunition through these as it is loaded way too hot. Yugo, Romy, and FN are fine.

2. American 8mm ammo isn't loaded hot enough to cycle a Hakim properly, although the gas flow can be adjusted to help with that.

3. Make certain the safety is switched ON if your fingers are going anywhere between the bolt and chamber, as that bolt can fly forward with considerable force.

This is a great rifle, but I have two and could use the extra cash.

Priced to sell at a hundred less than I paid for it at $450.  TRADE PENDING

Not really interested in trades, but might be interested in a 8mm Mauser + cash.  Sporterized Mausers are fine.  8mm only."

FOR LAST TIME WHOLE PACKAGE FOR JUST $1825.00
Up for sale like new (it was shot approx.100 rds only) hard to find Armalite AR-10T 2010 Shot Show Special carbine.It has 16"" stainless barrel. It is very unusual for Armalite to make their AR-10T models with 16""barrel.Thats why they made very limited run of these. The only thing i did to the rifle, i changed regular A2 stick with Magpul PRS stock. Also there Harris style bipod, Original Armalite rings, 3 Picatini rails installed and S&W Performance Optics 6-24x42 long range scope. S&W scopes are very nice middle range class scopes. MSRP was $619,but i bought it new for $250.
Since rifle was used for 100 rds i will take off the price $100.
So here is what is included:
Armalite AR-10 rifle $1500.
Armalite rings $50 ($30off)
S&W scope $225
Bipod $50
Magpul stock $200($25off)
Trigger is Armalite 2 stage original.
1-5rd and 1-20rd mag is included
Butler creek scope covers free
Picatini rails free($80)
Also all paperwork and letter from Armalite included.
By the way you can see from pictures Letter from Armalite stating this is limited run gun.

I will also concider trades:
Springfield TRP or micro series 
Custom 1911

The metal is in very good shape, and there are just a few small marks in the wood. Better than 90% of the original finish is still there.

The receiver is case hardened, so it has the beautiful colors. This example really is exceptional as far as the coloring goes. Serial number indicates it was manufactured in 1980, so it's a ""real"" Harrington & Richardson. This shotgun is in much better shape than most of the shotguns you see in this price range.

It is a break action, single shot, 12 gauge, and it has a fixed full choke and a functional external hammer.  It has a 3"" chamber, and the barrel is 30"" long.

This gun has never been chambered or fired, and was removed from case only for inspection. Please let me know if you have any questions."

Posted this last fall and had so many emails with crazy lowball offers I did not even respond to them. Yes I know you can buy a used DPMS a little cheaper, but you get what you pay for. DPMS, Olympic Arms, Bushmaster and many others = high volume, low quality. The Smith & Wesson is one of the best quality AR's made today.
Will sell FTF to legal WI resident for $900.00 Firm.
Thank you."

I am selling my beautiful condition Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II 4"" with black sights and Kimber Logo Crimson Trace Laser Grips. This gun is immaculate with zero handling marks. As evidenced by its looks, it has only had a couple of boxes of copper jacketed ammo through it (no lead or reloads). You will really see and appreciate it's pristine condition if you examine it in person. For what little is has been shot, the gun ran flawless with its original mag and is HIGHLY accurate. It shoots exactly to laser and iron sights point-of-aim.

It comes with the original serialized case, original Kimber mag, original FP-10 oil bubble and take-down tool, supplied chamber flag, all manuals and supplied paperwork, Crimson Trace manual, laser lens cleaning daubers (unused) and laser adjustment tools. I've used the gun as a show-and-tell for the laser in 3 CC classes. I don't use the gun and need the room and money so it has to go.

I'm asking $875.00 FTF in the Winfield / Mulvane area. Shipping to your dealer is actual cost. First person with cash gets it. No saves or post dated checks please. I will ask you to verify your residency by showing a Kansas DL. I will reciprocate. No bill of sale req. Not interested in trades and please, no low-ball calls or offers.

I know what it's worth, and I won't give it away. I will entertain trade offers of equal value, or ones in which you add cash. I will also consider multiple firearm trades. I apologize up front for coming across so pointed, however I have had numerous offers for firearms here that are an insult and complete waste of my time. Thank you for looking. UPDATE.....I have already received several offers for 350, 400 dollars, and trade offers that are valued at 400 wanting to trade even up. That is not going to happen. This rifle is pre-safety, making it worth 100-200 more than the newer ones. The newer ones sell for 6-700 dollars. I'm not in the business of giving my things away, so please keep that in mind when making an offer. Thanks for looking."

Full choke (not changeable).  Works great and I've never had a jam or misfire with it. Used lightly (maybe a couple dozen pheasant hunting mornings) and haven't used it at all since 1995 (took it out and shot a couple rounds of skeet in 2000?, but nothing else). I originally purchased it in 1990 at a gunshow in Iowa, so not certain what the original manufacture date is. Always cleaned and oiled after every outing.

Here's a video showing the condition of the gun. Make sure you select ""720"" in the video quality to get the best image:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvme0SIJVF4

I think it's in pretty good shape. There are a couple of nicks and scratches on the stock which you can see in the video. Also, there is some discoloration on a small patch of the right side metal that I point out in the video. I call it ""corrosion"" but its not that- the metal surface is perfectly smooth, so it's not rust, it more a cosmetic blemish in the bluing- if that's the right word? It's not noticeable unless you're within about 12 inches of the surface, but wanted to be upfront about it.

I will also include the soft case that I've always stored it in. The inside is a man-made lambswool substance, the outside is green cordura with a nylon zipper. The zipper was a bit stiff and could probably use some lubricant (or maybe it will loosen up with some repeated use).

Also will include a blaze hunting vest, size XL with a game pocket in back . It's a very basic model, but get's the job done. I don't have the model or design right now, but let me know if it's important to you and I'll dig it out.

Would like to get $350 for everything. Cash only and would prefer to have a local transaction to avoid the hassles of shipping.

Let me know if you have any questions."

I have an early Gen 3 (some say Generation 2.5) Glock 27 (.40 cal) subcompact that comes with an aftermarket .357 sig barrel (stainless steel) that gives you two guns in one (because the .357 sig rounds fit in the same mags as the .40's.  All you do is swap the barrels. 

I have 3 9-Round mags and a ban era 10-Round mag (that sticks out of the bottom) that I have left over from another Glock that is the same size as the 13 round mags.  And I have the magazine speed loader for them.  One 9-Round mag has a grip extension.  

I don't have the box or manual, but I did buy it brand new.  It is in very good condition with only about 200 to 250 rounds fired through the gun using both barrels.  There is only one single flaw.  The plastic sight post got bumped and is not perfectly square.  The white dot is perfectly round and untouched, but the right side of the sight is ever so slightly imperfect.  I have never cared enough to bother changing it out, but if I were, I'd get a night sight.  I do have a small padded case to keep the gun and extra barrel in.  

I also have a Galco black leather 3-slot holster in excellent condition that you can read about at this link: 

http://www.usgalco.com/HolsterPG3.asp?ProductID=2330&GunID=51  

I have only used the holster a few times and then went to a Fobus.  It's yours free if you buy the gun.

Great gun.  Having two barrels gives you twice the fun.  But I want something better than my Kel Tec P32 and smaller than this to carry on a regular basis.  

Its up for LOCAL SALE only.  I'll drive 1/2 way to you if you're not too far away.

This gun was very accurate from the factory, but this gun is even better. It has been glass bedded and target crowned. Groups well under an inch are possible with this gun with the right shooter pulling the trigger. I have owned and still own many Abolts and this is probably about the most accurate I've had. It comes with weaver style bases. This gun also has the signature golden Browning trigger and removable box magazine. The only reason I'm asking $450 on it and not $550 is because there are a few spots where the bluing is starting to come off toward the end of the barrel, as you can see in the second picture. Not really sure what caused it, but they really aren't bad and of course don't affect the functionality or accuracy at all. I had planned on just re-bluing the gun and keeping it because it does shoot so well, but unfortunately I just lost my job and need to move some of my guns. As always, all trades will be considered but cash is preferred. Anyone interested can email me or text/call me at REDACTED.

So he purchased this one, however it is several inches longer than the one he fell in love with.  It also holds a total of 18 rounds instead of the standard 14 that he shot.  Consequently it is too heavy for him to hold up.

I did a bit of research and this is a bit of a rare model.  You usually had a pick of one or two of the features, but rare to find all of them together as there were not many factory made like this:

-  The feed tube is the full length of the barrel.
-  It holds 18 shots instead of the standard 14 (Prior to the New Jersey 15 rd max capacity law)
-  It has the additional bolt behind the trigger guard making it more sturdy and rigid that subsequent models.  
-  It has the ""last shot hold open"" that not all models have.
-  The longest barrel produced at 22"" with an overall length of 41""
-  Microgroove Technology.

...This rifle has only had around 200 rounds through it (one good range session), and has been exceptional.  I am only looking to see what else is out there and try new things.  This is an exceptional rifle that has a barrel longer than an M-4 to keep great ballistics yet the whole rifle is under 30"".  Points like a dream, shoots more accurate than me, not to mention it looks like a Halo gun and will turn heads wherever you shoot it.  Included is 5 30-round magazines.  First offer of 1800 takes the whole deal!"

It is rare to find this in .45 ACP -- you can find the .38 special and .357 magnum on gunbroker or auctionarms sometimes, but they didn't make as many of the 45.  You will not see these at Tanner.

The ONLY reason I'm getting rid of these is because I sold my 45 last year and just found these rounds in a ziplock bag in the back of the safe.  They are in excellent condition with no corrosion or discoloration.
