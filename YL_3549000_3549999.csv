When I bought this it had these grips on it. I didn't think they were original so I put a set of plain Victory model grips on. Later I realized that these are the original grips because some of these guns made for the U.S. (not Lend Lease) had this style grips. So I put these grips back on and I'm listing it again.

Up for sale is a Smith and Wesson M&P 10 semi-automatic rifle.  This military/law enforcement version features Magpul furniture and Troy iron sights.  Also included are three 20 round Magpul magazines (the one that came with the rifle, and two gen M3 mags).  The rifle has sent 300 rounds down range to get broken in, and it is in like new condition.  The scope pictured (a Leupold Mark AR Mod 1 4-12x40mm mil dot w/ Rock River Arms rings) is NOT included in the $1300 price.  If you want the rifle and scope, the total price is $1700.

This is an awesome rifle, and it's very lightweight and manageable for a .308.  I just cannot afford to stock multiple calibers at this point in time.

(KAC) M4 RAS Quad Rail [NSN# 1005-01-452-3527 :  ADAPTER RAIL: WEAPON MOUNTED (M4 RAS)].

It is slightly used but in very good condition, I just have an extra I got as part of a package deal. The rails and entire handguard are in excellent condition dimensionally, with no damage whatsoever save a couple minor scrape marks which do not penetrate the anodizing. These things are no joke, they'll take whatever you can throw at them. The 3 full-length rail covers shown in the photos ARE included. Here's your opportunity to get the setup KAC charges $350 for a huge savings. If the buyer wishes, they can bring their rifle along to pick it up and I'll install it no charge.

From http://shop.knightarmco.com/ProductDetails.aspx?ProductID=KM98064
The KAC M4 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military's M4 Carbine, and with over 1 million rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M4 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories. Includes three KAC 11 Rib Rail Panels. 
Length: 6.25""
Weight: 8.9 oz
Free Float: No
Material: Aluminum
Finish: Black Anodizing

I will also offer the buyer the OPTION to purchase for an additional $25 a brand new complete 10-piece KAC rail cover kit. These are slide-on panels with a spring-clip lock (similar to Troy Battle Covers but more durable). They are really solid but still comfortable. They come in a roll-up, tie-shut case with 7 pockets to store the covers. Includes 4x 11-Rib (covers 15 slots - 6.15""), 2x 6-Rib (covers 9 slots -3.90""), 2x 4-Rib (covers 6 slots - 2.65""), and 2x 2-Rib (covers 4 slots - 1.65"") covers. These have never been used.

Will meet within 15 miles of 45054 (which is halfway for most of the Cincy / Dayton area) or ship actual cost on your dime. Thanks for looking, see my other listings for ammo, AR-15 parts, 1911 parts, other firearm accessories, etc."

It was beat to hell, the barrel was rusted up and the action wouldn't open. But after soaking it in some break away it popped open fine. Next I tore the gun completely apart and roughed up all the rust I could and neutralized it with baking soda, then heating the barrel up I then soaked it in motor oil. ( also known as the browning process). So now the barrel is a pretty cool dark brown antique color, instead of blued steel.( you can see the brown and blue in one of my pics bec the bottom wasn't rusted) Next the stock and foreend were sanded down smooth and stained a much darker color. Then I cut the barrel down, not a hack job either I used a pipe cutter unlike most who just use a hack saw.

The barrel measures 19 7/8"" which is way over the legal length minimum of 18.5"" in MI. Best part is this can handle 3"" loads so would be a great home defense gun, or for rabbits in tight brush like I was using it. With 6 shot I was knocking rabbits around out to 40+ yards. Ive also shot slugs out of it and surprisingly it does decent at 20-30yds without a front bead. ( never got around to welding one on)

The sling is just an old belt I screwed into the stock. Gun functions great, and ejects shells good.

The pistol comes with the original factory plastic box, serial-numbered to the gun, and with a factory plastic holster, mag holder, cleaning rod, and manual (no extra magazines, however). This engraved Springfield Armory 1911 looks just like an engraved Colt, the only real difference is the price, which is quite a bit less than what a similarly-engraved Colt would sell for!...."

NO SHIPPING!!  NO SHIPPING!!   For local pick-up only.  This is a real Spas 12, one of 1,850 that were imported into the U.S during the 1980's.  This shotgun functions in both Semi-auto and pump action, and has a very aggressive look to it.  Featured in many popular video games and movies.

This particular Spas 12 was made in 1982, according to the stamp on the receiver....making it one of the first to arrive into the U.S.  This shotgun needs to be refinished, due to improper storage of the previous owners.  According to the last owner...this shotgun was an ex-swat team unit firearm.   One side of the Shotgun has some surface rusting on areas.....the other side is near perfect.   The gun seems to function properly.....and the receiver shock absorber looks to be in great shape.  (Which is very important on these particular shotguns)   The gun also has some nicks on the outside of the receiver from where it was attached to the underside of a squad car trunk.   Like I said, the gun seems to function properly, it just needs some cosmetic touch ups.

This shotgun has the very desirable folding metal stock, with the shepherds hook!   It also has the extended shell tube.   The shotgun will come with a hard-shell plastic case as well.   Please do your research on this shotgun before considering purchase.   They are pretty complicated as far as shotguns go....so its best that you know what your getting yourself into.

Price is absolutely FIRM at $750.   I will not take a penny less....and if you ask, I will not return your email.   NO TRADES, NO SHIPPING.   This is a cash only sale, and the shotgun must be picked up locally.  Will meet in the town of Harrison 48625 or Clare 48617.   $750 FIRM.   Will send more photos to serious buyers only.   Thanks"

The whole thing is topped with my favorite reasonably-priced optic, the Bushnell Illuminated 1x/2x Red/Green Dot MP Scope. Ok it’s not a Trijicon (and you are not spending thousands), but it sure looks really awesome, has elevation and windage adjustments, intensity dial, and even a 3-dot iron sight in case your battery goes dead!. This setup is what I carry most often and I really enjoy all types of shooting with it. It does everything well, is lightweight, sturdy, and performs as well for short or longer ranges. It is a great gun for all-around use.
