Please look at pictures. You will get every thing in each picture. I think I have maybe some more mags that will go with them if I can find them. I got these kits back in the 1990's. I would buy one if there wasn't anything else to buy at a gun show just so I wouldn't go home empty handed. They were cheep then. I have seen these kit for sale between 300 and 450. Which I think is crazy.  At 250 apiece you could keep some and maybe sale some to get your money back. I had one for sale on here but took it down after finding the rest of them. I will trade for single action revolvers only. The only double action revolvers would be 1917 colt or S&W same model cash either way depending on the deal. There are some states that have banns on mags and parts of this kind so please don't ask me to send them there. Payment would be postal money order, bank checks or personal check. If paying with a check I will wait to send item till check clears clears and clears again before sending item. Thanks Bob"

It runs on gasoline and/or LPG (Liquid Propane Gas) like you would use to power up your propane grill in the backyard. This unit was bought new last year in the early summer, and used once at a tent revival to power up the lights and the sound equipment. It ran all day and into the evening without a hiccup. It comes with the original paperwork, manuals, extra keys (it is an electric start but also had a rope start for back-up), and all kinds of electrical adaptors. If you are going to shop around to see what this unit is worth or costs to buy, please be fair and research the DUAL FUEL generators. A ""gasoline only"" model can look exactly like this and be cheaper to buy new or used. Duel fuel expands your options in an emergency scenario and costs more to produce and buy. I am asking $800 cash for this generator, or will consider trades or trades plus cash. I can text you pictures if you want to see more detail."

The P22 is a 3/4-size rimfire rendition of the famous Walther P99 center-fire pistol.
FEATURES:
Actions: This Walther is a HAMMER-Fired pistol and enables both Double Action and Single Action firing for all types of shooting fun.   The External Hammer easily pulls back for convenient shooting.  Trigger pulls for Double Action and Single Action firing are excellent.  Nice, crisp trigger break!
Ergonomics: great for shooting!  Sculpted and stippled grip is well designed to allow virtually any size hand to be able to control the pistol.   Hooked front on the trigger guard, providing a nice place for the offhand index finger.   Comfortable for large and small shooters alike.
Safeties: Slide-mounted safety on both sides that blocks the firing pin so the hammer can be manually lowered safely. It also has a magazine disconnect safety so the gun won’t fire without the magazine inserted and a paddle-style magazine release that can be used by right- or left-handed shooters.
Magazine is constructed of stainless steel with a polymer follower and bump pad. 10-shot capacity.
Very handy ambidextrous magazine release located at the bottom rear of the trigger guard.
Sights: ramp front sight with a white dot pressed into the slide and a polymer rear sight adjustable for windage with two white dots. Excellent sighting as there is plenty of light between the front sight blade and the rear sight.
Picatinny accessory rail for the mounting of lights, lasers and other accessories.
Low recoil make it easy for anyone to shoot.
Accuracy: I shot great with bulk ammo and even better with CCI Velocitor and Winchester Power Points.
Includes factory case and paperwork."

That being said, I rarely have time to shoot it anymore, and also I don't have a whole lot of space for it. It appears the previous owner had tried to modify the sights by removing the front sight's ""ears"" as well as the long range rear sights. It does still have the original peep sight and front sight so its still shootable. Looking to sell, just send me an offer if you're interested or if you have any questions."
