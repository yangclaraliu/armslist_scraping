Grease gun conversion lower, grease gun mags and loader: The conversion allows for the use of unmodified M3 mags (30 round) in the conversion lower.

The conversion involves some material removal on the upper. This does no impair the functioning of the original lower which will be included.

There is an upper rail installed and an additional forearm rail to install in a location of your choice. In addition to several M3 (grease gun) mags, a loader is also included.

If you are not willing to accept trades, please do not make the listing as a For Sale/Trade listing! It is very MISLEADING and and I am going to encourage all potential customers who were looking to make a trade to flag these listings for misleading or otherwise untruthful information. Sure, it gets people to view the ad, but for those who would rather trade their firearm than outright buy one, it is a waste of time and very frustrating. I don't mean to come off as rude or anything of the sort, but if your aren't looking to trade, then put FOR SALE ONLY. You literally have to go out of your way to hit the drop down and manually select the For Sale/Trade option, so you know what you are doing. It is intentional.
Namely, right now there is a Sig Sauer P220R and a Kimber Covert II that are setup this way. Stop doing this guys, a lot of us would greatly appreciate it. Thank you and have a nice day!"

The Grizzly is Serial Number #400. That is number 400 out of 500 exactly. The stainless steel Colt Grizzly was manufactured in 1994, another limited production .357 Magnum revolver of the many made by Colt in the 80’s and 90’s. It used a Python barrel with a Colt King Cobra frame. All 500 of these had 6-inch Magna-Ported barrels and smooth, unfluted cylinders. The ported barrel includes a bear footprint, which you can see in several of the photos. I’m starting this at a penny with a very reasonable reserve price. As for this firearm it is in NIB condition unfired except from Colt. There are hundreds of great things I can say about this firearm but I believe you already know all about those!  The case is original, and has a colt tag just for identifying the firearm in the safe. The plastic bag and paperwork are original too. There is a faint dragline viewable in the photos. Additionally, there are some very faint hairline scratches in the stainless finish, nothing of any measurable depth."

It is currently my EDC, but I recently acquired another Glock 19 (gen 3) and considering parting with this one if the offer is right. At this time I'd rather trade for something of similar size and capacity, but offer away. Worst I can say is ""No thanks, not interested."" I'm very easy going so don't hesitate to let me know what you have. **I understand this is no $1000 dollar pistol, but I will ignore the $400 offers simply because of its condition and overall value. While it is not brand new, between the pistol, sights, and laser, it's value is around $900. THAT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECT TO GET, but it is why I won't sell it for the price of some SR9 or Sigma, or things of that nature. And don't even tell me I can keep my laser or sights because they don't fit the Gen 3, therefore I will have no use or want for them at that point. Also, the barrel in the pictures is not the stock barrel, but the original will be going back in. The nickel one in the pictures is from my NiB-X Gen 3 and is serialized for that pistol.**
So now, onto the firearm itself. It was purchased brand new by me about 4 years or so ago if I remember correctly. I've put around 800 or so rounds through her, and cleaned her after every range visit and periodically to keep lint buildup out of it. Slide and frame finish are basically immaculate. It currently has Trijicon Night Sights installed and a Crimson Trace laser grip. I have the OEM sights still and the 2 additional back straps that came with it. I have the original case and paper work with spent casing, and the 3 mags. Because I have my other 19, I am going to be keeping my hoster. It's nothing special anyway. 
I also have the paperwork and box for the CT grip with cleaning tips and allens for adjusting windage and elevation, as well as the OEM pin that the CT replaces in the grip. In short, I have everything needed in case you wanted to return it completely to stock. I have never done any trigger work or springs or anything, and never had a failure in any way. The only thing I did was the paint in the engravings to add a bit of contrast. Any questions, feel free to email me! 
**If you are over an hour away, I would like to try and meet somewhere relative to the halfway point between us. No shipping, PA residents preferred,  and face to face only."

It used a Python barrel with a Colt King Cobra frame. All 500 of these had 6-inch Magna-Ported barrels and smooth, unfluted cylinders. The ported barrel includes a bear footprint, which you can see in several of the photos. I’m starting this at a penny with a very reasonable reserve price. As for this firearm it is in NIB condition unfired except from Colt. There are hundreds of great things I can say about this firearm but I believe you already know all about those! The case is original, and has a colt tag just for identifying the firearm in the safe. The plastic bag and paperwork are original too. There is a faint dragline viewable in the photos. Additionally, there are some very faint hairline scratches in the stainless finish, nothing of any measurable depth."

Stippled grip.

I bought this about 3 months ago along with 1000 rounds of 9mm ammo to practice with. My intent was to start shooting competitions. But this grip is just too small for my hands and as a result I keep shooting low and to the left. A friend of mine that shoots IDPA with a G34 can shoot the bullseye out with this gun , so it's not the gun it's me.

I want to sell it and get the Glock 41 or a Ruger 22/45 Lite that I can add a Tac-lite or Volquartsen receiver to. I would be willing to work out a 
trade for either or both. 

I've put about 300 rounds through it. No scratches, dings, blemishes, failure to feed or failure to fire.

I also have 700 rounds of 9mm target ammo that I would like to sell with it.

$650 for the G34 and $150 for the ammo. That's 21 cents a round. Or $750 for both.

The gun will come with 2 16rd LE clips, a FOBUS holster, and the tan soft carrying case.

Used tan USP's like this go for around $800-1000 and are considered rare. The tan carrying case alone ranges from $75.00-150.00. 

The only issues with the gun are superficial- a very small piece of the grip tape is missing and the paint on the extractor is coming off (common with some handguns). If you call HK, they will supposedly send you a new extractor. Or you can pay $35 for both new grip tape and a extractor."

Description from Crye,

The AirFrame™ ballistic helmet sets new standards in protection, comfort, and modularity. Complete AirFrame™ helmets weigh less than complete ACH 2002 helmets while providing more coverage area. The AirFrame™ was developed with a mandate to dramatically reduce headborne weight while exceeding common frag threats. A complete medium AirFrame™ helmet weighs only 2.30 lbs, and the large weighs a mere 2.55 lbs. The unique overlapping shell design of the AirFrame™ creates an integrated vent that provides passive cooling and can reduce the damaging effects of explosive blast waves. Each AirFrame™ helmet features an Ops-Core® H-Nape Head-Loc™ retention system for unmatched stability, comfort, and ease of adjustment. All helmets and components are compatible with common ear-pro systems like Peltors® and Sordins®. Made in the US from US materials.

Here is a gun your likely to never see. A custom ruger super redhawk from magnaport custom. Caliber is 44 magnum 6 shot. Magnaport cut the barrel to 4.8 inches recrowned it and did there  famous trapezoidal porting on the barrel. It has 2 ports which are unique in their design and only used by magnaport. They polished the ruger warning label off re etched the ruger and super redhawk name and added their magnaport custom logo. 
 They also installed a brand new freedom arms front sight base and front sight blade (all black front sight) and a new rear adjustable sight(freedom arms is a custom gunmaking outfit in wyoming producing the highest quality single actions ever made). The wait time was ten months and almost 700 in custom work. Simply put this is the softest shooting 44 magnum out there. Their porting and custom work is second to none. Ruger only offers the super redhawk in 7.5 and 9.5 barrel lengths plus their snubby alaskan model so this ruger is shorter lighter and still legal to hunt with and could be scoped if desired. I absolutely love this gun but its to heavy and bulky for a carry gun for my liking and I've moved on to a lever action 44 for my deer hunting so this gun is a safe queen. The gun was made in 2007 and started life with a 9.5 inch barrel before I had magnaport do their custom work. At 1000 dollars asking price this is one heck of a deal just check magnaports website for pricing and wait times and you will understand how much money and time was invested in this beautiful revolver. Comes with original box and rugers scope rings that were supplied with the gun. Please do not waste my time playing games or lowballing me my price is firm this is a one of a kind custom gun. I will send pictures via email but please don't waste my time if your not legitimately interested in this unique revolver. Only trade interest is a NIB  smith 629 performace center snubnose.

For those not familiar with this pistol it is a solid milled steel military handgun with a chrome barrel and SA/DA action.
1968 model with rounded hammer for snagless drawing. Comes with two mags, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I ground down the finger rest on the non-matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady XTP defense rounds.
The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is much more hard wearing and corrosion resistant than the original blueing. This was done about a month ago by FTW Coatings here in town.
Would like to trade for a quality pocket .380 or snub .38 revolver. Would be interested in a S&W BODYGUARD .380 or .38, but will consider other pocket sized similar pistols.
Otherwise will sell for 300 FIRM. I have 450 in this pistol from the pistol purchase and cerakoting service, so I will not go any lower.
I can also include a set of custom walnut grips for additional cost or higher value trade (see last picture).

Beretta CX4 Storm
 Description

The Beretta CX4 Storm is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. The gun is the civilian version of the Beretta Mx4 Storm and is one of two rifles offered by Beretta. Beretta recommends the gun for sporting and personal defense.

The CX4 Storm features a blowback operating system, so the expanding gases that push a round through the barrel also push back onto the bolt to cycle the action. 

Features include an ambidextrous controls. The CX4 Storm utilizes a front sight adjustable for windage and elevation with a rear sight that includes long and short range apertures of 50 and 100 meters. And both sights can fold down. However, the carbine is also equipped with a Picatinny rail, which allows for easy mounting of optics and accessories.

The Beretta CX4 Storm semiautomatic carbine is a sporting or personal-defense firearm with a blowback-type locking system. The bolt safety ensures reliability, great stability and precision for a follow-up shot. The extractor, the ejector and the cocking handle are easily reversible for right- and left-hand use. The manual safety button and the magazine release button can also be reversed from one side to the other. The chrome-lined cold hammer-forged barrel is made of high resistance steel for maximum resistance to corrosion and increased barrel life. Adjustable stock is constructed of advanced technopolymers shaped with modern ergonomic lines and rounded forms for snag-free handling and rapid shouldering and aiming. Stock spacers (one included) allow you to lengthen the stock."

The barrel is marked ""custom built for Grady Jennings, norwood no. 462 30 gibbs"". The custom stock has very nice wood grain. Initial hand loads shot MOA. With load development this could be a 1/2"" rifle. As far as condition goes the rifle is in fair to good shape. It has been hunted with and has a few battle scars here and there but I would consider it pretty good for a gun of its age. The vintage scope and mount has to be one of the neatest I have seen in a while. Its a Bausch & lomb Balvar 8A with complete original mount. Im listing this rifle for a friend so I knew nothing about the scope. After a little research I found that its a 2.5-8X first focal plane optic, it was about the best that could be had in its day and is worth about half the asking price of the rifle complete with its mount. 
I dont really know much else to say about the rifle. All questions will be forwarded to the owner and answered as soon as possible.

 Remington model Sportsmans 12 Auto chambered in 12 Gauge. The gun comes as pictured with the installed choke (IM) with no accessories, but does ship with a hard case (used). I do not have any information on the number of rounds through the gun, but the previous owner used it for trap shooting, and he said he only put a ""couple hundred"" rounds through it. that is the only information I have. It has had a lot of work done to it as you can see, including: Custom chrome finish on the receiver, and chrome flame highlights on both sides of the barrels, carbon fiber Jack West front and rear stock with an adjustable cheek piece, a shell catcher on the receiver, a Timney trigger, the barrel on it is an 1100 target trap barrel, and it has been back bored. The customer who owned this did quite a bit of work to this gun and took very good care of it. The condition is exceptional, with the only noticeable imperfections being on the receiver where the shell catcher has moved a little, creating some light surface scratching. There is also some very light scratching on the bluing on the top of the receiver."

The Horton Hunter Express SL 175 is the ultimate crossbow for the serious hunter, regardless of what game you're after. Tough, quiet, accurate and fast, the Express 175# compound split limbs, microflite aluminum barrel and smooth power plant delivers that trophy shot, on target at a sizzling 305 feet per second. That means less arrow drop, greater penetration and better odds of a trophy on the wall and meat in the freezer. The synthetic thumbhole stock has the same warm feel as your favorite rifle and the Express' compact size and superb balance makes it easy to carry and quick to shoot, from a tree stand or the toughest cover.

Item is in very good shape. Comes as pictured with case and lock.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Browning Citori Over/Under 20 Gauge 3"" 2 Capacity 24"" Barrel Satin Walnut

The Citori Micro Midas Satin Hunter is a shotgun suitable for any lover of
over/unders, but this special model will fit youth and ladies very well.
The satin-finished walnut stock is shorter for easier shouldering. The
length of pull, which is the distance from the center of the trigger to the
center of the buttpad is only 13"". This makes the gun easier to shoulder,
quicker to point, lighter and easier to carry. It carries all the fine
features that have made the Browning Citori the number one selling over and
under shotgun in the world. The all-steel deeply blued receiver and
barrels, the single selective trigger and hammer ejectors with the famous
and easily navigated top-tang barrel selector/safety. This is a very fine
choice for the dad who is looking for a lighter, smaller over/under and
certainly ideal for youth and ladies.
