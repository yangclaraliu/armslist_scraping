This rifle has less than 1000 rounds down the pipe.  It will hold 1/2 MOA groups beyond 100 yards with match ammo and I've managed to get 1/2 MOA groups with soft point Federal ammo at 100 yards with the rifle on bags.  Beautiful rifle, phenomenal shooter.

Rare ""Loaded Model"" Springfield Government 1911-A1.

This gun has 2 Slots "" Ports"" cut into the top of the slide, revealing 12 Ported holes in the top
of the Barrel. When the gun is fired the pressure (and some wicked flames) come out the top helping to keep the muzzle down for faster target reacquisition.

The frame is in very good shape. The Flats look really good, some light scratches, and some holster marks on the bead blast (very normal with BB) but there are no deep spots, scratches or chips on this gun. The Slide is in the same condition.
The photos should help, I do have more and recommend asking for them.

I don't want any of the following

Shotguns
Rifles (Ar's maybe, I don't need a bunch of accessories, I want a nice rifle, I have furniture.
Cowboy guns
no .22 anything, I shoot guns not paintball.
No Taurus anything




Seriously, only answer the add by email WITH photos of whatever your trading, and DETAILS with it.
Anything less will be deleted, I won't buy what I can not see.

This is a double-edged bayonet originally manufactured to fit the Pattern 1888 Lee-Metford Infantry Rifle manufactured by one of the most famous English makers Enfiled. These likely saw service in the Boer War and WWI. They are very functional and of high-quality manufacture. The hilt incorporates an odd-shaped pommel with push-button/internal-spring latch, steel crossguard. The grips are of wood and are usually held in place by two brass rivets; an oil-hole is present behind the second rivet. The blade is a double-edge type, unfullered, with a medial rib the runs from the ricasso to the blade tip; bright finish. 

This 1888 Pattern Mk1, Type 2 bayonet can be easily differentiated from the other three 1888 Patterns: 

* MkI, 1st Type - three brass rivets in grips;
* MkI, 2nd Type - two brass rivets and an oil/clearance hole at the rear of the second rivet;
* MkII - oil/clearance hole is no longer in the grip, but in the pommel; rear rivet is closer to the pommel; this was the first of the series intended solely for the Lee-Enfield Infantry Rifle.
* MkIII - metal hilt is ""browned"" and grips are held in place by two screw/nut sets.

Various British proofs and manufacturer's marks are usually on the ricasso, both sides. Marks on this one are unreadable. 

Specifications:

* Overall Length: 420 mm / 16 1/2 in
* Blade Length: 300 mm / 11 3/4 in
* Muzzle Ring Diameter: 16.5 mm"

Ive had this gun for about 6 months, ~500 rounds through it, give or take 50, no FTF's or FTE's....been a flawless gun for me. To be honest this is a spur of the moment thing for me. I would like to trade for a S&W M&P .40 due to the fact that im going through a police academy and most likely i will be working part time so i will have to provide my own gun.

It will come with the XD Gear, (4) 16 round magazines(all factory), 20 rounds of Speer Gold Dot 124g JHP, and if i have any 115g wwb that will be included as well, also will come with a Crossbreed Supertuck IWB holster, worn for 4 months.

would like to trade straight up for a M&P, i think that is pretty fair when the gun is right along the ~475-500 mark plus 100+ in accessories

I WILL NOT TRADE FOR ANY OTHER GUN THAN AN M&P .40 with average to low use. Thank You."

There are 2 of these on gunbroker right now, 1 is $400, and the other is $525, and they'll sell for those prices. i dont need this one any more, and im looking for a walther P22, so if you have one to trade lets deal. if you want to trade even for a walther P22, i'll throw in a 500 round box of ammo.
Please read this ad carefully and understand that i have stated truthfully any known problems i'm aware of. the gun does have the occasional feed issue (not all the time), but im convinced it just needs another magazine. the gun also fails to fire on occasion, but im sure a good cleaning will straighten that issue out. im stating this because too often people misrepresent guns and the buyer doesn't find out until its too late. i buy/sell/trade a lot of guns, so i believein being totally up front with any known issues, and i expect the same in return. please do NOT send me any $75 low ball offers, i wont even respond."

I owned this bike and rode it very often up until about a year ago. At that point I sold it to a friend. 
The friend drove it twice, parked it in his backyard and let it sit for a full year. about 2 weeks ago, I purchased it back from him as a project. 
Since I bought it back, I have had a few unforseen events pop up that are going to prevent me from completing this project.

Just changed plugs, fuel, and oil. The clutch is sticking a little bit, but was good when I parked it.

I have no camera so no pics, sorry.  

First is a Springfield Ultra Compact 1911 with the V-10 porting, it is tuned for Winchester white box 230 gr JHP and will feed ball for days.  It has been sent to Sa for a rework but I then had my family smith go over it so the trigger breaks consistently at 4.25 pounds, and is surprisingly accurate for having a 3.5 in barrel.  It is the matte black finish with black plastic grips and has fixed sights.  I am asking $725 for it

Second is a S&W 459 with the fat Pachmayr grips as well as the factory slim plastic ones.  It is Blue and has some holster wear but is quite a shooter.  I am asking $300 for it.

Stainless steel  / 2 ¾"" barrel / pre-warning

Here's a round butt, snub-nosed version of arguably one of the best series of 357 magnum revolvers ever made. They have proven to be strong, accurate and utterly reliable. Many feel they are capable of several lifetimes of serious, magnum-shooting use.

This particular example is in excellent condition and has an early (more refined) finish, no warning mark on the barrel and locks up especially tight. It's the most popular version of the Ruger ""Six"" series (round-butt, snubby) and made of the most desirable material (stainless). It has its factory walnut grips and is waiting to serve for CCW, nightstand duty, truck gun or . . . ?

Come with 40 rounds of GoldDot defense ammo, Blackhawk IWB nylon hoslter (quality and very safe for nylon) Blackhawk double mag pouch, 3x 12rd Sig Factory magazines (one factory 10rd magazine as well not pictured), and the original factory as well as replacement Hogue wrap around grips. Case included as well. The sights are bright white, standard factory.

$500. Cash only. The gun is in fantastic condition with only one noticeable flaw and that is a slight discoloration on the top of the barrel. I think it is just a hint of surface rust that could be buffed out with just a touch to a muslin buffer wheel. 

I've been trying to sell this for awhile, but the caliber being uncommon is making it difficult. The idea of buying a Sig for 500 dollars with all the extra goods I'm throwing in should make anyone pounce.

Cash only. I work 7 days a week so the transaction has to happen in Wichita (I've got a place downtown I like.)"

Combining the alloy and titanium construction of the AirLites with an L-frame featuring the enclosed ""Centennial"" hammer (the only non-J-frame Centennials Smith has ever made), the new revolvers were offered in both 7-shot .38 Special (Model 242) and 5-shot .44 Special (Model 296) flavors. Weighing only 18.9 ounces, the 2"" round-butt .44 Special Model 296 offered big-bore punch, medium frame size, snag-free carryability, and was lighter than a steel J-frame. It seemed to be a recipe for success in a time when liberalized CCW laws were sweeping the country. The new revolvers were still fairly complex to make; the complexity of the two-piece barrel and the machining of the titanium cylinder translated to an MSRP of $754.00

Smith discontinue the revolver after the 2001 model year. The few who purchased one found out, that pretty is as pretty does and if you're looking for an easy-to-carry big-bore wheelgun, they don't come much prettier than the 296 Ti.

Given their unique configuration and short production run it seems safe to say that these will probably achieve at least minor collectible status in the future. 


I have had this .44 Hand Gun loaded sitting in my night table for about ten years, I guess I will never be firing it so I have decided to sell it. I hope you get to enjoy it because I never did, thank you for looking...God Bless.

S&W 637 that I used to carry. Belonged to my old neighbor gundealer/gunsmith. Had a good trigger job done to it to smooth out the double and make the single action very light. Its several years old so it does has some use/carry wear, but only cosmetic finish wear and holster polish. Most of it was done by the previous owner (the dealer who took it everywhere including hundreds of hunting ventures.) I am the second owner.

Comes with a Bianchi Professional 100 series leather IWB paddle holster, 4 speedloaders, replacement fullsize grip by Pachmayr grip, 25rds of Hornady Critical Defense +P .38spl ammo, and 21rds of Hornady XTP ammo, and case.

If you are looking for a concealable set up ready to go anytime without a huge investment, then this is what you need. Would also make an ideal pistol to leave in a vehicle.

Stevens .410. Older and a little beat up. Wood furniture. Grandmother never took car of it. Functions well and the safety features work. The start of the bore is a little pitted due to old corrosive ammo, but only extends two inches or so and is shallow on a very thick throat.

It is the old west cowboy gun! The serial number is 170,_ _ _ which makes it a July 1901 manufacture date. It still fires and everything looks original and still functions properly. This gun still has some of the ""bluing"" on the metal, but does show several lighter spots in places...could have been ""reblued"" before I acquired it. The stock and forearm have had some work done as well... but pretty clean looking.  There are some dings in the cartridge area but not on the barrel. The bore is in great condition and is a perfect rifle for shooting. This is a great shooter!!! I would say it is about 20% of original condition.  I have seen these go for as much as $3,500 depending on condition. I am asking $900 or trade. Can send more pics for serious inquiries only! I also have 2 boxes of ammo that I would estimate to be valued around $70."

Chinese Norinco NDM-86 in 7.62 NATO. Will also fire .308 Winchester and has the spring loaded firing pin.
The true copy of the Russian SVD in the NATO caliber, one of only 1000 in the country. The rifle has less than 50 rounds fired through it, probably closer to 10-20. Despite the notoriously weak finish it is nearly entirely intact on this rifle minus some light wear on the high traffic areas of a semi-auto. 
Comes with the original accessories, including cleaning kit, cleaning rods, scope box, spare bulbs, scope with infra-red detection, canvas tool bag, the 10 round magazine, all the paperwork and manuals, and spare rubber eyepiece, all in new condition.

!!NOTE!!

 I did find the matching handguards which were on a different rifle, so this rifle is now 100% matching in new condition. Worn handguards are no longer included. I don't have a new picture of the rifle but the matching handguards are in perfect condition.

I may consider trades for Arsenal SGL 20, 21, or 31, if the price of the gun is around $550. May pay more for package deals provided the rifle itself is only costing the above amount.

May also consider a PSL for around $400 plus a package deal.

May also consider a Wasr 10 or Wasr 2 for about $300 each provided they are in good condition.

May also consider DS Arms standard FAL full length battle rifle.

Also considering Mauser K98, Springfield 1903, Mosin Nagant, Lee Enfield SMLE no. 4 Mk 1 or 2, Arisakas Type 38 and 99. These must be in good condition and most importantly good shooters. I will consider prices on an individual case.

And I will consider any combination of the above trades or multiples there of, within reason of course. But if you have 2 PSL's or multiple Wasr's or both Arsenal's, that might be a possibility I would look into.

 This is just a general overview so feel free to ask any questions and make sure this rifle is legal wherever you are located. Reasonable offers are considered. Thanks for looking!"

These are getting harder and harder to find (just the kits)

This one has a DCI RPK receiver with matching serial number, Professionally built and receiver finished. All Yugo parts are Original Blue.

What sets this YUGO RPK away from almost all others? 

IT HAS A PERFECT ORIGINAL BARREL....If you have ever seen Yugo AK's ot RPK's (originals. not the ones with new US barrels) you know it is rare to find one that is not shot out. This one is ORIGINAL and PERFECT... It was an UNISSUED kit as you can see.

Price is 700 and firm...kits on gunbroker sell pretty quick for around 400...include receiver, compliance parts, build, etc. Not to mention the quality of the barrel.

You wont find a nicer example i PROMISE you."
