Out of the guns Winchester offered with this 7 Leaf sight, the 1886 Model, not many are encountered, and those that letter correctly are even scarcer. This rifle has an interesting story which I will get to later on in the description. Now the Rifle, this Rifle was manufactured in 1896 but shipped from the warehouse in February, 1897. (See picture of letter).No ffl.Wood is very nice and has not been touched up at all. Bore is good. Action works perfect and is tight. This 1886 is and can be figured as a Holy Grail for 1886 collectors and also for any Winchester Collector out there. USPS Money Orders. I will accept Pay-pal with a service charge.

Don't tell me you have to drive 75 miles round trip to get it so I want to pay less. Look around your area or pay the new prices and have it shipped to you. As for the people who like to trade... I will consider PARTIAL TRADES ONLY meaning part trade and the rest in cash. The only things i'll consider as a partial trade is a AR15 barreled upper or a 357 or bigger revolver nothing else. No video games or car audio or any of that stuff I'm too old for that. Do not contact me if you are not a serious buyer. I will only deal with Ohio residents with a CCW I will need to see it and you sign a bill of sale. If you dont want to do that dont contact me. Email for pictures. Pickup only no delivery.

Carry it ""Cocked & Locked"" if you like! I just saw this same model, but the SA/DA version at Shoot Straight for $599 before tax, bg check, transfer fee. More like $700 out the door!I ordered the G10 grips in red snakeskin that should be delivered Monday. UPDATE: GRIPS ARRIVED EARLY! The pic in the lower right hand corner is of the grips on the gun from the grip manufacturers website. The main pic shows how it sits now, with the factory grips still on it. If I were to keep it, I would put some better sights. The stock ones are night sights, but no where near as big or bright as say SIGLITES.You get the gun (Only 10 rounds through it/MINT!), box with papers, lock, etc. and two 10 round mags. I well sell it for $560 (FIRM! FIRM! FIRM!) cash OR partial cash and your trade (handguns only, either 9mm or 45). If your trade is good enough I can throw in a box of ammo.I put my number in the pic, so text me with any questions, or if you would like to buy/trade. Thanks!Face to face sale only. No shipping. No paypal. No checks. Greenbacks please!You must be a Florida resident (with Florida ID), at least 21 and you must not be a felon. Trade or sale must take place in Winter Park or Orlando. I will not drive. Thanks again!"

This is the ONLY model available that allows the user to activate the laer via the pistol grip, which is easilly the most intuitive design on the market. In addition, this model is no longer in production (for reasons I'll never understand), although it is still covered by the company's full warranty. At the bottom of the grip is an on/off switch so you can save battery life (which is very good) during daytime range sessions, or choose to just keep it off for awhile. The only reason I am selling this is I have made a change in rifles, and can no longer use it.  The average price for a Crimson Trace laser grip is approximately $250 for a red laser, so at this price it is practically a steal. More than anything, I just want it to go to a good home. Text mesges are prefered, although I will be checking my emails as well. Feel free to send texts (or call if texig in't an option) at 513-two27-84zero5. Local sale only, no shipping. Price is firm. Thanks for your interest!"

No dings or scratches, nor did I ever wear it in a holster so no holster wear. This gun is a sweet shooter and will run forever. My buddy uses one for competition and has nearly 10,000 rounds through it on the same recoil spring. I have everything that came with it: the original box, 2 mags, instruction manual, lock, and changeable backstraps. I'm selling it because I'm kind of bored with it and looking for something else. I'm going to price it to get quick cash. Please no low-ballers it's at a good price for a quality firearm. The M&P45 averages around $549.99+tax brand new. I am selling mine for $380.

I will give a direct contact in case emails are messed up.....IF they are going through.......Really people????...if you get a email that has correct spelling, and actually has some meat to it instead of "" Still have this?"" Please at least have the decency to reply.    Considering going a different route with this AR upper.....I just don't shoot the 6.5 Grendel as much as I thought I would.  It has a 20""  Black Hole weaponry barrel on it with 235 rounds through it, probably about a H-Bar contour. It was broken in as follows.....  cleaned after every shot for 10 shots, cleaned every three shots for 5 groups, cleaned every 5 shots for 5 groups, and finally cleaned every 10 shots for 10 groups. Some may say you don't need to do this, but I have never been disappointed in a barrel treated this way! This accounts for 150 of the 235 rounds through it.....the PITA part has been done, and this barrel is ready for hard use! The picture is the last group I shot with it, with 100 grain Amax reloads..... 5 shots in a dime at 100 yards. Here is you opportunity to buy a proven barrel! Don't risk it on a cheap no name barrel, You know Black Hole Weaponry, and you know this one is capable of dime size groups, or better as I'm no marksman!........don't forget to break a barrel in properly is going to take about $150.00 worth of hard to find ammo. Anyway, let me know if you're looking for a 6.5 Grendel barrel/bolt...... I may also sell the whole upper, if I'm not going to take a huge wash on it.....price out all upper parts.  If you want complete upper, ask yourself why I would sell it for less then what I'm going to spend reordering the parts. It is a basic upper with a Sampson Key mod handguard. Make me an offer! Barrel and bolt were over $350.00 when I bought them, and if anything they have been improved,  so don't lowball me! Shipping on your dime is a option, Pics on request. If it's posted, it's still available-don't ask!"

From 1800 to 1600. This is a custom build, that started with a base model DDI AK47. It was cut to 14.5 pinned and welded to 16 OAL and has Griffin Armament Taper Mount Flash Comp mounted for suppressor use. The entire front end conversion of the rifle was done by Hiram Holt of Athens and he done amazing job. The concentricity of the rifle has been checked and is great. The Trijicon MRO was a gift and is not included and can't be negotiated into the deal. I will add a complete list of the parts and what they cost me. I really would like cash to start on my next sbr project. The rifle has less than 400 rounds through and has never seen corrosive ammo and has always been cleaned after every range trip. I understand most people do not see this much in an AK but the work is top notch. If you would like to see it in person before making a deal that would be no problem, and I am willing to travel out of my are for the right deal.Also have a factory DDI 16 barrel that comes with it. Text me only REDACTED.

The extremely compact HK P7M13 can be drawn, cocked, and fired accurately, faster than any other pistol. With an overall length and width close to many .380 pocket pistols, the full-power 9mm P7M13 has a full-length four-inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide.
The unique HK cocking lever allows the P7M13 to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip. Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7M13 immediately and renders it completely safe.
The P7M13 gas system retards the movement of the recoiling slide during firing and eliminates the need for a conventional locking mechanism or heavy slide. The low profile slide contributes to the balanced center of gravity and compact size of the P7M13.
Made of high-grade steel, the low profile slide keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110°, the result is a compact, accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited to civilian and law enforcement users.
Features:• Polygonal rifling for increased barrel life• Fluted chamber aids in extraction• All steel construction• Extractor also doubles as a loaded chamber indicator• Fixed barrel ensures accuracy• Trigger guard heatshield• Ambidextrous magazine release• Cocking lever control means complete ambidextrous function• Blued finish
