Colt ""New Navy"" revolver was the standard sidearm used by U.S. Naval personnel in the Spanish American War. The U.S. Navy began its search for a new handgun to replace the aging converted 1851 Navy revolvers in 1887. These revolvers had been converted to .38 cal. center-fire in 1873, but were still outdated. The Navy decided to replace the weapon with the Model 1889 .38 cal. Colt revolver, and ordered five thousand of them. The weapon did have a problem in that the cylinder did not have locking notches, which could lead to misfires. Most of these weapons were reworked to correct this problem. In 1892, a new model of the ""Colt New Navy"" was issued which no longer suffered from this problem. The barrel was also shortened. Minor improvements were again apparently made in 1895."" Email for more pictures. Comes with antique leather case."

This gun feels great in the hand (and I have large hands), is under a pound, holds 8+1 rounds, is plenty accurate at 25 yards, has almost nothing to grab your cloths upon drawing (god forbid you ever need to), offers a 10 pound double action trigger for safety and a 4 pound trigger double action for accurate follow up shots.  Also this gun is great for younger people, women, or persons with weak wrists. You can chamber this weapon using your pinkey fingers, and loading requires no speed loader what so ever.  


Smith and Wesson lists them at the MSRP of $393 and with tax that would be $416.58 so I feel like 300 is fair. Please call me at REDACTED Ky residents only and a CCW is greatly preferred."

I have a used Harrington & Richardson Topper 88 shotgun. The metal is in very good shape, and there are just a few small marks in the wood. Better than 90% of the original finish is still there.

The receiver is case hardened, so it has the beautiful colors. This example really is exceptional as far as the coloring goes. Serial number indicates it was manufactured in 1980, so it's a ""real"" Harrington & Richardson. This shotgun is in much better shape than most of the shotguns you see in this price range.

It is a break action, single shot, 12 gauge, and it has a fixed full choke and a functional external hammer.  It has a 3"" chamber, and the barrel is 30"" long.

Perfect for shooting trap, cowboy action & SASS, and it makes a great beginner shotgun. Full choke also makes it a good turkey/bird gun.

It does not matter if you have fired 10,000 rounds or no rounds through your firearm, IT IS STILL USED.  Guns are just like cars, once it is sold for the first time, it becomes USED.  To make sure you are not getting screwed, go to The Gallery of Guns and use the gun genie to check the retail on any firearm before you purchase, but remember the prices there are retail.  Call a gun store and ask what the selling price is on what ever model you are thinking of buying.  One other thing I have a problem with,  if you have a $500.00 gun do not be asking to trade it for a $1000.00 gun, it just makes you look stupid."

Description on their website:
This is 40 S&W Speer Lawman Clean Fire 125gr. Reduced Hazard Taining (RHT) Frangible Ammo. For clean, close-up training, you need a lead-free bullet that crumbles into very small pieces when it hits a metal backstop. Lawman RHT ammunition features a precision-formed bullet made of sintered copper, which is powdered copper that's compressed under heat and pressure to form a bullet. Sintered technology means there's no separate jacket that can produce sharp fragments on impact with a steel backstop. The tip of each RHT bullet is distinctively marked so range officers can easily tell it from conventional ammunition. You also need a primer that's free of lead, barium and antimony. This ammo has that covered with the CCI Clean-Fire primer. Clean-Fire priming not only eliminates the heavy metals found in conventional primers but also leaves very little residue in the shellcase and firearm, which results in shooters and their equipment stay cleaner. Lawman RHT Ammunition is the right choice for improving air quality in indoor training ranges, or for ranges where bullet bounce-back has proved to be a problem. Use RHT for clean and close realistic training and practice."

This is the IOM version which came out before the USG and is no longer produced. It comes with everything from the factory.  Below is information on the different Five_seveN Variants. 


Five-seven DAO
The original Five-seven model was introduced in 1998.  It is now discontinued. The model had no manual safety device and it was double-action only, with a heavy trigger pull of 4.5 to 6.5 daN (10 to 14 lbf); its double-action only trigger was harshly criticized.  The model had a pebbled grip pattern, smoothly-contoured accessory rail, low profile fixed sights and a circular-shaped trigger guard designed to improve gloved use.  It did not have a slide release and the slide was not serrated as on newer variants, but a portion of the slide was instead slightly concave to aid grasping.  The original Five-seven also had slightly different markings, with an FN logo placed on the left side of the frame above the trigger guard. 

Five-seven Tactical
The Five-seven Tactical was introduced shortly after the original double-action only variant, as a single-action alternative.  It had a short and light trigger pull of 2 to 3 daN (4.4 to 6.6 lbf), as on current models.  It also had the addition of an ambidextrous manual safety device (located on each side of the frame, as on current models), and a slide release.  Aside from these differences, the Tactical variant was identical to the original double-action only Five-seven.  It was discontinued following the introduction of the IOM variant.

Five-seven IOM
The Five-seven IOM (Individual Officer Model)  was the first variant of the Five-seven pistol to be offered to civilian shooters, debuting in 2004.  It is now discontinued in favor of the USG variant. The IOM was similar in its basic design to the Tactical version, but differed in that it has a M1913 accessory rail, serrated slide and trigger guard, and fully adjustable sights.  It also incorporated a magazine safety mechanism to prevent the weapon from being fired without a magazine inserted. 

Five-seven USG
The Five-seven USG (United States Government)  is the current version of the Five-seven pistol.  This variant was approved by the ATF as a sporting firearm in 2004, replacing the IOM. The USG retains the changes incorporated in the IOM, but has further modifications. These include a conventionally-shaped (square) trigger guard, tightly checkered grip pattern, and a larger, reversible magazine release.  In addition to the standard black finish, this model is available with a flat dark earth frame finish (as the Five-seven FDE) and an olive drab green frame finish (as the Five-seven ODG).  In addition to the standard adjustable sights, this model is also offered with low profile fixed sights.  Starting in 2010, the standard black pistol is also offered with black controls by AcuSport, as opposed to the original grey controls."

It has had a mount upgrade, a GG&G quick-detachable throw-lever upgrade. Decide you don't want it for the moment to switch to a magnified scope? No problem, just throw the lever over, the Eotech pops off, when you want it back on just throw the lever back over it's that simple. It will even generally hold a zero to within .5 MOA or so, no need to rezero!  This optic is in excellent condition, with only a pair of tiny silver nicks on the protective hood which seperate it from looking new.

If you are unfamiliar with this optic, it is a very sturdy, reliable, fast, and effective holographic red dot sight. It features a 1 MOA dot inside a 65 MOA circle, meaning the dot is one inch wide at 100 meters. It is adjustable for several brightness setttings. What's best about this optic that seperates it from Wal-Mart specials is that it is very sturdy. Eotech's are commonly purchased by servicemembers for use on their duty rifles overseas, because they are sturdy, reliable, and very fast on target. 350 and a pick-up in/near the Stillwater area please.

I have one used Taser International, Advanced M18 Taser, with two Taser cartages (yellow door shoots 15 feet) I am pretty sure I still have the original case and all of the paper work that goes with Taser.

It has been in my family for many years but, due to some financial circumstances, I find myself forced to sell. I'm not an expert in such matters, but I'd rate the gun approx. 85% in finish and 95% in function (I've only had it to the range a small handful of times in 10 years and have had three failure-to-eject using cheap ball ammo). There is some wear shown in the bluing on the outside of the gun on the slide, but overall it's in fantastic shape for its age and could easily be made perfect by a bluing/restoration specialist. It is being sold with one original magazine.

Below is a link containing a lot of information on the particular model (including fun facts like General Patton used to carry one in WWII). As per the standards described on the site, the gun was manufactured between 1918-1921 and would make an excellent piece for a collector. The same model listed on Gunbroker without reserves are priced between $650-$1100, but I am asking $5500 to hopefully facilitate a quick sale and not a lot of lowballing. I would be willing to entertain a partial trade for a subcompact in .380 or 9mm (Ruger LCP, Kel-Tec, etc) but I will need $300 cash at minimum in addition. I know there are some people out there that like to email and offer 50% of the asking price-- if this is you, please save both of us the trouble and don't do it. I do have some things I need to take care of, but I will not just give the gun away.

Please don't hesitate to email me with any questions, specific picture requests, etc. If, for some reason, I cannot get the pictures to load on the ad I'll be happy to email them to you.

Thanks a lot!

And, I'm including a barely used BRW S1 magazine ($45 new) in place of the original 5 rounder it came with.

The fiberglass stock had been given a crude camo job by the first owner, so I painted the stock and handguard an Olive Drab green. Comes with box & papers, USGI fiberglass stock, and one BRW S1 20-round mag. The E2 stock in the photo is available for an extra $150.

I'm the original owner (bought it about 1 1/2 yrs ago) and it is in excellent, brand new condition. 

I've fired 80 rnds through it (all Lake City m193) and it's been flawless. The only reason I'm selling it is to finance another project I'm working on. The exterior is immaculate as can be seen in the pictures.

Rifle comes with original Rock River case (including the manual), 4 brand new in package 30 rnd magazines, and a detachable A2 rear sight (NOT the LMT sight that is on the rifle in the pictures, I already sold that one). The sight is made by Rock River and is not the cheap $40 knock off imitations you see on the internet.

Let me know if you want more pics.

I'm willing to ship to your FFL if you're out of state.

All serial numbers match and the gun is in very good condition. Includes the original sling and detachable bayonet. I have fired this rifle at the range and found it to be very accurate. I haven't tried it at any further distance but am told these rifles were used successfully against German soldiers at much larger distances. I want $125.00 Firm for this rifle. 
2) Mosin-Nagant Russian carbine manufactured in 1944 . All serial numbers match and the gun is in very good condition. I do not have a sling for it. The gun has an attached folding bayonet which is present and in good condition. I have fired this gun at the range and find it to be very accurate. I have 13 cartridges that will go with this gun. I want $150.00 Firm for this carbine. 
Both of these rifles fire 7.62 x 54R cartridges. They have quite a kick and are very loud when fired. In other words, they are a load of fun to shoot. Ammo is easily available and can be had pretty cheaply. I have a 20 round box of Lellier & Bellot ammo made in the Czech Republic that I paid just under 15 dollars for. That works out to roughly 75 cents per cartridge. You can get Russian Surplus ammo in sealed ""spam"" cans containing 440 rounds online from Cheaper than Dirt for $95.00 which comes out to about 21 and a half cents per round. This makes for a pretty cheap day at the range! Some local gunshops also have the Russian cans available but I don't know what their prices are."

The bluing on the rifle has gone to mostly plum - there is no rust, corrosion, pitting, etc.  The stock appears to be the original finish, it shows field marks and dings but there are no cracks.  The receiver was tapped for a scope mount before my father got it.  It also has the original steel butt plate with the ""Savage Quality"" Indian-head logo and one original 5-round magazine.

- An RCBS two piece reloading die set and case.

I will let the gun go with a Hogue Grip and Hogue Paddle Holster go for this price. My brother has asked me for a loan and that is the only reason why I am selling it, much less at this price! It has one clip with the pinky extension. I have fired it a few times at the range and here on my land and have not had a bit of trouble out of it. The bluing had some holster wear so I had the bluing removed. Of course as you know the later P-11's were stainless steel. I will not meet you nor take a penny less than 200.00. The first one to my door gets the gun. I am in Auburntown TN so do some Map questing and see where you have to come to before you commit. Thanks for reading my ad."
