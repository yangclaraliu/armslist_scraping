We are even throwing in a Bulldog soft case. A deal worthy of American Family Pawn & Guns! The Ruger® Mini-14® Ranch Rifle Semi-Auto Rifle is a scaled down version of the US M-14 with no selective fire switch. All models of Ruger's Mini-14 semi-automatic rifles have a solid reputation for being absolutely reliable under all conditions, and have proven themselves in both law enforcement and military use worldwide. The Ranch Rifle operates with a very simple Garand-style design that uses a fixed-piston gas system where gas impinges directly upon the operating rod and a breech bolt locking system. The Mini-14 action is not sensitive to the type of ammunition it uses, cycling both commercial .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO ammo interchangeably. A large extractor and fixed ejector send spent cases flying swiftly to the right of the shooter. The Ranch Rifle ejector is set to eject cases low to avoid hitting a mounted scope   Cold hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning.   Simple, rugged, Garand-style action with breechbolt locking system, a fixed-piston gas system and self-cleaning moving gas cylinder gives unparalleled reliability under harsh operating conditions.     Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid steel receiver, provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included).   Accurate sighting system with ghost ring adjustable rear aperture sight and a non-glare, protected blade front sight."

It has been cerakoted in a triple-color digital ACU pattern because im OAF and I want the Camo to blend in with my belly hair when im carrying appendix.  It has had some trigger work done on it by a gunsmith (he said he was) to remove the grit, smooth up the trigger, and lighten the pull; Its smoother than Tennessee trim; however its now just really dangerous to carry and fire less than one round per pull. By far one of the best Glock triggers I have felt. (And trust me, I like to feel on a lot of triggers) It has the Dead Ringer Snake Eyes combat sights installed with orange tritium rear and green tritium front.  Theyre combat sights because thats what they use in combat. My former brother in law's cousin's sister, who once had a neighbor that used them as a JTAC in Somalia. Legit combat tested sights.  It will come with 4 factory Glock mags, and 2-29 round mags. If you include some starbucks coupons, i will add an extra clip.  I've also got close to 600 rds of ammo with it as well (500 rounds of Remington FMJs, and about 80 rounds of Federal HST JHPs) I'm selling everything together and won't separate the ammo or mags out. Unless its for comic books and beanie babies. Im an avid beanie baby collector and am in search of a few rare babies, such as ""stinky"" the skunk. Feel free to message me anytime.

If you are looking for fo AR10 like this, you know how incrediable these rifles are. I have put 60 rounds thru it. It has a Primary Weapons Precision rifle compensator on it. It has a US Optics ER-25 5-25X58 scope, mounted with Leupold Mark 4 scope rings, Mil blue reticle and cerakoted earth finish. This is one of the finest scopes I've ever used or looked thru. I will also include 150 round of HPR 168g BTHP match ammo and 2 10rd and 1 20rd PMAG. If you have any further questions please let me know. I am happy to ship to a FFL. I am willing to sell the rifle without the scope."

They are light, fast, comfortable to shoot (even with mag loads), and extremely reliable. They are inertia driven so there are no pistons or orings to foul and cause problems. These will kick out the 5th shell before the first one even hits the ground. It comes with one extended ported choke. I did not keep the box. you will not be disappointed! not a scatch or handling mark on it. these go for $1075.00 all day long with sales tax. I'm asking $900.00 firm. THX for looking.

Like new with a low round count (less than 200) and very light holster wear. I also installed Talon grips over the stipple for a more confortable concealed carry (I don't wear a t-shirt underneath and move around a lot) but that can easily be taken off if you prefer. I personally think that it gives it more character plus the stipple/talon combo has a very nice feel to it. I'm also including 1000rds of ball ammo. Price is firm.
