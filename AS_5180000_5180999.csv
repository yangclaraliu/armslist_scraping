For looks, the rifle bolt has been polished.This was built as a hunting rifle and used for only one season. The rifle is very solid and was properly broken in upon completion. There have been less than 100 rounds through the barrel of this gun and the only blemishes are a scratch and chip in the paint on the handle of the stock and markings from the scope mounts. The rifle is capable of sub MOA groups with proper ammo according to my testing. The furthest I have fired the rifle is a distance of 500 yards with a group of less than 4 inches.The purpose for selling this rifle is not for any flaw, malfunction, or displeasure with the gun. I am selling it to start a new build for next year, this was intended to only be used for a year as a test of Christensen Arms product and it served well.The rifle comes it at little under 7 pounds and feels comfortable in the hands. The felt recoil is very minimal thanks to the muzzle break and harmonic reduction property of the carbon fiber."

Table is considered ""unbranded"" or ""generic"". It is however 3 piece of solid 1"" slate (this is is pretty standard for quality tables). It has Simonis 760 cloth on it. Quick details on the cloth. It plays VERY fast and is considered one of the top cloths on the market for serious pool players. The cloth is only 3 years old and is around 275-300 new. It has been played quite a bit, but is still tight and can be reused. Will include everything pictured on table. Balls, Triangle, Diamond, Brushes, and 2 pool cues. Pool cues are not the best, however they will get you started. The table has some general wear on it. Corner pockets have a little wear on the top. The top rail the felt has come a little loose. The felt has marks in the 'Kitchen Area' (Top 2 diamonds on the table) from the speed generated on breaks. None of the wear affects game play. I'd be happy to disassemble the table, help you disassemble, or give you contact information for a professional to do it. The estimate I got on reassembling the table reusing the felt was $125. Please contact me with any questions."

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol.  Available in 9mm, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance.
Chambered in 9mm for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel.  Standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Offer it in all major self-defense calibers, that’s how. When the Springfield Armory® XD-S® arrived on the scene in 9MM and .45ACP , its svelte profile quickly made it the pistol to beat for concealed carry. The thin, single-stack design allows it to melt into the body when carried, yet it’s shockingly easy to control. Even those with larger hands can get most of three fingers on the grip. Practice is everything, so rather than go for uncomfortably and uncontrollably small, we aimed to create a handgun that’s easy and pleasurable to shoot while still offering amazing concealment. You’ll enjoy your range time with the XD-S® and become a better shooter as a result. For 2016, we’re introducing the XD-S® in the ever-popular .40SW , so you can choose the mix of power and capacity that makes you comfortable. Like the originals, the new XD-S® .40SW comes with both flush (six-round) and Mid-Mag (seven-round) magazines, so capacity of the new .40SW model sits right between that of the 9MM and .45ACP XD-S®. We’ve designed the XD-S® to fit you – not the other way around. Interchangeable backstraps customize grip circumference. We even include matching magazine sleeves so the Mid-Mag (7 Round) fits seamlessly too. To make the XD-S® durable, yet portable, we used the right materials for the job. The black polymer frame saves weight while the forged stainless steel slide and Melonite® hammer forged barrel put strength where it’s needed most. The sights are designed for speed with a fiber-optic front sight that leaps into the sight picture. Don’t like the color? That’s OK , we include green and red tubes – take your pick. The rear combat-profile sight offers a simple notch so there are no distractions to divert attention from the front sight. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.   Read Less     Share             Specs   Caliber .40SW Recoil System Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide Rod Sights Fiber Optic Front & Dovetail Rear (Steel) Weight (with Empty Magazine) 22 oz   Height 4.4"" w/ Compact Mag, 5"" w/ Mid-Mag X-Tension™ Slide Forged Steel, Melonite® Finish Barrel 3.3"" Hammer Forged, Steel, Melonite® / 1:10 Twist Length 6.3""   Grip Width .9"" Frame Black Polymer Magazines 1 - 6 Round Flush Fitting, 1 - 7 Round With Mid-Mag X-Tension™, Stainless Steel     - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-s-3-3-single-stack-40sw/#sthash.D0SdqBGd.dpuf"

The gun is built like a tank and will provide multiple lifetimes of service. I'm looking for $400 for the gun. I also have a terror .720 which is extremely sought after for 10 gauge shooters and they are no longer made to my knowledge. You can have it for an additional $75 bucks. I also have approx a case of federal speed shok steel. This goes for $210 at the cheapest you can find anywhere online. Add another $150 if interested.

859,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5180859,For Sale/Trade:  Night vision weapon sight an/pvs-22 gen 3,"2a range, Tulsa, Oklahoma","$ 6,775","Listed On: Sunday, March 6, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"YES! This item is AVAILABLE to CIVILIANS!**Has a larue mount. Less than 30 hours on the gen 3 tube. Shows external wear from field use. All glass and electronics are perfect. The AN/PVS-22 UNS (Universal Night Sight) is a high-resolution Clip-On Night Vision Device that mounts to any MIL-STD-1913 rail interface forward of a riflescope. This gives the operator night vision capability from a standard day scope system. The AN/PVS-22 utilizes a fully Mil-Spec Gen 3 PINNACLE Auo-Gated image intensifier tube, a fast f/1.15 catadioptric lens for a brighter and sharper image in starlight, and patented permanent boresight alignment technology. The unit is installed, operated, and removed without tools and without affecting boresight (permanent boresight alignment). The PVS-22 can be mounted in front of a spotting scope for long range reconnaissance, hand held as a night observation device, or placed in front of a riflescope for sniper applications. The UNS is optimized for medium to long-range sniper weapons, rifles, and machine guns including the Mk11, Mk12, M-16A4, SCAR-H, M240, and M-24. OSTI’s patented Shock Mitigation System is specially designed to protect PINNACLE tubes from damage under heavy recoil. PINNACLE tubes are usually not intended for high caliber weapons, but they are perfectly secure with the AN/PVS-22.There are many clip-on night vision devices available on the market. Many make claims that simply cannot be backed up. This is why the US Military chose the FLIR AN/PVS-22 UNS. It is the original intermediate-distance clip on and will hold resolution, giving the shooter a clear image out to 12x depending on the day scope’s glass and available light. We have achieved this kind of resolution while using a Nightforce NXS 3.5-15×50. Although, the sweet spot for the best resolution is between 6-8X with most day scopes. The large 68mm objective lens will let in much more light than other clip-on systems. Most other clip-on units on the market will have severe image degradation after 4x.The AN/PVS-22 utilizes the latest ITT Gen 3 PINNACLE technology giving the operator an extremely robust system suited to any environment. The cast housing will stand up to the elements rain or shine and protects the unit from abuse found in the field.We have used the AN/PVS-22 extensively in the field. This UNS is the real deal PVS-22 developed by OSTI and now produced by FLIR and issued to US Forces around the world in the Global War on Terror. Indeed, we get many reports about how these units greatly contribute to terrorists having very bad nights! We have found that the image quality averages highest at about 10x, but will make it to 12x depending on the quality of glass being used."

923,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5180923,For Sale:  Glock 21 ZEV Ultimate Trigger package,"Sterling, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 180,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 16, 2016",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale a NEW never used Glock 21 gen 1 to 3 ZEV Technologies Adjustable Fulcrum. Price new is $260 plus shipping. I will sell for $180, price is FIRM. I can install the trigger for free if you wish. One of the first things a GLOCK® owner should consider is upgrading the stock trigger. ZEV™ builds the best triggers in the business and ZEV's Adjustable Fulcrum® Drop-In Trigger Kit components were used to set a world record. The Adjustable Fulcrum Drop-In Trigger Kit only requires one tool (a standard 3/32nd punch), and 15 minutes of your time.You will immediately notice these differences in your gun's performance after installation:The trigger face is flatter and the trigger safety is three times wider than a stock trigger; this is ideal for quickly placing your finger in the optimal firing position. This will help build proper muscle memory for improved consistency and accuracy.Because of ZEV's proprietary trigger bar refinements the trigger operates smoothly through the entire length of pull.The trigger's crisp tactile reset gives the user a clear feeling for the moment of reset. This feedback improves the user's ability to ride the reset to improve follow up shot speed and placement.The trigger weight can be adjusted to as low as 3 lbs. A lighter pull weight requires less pressure, reducing trigger fatigue and improving accuracy.The pre-travel and over-travel are adjustable to allow for a shorter pull, crisper break and faster reset.Trigger adjustments will give the benefit of shorter take up, post break travel and will result in a shorter reset.The Ultimate Kit has a Skeletonized Firing Pin, the benefit is its lighter construction, polish, and the tip of the firing pin is extended for more positive primer ignition."
