If you actually have to take time to think about it.....don't bother reading this ad. I was a child of the late 40's and early 50's. Back then you did not worry about people killing others or breaking into your house, car, etc. Well those days are gone forever. This is not a scare tactic... This is Reality in today's world. Watch the news. Read the paper. Crime is bad and getting worse daily. Criminals don't care about us. It is all about them and their habits.

I bought four of these to send to my 3 adult kids in different states and 1 for myself, but decided to not go through the hassle of shipping a firearm and just sent them the money to pickup one locally, so I will offer the 3 extras I bought for sale and keep one for myself. The $240 price is firm. This weapon is perfect for Home Defense. With the 18 1/2"" barrel you can maneuver around the doors and hallway of your home. Protect Yourself. Don't expect anyone else to protect your home, property or family in a break-in situation, as the response time for assistance takes too long. I very recently had about $1000 worth of stuff stolen by my garage. I figured I would just call the insurance company and they would take care of my loss. NOPE, The theft deductible is 1% of the value of your home. So if you have a $200,000 home, the 1st $2000 comes out of your pocket, so I got nothing back for my loss. I will tell you that now if someone breaks into my home or steals from me, I will shoot to kill....not shoot to wound. I don't want them coming back later. A shotgun shell is less than 50 cents and that is now my new insurance policy in addition to my homeowners insurance against theft.

A 1934 Czech VZ24 8mm mauser bolt action rifle. This rifle was made at the famous factory in Brno, Czech. It was sold to the Romanians who put their crest on it. The crest was partially scrubbed off by the Russians after the war. However a good part of it remains on the rifle, which is uncommon. The stock shows a lot of wear as you would expect from a rifle that saw action in 2 countries. The bore is dark in the grooves but has strong rifling. The Czech rifles were noted for their smooth actions and this one is no different. It cycles and fires with no problems. The upper hand guard has one small crack and one a little longer one that was repaired. Does not affect the function of the rifle. This rifle has a lot of history but has a lot of shooting life left in it. It would be good for the collector, a nice truck gun, hog gun, or deer rifle. The 8mm packs a punch. It comes with 20 rounds of surplus ammo. Asking $220, willing to negotiate a little. Please text any questions or requests for more pics to REDACTED. Thanks"

Perfectly new condition. Purchased an 8.5” 5.56NATO upper and this 7” Palmetto State Armory SQR Quad Rail came with the complete upper. I really loved the rail so I ended upgrading to a 9” because it looked a lot better with the overall length of the barrel + muzzle brake. 

Lightweight for being a quad raid. Mill-spec and looks great. Comes with an unused barrel nut as well since I didn’t need to use it for the new rail. I am going to mention that it is a proprietary barrel nut and it requires a 1 1/8th inch crowfoot wrench (spanner wrench I believe). I’m not exactly sure but this is what I have read online. I don’t have the tools but I did want to give a heads up that it does not use the regular AR-15 tool screw on.

Retails for $150 and it is difficult to find this rail by as a buyable part. Palmetto State Armory ONLY sells the 11 and the 13” version of this without an upper."

This is a beautiful antique looking gun with real wood grips. It can be a real fun gun to shoot especially if you use the quite rounds and shoot in your own backyard. You can use regular 22 rounds, hollowpoints, rat shot, or Magnum. It loads just like your more expensive Ruger's and you reject the shells the same way just like the old cowboys did. This gun also has the lifetime replacement warranty. This warranty is a replacement warranty not a repair warranty. If you should have a problem with this gun, it will be replaced with a new gun not been often repaired.  This gun is perfect for home defense, target practice, for shooting snakes or any other purpose that you not need it for. The 22 caliber rounds are inexpensive and fun to shoot and with a four and three-quarter inch barrel it is very accurate. The 22 Magnum round is a very forceful round it is very fast and hard-hitting making it a good self-defense round.

Factory combo rifle / shotgun from the late 70s. It is an sb1 frame but of stronger construction that the standard. The rifle barrel and frame are factory fitted and bear the same serial number. There are no strength issues. Barrels swap with 1flathead screw. This particular one is in .30-30 win and 3"" magnum 20ga. The rifle barrel has factory flip up rear sights with a factory scope mount included. Both barrels, the stocks, and the case colored reciever are all in excellent shape. Yes, I know what blue book is on this combo, and you try to find one for that. The rifle barrel is extremely accurate and a very handy length. The recoil pad is the factory hr pad and in great shape. Putting this up for sale or trade for something interesting. Ended up getting an old contender in .30-30 so I dont shoot this one as much any more. Really looking for a Ruger 10/22 with the full stock. Will consider all trade offers from glocks to contender barrels and everything else. I collect milsurps and old hunting rifles, figured if someone was interested in the topper I would give them a shot at it. I can add any amount of cash to a trade if I like it, lets make a deal.
