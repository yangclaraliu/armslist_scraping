Tritium front with a white circle around it and a blacked out rear sight make it very easy to get a front sight picture when shooting fast.

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit."

The C93 is a hybrid of milsurp HK parts and components of US manufacture. The rifle is a pleasure to shoot and has proven to be extremely accurate and reliable. The original furniture is included (solid stock, carry handle and wide hand guard) along with an HK pattern bipod, and HK 3-point sling. In addition, I will include an HK Navy 3-position lower (Semi-auto only, of course, but gives the rifle a more authentic appearance), lightweight aluminum MLOK handguard from HKParts.net, MLOK foregrip, MLOK rail section, and MLOK QD sling mount. I will also include two optics mounts and a rear sight adjustment tool. The first mount is a Trijicon designed for ACOGs oroptics with an ACOG style base (primary arms prismatics, etc), while the second is a Brugger-Thomet short mount with a picatinny rail. The B&T mount is the real deal and is extremely solid, unlike the UTG mounts that are commonly seen. Lastly, I will include the original 40-round aluminum magazine, two transluscent MKE 30 round magazines and a pant-load of ProMags: seven 30-round mags, and three 20 round mags. All of the magazines function reliably.So, there you have it. This is a great bargain if you are interested in HK roller-lock pattern rifles. It's been a fun experience, but I'm ready to start experimenting with another system. I'm not interested in breaking up the package as all of these items are specific to the HK roller-lock platform.$775 with buyer to pay transfer fees. No low-ball offers, please. I'm just trying to clear up some space for a new project.I'm looking to add cash to the kitty, so I'm not interested in any trades. Transactions will be completed at an FFL per 594.I am willing to meet in Silverdale at Silvercity Arms and Ammo, or in Lakewood at Quantico Tactical. Both of these FFLs charge about $20 to perform the transfer.Preference will be given to transactions in the Silverdale area.Thanks for looking."
