This version of the LG-401 features an NRA logo. With rugged polymer side panels and a rubber overmold activation button, these are the recommended Lasergrips for most 1911 shooters. Standard to Crimson Trace® Lasergrips, the LG-401 features instinctive activation. This means that the laser sight automatically springs to life when the weapon is held in a natural firing grip. I purchased this grip for a self defense 1911, and then decided on something different. It looks like new, and works great. It comes as shown in the photos. These normally sell for over $300. Cash only, no trades please. I normally work from 9:00 AM, to about 1:00 or 2:00 PM, and then evenings. Thanks! Also note that I am willing to ship so long as the buyer covers the shipping charges for USPS Priority Mail of $10."

I bought this a few months ago. It has approximately 1,500 rounds down range. I clean it every time I bring it back from the range and haven't experienced any problems with it. The front white-dot sight is slightly discolored. This is my fault... The sight was turning dark gray after about 1,000 rounds. I went to clean it with a toothbrush and a small fraction of the white came out. I was going to get some touch-up paint, but figured I would wait. Someone who wants to buy it may perfer to do it themselves or upgrade to night/fiber optics instead. Comes with original box, Wilson flat-wire guide rod, 17 & 20# flat-wire Wilson recoil springs (20# is currently installed), original guide rod and recoil spring, and 2 OEM Ruger magazines - one 8-round and one 7-round.

It arrived just today, 8-10-'17. As we couldn't find one locally to test we had to ""assume"" (and, yes, I know the alternate meaning of that word; all too well) that she could rack the slide... she can't! This little beauty does have some carry wear from the previous owner (not too bad but it's definitely there, mainly on the ambi safety levers, you can see it in the pictures if you look close) but seems to be in good operating condition and it has the best trigger pull I have ever experienced in a semi-auto pistol, probably in the 2-1/2 to 3 lb range with virtually no creep or overtravel. It's a really nice little gun that costs around $1250 new and it comes with 4 magazines, box, holster, magazine carrier, paperwork, and two brand new boxes of ammo (a 50 round box of ""plinkers"" and a 25 round box of serious defensive JHP's). We haven't shot it yet and don't plan to. We have no idea how many rounds have gone down the tube before we bought it but I doubt that it's many. I would love to keep it for myself but I really don't need another pistol; it's unfortunate that I see no reason to fill the gap between my carry 9mm and my 45ACP lightweight commander because I really, REALLY like this little EMP. We have $825 in everything noted and that's what we're looking to get out of it (reduced to $775 on 9/13/'17). Check around and you'll see that's a fair price. Will sell only to a MO resident, 21 years old or more with proof of ID (and preferably a CCW), cash only, and willing to sign a bill of sale. Face-to-face transfer only. We're not interested in any trades. I am willing to deliver to a mutually agreeable spot within a 50 mile radius of Buffalo, MO.   And thanks for reading this..."

Extreamly accurate. It's a 300yrd plus rifle easily. I can't list everything, it's just too much. It has a 20in Wilson Combat Barrel, Anderson Manufacturing complete FDE Cerakoted Lower Receiver, 3.5lb CMG Match Grade Trigger with Anti-Walk Pins, Bravo Company AR10 Bolt Carrier Group, Troy 16in M-LOK Handguard, M4 Feed Ramps, Magpull Buttstock, Magpul M-LOK MVG MOE FDE Verticle Grip, Rock River Arms Flash Hider, Bravo Company Buffer Tube Kit, UTG Pro Heavy Duty Bi-Pod, and Vortex Precision Rifle Scope Rings. The rifle will come with two metal mags! It's cheap to shoot, it only costs $10 for 40 rounds. I'm only asking $1390 cash for the rifle. No trades please. I paid over $2300 for it, so I'm taking a big loss. Cash only, no trades please. Call or text me at: (937)-684-6068, thanks and have a great day!"

It has the SRT Trigger system, new Sig ELITE grips, and a Luminescent Trijicon HD front sight that glows BRIGHTLY at night and even more so during the day, with Night Sights on the rear as well! It comes with the original Sig Sauer Hard-Case, two factory Sig Sauer 13round magazines, and an extended 15round magazine (still in box) Also, it has the de-cocker along with a reduced & contoured beaver-tail grip and spurred hammer for better control in shooting in either Double Action or Single-Action. It has had a total of ONLY 150rounds fired exactly, so it is still VERY MUCH like new, as you can easily notice from the pictures of the barrel and chamber area! I am mostly looking to sell but I MAY consider trading for something that REALLY catches my interest.In all, I have spent just at $1,500 in this, after the rear Night Sights, the front Luminescent HD front Day/Night Sight, the high capacity magazine, the Sig-ELITE grips from Sig Sauer, etc.. And the price of the pistol itself when I bought it brand new from the shop! However I am willing to sell for almost 50% LESS than what I have put into it! So for everything included, the price is $720cash! Thanks for looking!!"
