DIAGCAR ELECTRONICS is a dynamically developing company that was launched in 2002. We specialize in designing software for diagnosis and repair of various automobile electronic systems. We are capable of designing various kinds of software, using modern micro-chip technologies (8/16/32 bit mcu, FPGA, PLD). We have a lot of experience in programming micro-chips used in automobiles, e. g. Fujitsu, Infineon, Motorola, Mitsubishi, Nec.

We are among the best. Enigma can work with the newest models of cars, e. g. new models of Audi A3/A6/A8/Q7 (8P, 6F, 8E, 4L chassis), BMW 7 (E65, E66). Our newest software can change the km counter readings in the module CAS2 in the new BMW 5 and 6 via the diagnostic connector OBD2!

Before solving any problem, we analyze it thoroughly. This ensures the quality and reliability of our software. To guarantee our customers' satisfaction we keep improving the software and creating new programs. New updated versions are available at least twice a month.

For sale in the Roanoke Valley is an Argentine Mauser Model 1891 Calvary Carbine chambered in 7.65mm. This carbine was made by Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken in Berlin.

Don't know much about them so check out the pictures, but here's what I see. At some point during it's life a Lyman 57 peep sight was added which covers most of the Argentine crest (but it's still looks to be there). It appears the numbers match except for the stock. The action seems really nice and the bore looks good too. 


The Argentine Mauser comes with:
- Three boxes of Full Metal Jacket 174 grain Prvi Partizan ammo (20 rds. per box) 
- Three boxes of Soft Point 180 grain Prvi Partizan ammo (20 rds. per box).

Online buying tips : Both parties should have government PHOTO ID that is recorded in the bill of sale. A price should agreed upon before meeting and it should be cash unless otherwise arranged prior. Parties should meet at a municipal shooting range or local PD. I have a form, that is filled out, signed, and retained by both parties. It contains the standard Federal law requirements, bill of sale, and a release. Gun buying online should be SAFE, REWARDING and LEGAL. God Bless America !"

We do this so that upon completion of this class, you will have a complete packet which you can submit to Utah BCI (Bureau of Criminal Identification) with your payment. You will also have all the information you need to obtain your Oregon CHL from your local Sheriff's department. 

Subjects covered are: Basic Handgun Safety, Tactical Issues, Concealed Carry Firearm selection tips, Ammunition, Holsters, Gun Free Zones, Reciprocity, Cleaning, Storage, Firearm Transport, Justifiable Force, Criminal and Civil liability, How to interact with Law Enforcement, and how to apply for your Permit. 

After attending this class you will have a fundamental understanding about handgun safety and the rights and responsibilities and laws associated with the carrying of a concealed Handgun in multiple states. 

This is NOT a live firing class. Do NOT bring a firearm with you to the class. 

Even though the class time is only scheduled to be 2 1/2 hours long, there will be time for questions and answers after the class.

18.5"" HD Barrel for Remington 870 Express. 

Please be advised that I've also posted this in the Gun Parts section - I've seen barrels posted here so I hope this is kosher.

Very lightly used (from what I recall the use consists of being put on the gun). I bought the shotgun, tested it out, then bought the HD barrel a year or two later and put it on the shotgun, then put it in a safe place. To my recollection there have been zero rounds through this barrel - all of the testing rounds went through the 28"" barrel that came with the shotgun. The barrel is a fixed cylinder. 

The price is fair; bought new this barrel would be about $110 at Bud's plus shipping (about $10) and tax (if you pay use tax in your state). Further, I'm in no situation that requires me to unduly discount this item. If you are aware of a similar barrel in this condition for a lower price please do feel free to purchase that one.

I am willing to meet if it is somewhere in my normal transit about the Greene County or Dayton area. 

I will ship if pre-paid via US Postal Money Order for an amount including the purchase price and shipping price. 

Not interested in trades. 

Thanks much for your interest and have a great day."

The housing and glass on the aimpoint have no scratches and is in very good condition (the rear clear lens protector has a couple tiny scratches, but the optic itself does not).

Features a 4 inch shrouded barrel with a 1913 under rail for a light attachment, interchangable front sight blades (comes with a brass bead), scandium N frame, 6 shot cylinder with moonclip capability, Performance Center trigger with overtravel stock, all PC internal parts (made of bar stock steel with case bluing rather than standard S&W MIM parts) and all the original kit and kaboodle. The gun comes in a Eagle Industries soft case with the Thunder Ranch logo on it. I'll throw in a whole mess of Moonclips and a Wilson Combat De-Mooner. 

Why you need this gun... This gun is a reloader's dream, it can shoot everything from weak target loads to high pressure +Ps and do it with absolute reliability. Reloads are super easy, .45ACP's are so short and fat that they're easy to manipulate during reloads, much moreso than other cartridges like .357 when on Moonclips, so you can shoot this gun as fast as a semi-auto. The trigger combined with a fixed barrel makes it one of the most accurate pistols available, I've fired around 50 rounds thru the gun and it grouped better than my Nighthawk 1911. Couple all that stuff with the fact that this is a limited edition, hand built collectable S&W, and you're looking at a fantastic investment that's a joy to shoot and own. 

I'm asking 1200$ for the gun, that's what I paid for it.  NO TRADES."

Just wanted to let everyone know that doing the right thing not only allows oneself to rest, but also give peace of mind that you as a human can make a difference in someones life.

At approximate mid afternoon time I had arrived at the range for a great afternoon of shooting not only my new old mosin but my ak that my son had bought me for my birthday. 
As always I say my hellos and afternoons to everyone on the line and start general chit chat and ask what kind of gear they had and sometimes asking the decision making process in acquiring the items. This helps me in learning about things that I do not normally see in a day to week environment that gives me ideas to either look into getting some of the same, or possibly just learning more about these items of interest.

Scenario: closing time sunday at the range.
Had a nice afternoon at the 600 range talking to a couple of guys to the left of me and a couple of guys to the right of me. The person directly left to me had many moments of wisdom and knowledge to share that not only enhanced my life and made a difference but gave me insight into the human nature as a whole on a world level. I had asked this particular person several questions and he promptly give me personal attention and details that give me knowledge that will be of use not only today but in the future. 
The afternoon began like many afternoons at the range and with the hot and cold moments we had time to come together the group of people at either one end or the other to discuss upcoming local events or more generally the gear they had brought with them, the gear they didnt bring with them, or maybe even the gear they were thinking about getting and the reasons why. It is always a learning experience for me when I go to the range. The atmosphere and and sense of belonging makes for a very satisfying and enjoyable time, day after day after week. Kind of like in the wizard of oz. There is no place like home on the range type of feel.

This day at the range began like so many others and this was no exception but with one very special twist of fate. 
I myself since I live farther out of town than most always makes the most of my two hour round trip and bring many items with me to do testing of gear with and to make youtube videos to share with people. The day was waning right about the six pm hour and I had been at the range a good four hours having an excellent day. What happened in the next half hour was life changing for me, and as well as day changing for the person(s)  

Everyone other than the two guys around me had left for the day and they were getting their targets retrieved. I was as well packing up to goto the pistol bay.
After going to the pistol bay for about a half hour I decided to go back to the 600 range and shoot a little .22 at the clays out at the fifty berm. The time was a little after six pm.
After setting up the clays and returning I noticed a dark range bag in length that was on the table. Since I was the last one to leave and the ro had already taken off and the other two guys were long gone i went over and got the bag. After looking around for a name on the outside I then looked insiode and noticed this partucular item was one that one of the other guys had shown me a couple hours earlier. But they were way down on the left. Why was this close to me i was wondering. Well as i remember the person was showing off their most recent build and wanted me to look at it and comment.  Since no body was around when I left the gear went with me.
The next day i contacted the range. A little after lunch the owner of the stuff called me and we made an meeting to return the gear.
I made the half hour drive back to omaha monday night and delivered the gear to its owner. 
All told without going into too much detail there was a complete ar15 with dot, and another upper with a scope. Also included in the bag was ammo and a axe.
Estimated value of all the gear after I identified the individual components was around three thousand dollars.
So in less than 24 hours this person not only had his gear back, but a large part of his life and his arsenal family back and comfortable.

I am glad I could make in difference in your life today.
End of story...
Thank you."

Description:
DESCRIPTION
The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

I picked up this on impulse recently; then upon further research, I would be better off going in a different direction based on what I specifically want to do. The finish isn't great, but it's in very good mechanical condition and the bore looks fantastic. According to the previous owner, it was imported from Israel and appears to not be as picky about magazines as other Pre B 75's. The magazine brake has been removed and the grip screws have been upgraded.

I've got $370 in it, so that's what I'm asking.

New Vepr Made in Russia Hunting /target rifle in popular caliber of 7.62X54R.With 50% more HEAVY DUTY receiver that also has double reinforcement with extra heavy duty Target barrel ! A true comparison is with the Russian tiger Dragunov. Having made a reputation for accuracy this heavy duty Barrel not found on most other rifles has Chrome lined chamber and Bore.
A vepr goes through a thorough inspection process at every part, every step of building and must pass the final thorough examination by a quality control committee before any vepr ever leaves the arsenal.

Hammer-Forged, Russian Chrome-Lined, Heavy Barrel. Most durable AK Barrels Made.

These rifles are far superior to a PSL in the fact that not only is the barrel heavier, greatly reducing vertical stringing, but the receiver is built so that the rifle will eat heavy bullets without causing damage.

Now, to the specifics of my rilfe. Has Tapco G2 trigger, as well as SVD style removable flash hider. Comes with a new set of Ironwood Designs Vepr SVD furniture, as well as the original stock set. Additionally, comes with a 6x42 POSP scope, 2 5rd magazines, and a 10rd SGM Tactical magazine. To cap it all off, will come with a genuine Russian SVD paratroopers bag, which fits the rifle beautifully.

Taking a loss at $1650 for the entire package. Insured shipping will be $60. FTF in El Paso County/Colorado Springs area. USPS money order, or discreet Paypal + 4% for shipping purposes. I have a case of ammo that can be sold as well."

Description:
P30
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.
Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.
The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.
P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger
A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.
Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.
During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.
P30 and P30S models available in 9 mm and .40 S&W.

Description:
USP
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.
All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.
The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.
Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.
The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes."

Description:
 We created an unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.



And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.



Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.



Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.



KEY FEATURES: New semi-automatic AR-15-style rifle developed with the predator hunter in mind Free-floating button-rifled 0.680"" Muzzle OD ChroMoly barrels with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy Fluted barrel design reduces weight and promotes rapid barrel cooling Clean-breaking single-stage hunting trigger Receiver-length Picatinny rail for adding optics Ergonomic pistol grip Fore-end tube drilled and tapped for accessory rails Full Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ coverage Includes 5-round magazine Legal for hunting in most states Compatible with aftermarket AR-15 magazines"

I'm taking a huge hit on the sale of this rifle, but it has to go. This is a very nice rifle, and it is used (around 300 rounds of quality ammo) but there is obviously no warranty expressed, written, or implied.

Innovation & Added Functionality! The SB47 stabilizing brace is an awesome invention that secures AK style pistols to the forearm of the shooter and assists in firing the pistol the way it is intended - with one hand. Using the SB47 in this way, recoil is reduced significantly, resulting in more accurate shooting without compromising safety, comfort or control. Designed and made by a U.S. Military veteran with help from a top V.A. prosthetic specialist, the intent and design of the stabilizing brace is to help America's wounded veterans enjoy large frame handgun shooting again. The concept was to invent and create a device that would act as an extension of one's own arm - so it is like a part of your body. Well the SB47 did that - and more! Not only did it help our wounded heroes regain their confidence and handgun skills, it was wicked fun for anyone to use! BATF approved for everybody, the SB47 does not require any special permits, doctors notes or SBR tax stamp! Will fit PAP M92 PV, PAP M85 PV, Draco and C39 Pistols. Comes in retail ready packaging.

NO New York City. This listing is for ONE Magazine; buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Llama-Gabilondo was a very credible firearms manufacturer in Eibar, Spain, and produced excellent quality pistols for almost a century, ca. 1904 until 1997. Their model III and IIIA pistols scaled the basic 1911 pattern down to a neat little pistol chambered in .380 ACP that was roughly half the size of John M. Browning’s invention. Many specimens we’ve sold in our six decades of dealing guns had no importer stamps. Most specimens from the 1970s and 1980s bore Stoeger import stamps, and then the final ones from the 1990s imported by RSA of New Jersey. Since the company went belly up in 1997, there are no more magazines. Here, then, is the only game in town, the Triple K manufactured magazine for Llama model IIIA Pistols. Manufacturer is Triple K of California. Construction is all steel magazine body, floorplate, and cartridge follower, with steel spring. Each magazine holds 7 rounds of .380 ACP caliber ammunition. Pistol may be marked 9mm Corto. That is Italian for .380 ACP. This magazine will fit Llama model IIIA, and the identical Mugica Llama model 105-G, so long as they are chambered in .380 ACP caliber. It will not fit a model XA Llama that is chambered in .32 ACP caliber. It Will Not Fit a Colt Government .380. It Will Not Fit a Star .380. It Will Not Fit the valve of a 19th Century Italian Bidet. It will only fit Llama IIIA and Mugica 105-G pistols chambered in .380 ACP caliber. Measurements are 3 7/8 inches from the top body lips to the bottom of the floorplate. Body length is 1.095 inches back to front. Thickness is .431 inch. Magazine release slot measures 2 3/16 inches from the bottom of the slot to the top of the floorplate. carbinesforcollectors com llama page has an informative comparative history. Triple K magazine quality improved drastically with their move to U.S. production about 15 years ago. We’re offering the magazine in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 39.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10. Civilian residents of New York State are legally enjoined from loading more than 7 rounds into any magazine.
