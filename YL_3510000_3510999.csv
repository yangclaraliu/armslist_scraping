 Thermal Imaging Has Gone Digital! ATN is proud to introduce the newest line of ThOR Thermal Weapon Scopes. The most advanced night vision technology available is brought to you by the premier company dedicated to providing night vision systems at affordable prices. The new ThOR line is rich with features and options making it the best value of any comparable system on the market.

This model is lightweight and small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, yet it’s rugged and durable. The entire system is built in the USA, utilizing Mil-Spec Lenses that make the ThOR battle worthy for most any mission, operation, or outdoor activity. Each system features a digital menu that gives you a variety of options and adjustments allowing you to customize your system.

You can select a number of reticle options as well as choose a reticle color best suited for your specific application. No more black reticles on a black and white screen – ThOR features a color OLED display giving you a sharp color reticle every time. Or switch to full color mode and overlay it with either a black, red, blue, white or black reticle depending on the conditions and the environment.

Ever have problems with a scope not being able to hold zero? The ThOR has no screws or springs that can create targeting errors. With all digital controls, the ThOR will NEVER allow your reticle to move off base. The new ThOR Thermal Weapon Scope provides provide amazing image quality through total darkness, fog, or smoke. Darkness, camouflage or bright lights will not affect the sensitivity of these units.

All units have feature E-Zoom to expand your optical magnification. They’re Ideal for nighttime hunting, force protection, border patrol, police SWAT and special operations. And they feature a video-out connection and cable which will let you capture your nighttime operation on video. These units are priced like no other thermal devices in their class – as much as half of what you would expect to pay! No other product is comparable in value or price. 
 The ATN ThOR functions equally well as a weapon scope or a handheld viewer. Once you experience Digital Thermal you may not want to use anything else again!

They come in the 300rd ""swamp people"" boxes but of course are the exact same ammo that you see in the 100rd plastic slider packs. Mini mags are very good consistent high quality ammo, the ar tacticals just have a different bullet profile than the mini mags so they feed smoothly when they are rapidly fired from an ar platform firearm.   I also have some Remington buckets o' bullets, win super x, and other varieties of .22lr and a few varieties of 22 mag, other calibers as well. 

I would need $40 a box (300rds) and would prefer to sell a good amount at a time not just a box here and there. I do not have time to drive around everywhere. You may come to me (Grays Harbor County). I also make occasional trips to the Olympia/Lacey area so a meet up could be arranged. Maybe a small price break if you are wanting a large amount. I check my email often.  Also interested in trades for firearms and other ammos.

1-9"" twist, 6 grooves, right hand
5.56mm chamber (shoot either 5.56mm or .223)
11595E Barrel steel
Manganese Phosphate finish barrel
This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 cool tunnel handguards, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.
The barrel is mounted on a FORGED A2 upper receiver with built in carry handle made from certified forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec. This upper has match grade A2 adjustable sights that feature finger adjustable windage and elevation. The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover.
The buttstock tube is the mil spec thickness (1.145"" OD) M4 buttstock (not the cheaper carbine buttstock). This buttstock features 6 positions for maximum shooter comfort, reinforced design for heavy duty use, and the correct M4 lock nut.

Bolt Carrier Nickel Boron Group NiB MK1 MOD0
The next generation of Ares Armor NiB Bolt carrier group (auto) for an AR15, M16, or M4 is now available. The Carrier is enhanced with a MK1 ModO NiB coating featuring a proprietary method perfecting the balance of the sodium borohydride reducing agent; a step rarely taken. We then take it one step further to INDIVIDUALLY COAT ALL COMPONENTS before assembly; instead of taking a short and coating an assembled unit.
All Machining is completed to Mil-Spec. Properly Staked Gas Key. Gas key is heat treated. An 8620 Carrier and a 9310 Bolt are heat treated, along with the gas key to ensure proper strength. Bolt and Extractor are shot peened before coating and a crane O-ring is installed for superior extraction, along with a properly staked gas key. Proudly made, above and beyond milspec tolerances, in the USA.

Chambered in .50 caliber, and made by Traditions Firearms. Stained and finished the wood myself, the metal was sent to a professional gunsmith for bluing. Crimped all the brasswork by hand.


     The rifles were stained in the highest-quality red mahogany stain I could find, finished with an excellent satin finish I use for all my woodworking, and finally was lightly oiled, and the brass polished to prevent patina. 


     This gun has a brutal kick, but it's a dead shot, especially on a hunt. I have a personal one of these that I use to great effect. And nothing's more fun to shoot than old black powder guns. The best part is that they don't count as 'firearms', so you can have as many as you want, no paperwork needed! You do still have to be 18, sorry kids.


     Alternatively, no American living room is complete without a musket hanging above the mantle, and the Kentucky Long Rifle is a gorgeous piece to take that place. It doesn't get much more American than the Long Rifle.


     Rifled musket, uses standard small arms black powder, and .490 caliber lead balls for shot. Accepts #11 percussion caps.

Keep in mind that this rifle requires 'patched balls', that is to say, the bullet needs to be nestled snugly in a small piece of fabric so it stays still. The easiest test for this is simply turn your rifle muzzle-down.  If all the shot and powder runs out, it was incorrectly loaded(keep in mind incorrect loads will still fire fine, just keep that muzzle pointed up until you shoot). A correct load in a Long Rifle will not shift, unless you start whacking your rifle against things, and then you have a whole different set of problems.



Feel free to email with any questions. I also have a few kits left to create, so if you want something custom done to the rifle, we can talk. My standard design is the red mahogany stain(first picture), covered with a satin hard finish, but I am open to just about any kind of custom colors or work you'd care to mention."

-Anderson Arms lower
-BCM Upper
-18 inch fluted .223 Wylde Barrel (Allows you to shoot .223 and 5.56 equally well if you arent familiar with the .223 Wylde chambering)
-Tri Delta Tactical muzzle brake, same size as an A2 birdcage style brake and legal for three gun competition, reduces muzzle rise dramatically
-ATI Strikeforce stock with Scorpion recoil system and adjustable cheek riser for optics
-Low profile gas block with a 12 inch free float quad rail with T Marks
-MPI/HPT inspected BCG with properly staked gas key
-Magpul BUIS

Will also come with a couple of Magpul P Mags and 20 rounds of M193 5.56 depending on trade.  Have around $900 invested in it.  Shoots exceptionally well and with the longer barrel, muzzle brake, and cheek riser stock it would make an excellent long range rifle with a good scope, however I'm more interested in a .30 caliber rifle right now.  Primarily interested in a .308/7.62 battle rifle like a PTR 91 or FAL, possibly a Cetme+Cash.  Would also be interested in a nice AK47 in 7.62X39mm (NO WASR'S).  Not interested in SKS's, I already have one.

While I'm primarily interested in these rifles, I'm also looking for an HD/Tactical style 12 gauge shotgun, no more than a 20 inch barrel with a cylinder bore such as a Mossberg 500, Remington 870, Benelli Nova Tactical, just about any of the new Turkish import pump guns, etc..  I already have a nice field gun, so not looking for a hunting shotgun.  Would be interested in a two gun trade for one along with a semi auto .223/5.56 or 7.62X39mm rifle such as a basic AR (M&P Sport, similar) or AK (would allow WASR's if including a shotgun), or maybe even a Kel Tec SU-16.

Feel free to let me know what you have though, but I'm not interested in hunting style weapons or bolt actions of any kind, I already have my share of those.
I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers. texts preferred.

Gun has between 3-400 rounds through it, rear sight has been blacked out because 3-dot sights suck.

There is one tiny mark on the frame that can barely be seen. It was there when i bought it new, but im not picky and was too lazy to try to swap and wait for a new one since I didnt notice it until I got home. but full disclosure and all. I can send an additional pic of the mark if you would like.

The sights were blacked out with a fabric pen, so it can probably be removed with some paint thinner or something, but I will leave that for you to decide if you want to mess with it. You will probably want to leave it black, since that is better.

included are 2 15rd factory magazines, plus the original box, lube, lock, tool to remove grips, and documentation.

WASR 10/63.. of course
TWO steel magazines. One is a Romanian and i'm pretty certain the other in Bulgarian.
Bayonet to be honest with ya... Its one of the worst wasr bayonets I have ever seen. You will see it in the picture... At least it has character? lol
Magpul ak style grip in black. 
Original grip
Comes with a Tapco 6-position stock.
original wooden stock. Which is currently on the gun. Its a pain to get on and off..... I switched it back to the wooden one a few months ago for my bro in law.
Front sight adjuster
It comes with a tapco retaining plate. Which needs to be grinded just a tad to fit. I have just never done it after I found out how to get the original shepherds hook in. 
2 boxes of tulammo.. tbh this may be gone if you dont catch me in time. lol :)

The steel mags have just very little of wobble. I have never tried a polymer mag in it so I have no clue how those do.
The sight does not appear to be canted what so ever. If it is it must be by so little you cant even notice it. 

My brother in law went and shot it a few months ago and was messing with the sight. I dont know if he sighted it in. If so what distance or anything. When he first got it me and him shot it about 50 yards at my papaws and the sight seemed to be pretty on. Time for some pics! lol

Im located in Cleveland, TN just east of Chat im in the south end of it. You will have to come here to look at it and even show me what you have to offer for it.

The reason im selling it is to get me a Marlin "" new remlin "" 30/30 my papaw has been wanting me to hunt with him and I just believe a 30/30 may be better better for me. 
I also wouldn't mind a ruger gp100 4.2inch preferably blue but steel is pretty nice. But as always I prefer cash. My 500 is pretty firm so please... try not to talk me down any."

Browning Citori Lightining 20 ga. This is a used gun but in 98% condition. It has a couple light handling marks but other wise it is in great shape. I bought this gun new and have been the only person to shoot it. This gun was made it 1993 and comes with box and paperwork. It also has a browning hard leather case that comes with the gun. The case was $200 when purchased and I have seen it as high as $250 new recently. 

I am asking $1500 for the Citori with box and case. I will not split package.

Browning Belgium made Sweet Sixteen. It has a blonde stock, square knob, and matted barrel. The gun is in 97% condition with noting that it has one chip. That chip is about a half a fingernail size and located under the stock at the butt plate. My guess is that somebody dropped this gun and it broke off. The chipped spot has been doctored some by a previous owner. It has been stained and filed to blend in with the gun. Because of its location it might be hard to notice if you are not inspecting the stock. 

The Sweet 16 is the top gun in the pic and does not  come with a case or box. 


If there is interest in both guns I would do $2,500 for the pair."

Read Their Fine Print! WE WILL SHIP TO A CA FFL FOR THE SSE EXEMPTION!! This Listing is for One Factory Brand New in the Hard Case Heckler & Koch VP9 Striker Fired Semi-Auto 9mm pistol with 2 15 round magazines. Factory Part # M700009-A5 THIS GUN COMES WITH A FACTORY LIFETIME WARRANTY!! In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis.

Chambered in 9x18mm Makarov, which is similar to 380 acp but ballistically superior. This is a solid milled steel, military grade firearm with a chrome lined barrel. Cosmetically similar to the Walther PPK, it will fit in holsters designed for the PPK. DA/SA with a decocker and loaded chamber indicator.
This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.
With the gun, refinishing service, and grips, I have just over $500 into this pistol and that is the basis I will use for any trades.
Looking to trade for a Sig P938 plus cash on my end. Offering an additional $100 for a basic model, more for a higher end model (SAS, Blackwood, Equinox) and/or additional mags.
Though not my first choice, would also consider a straight trade for a Sig p238.
Would also consider a quality J-frame size revolver or Ruger LC9/LC9S +cash.
I will consider other trades for CCW style pistols but these are the ones I'm primarily interested in.
Otherwise will sell for 400 firm.
Best way to reach me is by text to 316-619-9eight5four.

I also installed an APEX tactical Competition trigger so this gun is competition ready. Trigger pull is so soft and crisp.

Got this on trade from a buddy of mine, but I already have a Kel-tec PF9 single stack and I just don't need this one.  He fired it less than 100 rounds before trading it to me for a mil-spec 1911 and my brother fired it another 100 rounds or so during one of our range sessions.  Shoots well and seems to carry well (although I've only carried it around the house to try it out, never carried by me outside the house).  I find that the PF9 feels better to me.  This Kell-tec has a shrink wrapped trigger to aid in the comfort of shooting it. 

NC PPP or CCP required for transfer per NC state law. NO exceptions.

This is a true double action (meaning each time the trigger is pulled the hammer falls as opposed to needing to rack the slide to reset the hammer in any fashion).  Feel free to email with questions.
