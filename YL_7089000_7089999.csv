The first Beretta 92 series pistols were made in Italy in the late 70's and of those only the first couple thousand included what they call a step slide. The step slide was a weight reducing feature used to better balance the pistol. As you can see the Original Beretta 92's also have a 1911 style frame safety which many shooters prefer(Notice the coveted limted edition Beretta Centennials also include this feature). In addition, they have a euro style bottom mag release, rounded trigger guard, and rich Italian bluing. I have only ever seen one other of these for sale stateside and it fetched several thousand dollars. This is your chance to own a true piece of history and now that Sig Sauer won the new Military Contract the Beretta 92's 30+ year U.S Military reign is soon coming to an end and these rare pistols will only increase in collector value. This pistol is in excellent unmolested condition and comes with one original magazine and carrying case. Price is $2500/Trade. Thanks"

It does not have a front sight but does have a mount for the rear. The gun has Magpul stock and forend with sling mounts. I added a M-lok rail underneath for a light or laser.  It has an extended mag tube for an additional round making it 6+1 capacity. The gun is a unique olive drab color. Odd but it grows on you.  I am assuming it has been configured as a home defense gun. A simple barrel swap would make it a hunting gun.I want $300 for it. I'll trade for a small or large handgun.

There is nothing wrong with the 12 gauge shell, but if you want to put more pellets on your target, it's a forgone conclusion that a good 10 gauge gun will do just that. The black finish, BPS 10 Gauge Stalker isn't just a workhorse, it's a Clydesdale. Whether you're going after high flying geese or a big Tom, you will be able to tip the odds in your favor with the most reliable, well-made and accurate pump shotgun on the market.   The BPS stands apart from other pump shotguns. With it's forged and machined steel receiver with dual steel action bars it is one tough shotgun. Simply stated it's a tough shotgun. Also unique to the BPS is the bottom feed and ejection port - instead of flinging empty hulls out to one side, empties drop straight to the ground underneath the action. This eliminates visual distraction when hunting airborne game, but it also keeps empty hulls from flying in the face of a left-handed shooter. In fact, this feature combined with the top tang safety makes the gun truly ambidextrous - a boon for families with left-handed and right-handed shooters. Browning BPS 10 Gauge Stalker"

This is a true combination muzzle brake / compensator / flash hider. Its performance is matched only by the amazing look of this device.The VG6 Epsilon 556 carries many of the same characteristics as the Gamma556 with a few exceptions. Extended flash hiding prongs and no ports at the 12 o’clock positions allow uninhibited view from flash through optics or sights. The difference in porting is also noticed on the underside of the device where it has 6 valve holes to allow the fastest gasses reaching the second chamber to exit. This creates very soft low energy recoil that allows for absolute control. The VG6 Epsilon 556 carries all these specs and is priced well below our competitors.

Meticulous triggers built by our staff toolmakers ... without a stopwatch in sight.No question, we’re particular about accuracy. Everyone knows that one of the smartest improvements an AR-owner can do to their rifle is a precision trigger upgrade. Everyone also knows that LaRue Tactical has a track-record of doing things right. The LaRue MBT-2S was purposefully designed and manufactured to render the greatest benefits from our legendary line of accurate rifles. The MBT-2S can also replace the stock trigger on any mil-spec AR lower receiver.Sparing no expense, all major components are precision-machined from S7 Tool Steel. The result of this extra effort is a glass-smooth, hyper-consistent trigger that will satisfy even the most scrupulous competition shooter, but also be overly rugged for the battlefield. The MBT-2S breaks crisply at 4.5 lbs (2.5 lb first stage, 2 lb second stage) and has a smooth and positive reset. Each trigger comes with an additional ""heavy"" trigger spring that increases the pull weight to 6 lbs.Made in-house, in Texas, in the USA."
