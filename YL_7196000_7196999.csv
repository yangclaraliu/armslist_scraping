This rifle was the bridge between wartime rifles and commercial hunting rifles, between WWI and the period leading to WWII. With a serial number of 9912 and the barrel date code of RT, this rifle was made in November of 1926. This exact rifle with a very close serial number but a faded finish is at Monty Whitley right now for $1395. Only 22,800 of these rifles (all varieties) were ever made. If you are reading this, you probably know what this rifle is. Remington was left with a load of M1917 rifles and parts at the end of WWI. They converted the military rifle into the FIRST centerfire bolt-action commercial sporting rifle Remington made. Major changes included removal of the rear sight at the top rear of the receiver and to ""hide"" this surgery, they put the crosshatch lines on the top ""to reduce glare"". They removed the ears from the front sight and did a mild redesign of the receiver to make it sleeker. The barrel length for the rifles made at this time was 22 inches, so it is a handy, quick-pointing rifle. The military finish was removed and they put an exceptional deep and glossy blue finish on. This rifle is a 98% finish gun! They dont make bluing like this anymore and this rifle made it 90 years with no fading or wear. I have photos of the barreled action from all angles as well as I checked for corrosion everywhere and it is phenomenal top and bottom. The right side of the stock has the cutout for the Lyman #48 rear sight that was an option on some versions and standard on others. This rifle has the factory original barrel mounted rear sight. You can see when you remove the stock, how they attached the sight around the barrel. The receiver has the factory mount holes for that Lyman sight and has mounting holes for a scope on the top as well, which have screws filling them. I have the pair of vintage ""swing-away"" mounts I will include. The stocks at this time had the schnaeble front and factory checkering. The receiver still has the stripper clip guides (on a sporting rifle) and the bolt cocks on opening. The first small batch of rifles were cock-on-closing but this was changed early in production. Speaking of production, during its 1921 to 1939 production, and including all of the variations, only about 22,800 total were produced. Ah, the bore....is AMAZING! I have photos of the bore as well. The sling you see attached is an original leather and brass military sling from WWI (not sure if it was for the 1917 or a 1903). It has cracks and shows age but is still complete and works. Here are the negatives, the flaws. This is a very short list. The rifles came with the original steel buttplate but firing a compact and lightweight 30-06 can be....less than fun. Most of these rifles have had a recoil pad attached and this one has a professionally and perfectly mounted Davis Sporting Goods (long gone I think)pad. The ONLY flaw I can find is a white streak on the wood in front. It will remove and there is zero impression into the wood. It is just a streak on top but I prefer to not mess with it and let the owner do so. I have complete photos of every angle and area which I can send to anyone who wishes to see a different view. I also have photos of all markings and proofs. I also have a lot of information about the history of the 30 Express. A VERY rare opportunity to own a piece of Remington history and the bridge between battle rifles and sporting rifles. It will be a century old soon!

Leopold mounts, Reloading Dies & brass included.  CALIBER: .300 WSM Adjustable muzzle brake reduces felt recoil by 30%. The FHSAK  features a hinged floorplate, muzzle brake, swivel studs, and Savage’s AccuTrigger system. The AccuTrigger system features a dual-stage trigger design. The first (vented) trigger acts to disengage a safety mechanism, allowing the second trigger to be depressed in order to activate the firing pin. The trigger assembly is also user-adjustable for weight of pull. The FHSAK also features Savage’s patented AccuStock system. The AccuStock includes an integral aluminum spine that runs the length of the forearm, resulting in a more rigid stock that allows the barrel to float freely. In addition, the AccuStock is bedded so as to apply both horizontal and vertical (3-dimensional) pressure to the action. This achieves in a tighter fit between stock and action, resulting in increased overall gun accuracy. The Model 16 FHSAK is drilled and tapped for scope mounts.On consignment owner moving to east coast great buy!!!"

You can use this to check the feet per second with your reloads for your rifle, handgun or other firearms along with air rifles, airsoft, paintball markers and even arrows and golfballs!

It allows you to cycle through shot number, hi FPS, lo FPS, avg FPS, standard deviation, extreme speed and total of number of shots this sequence.

The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.
The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.
Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated de-cocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.
An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.
Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm.
