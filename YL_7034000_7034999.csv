The early proofs on the barrel shank of the Type 53 will have both Chinese characters and the number 26 or 296. The Chinese characters translate to "" 53 Year Type "" and the 26 or 296 are the stamping of the State Factory at Chongqing. In many later production Type 53's the Chinese characters are not present but it is not known why the characters were dropped. The shank proofs also became larger in 1960 but again the reason for this action is not entirely clear. The Chinese did not use the large number of stamps on the carbine's metal as their Soviet allies; however, the Chinese more than made up for this with the large number of proofs that appear on most Type 53 stocks. It is not uncommon to have ten or more various stamps on these stocks. The wood used on most of these stocks is not the high quality as that used in the Soviet carbines; however, the wood on the Type 53 is quite solid and competent. The Chinese utilized a local wood that is known as CHU-wood. The CHU-wood was put to use as it was quite effective in standing up to so called ""Jungle Rot."" The wood was quite proficient in resisting moisture, so was a perfect choice for the environment of Asia. There are some Type 53 stocks that have their serial numbers matched to the carbines, with these numbers appearing on the left side on the stock. 3% Surcharge on Credit Card sales.NO CALIF SALES!"

""If"" you can find these available in this caliber-you have very good luck or resources….then you’ll pay all the extras to get it. This is a review:  Overall, the Baby Desert Eagle exhibited excellent accuracy potential. In short, this is a quality firearm with much to recommend. The pistol’s fit, finish and the materials used show attention to detail and high quality. The pistol has an appearance more in keeping with a high-end civilian pistol rather than a mass-produced military pistol. Those wishing to own a quality handgun of traditional material that is accurate and pleasant to fire will find much merit in this handgun. This pistol features a safety that allows cocked-and-loaded carry, which is hammer cocked and safety on....The primary advantage of this safety is the pistol may be placed on safe during tactical movement. After the first shot is fired and you are in a gun battle, you would not wish to decock the pistol. The BE allows a superior tactical safety and features a slide design that rides inside of the frame rails rather than outside the frame rails. This allows for greater contact between the long bearing surfaces and greater accuracy potential. Below is the link for you to view cost and specs. Once you put this in your hand...it a done deal, you'll fall in love. Seriously!Also IF INTERESTED I have 3 extra BRAND NEW magazines (making total of 6), purchased at $44 ea ($132.00 value) and will consider for right deal/cashPlease research this firearm: https://www.magnumresearch.com/Firearms/Magnum-Research-Baby-Desert-Eagle-II-45ACP-Steel-Semi-compact-10-round.asp"

I love this rifle immensely, but unfortunately I am moving to California, and will not be able to bring it with me. This is a package deal.
Background information:
I've owned it for a couple years and am the original owner. I've put about 1,500 rounds through it, and not once has she so much as murmered a complaint about what ammo I was feeding her.
I've owned a lot of guns, but this is hands down the most reliable one I've ever layed my hands on. She's got a couple knicks and scratches on the paint, and she is by no means a safe queen.
I clean her religiously. There are a few things not stock, which I will list below.
 
Modifications:
I had a low profile gas block installed, as well as a UTG free floating quad rail. Installation was done by Allison and Carey Gunworks located here in Portland. I have fired her throroughly since then, and she has not so much as hiccuped.
Aside from the gas block and handguard, everything on the rifle is factory stock. I still have the original A2 handguard and A2 front sight, so you can revert her to her stock configuration if you wish to do so.
I have a number of accessories installed as well, which I will list below:
Accessories:
- UTG Tactical Bipod with thumbscrew
- Streamlight 1000 lumen weapon mounted flashlight with thumbscrew mount. Has 3 modes: Bright, strobe, and dim.
- 6 Magpul rail covers and 1 Magpul XTM Handstop Kit
- Quick Release sling mount
- Condor Speedy 2 Point Sling
- 45 degree aluminum canted iron sights
- Off-brand red dot sight (surprisingly useful and reliable for $20 off Amazon, I have had no issues with it)
* I also have a UTG 30mm SWAT 3-12x44 AO Rifle Scope, which has been barely used, but has been great.
- Removable shoulder pad on stock
- Magpul Rear Flip Up Sight
 
Magazines:
Five 30 round PMAGs
Four 40 round PMAGs
One 30 round Windham Weaponry aluminum magazine
One Lula mag loader
 
Ammo:
300+ rounds of American Eagle 62 grain green tip - One box is unopened, the other box is opened.
150+ rounds of American Eagle 55 grain FMJ - Some unopoened boxes, some loose rounds.
75+ rounds of Hornady TAP 55 grain V-Max - 3 boxes unopened, the rest is loose rounds.
100 rounds of HPR Black Ops 62 grain OTF - 3 boxes unopened, the rest are loose rounds.
 
The retail price on the accessories, magazines and ammunition alone comes out to $700 (not including shipping).
The lowest retail price for an LE6920 I can find locally is $800.
However that's for brand new products, and I don't expect a buyer to pay retail price for used gear, no matter how good the condition is (though you're welcome to--I wont complain).
 
Because of this, for the package deal, I am willing to part with everything for $995, or the best offer presented to me.
I however will not be lowballed on this. If you're looking for a $500 AR, this is not the one for you.
If you are looking for an exceptionally well built, reliable home defense weapon, this is the AR package deal of a lifetime. Don't let it pass you by.
I am willing to part out the ammo, magazines and accessories, but I will not offer as steep of a discount.
 
For questions, inquries or bargaining, please call or text Zack at REDACTED
This is a first come, first serve basis."

With the update of the GLOCK 27, they improved the ergonomics with interchangeable backstraps and a reversible magazine catch for the left handed shooters. It wasn't long after GLOCK's acceptance by American shooters that the need for a smaller model geared towards concealed carriers was identified. To produce a handgun that was the right size to appeal to shooters that plan on hiding it in plain sight, GLOCK redesigned the popular GLOCK 23 into a new pistol they called the GLOCK 27. With a redesigned locking block, reworked frame and an all new dual recoil spring, the GLOCK 27, also known as the ""baby GLOCK"" was a fresh take on the now proven design. Shooters all over the world turn to the Glock 27 for its robust, reliable design that continues to perform in even the most demanding of environments. With a 9 round capacity magazine, the GLOCK 27 is a perfect choice for a police officer's looking for a backup gun to their GLOCK 22 or 23, as well as off duty or plain clothes work and concealed carriers.
