Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

The,only issues is the butt stock is gone. We have a redneck improvised ""pistol grip"". The fire grip is also cracked. If someone wanted a project gun or a just in case gun this would work for them.
The gun is nice and has some engraving on the side of the chamber. I am not a,wood worker but if you are a stock for this would not be hard to make. One near thing is the break lever is a push button in front of the trigger guard.

Anyway just call, text or email if interested. Or if you can make a stock let me know I might just keep it.
Thanks.

This DPMS AR-15 A3 Upper Receiver Assembly is a complete, dedicated rimfire conversion upper in 22 Long Rifle that is ready to install on any standard small pin lower receiver.

For useful, realistic sub-caliber training purposes, this upper offers the familiar operating controls and handling characteristics of a full power AR-15, but without the associated high priced ammunition.

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide. You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00.

338,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3573338,For Sale:  Blast from the Past - Beretta Mod. 950BS Jetfire in .25 ACP. **FINAL REDUCTION**,"Palm Harbor, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 155,"Listed On: Monday, October 6, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Beretta Mod. 950BS in .25 ACP. - Private sale of an older classic Beretta in good condition. Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide. You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven. If interested, respond with your name and telephone #. Cash only. No trades."

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide. You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven. If interested, respond with your name and telephone #. Cash only. No trades."

This rifle is the newest incarnation of the wildly popular AR-50 chambered for the powerful 50 BMG cartridge. A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V-shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenges of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition.

I'm looking to purchase (5) fully sealed unopened 40 round on stripper clips boxes of 7.62x39  Yugoslavian military surplus ammunition.
I'm looking to purchase (5) boxes for two reasons. 
The 1st is I want 20 guaranteed genuine Yugo stripper clips to use in my Yugo and the 2nd reason being I have never got to shoot any Yugo surplus ammo. That and it'll give me a legitimate reason to spend too much time cleaning the hell out of my firearm instead of doing everything else I'm supposed to be doing. The stuffs corrosive as all hell.

It's a great, accurate, surprisingly fun gun to shoot and absolutely beautiful.  It's impossible to tell just how great this gun looks in the photo, the grip is a very bright deep purple but the slide is a pearlescent purple also.  It turns heads not only by how great it looks but it has that Sig quality and accuracy you can't find anywhere else.  

We've shot exactly 24 rounds through this gun.  It was never carried.  Comes with everything that it came with new, plastic case, cable lock, plastic holster, and a total of 4 6 round flush magazines!  This model only came with one new but I purchased 3 more, so enjoy!  

The night sights are great on this model, and even though it is small enough to fit in your pocket, it is not too small to shoot really well.  Barely any recoil, follow up shots are easy.  Great little shooter.  My wife just doesn't like cocked-and-locked carry method.  Can be transferred on efa10 within reasonable distance to Worcester/Millbury/Uxbridge.

I will also include 276 rounds of .380 to get you started!  That's a whole lot of carry and range fun.

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide. You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven. If interested, respond with your name and telephone #. Cash only. No trades."

This has a first year manufacture date as indicated by a 3 digit no prefix serial number.  This rifle is in good overall condition.  There are some bright case colors remaining on the receiver (mainly on the rear of the left side).  The barrel bluing rates about 80-85% with some scattered surface freckles.  The wood is in good shape without cracks or chips and the bore is excellent.  I have many other photos available.   I am looking for reasonable cash offers but will also consider trade offers.  I am mainly interested in nice S&W or Colt revolvers, 1911’s, or, Sig Sauer pistols but open to others.  Please research these before inquiring.  I have an $800 cash price in mind which I believe to be very fair for what this rifle is.  Thanks.

The all-LED M900V gives you the additional ability to choose either brilliant 150-lumen white light or invisible infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between output modes. In either mode, the M900V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for short- to medium-range applications. The high-efficiency LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. 

 Three switches control the primary beam, in either spectrum: two momentary-on grip pressure pads (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), and a constant-on rotary switch. The M900V also features low-output white LED navigation lights that are activated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. A rotary system-disable switch turns all lights off to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage. 

 The M900V clamps solidly to any long gun equipped with a Picatinny rail via its integral M93 Swing-Lever™ rail clamp, which self-adjusts to off-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from vibration or recoil. Weatherproof O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out the elements. Made from extremely tough Nitrolon® polymer and CNC-machined aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing, the M900V is available in Black (BK) or Desert Tan (TN) body color.
