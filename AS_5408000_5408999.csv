The popular Bobtail Commander is now available in the Valor series in the form of the V-Bob. The Valor series is our flagship line, meaning it’s the best we have to offer. Frankly, we feel it is the best built production 1911 on the market.The V-Bob is loaded with features, including a forged Bobtail frame with 25 LPI checkering front and back, an undercut trigger guard, tactical ledge night sights, VZ slim line G10 grips, EGW carry bevel bushings as well as our tool-steel fire controls and other premium small parts. Every piece that goes into the Valor series is hand-fit, polished and blended to provide you with not only the best functioning gun we can provide, but also the best looking.The V-Bob can be had with either a matte stainless glass bead finish or our super durable black Duty finish. This finish is a revolutionary treatment process that actually bonds to the components and creates a super-durable matte black skin. Our Duty Black finish beats any of the spray-and-bake finishes most companies use today, hands down. Our durability testing proves it and our customers love it – which is proof enough for us!"

They play longer than just about anything I have hit lately. I just couldn't control my shots with them due to the shaft flex not being right for my swing speed.

The gun has has 50 rounds through it.Ruger 10/22 Takedown Semi-Auto Rimfire RifleBuilt on a solid reputation for reliability and accuracy, the Ruger® 10/22® is one of the most popular, and widely used Rimfire Rifles in the US. The 10/22 Takedown Model is well suited for having a survival gun stowed in a vehicle, boat, or plane, or at a cabin or home. It makes an easy-to-carry camp gun, perfect for backpacking and canoe trips. The Takedown splits into 2 subassemblies right in front of the receiver by simply pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. No tools are needed. To ensure consistent accuracy, the 10/22 Takedown has an adjustment knob to eliminate play between the halves. After reassembly, the firearm returns to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used. Its 2-piece carbine-style synthetic stock features a curved, checkered butt that stays put on the shoulder and textured surfaces on the pistol grip and fore-end to provide a solid hold in harsh weather. The barrel is made of corrosion resistant stainless steel. The 10/22 utilizes a simple blowback semi-auto action, and a 10-shot rotary magazine, both of which are legendary for reliability. (Takedown Model uses readily available, standard 10/22 magazines.) The 10/22 Takedown comes with a fine, gold bead front sight dovetailed into a barrel band, and an adjustable, folding rear sight. The included scope base screws onto the drilled and tapped receiver, and is compatible with both Weaver®-style and 3/8"" tip-off scope rings. An extended magazine release allows for rapid reloading. A backpack-style carrying case comes with the 10/22 Take-Down, with compartments for the 2 halves, plus extra pockets, mag pouches, and webbing loops. The Ruger 10/22 Takedown Semi-Auto Rimfire Rifle is an indispensible, go-to firearm to have on hand for emergency self-defense, hunting, or survival situations.

If you don't know much about them they are some of the highest quality handguns ever produced. It has a totally forged steel frame, slide and barrel. These are Spanish military handguns and it was actually in the competition to be the U.S. military's service handgun. It lost to the M9 only because of the weight (it's forged steel). But they are known to be built like tanks and will last many millenia!!! This one is a steal. Just the gun sells for about $500 when they come up AND it has three factory magazines, two stainless and one blue. The magazines themselves sell for a minimum of $75 each. This pistol has one or two small scratches but has been fired very minimally. I would say less than 50 times. It is near mint with a like new bore and chamber. It was manufactured in the late 1980s. It is basically a design cross between a Browning HiPower with a cammed barrel and a Sig 210 with internal rails which provide unbelievable stability. It also has a steel full length guide rod from the factory. The industry went alloy frame in the 1990s and polymer after that. This is quality equal to the finest pistols ever made from the 1930s to the 1980s. It is 15+1 also and has a decocker on the safety that is ambidextrous. Very rare opportunity on this one and there is a huge collector market for these pistols. It sold new for $575 when it was new."

Shotgun has a fair amount of wear on the outside, but no major rust or pitting. Bore is perfect. The barrel has been cut down to 18in and has no front bead sight. These were made by Nobel back in the 1960s for retail sales at Montgomery Wards. This is a Nobel Model 60 to be exact. I bought this for $100, but required about $50 in parts from Numrich to fix a couple broken and missing items. It shoots and ejects fine, but loading shells isn't as smooth as it should be. Has some sharp edging inside that is gripping the shells as they load. Anyone proficient with a set of files can deburr this to smooth it out. It also has a sticky shell block, meaning it sometimes loads a shell, sometimes not cause the shell block is stuck uipward in the way. Reason being was the factory one wasn't working doing anything in terms of stopping. When I pumped it it would dump all shells in the tube. So I bought a replacement from Numrich, but for a 16ga. Only difference between the 12ga and 16ga ver was the 16ga one has more metal on it. So I had to file some of it down to get it to work. But this is where it sticks. I'm not a gunsmith by any means so this is something that should be fitted by a professional gunsmith. Otherwise the shotgun works fine. Will also include a pistol grip with itI have 150 into this but willing to eat some of that. Asking 120 FTF in Brighton"
