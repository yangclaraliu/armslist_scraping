This 338 Win. Mag. load offers the rapid initial expansion of the tipped (TTSX) TSX bullet, yet it still penetrates deeply as do all TSX style bullets. This bullet is best suited for use on animals under 800 lbs where the greater impact damage is beneficial and where enormous amounts of penetration are wasted. Even though I have killed 1500lb moose (with one shot) with this exact load, I prefer the deeper penetration of our item 52B (225gr. TSX) for animals that large.

Both my 338’s have custom 22 inch barrels as the below velocities show. For your reference, 24 inch barrels will GENERALLY give almost 75 fps more velocity than 22 inch barrels and 26 inch barrels will GENERALLY give 50 to 60 fps more than 24 inch barrels.

The action is glass bedded and the barrel is free floated. I also have a 7mm boresnake, all of the reloading components, and Lee Loader to reload 7mm Rem Mag. I have ~130 bullets (~80 Hornady 162grn.

It would come with an MTM 50 round ammo box and 20 pieces of brass (~15 are already loaded up). Only factory spec reloads or lighter have been put through this rifle. I've only put about 20 rounds through it since I bought it ~1 year ago. I just don't use it enough to justify keeping it.

Windham Weaponry AR-15 Rifle with Carbon Fiber Upper and Lower Receiver, 16″ Barrel, 6-Position Collapsible Stock, Flash Suppressor, Flat Top Upper Receiver and Gas Block- R16M4FTT-CF1

The Windham Weaponry Carbon Fiber SRC was born out of the latest carbon fiber composite molding technology to bring you an AR type rifle of incredibly light weight – without sacrificing any Windham Weaponry quality, durability, accuracy or value. All the same high quality components of our standard models are married with carbon fiber molded receivers, and with our Lifetime Transferable Warranty, you can be guaranteed we will stand behind its quality for a lifetime.

Windham Weaponry’s carbon fiber composite molded receivers bring much more than light weight to the range! Carbon fiber receivers will dissipate heat faster than aluminum, have no surface finish to wear off, and the carbon fiber composite has an inherent lubricity that enhances long wear. Windham Weaponry’s receiver molds were created at a state of the art design facility to yield a
superior fit and function while utilizing many standard AR parts. Our Carbon Fiber Receivers retain all the recognizeable features of the AR platform, but are molded with a unique “billet machined” appearance – think Darth Vader meets the AR world.

Everyone knows about these mosins or might know something about them.


Tula Hex 1931 low serial , and umm did I mention was unfired. It has 100 in it now from me.

Well what does that mean to you. Not much really if you just want any old mosin from any old year. This one is special.

After doing my anallickit research like i always do i found out there was 150000 of these made at the russian tula in 1931. This is serial in the mid 30000 range. Quite a low number if you take into fact the Izzy manufacturing plant made several million in difference to the tula ones.

There was no sear wear, no mish mash of metal. No rub wear no nothing when i got it.
The finish is a very pristine dark color that is so sexy and appealing you have got to see it. The workmanship on this hex tula is excellent with not a single machine mark like all the others you have seen are. This one was made with love and care and it deserves to be in a home that will love and care for it just as i have.


It has had around 100 rounds through it as i keep pretty close track of round counts in all my items.

So, the question again is what does that matter to me and why am i even reading all this bullcrap anyways.

Well, here is YOUR chance to own this. The price is not the usual 200 you find at cabellas or sols pawn shop or arms and ammo in fremont or trade n post. 

Since this one is so special its more. Why more you ask. Quite simple. You will never find one like this for sale again. When people find items like this they go safely queened or lost by grandpa or what ever.

The brilliance of the metal. The clean breaking action and the crisp bolt all with matching serials make this one incredible investment. I am not quite giving it away since this isnt a fire sale but you can get with me right now by exiting this advertise and sending me I WANT IT for 300 bucks and its yours.  
It shoots pure at 200 yard gong at engc. I have pegged it 6 times in a row. The accuracy of this is superb.

Included is the:
Bayonet  still wrapped in paper
The dog collars and sling that does with it.
a hard case so as to keep it beautiful
Ammo to shoot for sale also if you want at less than i paid for it as a not free item but discount of ten bucks per 20 and i think I have 5 packs left of the copper wash 1975 

Soooo....  here is the scoop.

requires:

funding

purchase permit

meeting place and time and ability to meet me someplace. omaha or lincoln or fremont.

a love and respect for a spectacular machine such as this.

Just think, you , yes the person reading this can own today a piece of history that is special. yes they made millions of these. yes you can get one at cabelas for 200. No you cant get one like this a anywhere i have seen local or online.

The guy I bought this from his exact words were 'She's too pretty to shoot', and yes she is. I hope this finds someone fast enough to email me as I am a pretty agressive salesperson and always have many avenues of direct sale or trade for my items.
armslist is not the only game in town but it has server me well and I really enjoy making someone special like yourself happy with something like this.

This was unfired when i bought it. Like how do i know your asking. It has had 5 packs of 20 piped through it. It is most likely the best copy of a mosin i have ever seen. It was made at the tula in 1931 it is a low serial number under 30,000 for the year of 1931 that they made 150000 at the tula plant. It is in mint condition. There are a couple of handling marks I was going to work on but the wifes car broke and needed fixed last week so my time was spent with that. Included will be the other packs of ammo I have. Most of it is copper washed made in 1976 some is 1955 and maybe a few misc others. It will come in a nice hard case.

A fusion of our most advanced performance features in both tactical and varmint rifles, the Model 700™ Varmint-Tactical Rifle (VTR™) is a revolutionary system optimized for extended-range precision and mobility. Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid heat dissipation.

To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that’s machined-in during production. Along with the new barrel design, we brought together a host of other cutting-edge features on our super accurate Model 700 platform. The results are nothing short of astounding."

It's been cleaned twice (before and after shooting) and has only had 33 rounds shot through it. It's never been dropped, scratched, or mistreated in anyway. It's been kept inside my gun safe in my room ever since I bought it. I'm selling it because I don't have as much time to go shoot as I thought I would and it just sits. It comes just how I got it (In Glock manufacturers box with manual, 3 13 round magazines, gun lock cable, cleaning brush, speed loader, backstraps, etc). It also comes with the 2 holsters I've bought for it. I have an IWB custom kydex (wolf grey) (bought from JC Custom Kydex-online) which was $75 and a Blackhawk sportster OWB with paddle and belt loops which was $35. Both of these are for a left handed shooter. However, the kydex one can be used as an OWB holster for a right handed shooter. The Glock was $575 with tax, the kydex was $75, and the blackhawk was $35. That's $160 in savings on a very, very slightly used Glock with accessories.

The ultimate starter rifle for the first time 
muzzleloading enthusiast (.50 Caliber)

The Buckhorn 209 Magnum is an ultra-modern, conventional in-line muzzleloader. The heart of this high-tech gun is the precision-rifled 24” barrel with a 1:28” twist. It is powered by a modern 209-primer ignition system that will handle 150 grain magnum charges with ease. In those States where 209 primers are not allowed, the Buckhorn can be easily be converted to a #11 or musket cap ignition by simply changing the breech plug and adding the correct nipple.

 The Buckhorn comes standard with a thumb-actuated safety, DuraSight All-Metal Fiber Optic sights that are great in low light conditions, dual-barrel retention points and a bullet guiding muzzle. A feature that sets this gun apart from the competition is its compact new stock design. The Buckhorn’s unique stock features raised dot grip panels to ensure a comfortable, non-slip grip, and a Crush Zone recoil pad on the butt-stock which gives the gun a comfortable feel with reduced recoil.

The Anderson Rifle is The World’s Only NO LUBE Rifle

The Anderson Rifle is the only rifle in the world that never requires lubrication. It is only possible because it is permanently treated with RF85, the nano technology that injects calcium into the molecular fabric of the metal. RF85 is permanent. It is IN the metal. RF85 reduces friction 85% and wears with the metal. Under heat and pressure the calcium nano particles elongate and form a protective barrier that eliminates the need for lubrication.

An ancillary benefit arises because without an oily film to catch carbon particles, the rifle runs cleaner much longer. A typical lubricated weapon traps the carbon byproducts from explosives. Under the heated conditions found in weapons, the gooey mess turns into tar which bakes into a solid mass and fouls the chamber. The result is life-threatening weapon failure.

The Anderson Rifle uses RF85 nano-technology to fire with
•85% Less Friction
•23% Faster Action
•Never Needs Oiling
•Cleans Up with Soap & Water

RF85 is proven effective in the medical industry, in automotive and racing, and manufacturing. You can read the independent reports by Oak Ridge National Laboratories here.

Once you understand just how effective this process is, you won’t settle for anything less than an Anderson NO LUBE Rifle."

I have here for sale the amazing and highly rated XDm 9mm 3.8 

Its in Like New condition. 

I've done 2 small but important upgrades to it, otherwise its completely stock, and looks and feels new. I've cleaned and maintained it well using FrogLube,  and performs flawlessly.

I added a Pearce pinky extender to the smaller magazine, so now it feels much better when using it (and looks much better too)

Also, I installed TractionGrips to the grip of this XDm. The Springfield grip was great out of the box, and its even better now. They're a very nice upgrade and won't slide off or wear out, but if you don't like it, they come off pretty easily and leave no residue or stickiness behind!

Comes with the original case, all the paperwork, lock, etc etc etc that came with it, PLUS….. I'm also included a nice nylon holster for it. 

Offering all of that, including the upgrades and holster, for just $520. 

Face to Face. I will not ship.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.  Not here to waste anyone's time or mine-- feel free to inspect thoroughly, you won't be disappointed.

Buy this one here at cost without paying for labor to have one built or having to spend hours of your time doing a proper break in. The Black rifle in the second pic is only an example of what the lower cost build would look like. This is a no bull shit sale and I guarantee you can not buy one with these components for this cheap anywhere else. May take trades just ask looking for a Kimber or a good conceal carry gun and maybe some other semi auto handguns as well.  Call or text REDACTED

Taurus provides an unlimited lifetime warranty to the gun, not the owner, so if anything should ever come up Taurus will handle.  I’m not as accurate with revolvers as semi-autos, but I can say of all the many revolvers I’ve shot this one is highly impressive with great accuracy...I’m sure the heavier frame has something to do with that, at least for me.

$389
The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber.

Barrel is in good condition and shows decent rifling intact. Includes one factory 10rd magazine and rubber grip sleeve.
$189
The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members.The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

967,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3588967,For Sale:  45 Osprey SilencerCo,"Howell, Michigan, United States",$ 749,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 31, 2015",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"YOU CAN BUY THIS HERE>45 Osprey SilencerCo

With the modern combat handgun in mind, SilencerCo set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. SilencerCo went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP. 

Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun.

The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length.

This is one of the first 6"" guns to leave the factory. I bought it new and it has been well cared for.
It is utterly reliable and as accurate as a custom built .45. I have had it out for PPC and pins two or three times a year. It is match winning accurate for bullseye and PPC. I have two recoil plugs and different springs. (The one plug lets a person use standard length 1911 recoil springs) One for pins and factory loads and another for lighter bullseye, PPC loads.
The factory trigger is included as well as are the factory magazine base pads. Dawson magwell. The three magazines have extended pads and all three hold 16 rounds of .45 each. Nice adjustable sights and fiber optic front sight.There is a tan Bianchi 50P 6"" 1911 holster too.  Box papers and everything that came with it new. The red seen by the grip screws are O-rings. Para Hi-caps have tiny, short grip screws that often shoot loose. These O-rings slipped over the grip screws keep them tight. Nothing worn or modified about them but a worthwhile addition.
It is perfect mechanically and still a very nice looking set up.
I have much positive feed back on Gunbroker and E-bay. Username  mstuhr at G broker and mstuhr63670 at e-bay.
Deer hunt? IPSC? PPC? You name it this baby will go!"
