Mr. Shannon is well known for his engraving skills. His trademark was the engraving ""SHANNON"" on the trigger guard of the pistols that he engraved. This was presented to a retiring Tennessee State Highway Patrolman in the early 1970's. At his death this Colt was passed to his wife and at her death it was inherited by their son. The son made the decision to sell this Colt due to health reasons. This was in a night stand drawer for 40+ years.t is not perfect but considering the lack of attention it has received over the years it is in remarkable condition. There is a small nickel blemish on the bottom of the trigger guard and another very minor spot on the cylinder. (highlighted in the pictures) This would be a great addition to anyone who appreciates Mr. Shannon's work, the history on this gun and the potential appreciation in value of this unique firearm."

The total round count is roughly around 1k at this point as it had roughly 500-600 rounds fired when I bought it.  It is in great condition and has been stored in a climate controlled environment.  Also included are 4 magazines, 3 are HK and 1 is Pro Mag (I believe).  1 of the HK magazines holds 12 rounds, the rest are all 10 round magazines.  Also included is the original grey HK hard plastic case the pistol came in.  $1500 OBO."

It's also a Romanian AK-47 The arm sling is made for the AK-47 and the clips are also metal. No plastic. The side fold shortens the gun length only about 2 inches so if the gun is too long you can use it that way or you can hip fire it with the side fold stock folded. Anyway you slice it. It's a great gun. Has been in my family for a decade and still shoots like the day I bought it. The stamped receivers may not be as high quality but allow more heat displacement thus last longer than milled. I've done all the research, but do more if you must and then let me know.Hope to hear from someone. REDACTEDREDACTED"

Offering for sale a Zastava CZ99, manufactured in Serbia and imported into the US by EAA as an EAA ""EZ9"" 9mm. This is a very well-regarded, if somewhat obscure, series of pistols. I'd recommend checking out some video reviews on Youtube if you'd like to learn more. This pistol has a nice stainless barrel, steel slide, and aluminum frame. In size and overall shape, it is very similar to a Sig P226. The magazine release and slide release are completely ambidextrous, and the slide release doubles as a decocking lever. Insert your magazine, press once to lock the slide into battery, and press down a second time to safely lower the hammer.This was my car gun for a couple of years. Overall, this pistol has only fired 25rds of Hornady defense ammunition to ensure function. Also included are five 15rd magazines and a hard case.
