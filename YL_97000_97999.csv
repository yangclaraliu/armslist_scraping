This revolver locks up tight being in good cosmetic and mechanical condition with the finish being about 95 percent or better (as I am no expert in the grading of these just going on my opinion that defers from person to person) with the metal surface having minor handling marks and finish loss, the bore is bright and shiny with the factory wood grips being in good condition with minor handling marks with no visual breaks, cracks or repairs.

Here's what I have:
Dean Flying Z
Fender Telecaster Squire
Samick acoustic-electric
Samick 5 string bass with UFO frets
Kansas Strat knock off
1963 Teisco electric hollowbody

Combined value of about 800-1,000, doesn't mean I'm wanting that much out of them though.
All are in wonderful condition, no scratches, dents or dings on any except for the Tele, someone chipped the paint on the head by the tuners.

Also have a vintage 1980's Digitech XP300 Space Station with power cable, works great, only around 1,400 of these left that are working out of 150,000+ they're getting rarer by the day and I have regular offers of $600+ on it from musical collectors and they normally go for the same price on ebay.
I've got a Digitech Whammy pedal as well, valued at around $200.
Also have a PSE 60 pound compound bow I can throw in, worth about 150-180.

Hope someone can make me a deal, my left hand hasn't been able to pin the strings correctly since it was broken, so everything I try to play sounds horrible, I don't need these anymore and I'd rather focus on family safety.
Willing to trade all this outright for a fairly good semi auto, finish/value doesn't matter to me as long as it's mechanically sound and reliable.
Just want something to put by the bed, there's a lot of crackheads and meth addicts in Marshall.

Can send more pics if you want.

Thanks for reading, have a good one."

I had this listed & it didn't move, so my price has moved.  $700 firm, bottom dollar.  Also willing to listen to trades, but not junk. 

This is a very nice, original condition, NOT refinished Winchester 61 pump .22 that shoots shorts, longs, & long rifles.  It has the 24"" round barrel & is about 98 original condition.  The action has that ""new"" feel to it, not a buttery smooth-shot a million rounds feel to it.  Or the hard feeling action of a rusty closet queen.  The sights are original with the ramp in the rear & the copper dot still on the front blade.  Metal butt plate is in place & there are no cracks or breaks, or repairs on the stock.  The fore-arm matches the stock & has no missing ribs or marks on it.  Rifling is perfect.

The only non-gun thing I would consider is a set of Toyo Open Country M/T tires in 285/75/16 NO OTHER NON-GUN ITEMS WANTED.  If your gun is worth $300, don't bother unless you have several hundred in cash to add.  If your gun is rusty, don't bother.   If your tires are anything other than the Toyo specific in that size, don't bother.  If you are under 18, don't bother, If you can't legally own a gun in the state of Mo., don't bother.  If you are a low-baller looking to fill your table for the next gun show, don't bother.  If you are unwilling to drive to pick it up, don't bother.  I think that about covers it.

It has been in my family for many years but, due to some financial circumstances, I find myself forced to sell. I'm not an expert in such matters, but I'd rate the gun approx. 85% in finish and 95% in function (I've only had it to the range a small handful of times in 10 years and have had three failure-to-eject using cheap ball ammo). There is some wear shown in the bluing on the outside of the gun on the slide, but overall it's in fantastic shape for its age and could easily be made perfect by a bluing/restoration specialist. It is being sold with one original magazine.

Below is a link containing a lot of information on the particular model (including fun facts like General Patton used to carry one in WWII). As per the standards described on the site, the gun was manufactured between 1918-1921 and would make an excellent piece for a collector. The same model listed on Gunbroker without reserves are priced between $650-$1100 but I will take the best reasonable offer. I know there are some people out there that like to email and offer 50% of the asking price-- if this is you, please save both of us the trouble and don't do it. I do have some things I need to take care of, but I will not just give the gun away. In addition, I will consider partial trades of subcompact semi-autos (KelTec, Ruger, etc) or even possibly a Derringer.

Please don't hesitate to email me with any questions, specific picture requests, etc. If, for some reason, I cannot get the pictures to load on the ad I'll be happy to email them to you.

Thanks a lot!

You can check out DGR's web site if you wish at: http://dgrguns.com/0-main-page-firearms-for-sale.htm This is a great price for this unit!

I traded my Ar-15 for this just a few weeks ago. The serial number on this gun shows it has been finished in the US, which is getting rare these days. Gun was made in July of 2007. Looking from the gun it has been fired very little. Has no holster wear at all on weapon. There is no difference between a new loaded or this one. I took a loss at trading for this but that happens when your trading for something you really want. This gun is in perfect condition. It has been fired. I would think less than 100rnds. I have myself not fired it. I had the guys at Coal Creek Armory look through the gun and their words were WOW. They said it was near perfect. So they removed all of the rough edges to get it perfect. The gun came from the factory with a black finish. The people from SA told me the finish but I cannot remember ATM. It has factory Novak night sights which are still very bright. I am going back to Glocks so I am wanting to sell all of my 1911 things together with this gun. I will do my very best to list the items that will come with this package.

This gun is in poor shape, however everything is solid on the frame and moving parts all intact, and in working order. Only part missing is the front sight, and the original magazine (there is an alternate magazine which feeds, but does not snap in)  factory bluing has been stripped, and rust pitting on slide exists from the high carbon German steel.......   but it fires. Make an offer, good project gun for beginner or master gunsmith."

** Picatinny Rail optic mount.
