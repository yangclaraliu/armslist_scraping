The outside of the barrels has maintained a smooth, partially blued finish, with that said, there are no pits or rust spots. The stock has a fine oil finish.The double triggers operate flawlessly. Before it was passed down to me it was rarely, if ever fired, essentially it was a closet gun. After looking it over and cleaning it up, I have fired it roughly 250 times shooting skeet.  It has been a joy to own and shoot.I based my price off of looking at other Model 24s for sale online selling for between $350 and $1400. For a 70 year old hunting shotgun, it is in amazing shape.I’ll include a few boxes of bird shot.

4x Redfield scope Serial# indicates early 50's manufacturing date. 
This was one of two of my deceased father's 'go-to' hunting rifles, so there are some signs of wear. However, he did care a great deal for his guns, so there is no neglect, just some wear due to many seasons of hunting deer and elk.There are some dings in stock - most notably a long but very shallow scratch on the butt. Checkering is in great shape. Bluing is average for age, with some fading/loss most noticeable at the muzzle and some bluing ""splotchiness"" if you look closely. Barrel is still bright, still good rifling there, too. Will be a great gun for years into the future. I'm asking less than bluebook value, which puts the bottom dollar value for this gun at $525. The gun is much better than that, but I need the money. (The blue book states value ranges for this model and caliber at between $525 and $1850).Keep as collector, or do as my dad did, and hunt with it. I need to sell this one due to ongoing medical issues of my own (bill collectors). My loss, your gain, as they say. Don't miss out on this desirable pre-64 firearm. $595 OBO. Note: I will require that we meet and transfer ownership via a local gunshop here in Covington, WA. I do appreciate your willingness to work with me on this, as I want to make sure all is done correctly and ACCORDING TO STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. Thank you so much for understanding."
