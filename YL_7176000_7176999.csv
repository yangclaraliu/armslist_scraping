The Aimpoint® Micro T-2 redefines everything you thought you knew about compact red dot sights. Cutting edge lens coatings radically improve the shape and clarity of the 2 MOA red dot and physical protection has been added for even more ruggedness.

At the same time, we decided to improve upon the optical performance of the sight which results in a new lens and an important breakthrough in reflective lens coatings. This makes the Micro T-2 and the 3XMag magnifier a fantastic optical combination.

I purchased it brand new to be my deer gun and had to order it from Benelli as they were nowhere to be found. After 7 months of waiting on the gun I never even bothered to use it as intended. It has been sitting in my Liberty ever since.The gun has never been carried in the field or taken on a hunt. I put a total of 5 slugs through it (Hornady) just to test it out when I first got it. It has since been cleaned twice.The gun comes with a ComfortTech Gel cheek riser ($100) as well as the flat one from the factory. My goal was to put a scope on it but never got around to it. If you decided to mount an optic on it you won't have to worry about adding a cheek piece. It also has the three stock shims so you can adjust it to your fit, as well as the assembly tool. Sling is also included.My loss truly is your gain on this one. These CryoBarrels are insanely accurate and the gun is like brand new. I just have no need for it.The cheapest I can find this gun anywhere online in stock is $750, and thats only two websites. I am asking $500 for everything or best reasonable offer. I will not respond to low-balls. NO TRADES!!!Deer season is only a few months away!!Thanks for looking!"

The typical light gain of these units is around 90,000 times the available light such as stars, moon etc. Most base model gen 3 units have about the same light gathering ability, yes they are much smaller and also cost a minimum 2000.00 for standard units.
A set of AA battery’s will last 20-30 hours under normal use.
These units can identify predator size objects at 300 yards plus, human and deer size objects even further.
The tube in these units has an automatic brightness control referred as a ""ABC"" system which helps prevent the tube from over exposer or ""blooming effect"", this system automatically controls the amount of light that the tube is exposed too. The unit must be protected from daylight exposer by using the supplied daylight filter when it is used during the daylight.
Do your homework on 1st generation cascade tubes to gain a better understanding of how the unit amplifies light!!! The Astronomy group loves these units for their exceptional light gain.
These are very ""heavy duty"" units and if needed repair parts are available, after sales customer service is always welcome!!!

Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster.
