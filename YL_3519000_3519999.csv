Like it a lot and has a 1MOA chevron that is illuminated by tritium, battery and a fiber optic located on the top of the sight.
Little to no use but its a trijicon and is built like a tank.
I have a T1 and a EoTech and only have two AR's so this just acts as a back up optic.
If your looking for a ACOG style red dot that will last you through a SHTF or just going to the rang it will do the job.

The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date.

The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight.

The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated one piece bolt carrier and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A2 front sight post and a LWRC B.U.I.S. folding rear sight

The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price.

For sale is a Yugoslav M48 Mauser, bayonet, 460 rounds of Turk surplus 8mm Mauser and 45 rounds of various soft point modern production 8mm Mauser. The rifle is all matching including the numbered stock and is in very nice shape. The bayonet doesn't match and is covered in cosmoline. The Turk surplus ammo is in 6 70 round bandoliers (420 rounds), and one half full bandolier of 40 rounds (I shot 30 rounds of it with no problems). The modern production ammo is loose, and the majority of it is Federal Power-Shok. I haven't shot any of the modern ammo.

I am asking $450 for everything, or the rifle and bayonet for $300 and the ammo for $160. The only trades I'm interested in are Finnish Mosin Nagants, British Martini Henry rifles, and a certain few older S&W revolvers.

I'm considering parting with one of my favorite weapons due no non-usage (no time to go to the range anymore because of my son). 

If you're looking at this, you probably know how long it takes to get one of these in after ordering...mine took almost a year. I LOVE this gun and currently have 3-31rd mags in addition to the stock 10rd as well as an over the shoulder "" tactical bugout bag""  which it fits into perfectly along with ammo and even another rifle if you'd like. 

I'm accepting offers but if it is going to be a lowball offer, please don't waste either of our time. We both know that these are great weapons that shoot straight and carry easily. 
If you are from outside the state or not legal to own, please do not make any offers...I won't be interested. No trades either, please. 

Thanks for your time, photos can be emailed."

Potent Strength and Power. Ruger Super Redhawk revolvers have all of the advantages of the Ruger Redhawk plus additional features like the unique Ruger cushioned grip system, hammer-forged barrel and an extended frame machined to accept Ruger scope rings.

The potent Ruger Super Redhawk revolvers are popular among hunters, metallic silhouette shooters and those looking for an added level of safety when outdoors in dangerous game country. Ruger Super Redhawks are available in standard satin stainless or the unique low glare target grey. Handgun hunters can choose from 7.5 or 9.5 inch barrels. Ruger Super Redhawk revolvers are strong handguns that easily withstand the stresses imposed by the calibers for which they are chambered.

This has the original factory chrome-lined barrel chambered in the original 7.62x39mm cartridge. I don't know who built it, but the rivets look great and everything is nice and straight. The rifle has a painted finish, like what you see on the new Bulgarian Arsenals. There are some nicks and scratches here and there, but nothing egregious. Polish underfolders have a much more straight stock compared to some of the other countries where the stock slopes downward. The straighter stock is better for using optics and places the recoil impulse more inline with the bore.

-TWS Dogleg railed receiver cover with peep sight. Made in the USA, the Dogleg uses a 3-point tension system that makes optics return-to-zero after opening and closing the cover. I have done several return-to-zero tests with this rail and it works just as advertised.

-Primary Arms MD-06L mini red dot optic. This red dot is a clone of the Aimpoint T1. The dot is 4MOA and the sight works nicely with the Dogleg rail. This model has the control knob on the left side. Some pretty impressive torture tests have been done on these little inexpensive optics.

-Mission First Tactical Engage Grip. Made in the USA, this grip has interchangeable front and back panels. It's sorta like the Magpul MIAD, but for AKs. All extra panels will be included.

-Damage Industries MKIII railed forend. Made in the USA, this rail locks up nice and tight and it looks great. The bottom rail is flush wth the receiver, which allows the underfolder stock to close and lock correctly. It comes with two picatinny rail sections (one has a QD hole) that can be placed at various locations along the rail. Perfect for mounting a light and/or a vertical grip, or an optic and/or laser if you prefer.

-Manticore Arms NightBrake. This is more of a brake than a flash hider. Made in the USA. It works well to tame the muzzle rise and it helps lessen recoil. Everything offered by Manticore is really well made. This brake is no exception.

-Tapco G2 Trigger. Without a doubt, the best product that this company makes! Trigger is nice and smooth. Counts as 3 US parts.

-Original handguards and pistol grip are included (as pictured)

The pistol had a misaligned hammer from the factory which resulted in strikes on the rear of the frame. The factory generously chose to replace the entire frame and consequently issue a new serial number, a letter from S&W detailing this work is included. Since getting the new frame the gun has been fired less than 200rds and is in great shape. I have an extra set of boot grips off a Taurus that will be included, these are advantageous because they cover the rear of the grip and offer a little better recoil control.

The gun itself is a Remington 1100, great gun, functions and cycles flawlessly and is in good condition. There is a crack in the forestock, I believe that to be the only cosmetic issue with the gun other that it not being new (Slight use wear) nothing major whatsoever.   What makes this particular item even more interesting is of course the barrels.


I have two barrels for this shotgun, one being the factory barrel with some alterations for slowing the wad (Small rings in the barrel).

And also a Hastings barrel with what I believe is referred to as ""straight rifled"", it has grooves much like a rifle but they are straight with the barrel instead of twisting.   It is made in France, has removable choke tubes, and a custom tube. (again with the rings) 

So here's the deal, you can purchase the shotgun and stock barrel for $500, Shotgun and Hastings barrel for $575, or everything all together $650.  

Also, I was told when purchasing this shotgun that the work was done by a local gunsmith, (central NC) but I honestly don't remember the details so forgive my ignorance of this firearms history."

ALL U NEED IS A LOWER RECEIVER.  The upper is a LR 300 is an American assault rifle and conversion kit designed and manufactured by Z-M Weapons. It is based on the AR-15 platform and is broadly similar to the United States service rifle, the M16.

The weapon is touted as an exsuitability for military use in close quarters battle which often involves aggressive and rapid building entries requiring a compact yet powerful selective fire weapon.

Also notable is the rifle's capability to use a fully folding and adjustable skeletal stock. Most AR-15/M16 rifle variants have a thick, cylindrical recoil buffer tube, more properly called the receiver extension, that protrudes approximately 20 cm straight back from the rear of the receiver, and the firearm cannot operate without it. This normally precludes the use of anything but fixed or telescoping stocks. The LR 300 however uses an adapted version of the AR-15's standard direct impingement gas operating system which removes the need for a receiver extension and allows a folding stock.  The whole recoil system is in the mid length hang Guard witch really balances out the rifle and shoots like a dream with the stock folded in.
