Originally developed as a consumer-friendly option for the FBI contract Professional Model 1911, the TRP™ family provides high-end custom shop features in a production class pistol. Since its introduction, the TRP™ has become the standard for no-compromise fighting handguns.
The TRP™ Operator®, Tactical Gray model features a forged steel frame treated with Gray Armory Kote™ for protection against rust, corrosion, and knocks and dings from hard use. Accenting the Tactical Gray frame are black Armory Kote™ controls including the beavertail grip safety, ambidextrous manual safety, hammer, and magazine release. The forged-steel slide also sports black Armory Kote™, rounding out the attractive two-tone finish.
“We designed the original TRP™ as a serious pistol for serious users,” commented Springfield Armory® CEO Dennis Reese. “Whether our customers are serving in military or law enforcement capacities or using the TRP™ for personal defense, we wanted to offer a family of pistols that they can count on to perform in the very worst of conditions. Now we’re adding more choices for our customers that leverage the same mission critical design principles.”
The new TRP™ Operator®, Tactical Gray features an integral three-slot accessory rail, facilitating rock-solid attachment of lights, lasers, or other rail accessories. Out of the box, the TRP™ Operator®, Tactical Gray is ready for low-light use. Front and rear sights include inset Tritium-powered lamps. The rear sight is a low-profile, adjustable unit that will stand up to punishing use and avoid snags on equipment. Windage and elevation adjustments allow TRP™ Operator®, Tactical Gray owners to fine tune the point of aim and point of impact relationship to match their preferred sight picture to specific ammunition types.
Inside, the TRP™ Operator®, Tactical Gray is all business. The forged National Match frame and slide are precision fit and mated with a Match Grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The slide is managed through the recoil cycle by a one-piece, full-length guide rod, and reverse recoil spring plug.
The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing, and G10 grips present a slip-free surface for sure contact with or without gloves. The TRP™ includes a long Aluminum Match Grade trigger factory calibrated for a crisp four and a half to five-pound trigger pull. Operators will appreciate the ambidextrous safety levers, both treated with a black Armory Kote™ finish.
The Springfield Armory® TRP™ Operator®, Tactical Gray ships in a hard, lockable plastic case, built for range use or travel. Two 7-round stainless steel magazines outfitted with slam pad bases are included with each pistol.

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment."

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment."

Serious shooters who care about the details welcomed the precision features that made the Range Officer® perform far beyond its price tag.We insisted on the best components and manufacturing techniques, like forged national match frames and slides, both features found on our top end 1911 models. A gun is only as good as its barrel, so we didn’t skimp there either. We added a national match stainless steel barrel and precisely fit bushing for maximum accuracy.Many of those competition gun customers couldn’t help wonder why we didn’t make a self-defense version of the 1911 Range Officer®, so we did – in both 9mm and .45ACP calibers.New for 2016 is the 1911 Range Officer® Operator® model. We’ve kept the same great “under the hood” features that made the original Range Officer® great, but added features to turn this pistol into a formidable self-defense pistol for carry or home use.The five inch barrel with fully supported ramp provides an extended sight radius, making your job of getting fast hits on target even easier. Speaking of sights, the front is a shielded fiber optic tube while the rear is a low profile combat style that won’t snag during the draw.There’s no reason a functional combat gun can’t look good. The 1911 Range Officer® Operator® sports a Parkerized finish that looks sharp and will ward off corrosion and rust. Checkered Cocobolo grips provide a firm hold without shredding carry holsters and clothes.Serious 1911 fighting features are all there too. The classic flat mainspring housing is checkered for positive grip, and the extended beavertail safety includes a memory bump for positive activation. Add a long aluminum match grade trigger, skeletonized hammer, and rail for light or laser and this pistol is good to go.When it’s time to get down to business, place your trust in a gun that’s built for the task. Try the Range Officer® Operator®. Are You Ready"

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier. This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.Item #: 1638MDBL-MNCondition: New"

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.ALL NFA RULES APPLY.

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.   ALL NFA RULES APPLY.

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

These are high quality leather holsters but they have some blemishes, such as uneven staining and blank stitching holes. They are for smaller framed guns anywhere from the size of the Glock 26/27 to Ruger LC9. Almost any concealead carry will fit in to the holster. It will be a tight fit for guns closer to the size of the Glock 26, however these holsters will fit to the gun over time with use and moisturizing. We suggest that you use either mink oil or mineral oil but even olive oil or Vaseline will work. The current color of the holster is a light brown stain which is made from black walnuts but the leather will accept further staining if you decide to do so. Also any oil will cause the color of the leather to darken."

I bought this a few months ago and never got it out to shoot, I was going to take it out west for some Mully hunting this year but I went with a lighter rifle instead. Never fired and just needs an optic. Original box, papers, warranty card, and Blackhawk Scope Base 20 MOA (installed) From the Savage Law Enforcement series, the Model 10 FCP-SR is a purpose built tactical rifle. This superbly accurate rifle has a free-floated 24"" barrel with a threaded barrel, and the renowned AccuTrigger adjustable trigger. An oversized bolt handle allows sure cycling even with gloved or wet hands. A Picatinny rail provides the base for optics, and the rifle is fed by a 10 round detachable box magazine. Twin swivel studs on the forend permit use of both a sling and a bipod.

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

This one is a Robbins Kendall & Lawrence model Windsor 1847. It has US stamping on the barrell and but plate, as well as ""OHIO"" engraved in the wood. Gun is in very good condition. Wood shows typical marks and nicks from use, and the stock is tight against the barrel. The spring clips that hold the brass around the barrel both lock in place, and release properly to break the gun down. The trigger works, but it has not been test fired. The barrel is clear, and still shows strong riffling down it. The brass trap door on the but folds out smoothly, and there is a back up cap stored in there. Any questions please ask, I know about guns, but I'm not a collector myself. So no trades, or barters, it's cash only peroid. Might be able to ship, but perfer local pickup.

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."
