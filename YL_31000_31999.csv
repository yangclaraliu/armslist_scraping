It comes with the option to have it as a decocker or a manual safety to carry it cocked and locked.  It holds 16rd plus one in the chamber. 



The only reason I am selling it, is to put the money toward a more expensive CZ competition pistol.

It is lightly used, just broken in would be a fair description. Very little wear. A good shooting, lightweight, tactical AR15.
The lower has had about 300 rounds through it, the upper is pretty much brand new, as I've only taken it out to the range once, and haven't even got it fully sighted in yet.

With it, comes 9 30rd aluminum mags, mil spec with green follower, as well as 500 rounds of Nato stamped, brass cased 62gr. AP ammo. 

I would like to sell all of this together, but will break it up as follows if I have to:
1100 for the AR
90 for the mags
230 for the ammo(that's 44 cents around, what I'd call fair given 55gr federal goes for at least 50 cents)

I built the AR for more than 1100, so the price is firm. I will entertain trades of a very specific kind - namely high quality AK's, preferably the Arsenal brand in 5.56, Springfield M1A or 1911, or maybe a nice Rock Island 1911 plus cash, or a Glock 21 w/OD frame plus cash. I like tactical/practical stuff in 45 auto, 5.56, and 7.62. Feel free to let me know what you got.
I have no camera, so I can't take pictures of the AR. Sorry. I give my word it looks nice.
FTF, cash only.

This 22 is in decent working order.  Stock looks great and the barrel & bolt is in excellent condition.  I acquired it trading guns as a throw-in to complete a deal.  Took it to the range and made sure it works fine. I believe they quit making this model 750 in 1983. This should be a 70's model 22.  The sight at the end of the barrel is broken off."

This is a real good conceal carry gun and even with it's higher power charge has a very sustainable recoil. When I swapped the Guy for this I was skeptical about it even cycling, took it to the range and put 150 rounds down w/o a hitch. It's pretty easy to clean, not quite as easy to strip apart as a Glock but as long as the barrel is recessed a tad it gives you no problems. The reason I want to sell it is I'm not a fan of the trigger. Its got a little more creep then I like, and I've got my eye settled on Ruger Blackhawk. This is going to help fund that. I've put 150 rounds out, and the previous owner did not mention. If I had to guess it's had between 500 and 1000 rounds so theres still plenty of life left. These are going on GB for $410+ S&H and a FFL fee to pick it up of $20. You're looking at over $450 for one off the internet and probably $420ish in a store for a new one. I feel $340 is a fair price for this one and after seeing it I'm confident you will too. 

You've got to be 21 to buy. I'm not driving all over the State for $340 so if Bass Pro in Cincinnati mall is to far I appreciate you looking at the ad. I'm not interested in shipping. And the only trades I'd consider will have to be absolute steals. I.E. Smith and Wesson .500 complete w/ scope. If its close or a slight trade up/down I wont consider it.

This is a REALLY nice knife, its small but it feels reaaally good in your hand and very controllable, I like this one alot, and although i have no problem selling it to fund my uber expensive knife i intend to buy, i wouldnt mind not selling this one either. :P
Got this in the mail last week, comes with sheath.

Once again, a reaallly nice knife, but not quite what im looking for, blade is a little too big for my taste.
Just got this in the mail today, comes with sheath.

This is an amazing knife, nothing but fantastic reviews and its just a beast. You could be dropped into the middle of iraq with this thing. Only reason this wasnt the perfect knife for me is its a little larger than what i originally thought it was going to be.
Got this in the mail 3 weeks ago.
Comes with kydex sheath and leg straps

Im selling this for $50

Im trying to get rid of these knives so i can buy the 1 stupidly expensive knife that better damn well be the last one i ever buy! Looking to build my survival kit for a wilderness vacation im planning and who knew finding the right knife would take so much work!


These prices are firm, might go slightly down on price if you wanted all 3.

145,http://www.armslist.com/posts/31145,For Sale:  1954 CZ-52 7.62x25mm Tokarev,"South, Wichita, Kansas",$ 250,"Listed On: Friday, April 23, 2010",Handguns,no type,7.62x25 Tokarev,no type,no type,"Note: $250 is for the handgun in stock condition only. $300 is for the handgun with the replacement parts. Ammo goes with the gun in either case.

I have a 1954 year CZ-52 handgun for sale. It shoots the cheap 7.62x25mm cartridge. Just some numbers, it's roughly 10 cents per round. The round's velocity is approximately 1350fps to as much as 1600+ fps. They are very fast for a handgun. I have replaced the barrel, firing pin, and lock rollers. All three of these are brand new parts. I still have the old barrel, firing pin, and lock rollers that will come with the gun that will be given to the buyer. It has one magazine. I also have a box of 72 rounds of Romanian mil-surp ammo that I will include as well. No holster or other accessories included other than what I have listed above. I can be contacted via the email link below. It was arsenal refurbished twice from what I can tell (1978 and 1986) and there is a very slight import mark (NHM CO. SAC CA), you can hardly tell it is an import mark. Definitely not an annoying ""billboard"" on the side of the slide like other CZ's have. 

I'm asking $300 because stock I feel it is worth $250 because of the condition it is in. The brand new barrel (never been fired), hardened lock rollers, and hardened firing pin are well worth over $75. Ammo is worth $8. None of that includes shipping costs that I paid, the total tally would be around $335, so I think $300 is more than fair. If you would like to buy the gun stock with the original parts only, then I'd take $250 for it. Thanks."

The skinny: I just bought this less than a month ago from a member on okshooters, he told me he hadn't put many rounds through it since he'd purchased it.  I haven't even fired it yet myself.  I bought it about 3 weeks ago for $340.  An unexpected family emergency has come up and I need the cash more than I need another .22 so as much as I hate to see it go without even getting to send one down the tube, I need to.  If you have any questions feel free to email me.  

This rifle is beautiful and it's not dinged up and beat up.  It's as close to ""New in box"" condition without being brand new as you can get.  

As much as I hated to, I've lowered the price to $320.  Considering there is now an extra magazine and I paid more for it, the deal is even sweeter now.  

Hey to the guy I purchased it from, sorry for using your pictures but something came up and I had to unload this thing quickly to come up with cash and I didn't have any pictures.  I hope you're not angry about it."

It includes two magazines, factory kydex holster, factory dual mag pouch, cleaning brush, hard case and all manuals/papers that came with. It has a blank warranty and registration card still as well. It currently has custom made thin grips for (in my opinion) a better look and feel. These ran me $60 plus new bushings. I will include the original grips and bushings should you choose to revert to stock.

I'm also tossing in:
My cleaning supplies for the .45 - a bore snake, a tube of tetra gun lube and a large bottle of shooters choice solvent. (And some other misc supplies as seen in the picture.)

A belly band holster (large)

A cheap shoulder holster

That being said, I'm a certified Armorer/Gunsmith able to work on all Glock, Remington, Colt, Springfield Arms and Smith & Wesson firearms. I specialize in custom built Bolt Rifles and AR15s. I use Rem. 700 actions chambered in just about any caliber for the bolt rifles and can start from just about anywhere when it comes to an AR15. I also specialize in upgrading Glocks for tactical/combat applications as well as competition. 

Prices are per job and from what I can tell so far with the pricing around here, I will beat all others in the Springfield area. 

I'm also the only Armorer you will ever find that will let you personally test your weapon after I work on it before you pay for the work!!!  (Parts must be paid for before picking up guns) It's my personal guarantee you will not pay a penny for the work until you are completely satisfied!"

It spent almost a month in the gun shop after it fired while trying to chamber a shell. The gun was only made from 1930-1933 and the parts are obsolete. This was what became the Remington 870. I have both Modified and Full choked barrels. Yes they have separate barrels for separate chokes and are both in MINT condition. There is no blue loss on the steel, except for under the forend where it has been pumped. Very few nicks in the stock or the fore end.  The butt plate is broken about 1/4 is missing. Again this gun is tagged ""do not load"" and I am trying to market to a collector, or someone who needs parts. This is not your son or daughters first gun. It is however great for parts or display for that matter. I am interested in trades, but not for shotguns please.

The gun is just to small for my hands. I can add cash if offered something worthwhile. 

The gun is just over a month old. Has 200 rounds shot through it exactly. 

Have receipt, box and lock just like the day I opened it. Also have a Desantis nemesis pocket holster,Three boxes of 50rounds winchester white box ammo. One box of 50rounds Magtech brass ammo. And two partial boxes with prolly another 50 - 75 rounds. Some are ""non brass"" metal case Herters ammo. 

Also have a 13# wolf recoil spring and still have the original 9# spring. Gun is like new.

This is a new post recall lcp and came with the finger extension and one magazine. Has the Davison's lifetime warranty I didnt fill out the warranty card.



If you just want tobuy its $400 obo. I would rather trade. And before anyone asks its a package deal. Find your own .380 ammo ;)

Must be at least 21. If no CCW license I may want to meet at an ffl or at my gun club.
Depends though.

The gun was manufactured in 1923 according to Crosman's site. There are no discernible marks or stamps we can find anywhere on the gun. It took a LOT of research to figure out what we had and what its worth. The leather seal that holds air is blown. The stock is nearly perfect, very dark wood with very few surface nicks. The bore is great, zero finishing loss with one mark up near the chamber. This a pneumatic single shot pump air rifle. According to Blue Book of Airguns at 80% condition this rifle is valued at $2500 and 90%-$2900 . Hell, this gun is 87 years old.

I am interested in trades. Not airguns please though, I am just not as into them as others. 1911's are welcome, CCW pistols, rifles things of that nature. If it goes bang I generally enjoy it.

The SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun that was manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi S.p.A. from 1979 to 2000. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, meaning it can be used as a semi-automatic or pump-action firearm. The SPAS-12 has sold well to military and police groups around the world, but the appearance and intended purpose of the weapon eventually led to it being banned from import into the United States, due to a lack of ""sporting purpose"".

I extensively filed the spacer (see the photos) to make it fit a larger than 30mm scope. It didn't work, but I still think it would work fine on a 30mm tube -- the spacer is very beefy. I also took a file to a couple of the internal edges of the top half of the mount. This was very minor. Finally, the hex sockets on the tops of the screws are a bit worn. They should work, but may need to be replaced if you really want to crank them down. I'm selling this for $50 shipped via USPS Priority Mail. If you want it insured, that will be another $2.

Great 3CCD professional video camcorder. 
Camera is used, has some superficial wear on it, but nothing serious. Lens is smooth and clear and unmarked. Works flawlessly. Have had this camera since 2005, used it very little. I can't give much an estimate on the number of hours it's ran, but not more than a couple of hundred. I made a handful of student films with this, other than that it's sat in my closet for the better part of 5 years. I no longer have a need for this camcorder, and haven't used it more than a handful of times in years, so I'm selling it. 
Comes with camera strap, hard carrying case, remote, AV wires, charger, and two batteries. I think I have a couple of blank DV tapes I'll throw in, too. 
Price is flexible. But I haven't seen these for less than 1200 used, and I bought this for 2500 new, so I think it's a pretty fair deal.
Will consider a trade for a nice AK74.

It's just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with rosewood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights.
