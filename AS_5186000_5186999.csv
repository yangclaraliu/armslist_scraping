Will handle plus P loads too. The no dash versions like this one are 38 special only. The 640-1 came out in 357 magnum, though most would agree that the small J frame platform is not pleasant if not downright punishing to shoot 357 magnum loads. 38spl plus P is a solid self defense caliber in any knowledgable firearms affecionado's gun rotation. Enclosed hammer for snag-free, dust-free concealment, fitted with the classic rubber Uncle Mike's boot strap grips. Frame is stamped with a production date of 4-95 . These older Smiths do not have any MIM parts and the trigger pull is smooth and not heavy like current model Smith & Wesson revolvers. These all steel versions weigh more than the lightweight models, but the 23 oz weight does wonders for recoil management and thus, accuracy. Nice tight lockup with minimal to no end shake, no disappointments with this one, folks.REDACTED"

The Beretta model 92A1 is a semi automatic pistol derives from the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history: the Beretta 92FS, which meets all military testing guidelines and has defined new standards for quality. 
The Beretta 92A1 series pistol incorporates new and unique benefits while maintaining all of the advanced performance and safety features of the 92 FS pistols. On the 92A1 series pistol, a machined rail integrated into the frame allows the mounting of lights and lasers. 
The disassembly latch automatically returns to the locking position when the slide is retracted. Inside the frame, near the disassembly latch, a metallic recoil buffer reduces the impact of the slide assembly against the frame during the shooting cycle. By redistributing the stresses, the recoil buffer increases the service life of the firearm. 
The Model 92A1 represents Berettas evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol. Combining the best elements of the 92FS and the 90-Two, these pistols feature higher capacity 17 round magazines completely interchangeable with other 92 family magazines. A removable front sight, accessory rail, internal recoil buffer, captive recoil spring assembly and rounded trigger guard.

In 1980's i met an old antique collector who was close to 90 years old, he told me stories about Pancho Villa riding through town, and the calvary corps out of fort Clark Springs in Brackettville..where they filmed The Alamo. He gave me this gun and spur set as a gift, he said he found it in a crook of a tree by the creek near the fort . I contacted the museum at fort clark years ago, and base on what i said, he told me it was probably from the  late 20's .years later i found this old picture of calvary from 1928. Based on more research, it is highly likely it belonged to one of these soldiers..serial number 9888 cal are spurs with handmade spur added..i lived there for 8 years, was a firefighter there after the air force, and worked as an extra in the movie Lonesome Dove.

Period. No questions asked.  Attorney Christopher Gasper: 614-845-1923 or chris@gasperlegal.com  http://www.gasperlegal.com/nfa-trust/  What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.  As an Ohio lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!  This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.  I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.  Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.   What the Trust includes:  - The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages) - Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms) - Appointment of Trustee (1 Page) - Trustee resignation (1 Page)  I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.  Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***  Attorney Christopher Gasper www.gasperlegal.com chris@gasperlegal.com 614-845-1923  7652 Sawmill Road Suite #166 Dublin, Ohio 43016"

The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides. The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul® flip-up sights included. The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle. NO TRADES. MUST HAVE A HANDGUN PERMIT AND ID. PAPER WORK WILL BE SIGNED BY BOTH PARTIES.IF THIS AD IS UP IT IS STILL FOR SALE."

The LCP utilizes a double-action only, hammer-fired mechanism, with the hammer recessed into the rear of the slide to prevent snagging. The double-action only firing mode makes it simple to use in stressed situations—no levers or switches to remember—just point and shoot. The LCP features low profile front and rear sights integrated onto the slide that do not snag on clothing when pistol is drawn from a concealed position, and all sharp edges have been eliminated on the LCP to aid in concealment and to reduce wear on clothing. This LCP model features an alloy steel slide with a blued finish. Right-handed shooters can comfortably reach the magazine release on the LCP with their thumb, while left-handed shooters have no problem using their trigger finger. The mag release pushes in easily, but not so easily that the magazine pops out unexpectedly. Unlike many small semi-automatic pistols that operate with a blowback action, the Ruger LCP operates on a locked-breech system, which mitigates recoil and does not necessitate the user to pull the slide back against an excessively heavy recoil spring during loading. The LCP also has a manual slide hold-open latch for inspection and cleaning. The Ruger LCP is a well-designed, reliable Semi-Auto Pistol that one can count on in an emergency.

The 6.8 SPC has ample power for hunting medium-sized game, and the greater muzzle and downrange energy enhances the capability of the SR-556 in defensive or tactical roles as well.The SR-556/6.8 retains all the features of the original SR-556 that make it an outstanding value in the AR-style rifles. The patent-pending, two-stage piston delivers a smooth power stroke to the one-piece bolt carrier, which softens recoil, aiding both shooter comfort and durability of the rifle. The four-position gas regulator allows the shooter to tune the rifle to the ammunition being fired and environmental conditions present. A chrome-lined, cold hammer forged barrel provides accuracy and longevity, Troy Industries Folding Battlesights™, Quad Rail and rail covers add considerable value to the package, as does the Hogue® Monogrip®, six-position stock, sight adjustment tool, and the padded carry case, all included with the SR-556/6.8.The SR-556/6.8 maintains the mid-length gas system and the heavy (.850"") barrel contour under the handguard of the original SR-556. The 1:10 twist barrel has a standard SAAMI 6.8 SPC chambering, is 16.12"" long, is threaded 5/8-24, and is capped with the effective and distinctive Mini-14/SR-556 flash suppressor.

This trigger is made by shooting sight and is a top quality part. This Trigger is a very nice upgrade , it is a 2-stage trigger and breaks at 5 pounds. This trigger is brand new and has never been fired before. It is in the original box. I purchased this trigger for $315 and am selling it because I need the money for a new project. My loss is your gain! Purchase it here for $45 off!(From Website)
TAVOR 2-STAGE TRIGGER ShootingSight is pleased to announce the TAV-D, the first true 2-stage trigger pack for the IWI Tavor rifle.  
The Tavor is a superb rifle, with excellent design, ergonomics, fit/finish.  ShootingSight has designed the ideal trigger to go with it.  
In chosing the best trigger for a battle rifle, we took a cue from the greatest battle rifle ever devised: the M1 Garand.  The M1 has a superb 2-stage trigger.  It is robust, but keeps the crispness and accuracy of a two-stage trigger pull. 
The M1 concept was married with tool steel, CNC machining, and aerospace surface coatings.  The result is the TAV-D, a 2-stage trigger which is robust, smooth, and crisp.
Features:
· 2-stage, giving a predictable glass like break. 
· 3lb first stage, 5lb total pull
· Machined from heat treated plate tool steel, for superior metal grain structure.
· CNC cut Delrin housing
· Ultra hard / low friction surface coating allows lube free operation in dirty / tactical environments.
· Polished and honed sear surfaces for butter-smooth pull.
· Drop in trigger pack is fully assembled."

Head or helmet mounted, the PVS-14 allows the user to retain their night adapted vision in one eye while viewing their surroundings through the illuminated eyepiece of the PVS-14. The new battery housing completes the perfect package by allowing the user to power off the unit when in an upright position and power on when flipped down.

Strength is its ability to be weapon mounted behind most collimated daylight aimers and Reflex sights such as the ACOG, Aimpoint and EO Tech systems. This allows the user the ability to use their PVS-14 both as a night vision monocular for increased mobility and tactical awareness and as a short range weapon sight.
Gain control gives the user the ability to increase or decrease the tube gain. Under extremely dark conditions, gain control allows the user to adjust the gain upward, giving a better image. Under high light conditions, details can be washed out due to an excess of light. Lowering the system gain can allow those details to be better seen. Additional features of the PVS-14 include an infrared LED with LED indicator and a low battery indicator. All in all, the PVS-14 has set the bar for what a night vision monocular should be."

Three of the magazines hold 15 rounds and two hold 30 rounds. I have put thousands of rounds through the barrel and have never had an issue with feeding or any of the common issues. It will eat up Winchester white box ammo. Also throw in a cheap nylon holster that I bought at walmart. Again this is a solid gun but I would like a Glock 19 Gen 3 or Gen 4 to start CC. If you have question or would like the gun please text me at (405) Four4Three 9906 if it is before 5pm, after that you are more than welcome to call or text that same number. I am not looking for anything other than the Glock or cash, thank you very much."
