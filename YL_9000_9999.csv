I have added a Bulgarian AK74 stock/furniture set. I also had the barrel threaded to 14mm LH threads. The Muzzle brake on the end is a true AK74 24MM threaded brake. There is a removable adapter set into the brake that allows it to be used on the 14mm Threads. The brake and adapter are attached via blue thread locker, so it is removable. I have fired less than 500 rounds through the barrel. This Rifle fires the very fast, very accurate 5.45x39mm round that is used in the Russian AK74. This round is very similar to the 5.56mm round and MUCH CHEAPER! This round can be had for as low as .14 cents a round! Much better than paying .30+ cents for .223! Take advantage of this great deal and save on your ammo purchases! One black Bulgarian 30 round magazine will be included (either circle 10 or circle 21, no choice).

I absolutely love the way it shoots.

This is reasonable asking price. You might find better deals out there. If so, I encourage you to get one of these. They will not disappoint. As far as trades, I am interested in the following:
Ar-15's 
Most any semi-auto and revolver (as long as they are of good quality) 
Home defense shotguns (even old beaters)

It is still fully functional as I have shot it several times, and I do have a couple of reloads for it as well as 2 original Remington peters 00 buck high brass wax paper shells ( unfired ). I think it was an old coach gun but not sure and could really use alot of TLC. I am open to any reasonable and serious offers or trades, as far as trades go I would consider any type of wheel gun or an auto 9mm or larger. I have no idea what the value of this shotgun is, but someone here does. Thank You and have a great day. 

PS I did some research online and came up with the following based on markings on this gun: Neumann Bros. shotguns were made by Neumann Freres, a Belgium gun making company from 1863 to 1957.
The crowned ELG proof means it was made in Belgium after 1893 and was proofed for black powder.
The ""Machine Made"" part is in English.....so it was a Belgian gun made for the American market.
The ""machine made"" stamp by itself was used by any of three companies on mass produced shotguns sold through American distributers.
The ""Belgium Laminated Steel"" on the barrel was the same."

The Henry U.S. Survival rifle's unique design allows the rifle to break down easily into three pieces in seconds. This enables the barrel, action and two 8-round magazines to fit comfortably into the tough ABS synthetic waterproof stock. No tools are needed to assemble or disassemble. Once disassembled and stowed, it is only an incredible 16 inches long. Carry it in your backpack with room to spare. To assemble, simply attach the receiver to the stock, insert the barrel, screw on the barrel nut and you're ready to fire. In seconds, you'll have the security of a semi-automatic rifle without the bulk and weight of a full size firearm. The Henry U.S. Survival rifle features a steel barrel that is covered in a tough ABS plastic and then coated in Teflon. This unique barrel design allows the gun to balance properly and remain lightweight, yet withstand tens of thousands of rounds. The entire receiver is also coated in Teflon, making the Henry U.S. Survival rifle the most weather-resistant of any AR-7 ever made. As an added feature, the receiver rib is now grooved for easy installation of a scope. The rifle is capable of feeding both standard and high velocity .22 Long Rifle ammunition.

378,http://www.armslist.com/posts/9378,Surefire M961XM07 Tactical Weapon Light,"Brighton, Denver, Colorado",$ 350,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 11, 2009",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"SureFire flashlights are known around the world as the lighting system for any and every tactical scenario. In 1969 their original product line consisted of laser sighting systems for firearms. After many years of intense research and development, the SureFire WeaponLight was born and low light law enforcement & military operations changed forever. SureFire then went on to establish themselves as the leading manufacturer of rugged, powerful and compact illumination tools for tactical applications; from weapon-mounted lights and laser sights, shield lights, baton lights & hand-held lights powerful and bright enough to qualify as force-multiplier tools that could temporarily blind, unbalance, and disorient a threat.

The M961XM07 Millennium Universal WeaponLight is designed for Mil-Std 1913 Picatinny rail interface equipped shoulder-fired weapons. The included thumbscrew mount ensures quick attachment or removal during high stress conditions.

This WeaponLight features a shock-isolated modular system and components, for rapid conversions in the field to meet mission-specific requirements. The bezel, lamp, and tail cap are interchangeable with SureFire's Special Operations Series hand-held flashlights.

The Millennium Universal (MU) WeaponLights are designed and constructed to endure and perform under harsh battlefield conditions. They're finished with a durable Mil-Spec hard anodizing (Mil-A-8625 Type III Class 2), and the rugged CNC machined housings are o-ring sealed for moisture and dust protection.

The Millennium Universal M962XM07 WeaponLight is powered by three lithium batteries, and produces a 125 lumen beam. The optional MN11 high-output bulb produces a 225 lumen beam.

. CNC machined aluminum housing is o-ring sealed
. Mil-Spec hard anodized finish is extremely durable
. Thumbscrew mount enables quick installation and removal
. 1.62"" Bezel accepts SureFire's accessory filters and protective cover
. Tactical XM07 Tail Cap Switch
The XM07 tail cap switch assembly features a click-on/off push-button switch, a plug in momentary-on switch with a 7.0"" cable, and a system disable option. These switches operate independently of each other. When the tail cap switch is activated, the tape switch is disabled. Turning the tail cap switch to the off position activates the tape switch. The system disable feature eliminates the possibility of accidental activation from either switch.
. High Output
Included MN11 bulb produces a powerful 225 lumen beam
. Turbohead Option
Optional beam-focusing 2.5"" Turbohead delivers a tighter, longer reaching beam
. Prefocused Beam
No need to twist the bezel to adjust the beam, it's already perfectly prefocused. Lamps and reflectors are individually mated and hand-adjusted to within .005"" for optimum beam quality at all distances.
. The SureFire Difference
SureFire strives to design and manufacture lights of ever-increasing brightness and quality while setting new standards for maximum power with minimal size. Three things characterize every product: compact size, extreme ruggedness, and a flawless high-output beam. Every SureFire illumination tool is guaranteed to produce a perfect center spot of intense light surrounded by a smooth corona of softer light.
. No Hassle Lifetime Warranty
Lamps will burn out, batteries will be used up, and switches for WeaponLightsT will eventually need to be replaced. Everything else is covered by their lifetime no-hassle guarantee; if it breaks, SureFire will fix it!

It has been well kept and in excellent condition but needs a cleaning. I am assuming that 90% of it's use was by the original owner. What makes this pistol special is that it was issued to the Kriegsmarine ( it has all the correct stampings, the eagle over N an the rarest of Kriegsmarine stamps, the M/6 on the trigger guard) which, as you may know, most of these pistols are at the bottom of the Alantic unlike those issued to the army or police.

From speer-ammo.com:
"" We created the first bonded-core handgun bullet. Our method is so innovative that we hold patents* on the process. Using our proven Uni-Cor® technology, we bond the copper jacket to the lead core one molecule at a time. We've virtually wiped out the cause of most bullet failures - core-jacket separation. In the process, we've assured high retained weights and excellent penetration.
What about expansion? We have you covered. Most bullet makers add the hollow point cavity at the very last operation. This is not very smart if you want premium performance. We, however, form the cavity in two distinct steps. Very smart.
The first cavity operation establishes the limit of maximum expansion--a bullet isn't very effective if it rolls back so far that it falls apart--and precuts both the jacket and the core for symmetrical expansion. The final cavity operation establishes the rate of expansion. The flexibility of this two-step proces lets us tune each bullet to its intended velocity range. Bullets for low-velocity cartridges have a deep cavity; those for high-velocity have a shallow cavity. Very smart, indeed.
We put a lot into Gold Dot. Accuracy. Penetration. Incredible terminal performance. Now you can put all that in your handloads.

I just got this after debating on whether or not to let my son use the.223WSSM or get him a .243WSSM. So I got this but it's a little too heavy for him (who's 9) to hold up by himself and be accurate. Plus this gun is in MINT condition. If I had the box and papers I would say that it is 100%, but since I don't have the box I will say that it is 99.9%!! There's not a scratch or a mark anywhere on it. I would hate for him to beat this gun up! I have $685 in the gun and ammo and that is what I am asking. There are two boxes of Winchester shells.The bipod is NOT included. It books for more than that for the gun alone! The scope is $150.00  FTF in Moore/SW Okc. Email me for Any questions. Thanks for looking. REDACTED"

Sheath is lighter than it appears in the photo. Now you can own an exact replica of this original classic for a very reasonable price. But make no mistake, our R1 Military Classic is not just a showpiece. The blade is expertly crafted from VG-1 San Mai III® blade construction and is 3/16"" thick. Each one is flawlessly ground, hand fitted, polished and then honed until it will cut at the slightest touch. For strength and beauty, the double guard has been meticulously fashioned from a single piece of highly rust resistant 300 series stainless steel (instead of brass or nickel silver that can tarnish). It sports an extremely buffed and polished surface that will continue to gleam despite the ravages of time and weather. The handle is made from solid black linen Micarta. This is extremely costly, but nothing else looks or lasts like Micarta! Each one is contoured and shaped until perfect then permanently mated to the heavy blade tang with attractive colored fiber spacers. The final assembly is then buffed and polished to a fine luster. The R1 is delivered with a heavy duty brown leather sheath complete with Norton Fine India stone and pouch. This rugged sheath is built for hard service and is designed to fit virtually any belt including a G.I. pistol Belt!

I live in Tarrs and I only feel comfortable with face to face transactions. We can find a gunshop somewhere for this.
Sorry about the semi lame descriptions, if you want to know more just shoot me an email at REDACTED. I'd be more than happy to get more detailed for you. I could maybe even figgure out how to add pictures or something if you want. 

-AR upper in .223rem. Free Floated. Badger Ordnance high rise mounts and SuperSniper fixed 10x with mildot and paralax. No BUIS. I havn't had any malfuntions with it. I've shot 55gr Black Hills and 60gr TAP plus some cheapy stuff. I can group about 1MOA with those (well the cheapy stuff is more like 2MOA). It should be shooting tighter. I don't have reloading equipment or the time to put some good 62gr in it to really take it to its full potential.
$800

-Beretta TomCat SS in .32. Two mags. I bought this as a pocket gun, but I just can't replace my KelTec when it comes to pocket carry. Factory case. 
$350

-Uberty top break in .38SWS. Lefthanded cavalry holster. Box (but the box is a little beat up) This is by far my prettiest gun.

It has the external hammers and double triggers. It is shootable as I have done so( you have to use low Pressure loads) anyone that does reloading can make up a batch.The following is some of the info I was able to find about this shotgun.
{Neumann Bros. shotguns were made by Neumann Freres, a Belgium gun making company from 1863 to 1957.
The crowned ELG proof means it was made in Belgium after 1893 and was proofed for black powder.
The ""Machine Made"" part is in English.....so it was a Belgian gun made for the American market.
The ""machine made"" stamp by itself was used by any of three companies on mass produced shotguns sold through American distributers.
The ""Belgium Laminated Steel"" on the barrel was the same.
The writing on the left side plate would be a store brand or maker's name ala ""Wm. Parkhurst"" or ""Wm. Moore & Co"" or ""Manton and Co."" etc etc etc.
The E over the LG in the oval with the crown is a Belgium proof mark that began in 1893 and stands for ""definitive black powder proof for breech loading guns, small bore guns and handguns.
I have a couple of shells for it as well including two Remington Peters 00buck High Brass waxed paper shell in mint condition (unfired). It could use alot of tlc  and some stock work."

I have an Extrema Ratio Fulcrum S that I'd like to sell.  It is a seriously tough knife that can handle slicing as well as chopping tasks.  The knife is practically new with the box, packaging, sheath, and straps.  It has been used on a piece of paper, etc, but has never seen field use.  The only wear is from the sheath.

Retail is $339.00, and it can be found for $272.00, so I'm asking $200.00

Third:
I have a Benchmade Nimravus Tanto model #BM141SBKSN.  Considered by some to be a nearly ideal camp knife, it excels in cutting organic materials as well as rope, cord, and nylon webbing. Prying ability has been sacrificed in lieu of more precise cutting.  It has seen minor household use, but no field use and hasn't been sharpened since it left the factory.

For those of you unfamiliar with the XD pistol, it is a modern semi-automatic pistol that generally considered a very reliable and accurate weapon.

You should do your own due diligence as this is a popular pistol and widely documented on the internet, but here are two links to a torture test and stress test:

http://springfield-armory.primediaoutdoors.com/SPstory02.php

I am selling everything below as a complete package:

XD40 pistol
XD gear (holster, magazine loader, two-magazine pouch)
original box (manual, lock, test fired cartridge, test fire date is 10-2008)
2 magazines

Other comments: This pistol has had between 500-600 rounds fired through it.  No malfunctions or failures.  It has been cleaned and lubricated as recommended after each range trip, hopefully it shows (see photos and feel welcome to inspect it thoroughly).  The finish is excellent as it has never been holstered and carried; after range trips it is cleaned, wiped down with a silicone cloth, and stored in a dry safe. At least around here, it is still relatively straightforward to find 40 caliber ammunition (not so for 9mm), so that's another plus.

I'd like to keep it, but I have a baby on the way in Oct, and am selling one of my XD40s.

9mm, blue slide, 7+1, two mags, second strike, glock style trigger, thumb safety, loaded camber indicator, two-axis adjustable rear sights. 

I had been waiting for this gun to come out for over a year. I got fed up and bought a PM9 about 7-8 months ago, but when this finally came out I bought it anyway. I fired about 50 rounds. It's a really nice gun, but I like my PM9 better. It's [slightly] larger the PM9, but not by much. Much smaller than the Walther PPS and a major step up from the KelTec PF9. 

I have about $400 in it after all the s/h and transfer fees. FTF in STL for now only--you must have a CCW or C&R to avoid a 4473.  Buyer will sign a bill of sale as well.

Trade +/- cash for a USP9 compact, Springfield M6 Scout, Henry Golden Boy, Thompson 1927 or M1, Yugo M70 fixed stock, Kimber Ultra Carry II, Kahr (any 9mm model), GSG-5 parts, LaRue or EoTech FTS magnifier, 9mm ammo, or .22LR ammo (nothing above current Wal-mart prices on ammo.)

Smith and Wesson M&P .45.   I purchases this firearm new late last year.  I have exactly 100 rounds through it.  It fires beautifully.  I am only going to be asking 425 or best offer because these firearms are a must sell right now.  - PENDING SALE 4:57PM

The second firearm for sale is a ATI GSG5.  This mp5 clone fires in .22lr and is an absolute blast to shoot.  I have just over 1100 rounds though it without a single issue.  I have purchased and will be including 2 extra magazines which retail between 25-40 each.  I have attached a MP5 scope mount adapter so you can mount any kind of scope or red dot sight you would like.  I have also installed a flip to side stock.  The gun will eject the round, even of the stock is collapsed so you can fire it either way you like.  I also will include all the 22lr ammo I have left, which is around 2500 rounds.   Asking price for this firearm is 475 or best offer.  Please look over the pictures and call me with any questions.  I am asking well below the standard price for each of these firearms because I am in a must sell situation.

I had been searching for the best price for over a year and Cabelas is the best I've found at 119.00 + 18.00 shipping. Brand new and never opened for $80.00
