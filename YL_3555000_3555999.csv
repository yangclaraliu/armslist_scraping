 This is an aiming system that provides the performance of a full-sized sight in the smallest package possible. Built to offer the same battle-proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, this Red Dot Sight performs reliably under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. The Aim Point Red Dot T-1 Micro Weapon Sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology. This Aimpoint Red Dot Rifle Sight is made with a innovative coating on the front lens that reflects the selected frequency of the red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. The Aim-Point Standard Mount Micro T1 Red Dot Sight has 4 night vision compatible settings and 8 daylight settings with one extra bright setting for use with laser protection glasses or in bright desert sunlight."

It is not only of fresh manufacture, but it has only been handled to take the attached pictures.  The M&P .45 Compact gives you everything you get in the full size except in a smaller package.  If you want the same capacity of the full size, just buy the full size magazines and add the little X-Grip extension on the mag and it looks all factory and you have a full size M&P.  For concealed carry, use the two flush fitting mags and it is a lot easier to carry.  As with all new M&P's, you get 3 different backstraps to fit your hand along with the hard plastic case and the required lock.

There has never even been a round loaded in either mag and the only time the pistol was fired was in 5/14 and that was in the factory and the spent casing is enclosed.  The only reason I am selling this new pistol is because I personally prefer the H&K .45 Compact.  Of course, it's quite a bit more money, so I really don't need to keep both.  I figured I'd sell this fine M&P before it's used any.  Must have proper IN ID and preferably LTCH."

I bought it to hunt with down in West Virginia but never made it now I would like to get a bow and I am terrified that I will dent or scratch it sitting in the safe moving guns around. It shoots true and the bore is excellent its serial # is 2363011 if you would like to verify the year. The gun is not drilled either it is 100% original. This is a beauty of a gun and I have been watching on broker etc. there isn't many like this that come along especially under the grand mark. I don't really want to travel more than 20 - 30 miles to meet and I don't want to do trades unless you have a smoking deal on a bow and I don't know my draw length etc.. so honestly it would probably just be a pita.

I have the 85% letoff Rock Mods as well as the 75%. The 75% are on the bow now, I prefer these because they add a little arrow speed and keep me from getting lazy; although unable to be as lax at full draw I have found this makes me more accurate. The separate mods cost $40. I added all white accessories for my desired look. Have most of the original black accessories. This bow bare with an ultralight arrow and the 75% mods clocked at 334fps.

This is a wonderful concealed carry handgun. The LC9S is the striker-fired version of the LC9. The trigger on this gun is the best on the market as far as deep concealment handguns go. It breaks at about 5.5lbs with a short and positive reset, just like a glock. Accuracy is also very good and I am able to hold groups all day within a 3"" box at 15 meters, which is extraordinary for such a small pistol. Reliability is perfect, I purchased this gun brand new and after 200 rounds, this gun has never jammed. Recoil is surprisingly easy to control and full size combat sights ensure it points fast. This is a better combat handgun than many other full-size 9mm guns as far as speed, balance and follow up shots. It maintains the same dimensions as the original LC9 and can conceal in a pants pocket easily... though personally I always condone using a holster! :)  

Thank you in advance for your consideration to purchase this gun. I purchased it recently because I really needed the protection at the time, but thanks to the courts, it seems that I can walk outside again without fear. The gun comes with a small case, one magazine, a gunlock, the owners manual, and an orange safety magazine that you can use for dry-fire practice."

Have a great Colt Cobra/detectives special in 38 special, serial number 369..LW which puts in manufacture date in 1955. It had not been fired since the late 60's when I got it from my uncle earlier this year, I put 18 rounds fresh ammo thru it and it shot really nice, super crisp trigger! The pistol has been carried and holsted pretty regularly (ex cop) so it does have some color loss on the contact points. Being an alloy LW model I would think it could be touched up or refinished fairly easy?  Anyway it comes with the nifty black leather holster and 32 rounds of new ammo which is the leftover from the box I bought. This would be a super carry piece or beside the bed  weapon. I'm pricing it to move quick as I'm out of town starting Saturday.

The 7mm RUM is hard to tame, but this one is a pussycat with the Muscle Brake installed by Ryan Pierce at Piercision Rifles (http://www.piercisionrifles.com/brakes/).  The camo stock is in as-new condition.  Also included is a very nice set of Leupold split bases with 1"" rings, and the front ring is a 1"" offset version.  The recoil is equivalent to my .270 Rem shooting factory loads.  Best of all, this rifle is extremely accurate.  I purchased it from the original owner, who fired it 9 times (he gave me the remaining box of ammo).  I have fired it 18 times using a variety of factory ammo.  The rifle shot them all well, but the Remington Scirroco 150-gn round produced a 1/2"" 3-shot group off of sandbags.  So you are buying a rifle with only 27 rounds down the pipe, not some ragged-out barrel.

The condition is excellent, but it's not perfect.  Perfect comes new in a box from Remington.  It has one small scratch on the floorplate, and one light scuff on the right side of the barrel about 2"" back from the brake.  That's it.  The barrel was cut down slightly to 24-3/4"" before adding the brake.  Overall barrel length from the receiver is 25-3/8"" and overall length of the rifle is 46-1/4"".

Local pick-up is always good.  I will only ship this to your FFL with a valid, signed FFL in hand.  Shipping is $30 in the lower 48.  If you need an integrity check, look me up on Ebay at Scottielover1.  I'm also selling an as-new Swarovski Habicht 4-12x50mm matte scope with Plex reticle in another Armslist listing.

Write me with your questions.  I can email you 20 photos of the rifle showing every side and angle.  Or feel free to call 33four-four five six-911four.  You can't go wrong with this 7mm RUM.  I also have some ammo that we can discuss as part of a deal.  Thanks for looking."

The Red Synthetic Color Guard Stock was very rare as not very many of them were imported with this stock. It brings a premium to collectors with this stock. I have seen some in no where near as good condition as mine for sell for over $800 on Gunbroker for just the gun alone. Mine is complete and has the matching forearm. Also it still has the spike bayonet and 10 rd box magazine and non scoped receiver. 

The Tactical Folding Stock has a see through scope mount on the receiver with an NC Star 3x9-42 scope also included is a folding bipod mounted on the bayonet lug and removable 20 rd steel magazine and sling.

Also i have a chest bandolier that holds 20 stripper clips of ammo for a total of 200 rds ready to load ammo. 

My SKS has been shot very little and is in excellent condition. As you can see in the photo it has alot of quality extras that make the gun well worth the asking price.
I will consider a trade on an AR 15 in as good a condition as my SKS

Other information: This pistol is 95%. I have shot roughly 400 rounds through it.  The Eclipse models are, in my opinion the most beautiful model Kimber makes. The only reason I am selling this pistol is because I recently ordered a NH Falcon and would like to pay it off.  All state laws will be followed meaning, you will have a valid FOID and we will wait 3 days from time we agree on sale.  If its worth anything, I am more than happy to meet at a LGS of my choice, and pay for your full 4473 background check to get the pistol 100% transferred to you.
