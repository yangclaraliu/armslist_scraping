Details: Upper is an DSA, 16"" M-4 dimension barrel, chrome-moly lined, A2 flash-hider, M-4 synthetic with aluminum-insulated handguards, flat-topped for low-profile optic mounting, lower is API, multiple-position collapsable buttstock.

Rock River carry-handle w/ A2 rear sight which usually sells for 80 on its own, have had it awhile but never used it. Also included is a hard-case, and three (3) great condition USGI 30-round magazines.

Also, I can swap out the carry-handle with an Eotech (genuine) holographic sight. It has been used only a few times, and minus some (very) minor scratches on the protective hood is brand new. It has also had a GG&G quick-detach throw lever (80-100 bucks by itself) installed so it literally can pop on and off the rifle in a matter of seconds, yet still retain a near perfect zero every time. If this is your preference, 1150 and the package (minus carry handle) is yours. I will also sell the Eotech+GG&G mount alone for 350.

I greatly prefer cash, so if a trade is involved I'd only be able to give a majority-percentage of whatever market value is on your item. Cash plus or minus depending on the item, obviously fills the difference. Please don't hesitate to throw me an offer if interested in getting into the AR-15 market."

Up for sale is this odd rifle, as far as I can tell it is an imitation AR, looks to be on the older side. It is marked ""Liberty Arms Armalike, Squires Bingham MFG CO INC"" and further down the barrel it says "" Manufactured in the Philippines"". It's one of the uglier guns I've ever seen, it basically looks like a wooden AR. The finish on the wood isn't great. The stock end is pretty rough, looks like someone had put tape on it at some point and it's pretty dinged up. The fore end isn't as bad, although it isn't perfect. The bluing on the barrel and the lower portion isn't great either, it's almost completely worn off on the sharp corners and it's pretty faded in some spots. It also comes with a little magazine, probably holds 10 rounds (I haven't checked).

I've never fired it because it's missing the trigger (it may be missing other parts, but I've never torn it apart). It also seems to be missing the magazine catch, because the magazine doesn't stay seated in the gun. I can't seem to find much information on this rifle at all, let alone parts to fix it. It's not doing me a whole lot of good, so I figured there might be someone out there that could fix or use it. 

Asking $25 for it. If interested you can send me a message or give me a call or text at REDACTED. Also, if anyone has any information on this gun they would like to share, I would appreciate it. Thanks for looking."

It was evaluated by Tucson Guns and Western Artifacts last year, who found that ""the shotgun is in excellent mechanical condition but the barrels are corroded""; however, the lockwork is very tight.  The furniture is in good condition with scratches one would expect from 110+ year old piece, and the checkering is original and has not been re-cut.

I have put maybe 20 rounds through this rifle and the person I got it from who bought it in the early 90's said they never put any rounds through it.  The bore and chamber are chrome lined for corrosion resistance and look perfect.  The internal parts are very clean and do not show wear.  Externally there is a little bit of freckling and a small spot of damage to the blue on the trigger guard.  The original magazine was swapped out for a junky metal 40 round peice but I have replaced it with a nice factory magazine.  The original stock has a few dings in it but is otherwise in very nice condition.

I don't know alot about this.  Here is what I do know.  Darne was (is?) a very high quality and expensive French gun make who started making double guns in about 1880.  The shorguns were sometimes highly engraved and sometimes plain but all exhibited the best workmanship and materials.  During the time between the wars, Darne made a lower priced series called the Halifax.  I believe all Darne guns exhibited the slide open action that this halifax exhibits.  I am not sure but I believe this shotgun to be from about 1920-1935.  I don't see a serial number.  The barrels are not Damscuss and are 27.5 inches long.  I do not know the chokes n the barrels but I assume left improved or Modified and right full.  It is 12 guage.  The action is the typical DArne slide open action.  It is minimally engraved.  The walnut is chequered on the fore arm but not on the butt stock.  Wood shows wear and some finish checkering but is in tact.  Double triggers.  Action is very tight.  Triggers are a tad heavey but very crisp with no creep and not much over travel.  This gun comes up like a dream.  I had a collecter who told me the gun was worth 2500 to 4000 bucks.  Unfortunately, he was not willing to give me 4 grand for it.  So I am selling it.  I invite you to comelook at it.  I have taken it to a few local gun shows and most people knew very little about it (or any French or English shotguns).  I will take it to Wanenmachers in OCT if it doesn't sell here.

I purchased this gun about a month ago. Kahr recommends a 200 round break-in period before considering the firearm reliable for carry. I put 235 rounds through it in about an hour without a single malfunction. Since then I have not shot it. It is a great little shooter. Some Kahr's seem to have reliability problems while others are exceptionally reliable. This one appears to be the latter from my experience. A new CW9 only comes with one magazine. I purchased the extra one for $40 to have a spare. I will email more pictures on request.

.357 Mag - model 15-2 (target front and adjustable rear) blued, 715 (target front and adjustable rear) in stainless, or the .357 mag in the Supermag/Maximum (blued or stainless).  Prefer 4 inch, 6 inch, or pistol packs...Supermag/Maximum barrel length will need to be factory length.  Stainless barrel inserts are a plus.

.44 Mag - blued or stainless, stainless barrel inserts are a plus.  Supermag/Maximum will also be considered, but must be factory length.

Barrels - I will also consider purchasing barrels and shrouds, however they must be complete (good threads, barrel nut good, clean barrel, and shroud must all be present) and the bore must be in excellent rust free condition.  I prever the heavy vent-rib barrels, but others will also be considered.  Looking for these in .357 Magnum and .44 Magnum.

Condition, factory accessories, factory paperwork, factory boxes, and the number of barrels will all play a factor in prices I'm willing to pay.  These will be a private purchase and I do provide a signed bill of sale for sellers to protect them.  I am also willing to go through a local FFL holder for transfer, however the transfer fee will come off the top of my offer.

Please do not ask retail or gunbroker prices, I am not willing to pay at those inflated levels unless you happen to have a product or package so unusual and unique that it's worth the investment.

If the bluing is bad on your DW revolver, but the bore is excellent and rust free, I am still willing to consider those products as I can have them reblued or polished to stainless finish.  It will dramatically impact the pricing if the factory bluing is bad, but it will put money in your hands."

P99AS (Anti-stress)
Prior to 2004, there was no designation for the double action trigger which Walther® now markets as the P99AS (""Anti-Stress"") trigger. It is called anti-stress because the trigger pull is the same length for the first shot, regardless of single or double-action. The anti-stress trigger functions as a sort of two-stage trigger, lessening the possibility of unintentional ""reflex"" firing in stressful situations."

Chambered in .44 Magnum, it's a beast of a gun, with very little recoil to show for it.  Some notable features include the 18"" barrel, which lines up with the 6 o'clock position of the cylinder.  This sends the force of the recoil straight back into the gun, reducing muzzle flip, and rotating the cylinder and cocking the hammer.  It's also got a picatinny rail for optics.

It's in good condition, with a few minor scuffs, the worst being a small corner of the forward grip being chipped off (cosmetic only).  I love it dearly, but it was a costly purchase, and I can't afford to keep it, much less shoot it.  I've put about 75 rounds through it, and found it to be consistently accurate.  i would recommend putting the picatinny rail to good use, and adding some sort of optics on it (I used a red dot sight).  Sale includes gun, soft case, speed loader, copy of user's manual, and about 20 rounds of Remington .44 Mag.  I'd like to sell it for $1500 (now $1400, OBO), and I will consider trades.  I'm particularily looking for an M4 plus some cash (depends on what you've got).  FTF in Stillwater, but I'd make a trip to Tulsa/OKC or in between if your serious.

Made in 1985, this gun is part of the recall, but It has not gone back to S&W in the 10 years I've had it. I do not know if it was sent back before I got it. They do not have any more cylinders to fit these, so if you do send it in you may not get it back. Light loads have been no problem.

Setup is also for sale at $500.

Sig P238 .380 pistol, holster, extra mag, VZ grips, factory grips, new Wolffe springs, box and all the paperwork. 

Great little pistol, just trying to consolidate calibers, too many .380's in the collection. Gun has 400 or less rounds through it and functions flawlessly. Has gobbled up anything put through it. 

Here are the grips that are on it and they are less than 1 month old, VZ Grips 

VZ Grips 

Springs were replaced with a new 1# heavier Wolffe spring as I understand from research they tend to wear out at around 1,000 rounds and I wanted to be pro-active before I got there, there is one extra spring to go with the pistol. 

Includes box and all items in the box that came with gun.

I sold this over night, (8.16 2010 but we have a logistical problem, so it's back up but form the activity it generated I suspect it won't be here long.

I have a matching tac light that matches teh slide perfect, it's for sell but not included
As for photos of it or tons of photos of the gun are availible also. Just ask.


This is the only FN 45 that you can get night sights with now.
They are tall for use with can's and to co wittness the optional Red Dot Scope as well.

The sight on the top of the gun on their site is not included. It's an optional light you buy yourself, they don't come with the guns from FN, but there are special mounts build into the gun. You can read about that on their site
Just the hard bag that it comes in will hold every piece you need to carry, a can, tac light, red dot sight, the other 2 15 round mags, or you can adjust, take out or put in what you want, it's all military velcro backed.
One of the best military utility guns I have ever owned.

I would prefer this be FTF but I will ship.
You need to make sure you can own it
you need an FFL, I am not into playing around. You will be legal and the deal will be. Shipping is on you, $40 will ship it to your FFL only.

I've got almost 800 in the pistol with those 5 mags , the glocklight and that ammo, and it's practically new....I know there's a lot of glocks up for sale right now, so I don't expect much....but please don't be rude...Serious offers only.

Shoot me an offer. I will be interested in trades specifically for 9mm Sig p226 Navy, Browning High power, or stainless steel Ruger New Vaquero in .357(4 3/4 bbl)...Will do even trade for the Sig or Browning, will want a little extra cash with the Ruger...

Integral weaver style mounts. Comes with one factory mag for each caliber - 9 round .357 magazine (brushed chrome), 8 round .44  (black oxide), 7 round .50 AE (matte chrome).

Extra IMI slide (see below).

For awhile after the Desert Eagle Pistol switched from Mark XII to the Mark XIX, , they offered a ""conversion kit"" for mark XII pistols  - i.e. a new slide that would accomodate all the new bolts and barrels. I purchased this.

This means that in order to switch from ..44/50 to .357 you need to change slides. This is actually quicker than changing the bolt, but if you liked you could get sell  the IMI slide and barrel, buy a Magnum Research barrel and this would be identical to a mark XIX pistol. Kind of a waste of time IMO.

Used, in excellent condition. The .357 barrel, the frame and original slide have seen the most action, maybe 10 boxes of ammo with some wear to the finish around the gas port (and perhaps the black oxide components - the bolt, gas piston, etc.).
The new slide and .44 barrel are virtually unused. Less than a box of ammo. The .50 barrel is unfired."

Rifle is slightly used, in excellent condition. I've put less than a box of ammo (10-20 rounds through it). Rifle is pictured with scope mount, weaver rings and a BSA 3-9 x 50 scope mount, but that's honestly a terrible scope for this rifle. I will probably replace it with the original factory iron sights, which I still have....has at least one spare 4 round factory magazine.
