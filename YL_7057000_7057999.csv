It features a special order crescent butt plate and probably a non-factory installed sling swivel attachment on the butt stock. One can tell the scope mounts are factory by the fact that the Winchester Proof (â€œWPâ€ in an oval) is stamped on the left rear portion of the barrel rather than the top center. The mounts themselves are typical factory style with appropriate hole spacing and narrow dovetails to match Unertil style rings. The receiver has lost most of its finish but the 22â€ barrel retains some original blue. The stocks are in good condition, the mechanics are great and the bore is fine."
