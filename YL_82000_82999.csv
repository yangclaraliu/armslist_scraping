Will like to trade for a Glock, prefer a 23 or 30, just let me know what you have, worst I can say is no thanks. No FRANKENSTEIN GUNS

What Glock safe queen do you have to trade? If you have one you never use and want to try something different, this is the one.
Will sell for $450

FTF Tulsa or Owasso.

Issued but ""Never"" fired. I'm sure it was holstered by a German military or police officer, but never fired. I don't see any holster wear anywhere on the slide or barrel. The only possible holster wear is  mild and it's on the sharp edges of the left side of the trigger guard. This pistol looks NEW inside and it should be, it was never fired.


Includes the original, ""never used"" cleaning kit w/ case, 1 original 8 round Walther magazine and I'll throw in 50rnds of Sellier and Bellot 115grn 9mm ammo. Also included is a German made holster in a camo design in excellent condition.  Extra mags for these are cheap and can be bought for about $12 online.

Great condition, all original and unmolested by import companies. No ugly hex bolt nailed through the frame like a lot of the post war models were done by the import companies.

The car smoke a little white smoke when we drove it home, we had the heads redone, new water pump, new timing belt, new motor mounts. The top is new but has a metal piece that is broke so it gets hung up a little when going up or down, but it does not leak. The drivers side window does not want to roll up now, it worked before we took it to the mechanic and now it doesn't. The guy that sold us the car said the engine had been replaced and had only 70k on it, but I think I was lied to. The car has 200k on the body I believe. The car smokes even worse now when you start it up and settles down after about ten minutes. The car drives good, shifts good just smokes. No Stereo.

that makes the grand retail total of 1350 before tax and shipping(press and the 45 bullets weigh 60lbs together)

I would prefer to keep everything together and just sell as a lot to make it easy for me, but I could break it up if the deal is sweet enough. There may be a few other misc bits lurking around here somewhere, as you can tell it is a lot of stuff. Make me a REASONABLE cash offer, or cash + firearms Buy the whole lot for a reasonable price and I'll throw in a nice pair of Wagner brake calipers that are very accurate. You can also have the bench the press is mounted to if you want it, it's 3/4"" finish plywood with the press bolted through a 2x4. Please make it obvious in your subject that you are a person. Also, please don't lowball me, I'm not desperate to sell my gear and you will most likely get a rude email back if you insult me by offering less then 1/4 of what this stuff is worth.

If you know about the Saiga then you know how cool this weapon is. If not, I will give you a brief rundown. 

The Saiga 12 is a hybrid of a 12 gauge shotgun and an AK 47. This shotgun is made for battle and nothing less. I bought the gun new 3 months ago and I have been slowly converting it from its sporter configuration into the monster that you see. 

I have added:

- UTG tactical quad rail. This comes with the long and short top rail and rubber rail covers.

- Gunfixers low brass kit: A 5 stage adjustable gas adjuster and new plug and spring. This changes the stock 2 setting plug to 5 settings to adjust the amount of gas. This allows you to shoot low brass cheap rounds and bird shot. 

- AGP 10 round extended magazine. Also comes with 5 round mag.

- A red dot / laser site (not the one in the picture).

- Tapco T6 adjustable stock (dark earth)

- Tapco forgrip (dark earth)

- Case

I also have a bunch of ammo for it, Winchester PDX1, Brenneke KO slugs, Winchester rifled hollow point slugs, and others. 

Not only is this gun an absolute monster of destruction, it also looks the part. This can be a good an bad thing, this gun is one of the most intimidating looking guns at the range and it draws a crowd. It is for this reason that I have decided that I have to sell this through a FFL dealer. I don't want anything on my conscience if the wrong person gets their hands on it. I know an FFL doesn't guarantee anything but my hopes is that this will at least keep gangbangers from contacting me. 

I have about $1400 invested in this gun, and I work on a budget. There are still a couple things I would like to do to it. There is a trigger modification that is popular, its not needed but some people like it. If I don't sell it, I will be doing the this mod to better balance the gun. 

I am sure I will take the money and buy another gun so I am also open to interesting trades.

Langenhan F.L Selbstlader .32acp pistol. This is a German contract pistol made by Langenhan for the German military starting in 1915. This particular pistol has the plastic repro grips it did come with earlier wood grips and has a visible trigger bar. The bore is in great shape, bright and shiny with no pitting and strong rifling. The finish is a dull faded blue. This is a very interesting and collectable piece with lots of crown N proof marks. 

As I said the grips are repro, I have 1 (left side) original wood grip, it needs a right side. It is also in need of 1 screw for the catch at top as seen in the pictures. (there is a man I was in touch with at Evans Custom Screws, He said he could make a pair of these screws for $15.00)

No other night vision scope can match its performance, ease of operation or range detection. This scope means business but delivers pleasure!
     Designed to meet strict military requirements for extreme long range accuracy, the 6X RAPTOR® can be mounted on almost any weapon with an M1913 rail, including .50 cal sniper rifles. This Weaponsight incorporates a red MILDOT reticle with Variable Brightness Control, and can be zeroed with separate windage and elevation adjustments. Optional mount adapters are available for specific mounting needs.

   The red on green reticle  is fully adjustable for bore sighting and has separate controls for optimal reticle brightness and contrast for all lighting conditions. The reticle offers 0.2 MIL elevation and windage adjustments. A daylight cover protects the objective lens from dirt, debris and scratches and the image tube against accidental exposure to bright light. This daylight cover can be utilized for training and bore sighting during low-light conditions such as dawn, dusk or overcast days. A pressure operated Rubber Eyeguard provides operator protection from recoil and prevents light scatter from the image tube. Optional extended shuttered Eyeguards are available."

I bought it for $149 from Amazon with free shipping. It's yours for $125. I like it, it's useful, functional, and well made. I'm 5' 8"", 175lbs and it's a bit on the long side for me. It IS adjustable up to VERY big individuals, I just don't like the way it fit on me. I basically had to take all the adjustment straps down as far as they would go in order to fit me. Like I said, it fits, I just don't like how it fits. When I wore it over my body armor, it was just fine."

The gun has the basic black matte finished metal with a synthetic camo stock (factory) (Mossy Oak - actually looks pretty decent for a camo stock) - it appears to be an older model ADL as I have not seen another ADL with this particular stock (it's all hard-stock not the new jello BS and it is branded as a Remington factory stock)

I would rate the gun overall as 95% since it looks great but as much as I have hunted with it I'm sure I (or you) could probably find a small handling mark somewhere if you really wanted to - nothing that has been hunted with is 100% flawless IMO (But it really does look great - pics do no justice)

The rifle does have a cheapo scope on it that is sighted dead on at 125 w/180gr Core-Lokt ammo - You will want to get a different scope if you plan for any serious use. (P.S. This scope really doesn't effect my idea of the value at all)

The gun is in good condition and is DEADLY accurate (I use 165/180gr Hornaday or Federal ammo in it) - I just want a different flavor.

I have pics available Via E-Mail for those who are interested / have interesting offers.

I am ONLY LOOKING FOR:

Long-Guns - 243/6mm or Larger(Rem 700, Win 70,Ruger M77,Savage, possibly Vanguard etc etc - looking for even trade of like-quality firearms) - Feel free to offer any other quality firearms you may want.

These are not the cheap Romanian versions you see flooding the market today. Therefore, they hold their value and are of very high quality (hence the reason Norinco has several contracts with western governments to provide firearms).

What an amazing gun. Fires like a dream. I was able to achieve a 3 in. spread at 150m (which is superb for an AK47). In great condition, fired <200 rounds total.
