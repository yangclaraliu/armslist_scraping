Bought the company I work for and have very little time to shoot these days.  Need feedback or personal contact info on me?  Just ask. Bought new March 2016 and have only been out 2 or 3 times with this. Round count is under 300. Rifle was cleaned after each use and stored in my climate controlled gun room in a safe. Rifle is stock / unmodified with the exception of the VG6 brake shown in the photos. I have the original flash hider and will re-install prior to shipping unless bought with rifle (See below). Please note: Tavors are not intended to be ""pretty"" and the FDE colors throughout the rifle are not a perfect match. Plastic molding and fitting is not on par with the finest the plastics industry has to offer - this is a military-grade rifle and is not intended to be ""pretty"". All pieces and parts on this rifle are exactly as it was supplied by the factory - nothing has been changed or replaced. Your purchase includes shipping (USPS Priority Mail with Insurance), the original box, all original paperwork and kit items, one black Gen 3 Magpul magazine (20 or 30, you tell me), and the stock Tavor.Selling for $1200 shipped (Firm) in stock form. Will sell for $1275 shipped with the VG6 pictured. This is one of the best-rated recoil reducing devices available, and is also one of the smallest / shortest. Will sell for $1650 shipped with the VG6 and the Aimpoint PRO pictured. The Aimpoint is sighted in at approximately 50 yards, and is the same age as the Tavor (still on it's 1st battery). Conditions:Payments via USPS money orders strongly preferred, and I will deduct $25 from my asking price so you can overnight the payment to me (USPS next day letter). I may consider a mix of USPS money orders and Paypal sent w/o fees. Your FFL must accept shipments from individuals (with copy of my ID's in the box), and I must have your FFL's info in hand before shipping. See my feedback - this is not my first firearm sale."

I will not separate. Made of real cast iron it’s definitely heavy duty construction and in decent shape overall. I disassembled it and cleaned it up a bit and lubed all the moving parts. The top is threaded for standard size 7/8-14 dies and the rams have what appear to be homemade shell holder adaptors to fit current standard shell holders. I do not have the priming arm or primer catcher cup. It was designed to process 2 pieces of brass in a single stroke, or as a swaging press for increased production.
There has been some questions over the price, The Herter’s shell adaptors run about $4ea average on sites such as eBay so $4x21=$84 with the balance going towards the press.
Due to the size/weight the buyer will have to pay for shipping unless a FTF meeting can be aranged. Cash or Money order only.
Here is the list of the 21 Herter’s shell holders that I have. Most of them are pairs, but a few are only singles noted below. I do have a scan of the full shell holder list (googled) available to show what all the holders fit. #1 = 30-06 (qty 1) #3 = 30-40 Krag #5 = .222/.223 (qty 1) #6 = .38/.357 #7 = .45-70, .378 Weth/.460 Weth #8 = Most H&H based Belted Mags (qty 1) #9 = 30 Rem #18 = Weth belted mags #21 = 6.5x55 #22 = .44 Spl/.44 Mag #23 = .45 Colt #26 = 6.5 Jap/Carcano/.220 Swift/7.65 Belg"

Great pistol and fun to shoot! No issues! Clean as can be!

Browning designed M1911 semi-automatic pistol, used by the US military for over 70 years. The 1911-22 shoots inexpensive 22LR ammo, and with controls that operate as those on the original Browning designed 1911, the 1911-22 makes a great practice and training pistol. With a main frame that's 85% smaller than the original 1911, the 1911-22 fits younger shooters and allows them to experience part of American firearm history. The 1911-22 A1 Black Label is constructed with a polymer frame with an integral Picatinny rail to attach after market laser sights or tactical flashlights. The slide is made of machined aluminum with a matte black finish, and the barrel is stainless steel. An extended ambidextrous thumb safety, and an extended slide release facilitate operation by all shooters. A checkered front strap and laminated, stippled grips provide a positive non-slip grip in all shooting environments. The Browning 1911-22 A1 Black Label Semi-Auto Pistol uses a reliable 10-round magazine, made of heat-treated steel and coil springs."
