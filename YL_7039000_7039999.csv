Slide stop has been replaced with a new Tokarev slide stop.The Model 213 is a civilian 9mm variant of the Type 54, which itself is a copy of the iconic Tokarev. The Type 54 has been called ""The Black Star."" The Model 213 has a magwell spacer in it which may be removed, allowing you to use Type 54 magazines.If you replace the barrel and the bushing and remove the spacer, you will be able to fire Tok ammunition. If you change the slide and do the above, it is a total conversion to a Type 54 setup. The 9mm slide's ejection port is too short to cycle unfired Tok ammo, meaning that it is not recommended to carry it with Tok ammo and the 213 slide due to the possibility of a jam being unable to be conventionally cleared.This means that if you buy a Tok ammo slide, barrel and bushing, remove the magwell, and use Tok ammo magazines you will have a pistol which you can convert to 9mm by only replacing the barrel and bushing and then pushing 9mm ammo to the front of the Tok ammo magazines while loading.Kept as-is, it is a reliable and shockingly accurate, especially for its price, pistol with some interesting history.Includes one magazine with a pinky shelf and one magazine's worth of ball ammunition in addition to the original box.A great gun for a collector, beginner, or as a backup for a ready kit."

Not high end collector grade but it's the nicest shooter grade I've ever seen. No box or papers, original owner didn't have them anymore. Happy to send more pictures if interested. Recent storms have caused me expensive damage, don't really want to part with it but don't have much choice. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Prefer straight cash sale, but just to get money for repairs I will take $1000 cash and something in trade. Make me a offer, I try to be as reasonable as possible. Thanks."

Are you a fan of revolvers but want faster reloads and better concealability? Do you want safety, compactness and versatility without sacrificing accuracy? Are you a first time shooter or an experienced pistoleer looking for your next trusty pocket monster?
If you answered ""yes"" to any of those questions, you might want to keep reading. If none of those hypoteticals applied to you, you've come this far already- keep reading.The P290RS is the sturdy BMW of pocket rockets. Chambered in 9mm, the ""RS"" stands for re-strike, meaning the pistol has the ability to allow you a second chance at a misfired round/pistol pushed out of battery before executing remedial action! Not that you'll need it of course, this thing was built to keep shooting under even the most extreme conditions.The A-10 Warthog of pocket pistols, the P290RS understands what a man (or woman) wants when they truly appreciate the art of the gun. Built like a tank with Sig Sauer quality in a package rivaling the Glock 43-sized competition, the 290RS stands apart in safety, reliability and most importantly, accuracy.
Having fired many rounds from the 290RS series (not this specific pistol, of course- it has only had the test fire for reliability done), you are going to be *amazed* at how accurate the 290RS is. Despite having a trigger feel akin to a tuned carry revolver (which makes it perfect for people who like a good revolver but want faster reloads, better accuracy and more capacity), the 290RS is a smooth shooter that has effortless follow-up, excellent safety features and a clean pull. She's user friendly, for newbies and experienced pistoleers alike.Of course, this isn't all the 290RS package has to offer. With tritium night sights, the 290RS literally requires *nothing* to be considered ""carry ready""- this baby is ready to fly right outside of the box. Speaking of the box, everything that came from the factory is included in the box- SIG decal, manual, warranty card, takedown tools, 7-round and 8-round magazines, Lucas Gun Oil, safety lock and an open-carry holster (which you could technically wear under a shirt in Florida until a dedicated IWB holster comes your way).
In the spirit of being a good host, I'm including a safety orange snap cap (for safe dry fire training) and a box of ammunition. Basically, your first trip to the range is (kinda) on me, just pay your own range fee.
So, at this point, I'm guessing all this sounds too good to be true. Don't sweat it. I just got married on July 4, so I have to slim my collection down a bit. Deciding between the 290RS and another sidearm came down to a coin toss. That said, I'm not desperate for cash, so don't think about low-balling. So here is what you're getting:
P290RS with night sights
x1 7rd flush magazinex1 8rd extended magazinex1 casedocuments, lubrication, takedown toolsx1 snap capx1 box of ammunitionx1 holsterMust have Florida state ID or CCW. CCW holders preferred, though any and everyone interested will sign a hand reciept stating that you can A) legally own the firearm and B) have no intention of using the firearm for illicit activities. I reserve the right to refuse sale to anyone.Make my loss your gain and take home a concealed carry/self-defense powerhouse at a fraction of the price today!"

The eagerly anticipated subcompact model of the acclaimed Heckler & Koch VP Series handgun, VP9SK (in 9 mm) has all of the sought-after characteristics of larger frame VP pistols but in a more concealable design. The highly-rated HK VP precision strike trigger is also found on the VPSK. The VP trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The net result is trigger quality unmatched in production striker fired pistols. A small-scale interpretation of the completely adjustable VP grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the compact grip frame of the VP9SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit any individual user and is a feature found only on Heckler & Koch handguns. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. The VPSK has the features of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the paddle style magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. HK’s patented charging supports, found on full size VP pistols, are also present on the VPSK. The charging supports are simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. VPSK pistols can use a variety of proven HK magazines, including compact double stack 10-round and 13-round with either flat or extended floorplates for a more ergonomic grip. The VPSK can also use the same high capacity 15-round magazine used by the full size VP and P30 handguns. Magazine sleeves that replicate the grip profile of the VP handgun are also available. VPSK pistols have an abbreviated Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into their polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. VPSK pistols use a proprietary captive flat recoil spring that helps reduce the recoil forces affecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component life span. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures a long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VPSK’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. Despite their small size, VPSK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. VPSK models are currently available in 9 mm. VPSK pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany and are well suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. A high quality and well-engineered design, the VP9SK possesses all the features and long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. And like full size VP pistols, the VP9SK is value priced at $719 (MSRP). Heckler & Koch VP9SK 700009KA5 FREE SHIPPING!"

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change."
