The new Cerakote™ white matte distressed finish would intimidate even the most wild of beasts and evil immortals. For shooting enthusiasts who do not really worry about the apocalypse, this new Mark XIX Desert Eagle white matte distressed finish just earns kudos for its “cool factor”. The new Cerakote finish consists of a multi-step process which involves a high temperature ceramic coating that holds up well under normal use. It has been extensively tested for durability and has proven to be very tough. The Apocalyptic Desert Eagle comes in two calibers: .50 AE and .44 Magnum. The .50 AE is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a 7-round capacity. The .44 Magnum has an 8-round capacity. Both guns measure 10.75” in length with a 6” barrel. Slide width is 1.25”, height 6.25” and the weight with an empty magazine is approximately 4 lbs. 5.8 oz. in .50 AE, and 4 lbs. 6.6 oz. in the .44 Mag. It has a trigger reach of 2.75” and a sight radius of 8.5” with the 6” barrel. The construction of the Desert Eagle utilizes the latest CNC machine technology providing exacting specifications with tight tolerances creating a work of art in a precision firearm. This Desert Eagle features a G10 grip. The G10 material is a high-pressure thermoset plastic laminate consisting of multiple layers of woven fiberglass mesh cloth impregnated with an epoxy resin binder. It is anatomically formed and provides an ideal hand seating angle for two-handed shooting allowing for comfortable, rapid and accurate firing. The Weaver style accessory rail easily allows for aftermarket optics and scope rings.Learn more at MagnumResearch.com/DesertEagle."

I bought this a few months ago and never got it out to shoot, I was going to take it out west for some Mully hunting this year but I went with a lighter rifle instead. Never fired and just needs an optic. Original box, papers, warranty card, and Blackhawk Scope Base 20 MOA (installed) From the Savage Law Enforcement series, the Model 10 FCP-SR is a purpose built tactical rifle. This superbly accurate rifle has a free-floated 24"" barrel with a threaded barrel, and the renowned AccuTrigger adjustable trigger. An oversized bolt handle allows sure cycling even with gloved or wet hands. A Picatinny rail provides the base for optics, and the rifle is fed by a 10 round detachable box magazine. Twin swivel studs on the forend permit use of both a sling and a bipod.

She is a huge 1911 fan but her elbows are hurting these days and she don't want to shoot her 1911 45 or 9mm because it makes her elbow hurt after 5 or six magazines. In a pinch no problem she will shoot it but for a day of pleasure at the range it ain't worth it. She is my shooting  buddy so if she wants a 1911 380 or 22lr I will trade one of my glocks.  If you have one you are willing to trade let me know. Browning  only..

Chambered in .32 ACP or 7.65mm Browning, this gun is extremely similar to the PP but adds a useable slide release and conveniently located mag release. Can be carried cocked and locked. These guns are rare and few ever made it into the country. They were not terribly popular due to the caliber. If you have a lady that needs protection but is a little recoil shy, this would be perfect. Price is $500. Please do some research before offering any less. They just aren't out there anymore. Here's your chance to own one of the rarest Beretta's on the market."

It comes with a Pattern Master duck choke (new from Cabela's $90) as well as the original 3 chokes, and box it came in. I will throw in a carrying case for the right price/deal. It is as ""like new"" as you can get. It has a 28"" barrel and the choke adds an additonal 1"" or so. It shoots 2 3/4"" shells up to 3 1/2"" shells and has a red fiber optic front sight. These guns are incredible shooters and this setup will easily knock a fat mallard down up to 70 yads.

Being all steel, pistol is heavier than most with enough mass to genuinely control recoil/ muzzle flip and stay on target for devastating damage. I fired this once and put only fifty rounds through it. It is extraordinarily accurate. This was the tactical package which included two magazines, a magazine holster, a paddle holster, and the pistol has the trijicon night sights. Price is $500."

For some stupid reason ARMSLIST will not print advice of this nature at the top of every posting. But they sure as hell SHOULD!1) NEARLY ALL OF THESE SCAMMERS ARE FOREIGN AND DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH THE WAY AMERICANS DO, SO THEY WILL AVOID TALKING ON THE PHONE. They have excuses about how they cannot meet face to face nor talk on the phone. IF THEY DO HAVE SOMEONE CALL YOU that person will know NOTHING about the gun and will have a heavy accent. And the number will be through Google. While the posting that was copied from another site will be well written, the scammers emails will have bad syntax, bad grammar, and will sound odd. A genuine seller offering an expensive gun will know all about the gun, will have good emails, and will speak American. AND A GENUINE SELLER WILL ALWAYS TALK TO YOU ON THE PHONE. THE SCAMMER WILL NOT. NEVER EVER EVER SEND MONEY TO ANYONE WITHOUT SPEAKING ON THE PHONE WITH THEM.

The ejector rod is probably a replacement, screw heads are not engraved and the ejector rod is not numbered. It was very common for ejector rod housings to be removed on revolvers used in battle. Supposedly they would hang up on holsters. Also the barrel fit is not perfect, but markings on barrel are correct and match the remainder of gun perfectly.

Otherwise, you will have to come with me to my local shop to transfer it, and they charge $50.This is a Zenith Z-5RS, purchased from Atlantic Firearms, Sold by Zenith Arms, and Produced by MKE out of Turkey. It is the closest clone of the HK MP5 I know of. It is an HK quality clone as well. It is made using original HK tooling and the factory was originally supervised by HK Engineers. It is compatible with almost of HK made parts, including stocks and foreends. I wanted to file the paperwork and get a few American-made parts to make it legal, and SBR it. It is also Auto-sear compatible. It does have a paddle mag release as well.The firearm itself isn't very old. It was purchased in March, constructed in February. It comes with everything it came with upon purhcase: hard case, three 30-round magazines, picatinny rail and mounting screws, arm-loop sling, cleaning kit, 'birthdate' paperwork and manual. I am also including a magazine pouch that holds all three mags. I've put 250 rounds through it with not a single failure, a testament to the fluted chamber design. I only recovered about 25% of the brass since the roller-delayed blowback action flings most of them into orbit. I cleaned it after 200 rounds, and fired another 50, so the firearm hasn't been cleaned after that. The bore and crown are completely intact, and the firearm is entirely mechanically sound. It just needs a good cleaning. There is no damage to the gun either, aside from a few minor scratches from putting the firearm down and picking it up from a plastic table.I'm pretty firm on the $1500 price tag, as you won't find a cheaper one anywhere, accept through private sale like this one. I'd be willing to reduce the price in exchange for a stock used pistol, such as a glock 17, 19, or 21. I'm willing to consider any used handguns, but I'd prefer it to keep to a common caliber, with the exception of a PMR-30. I'm specifically looking for a Kel-Tec PMR-30 if you have one to exchange. Not accepting trades other than a minor one to relieve some of the pricetag, as I'm aware it's a premium firearm."

Or local pick up at our store in Hudson Fl.  For the discerning shooter who appreciates Italian design and craftsmanship. The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use. The WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for any shooter.  Features: Compact Polymer Semi-Automatic; Low Profile, White Dot, Windage Adjustable Sight; Double Action/Single Action Trigger; Enhanced Slide Serrations; Reversable Mag Release; Polymer Frame; Lightened Recoil and Hammer Springs for reduced felt recoil and loading"
