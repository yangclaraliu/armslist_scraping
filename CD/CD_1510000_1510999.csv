The unique design allows the rifle to break down easily into three pieces in seconds. This enables the barrel, action and two 8 round magazines to fit comfortably into the tough ABS synthetic waterproof stock. No tools are needed to assemble or disassemble. Once disassembled and stowed, it is only an incredible 16 inches long. Carry it in your backpack with room to spare.

Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.

It was purchased legally in a less communist state and imported with a fixed 10/30 magazine. The rifle comes equipped with a 6 position telescoping Magpul MOE stock. Although the rifle is currently in a configuration that complies with Nancy Pelogsi's socialist regime...it is easily converted into a fully functioning AR-15 once you leave this godawful place, or if you are enlightened enough to keep it locked and loaded under you bed. The magazine can also be converted to its native 30 round capacity once you've made it to a state where it's legal to do so. I upgraded the mag to Magpul Gen-3's with the coveted (and functional) snap on dirt protectors. Tell me how much you dislike the current political climate and I will provide you with an magazine at no charge. I'm a US Army Cavalry Scout veteran who is perfectly willing to apply the tools of my trade to make this legal in other less fortunate states. Let me know what makes it legal in the the libtard state you live in--and I'll make it happen. I'll accept USPS money orders (same day shipping), or personal checks (I'll ship when it clears). I'll cover the shipping expenses as long as your FFL will accept shipment from a private Obama hating citizen. If not, you'll have to pay for the FFL expenses (usually around $40).

I'm selling my brand new, never fired and never carried, full size Beretta PX4 Storm in .45. The gun comes with interchangeable back straps, gun lock, two magazines, hard case and all of the original paperwork that came from Beretta. I also have a Viridian X5L that can be sold with it or be bought separately. The Viridian has multiple settings for the flashlight as well as the laser and these settings can be changed at the shooters discretion. The laser is incredible bright and so is the light. The Viridian is used but in excellent condition and comes with the original box and all of the tools for adjusting the lateral and horizontal positioning of the laser. 

I know exactly what my pistol is worth and I know exactly what the viridian's value is even though it's used. I'm not looking to trade for anything and that includes other guns, ammo, home appliances, remote control cars and the list goes on and on. I'm also not going to sell to anyone that does not have a concealed carry permit or purchase permit. It's nothing personal, I just don't want the ATF knocking at my door. I'm asking 700 and I feel that this is a very fair price. I understand that there are potential buyers out there that may not share my sentiment but to each their own. I will not respond to emails telling me what my gun and viridian are worth or that 500 is a generous offer. If you can find this setup somewhere else for a better price, I suggest you buy it. Only serious inquiries and offers.

The Model 597™ is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.

Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.


Key Features:
Bolt-guidance system features twin, tool-steel guide rails
Sear and hammer are Teflon®/nickel-plated for crisp, smooth trigger pull
Non-glare matte finish
Adjustable big game iron sights
Patented drop-out staggered-stack, detachable, 10-shot metal box magazine
Last-shot ""hold open"" bolt for added safety

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries. The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. Operation The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts.

Comes with 7 mags, bayonet, original sling, dsa railed top cover for easy optics mounting and in the neighborhood of 200rds of 7.62x51 ammunition. This isn't a cheap century gun, it's top of the line. It will shoot 1.5 MOA using any ammunition you put through it, and I'm sure with a scope + good match ammo it could hit MOA if you're capable ;). It is a metric rifle, not inch pattern. 

And for one that keep asking for a price on the rifle, I have more than $1600 in it... Reluctant to sell unless I find a suitable replacement."

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol."

I have 4 steal mags for it 3 are 30 rounders and one is 35 rounder. I also have about 175 rounds for it. Mostly Tula but i do have some Wolf and some hollow points. It has a had a bold job done to it (modification so that you can drop and replace the magazine while the slide is forward.) Usually on an SKS you cant drop the mag if the slide is forward. but with the bolt mod, you can. My mod was done at a gunsmith not a DIY job. 

Im looking for $600 for everything. I figure each mag is worth $25 so theres a $100. The ammo is worth about $50 or $60. The upgraded stock $50 or more. and the gun itself Like $450. I also have some stripper clips i can through in. I even have another Mote Carlo stock i can through in. and the Original 10 round internal mag.

It has been fired in recent years, cleaned and put away. The stock is also in great shape, no cracks. I do have a few rounds and some brass for it.

$3,000!!!!!!!!!! GREAT price for a lifted wrangler! NOT A PENNY LESS!

I have a 1991 jeep wrangler YJ that has a 4 inch SUPERLIFT lift kit. Also has over sized tires that are pratically brand new (less than 5,000 miles on them) the jeep is a 4cyl 5 speed, with under 150k miles. Also it has the hard top sitting on it, but it'll require installation. The jeep will also come with a decent soft top that works perfectly, only has minor problems with windows. Jeep has sound bar, center counsel, all good seats, after market CD player, (that needs hooked up) and a full size spare. The jeep has alot of new parts, and I'd hop in it today and go to Cali and back. It does need cleaned up, as it sat inside my garage for 6-7 months.

I'd be interested in trading towards a nice open bow speed boat, newer set of jet skis, but my main interest is: 06+ YAMAHA r6, or r1. Really that's about it. Can obviously add cash to the right deal
