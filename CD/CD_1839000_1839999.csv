Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

124,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1839124,For Sale:  Huldra/Adams Arms piston carbine upper,"Shelton, Connecticut, United States",$ 700,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 3, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Like new. Only test fired at the range with 5 rounds each of .223 and 5.56. Same day at the range included swapping in a .22 conversion kit and test firing that. There were zero fails. And with the gas setting in the off position, the gas system remained clean during .22 fire (very nice feature). Since ownership, I added a few mods to even better its reliability and shooting experience. I added a BCM compensator that wipes out all felt recoil! I also added a POF roller cam that further smoothes out bolt travel, and David Tubb's precision ejector and extractor springs. The piston system is an Adams Arms system with Huldra's modifacation (pins, not screws fasten the gas block). This entire system is melonited, including the bolt carrier group and inside and outside of the barrel. Yes, the bore is BLACK! This makes for better barrel pressures and accuracy. I don't have an extra lower to keep using this on, so away it goes. The FDE ejection port cover can be swapped for a black if needed for no extra charge. $700 OBO."

The Steyr M9-A1 is incredible both in regards to accuracy, ergonomics and reliability.   It goes bang each time you fire it, and it is almost impossible to fire inaccurately. The sights are triangular which are very unique and took some getting used to, but once you get used to them, acquiring a target has never been easier.  Seriously, I absolutely hate to get rid of it. It is in excellent shape.

Everything includes:

- Original Steyr case and security locks for the gun

- 6 fifteen round magazines and 1 ten round magazine

- 1 Fobus paddle double magazine holder

- 1 custom Bladetech holster OWB for right hand in OD Green made for the M9-A1

- 1,140 rounds of 9mm


I think the price is fair for everything that is included.

Please, I only am looking for cash, so do not offer straight up trades. The ONLY trade I would consider is some sort of pump action shotgun + cash, because cash is the main thing I need right now.

This can not function as a magazine on its own so its legal to sell and transfer since its just a bag of parts.

(#299) ***NEW IN BOX*** BERETTA PX4 STORM COMPACT TYPE F, .40S&W with two 12-round magazines.

DESCRIPTION:	 	 	 
With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range. 

The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package. The 13 round capacity (12+1 in .40S&W) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols.

BUSHMASTER FIREARMS INTER ACR (Adaptive Combat Rifle) With ability to rapidly change calibers, barrel lengths and stock configurations, the Bushmaster ACR adapts to varied conditions like no rifle that has come before it. In minutes, without tools, it will go from 5.56mm to 6.8mm to 6.5mm by swapping the bolt head, barrel and magazine. With an exchange of stocks, barrels and accessories, it transforms from a close quarters weapon to a designated marksman platform. Simply put, the Bushmaster ACR is the highest evolution of modular rifle utility. This rifle is built specifically for law enforcement and tactical applications with Bushmaster's unrivaled standards for durability and precision. They've nearly doubled barrel life and reduced maintenance with the addition of an innovative protective coating. This is also featured on action components for dramatically reduced wear and enhanced operation. For the ultimate blend of strength and reduced weight, they used rugged, high density composite for the hand guard, lower receiver and stock. The heart of the ACR is their gas piston operating system. It's torture tested and proven reliable in the most brutal conditions on the planet. From the magazine release and fire selector to the non reciprocating charging handle, ambidextrous controls optimize user effectiveness. Add Bushmaster's hallmark commitment to quality down to the slightest ingredient, and you have a platform that's a natural fit for any operator and every mission."

I don't have a need for yet ANOTHER 9mm handgun so here it is! The prior owner, who shot it VERY little (less than 100 rounds I think) had night sights installed which still glow very bright in low light. Like many of the surplus Sig's from this era, the outside has some minor holster wear. On the inside however it looks brand new. Barrel is clean, parts are in great shape.

Included is the Sig, 2 8 round magazines, and the eponymous blue box. I also have the original black fixed sights if you feel like having a use for those.

If it comes to it, I can throw in some spare range 9mm to sweeten the deal.

If you're under 21, talk to me after your 21st birthday.

Price is firm, no trades.
