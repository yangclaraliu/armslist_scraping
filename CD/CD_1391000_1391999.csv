I'm helping my pop sell his LWRC.  It has a 20"" barrel and is less than a year old.  As you can see in the pictures, there are extra bits and bobs that can be purchased with it.  Ideally, I'd like to sell it as he used it.  That is with a gunbag, 2 of the plastic 20rd (CA Legal) clips, and the top of the Line acog with the ""German"" Crosshair redicle. It also has the so called ""Biblical UPC"" (JN8:12) and is 4x32 magnification.  It retails for $1800 and is less than a year old and comes with a case and paperwork (as does the LWRC).  Email me with any questions.  NO TRADES/Funny Business... This will be done by the book by the end of the week if I do not get the asking price, I will not sell. The Price includes 1 gun, ACOG, Bag, Instructions for gun and acog, acog case w/all that it came with incl warranty card which may or may not be valid (but there has been no warranty paperwork filed for either, I suppose you can try) and all other goodies that come with the acog incl lenspen, 2 Magmul 20rd clips limited to 10rds.

I use the Lee Pro1000 Press and have made well over 10,000 rounds with no issues.

If you're looking for the highest quality and most durable Lower Parts Kit on the market with all of the upgrades, look no further. The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that breaks at around 5 lbs and gets even smoother the more you shoot it. 

The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out (a problem in some 9mm ARs and full auto M4/M16s) and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and our Ergo grip featuring our Spike’s Spider logo. 

The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs. We also include quality spiral roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch as well as a ¼” allen screw and washer for the Ergo grip. 

This is the best Lower Parts Kit on the market that you can put in your lower. Everything is here that you need to save you money on parts and shipping costs.

This kit is brand new, never used. Was going to use for a build but didn't need it after all. This came from vendor in packaging labeled SLPK302 FDE, but it is definitely the BLACK version. The KNS Rotation pins come in separate retail packaging.  

Even though it is new and never used, it is being sold as-is no warranties expressed or implied.

Will ship for $6.50, on top of purchase price. Payment preferred via discreet paypal. Only other form of payment is via USPS Money order, but will not ship until it is received and clears bank.

These are very hard to get nowadays, get yours while you can."

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench."

Up for sale is my .40 Baby Eagle all steel frame. This has been a great shooter and I've really enjoyed it. Trying to consolidate calibers and this one is the oddball of my collection. One of the few calibers out there now that you can still find ammo for. I was in the Winston Gander Mountain yesterday and they had loads of .40 ammo. Still no 22's or 9mm to be found anywhere. If you want a gun that you'll be able to shoot now and still buy ammo for, this one is for you. Will include the box it came in when and if I find it. I'll update when I do.

This particular ""baby eagle"" model is becoming increasingly rare. In recent years of the pistols production, Charles Daly (who has now gone out of business) had taken over the importation of the firearm from Magnum Research, at which point the pistols name changed to the IWI Jericho 941. I have looked for other models that have the ""Desert Eagle Pistol"" on the side of the slide and ""Israel Military Industries"", but it has become harder to found another one in stock or for sale. This would be an awesome piece to add to a collection. As stated it is also extremely reliable and durable, well suited for duty work or concealed carry (preferably with a shoulder holster).

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine and one 40-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit."

Reduces the factory trigger from 5.5lbs to 3.5lbs. The GLOCK ""New York"" trigger has its name from the New York Police Department. It facilitates officers changing from revolvers to pistols. This part increases trigger pull weight from factory standard 5.5 lb. to 8 lb."" The combination of these two parts gives the Glock a heavy double action-like trigger pull with a smooth, crisp break. It gives the Glock a very nice feeling trigger that is good for concealed carry, and makes for better shooting!

The second part I am selling is a Lone Wolf pistol Grip Plug for Glock 17/19/20/21/22/23/24/31, or as I like to call it, a “butt plug.” The Lone Wolf plug is designed to close the open cavity at the bottom of the Glock grip. This will prevent debris from entering and reaching the trigger assembly and firing pin. Also eliminates possible snagging from open cavity.
Price: $10

Both of these items were purchased less than two months ago, and have seen little action installed my Glock. They are all in perfect condition, as seen in the pictures. I am selling my Glock, therefore I don't need these parts anymore.

It seems (acording to Dieter Marschall in ""Handguns of the Armed Organizations of the Soviet Occupation Zone and German Democratic Republic"") that these little .25 ACP pistols were status symbols in East Germany. Marshall states that the Tezet was not supposed to be worn in an outside belt holster by regulations but this was widely ignored by high party officials, staff officers, and Stasi. I have also read where female police officers prefered this pistol. I know that the belt holsters are few and far between. However I do know where to obtain/aquire a brand new shoulder rig for an additional $50 .. Let me know if interested.

 The Vzor 45, commonly known as CZ 45 is a compact  blowback operated semi-automatic pistol  chambered in  .25 ACP . It was made in  Czechoslovakia and later in the  Czech Republic . Derived from the CZ-36 following World War II, the CZ-45 is currently manufactured by  Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod  as theCZ-92.
In 1945 the CZ-36 was redesigned by Jan Kratochvil to make it easier (hence cheaper) to manufacture and became the Vzor 45 (model 1945) but is generally known as CZ-45. The safety lever which had sometimes appeared on the CZ-36 was eliminated (though a few early model 45s were manufactured with a safety lever). The changes included the addition of a side plate to simplify assembly and a magazine safety. The CZ-36 had a connector from the trigger to the hammer that ran on the left side of the magazine, whereas the CZ-45 has a Browning style stirrup-shaped connector that runs on both sides of the magazine.
The overall design of the receiver, slide, guide rod, and recoil spring are very similar to the earlier Browning .25 design. The barrel mount is also like the Browning, with a single lug that rotates into a slot in the frame. The trigger pivots on a pin.
When the trigger is activated and the hammer is down, the connector is pulled forward, rotating the hammer backward into cocked position. When the hammer reaches full cock, it is freed to fall and strike the  firing pin , which ignites the cartridge. The hammer is not cocked by the slide--technically speaking, this is a self-loading repeating pistol, not an automatic or semi-automatic. Other than the heavy double-action trigger pull, the only safety mechanism is the magazine safety. When the magazine is inserted, it moves a bar which allows the connector to engage the sear. When the magazine is removed from the gun, the bar disconnects the trigger from the sear.
Disassembly is similar to the Browning. Remove the magazine and make sure the chamber is empty. Draw the slide back about 1 centimeter and rotate the barrel clockwise a quarter-turn. Remove the barrel and slide forward off the receiver. Other than the guide rod and recoil spring, there are no small parts that come loose.
The CZ-45 holds 8 rounds in the magazine and has a simple groove down the top of the slide for sighting. Its great merits are its simplicity and reliability, ease of field-stripping, and accuracy--despite its primitive sighting groove and double action only trigger.
The only design weakness in the CZ-45 is a brittle firing pin (like the  CZ 52 ). This gun should never be dry fired.
In 1992 the gun was slightly redesigned, given a magazine release behind the trigger and a futuristic grip, and is now sold as the CZ-92. Unfortunately, due to the Gun Control Act of 1968, the gun can no longer be imported into the U.S., as it is too small. After the GCA blocked further importation, US Manufacturer Intratec started producing a near-exact clone called the Protec, though the build quality is somewhat lower.
CZ-45's are somewhat rare in the US resale market and go for about $250 in good condition and up to $500 in mint condition. CZ-92's are virtually non-existing in the US and go for higher prices, despite the limited applications of the .25 ACP as a self-defense round.
The CZ Custom Shop in the United States is planning to produce a limited run of US-made CZ 92's. A prototype was shown at the 2011 SHOT Show. CZ Custom aims to have the US-made CZ-92 included in the CZ Catalog at the 2012 SHOT Show. It is not confirmed if the chambering will remain .25ACP or possibly switch to .32 or .380.
The modern successors to the Model CZ-45 are the  Seecamp  .25 and .32, the  North American Arms  .32 and .380, and the  Kel-Tec P-32  and P-3AT.

 The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P220® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench."

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench from ATI]

    ANECDOTAL:
    Broker—While I liked the smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy – I thought the stock and grip too small and a bit awkward.

    Mac—The good news for my friend is that Xtreme is designing a completely USA crafted AK with an adjustable stock (that’s a story for another day).

    Deacon—The all American AK has been a long time coming. Since enactment of Bubba’s infamous assault weapons ban, perfectly good weapons have been mutilated overseas, stripped of the essentials and imported piecemeal to be rebuilt with selected U.S. components to make superior or inferior rifles depending on what side of the argument you choose to take. Having fired Soviet Bloc milled units in the past, I was pleased to see this rifle introduced by Xtreme Mfg.
    The inherent greatness of the AK has been its low cost of manufacture, the simplicity of the machines needed to stamp out the parts by the score and readily field a combat ready weapon. Tolerances are loose by design and while this built in “rattle” provides us with a weather proof rifle, it also leaves us wanting for accuracy. The 7.62 X 39mm round has been badly maligned as being inaccurate. It ain’t the round, it’s the marriage of receiver, bolt and chamber that seats the round, properly spaces the projectile and preps it for our hands to send on its way. I have a friend in the North East who has been hunting deer for years

    Broker: While I liked the Xtreme's smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy, I thought the stock and grip were too small and awkward.

    with what he calls “Russian rounds” from a Savage bolt action with a Douglas Barrel he had chambered for the 39mm. He takes a ribbing for using the stuff but everyone enjoys his venison stew and that’s where the laughter stops.
    It seems from all objective results that Xtreme has tightened tolerances and given us a solid receiver that will shoot on par with any AR upper chambered in the same round. If they pass on importing foreign furniture and sights and build entirely from U.S. components we’ll all benefit.
    Made in America. You have to love that. Sure there is room for improvement but the folks at Extreme are listening to the guys in the field and tweaking as I write.

The workmanship of this Model 19 is superior to the ""modern"" versions, such as the S&W Model 686.  As the saying goes, they don't make 'em like they used to.  When it comes to high-quality revolvers, older is better.

However I have alot more guns that shoot 5.56 than 7.62 X 39 so I can't keep enough ammo to really enjoy this gun. These are very fun to just dump large quantities of ammo out of.
