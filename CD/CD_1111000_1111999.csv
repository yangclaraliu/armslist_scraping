Never carried and less than 20 rounds through the gun and I can toss in 250 rounds of wolf 9mm still in the cases. The gun has an odd chamber cut and should go back to S&W (apparently others have had this occur according to the S&W Forums). It functions fine and the potential issue was only noticed by look at brass. I'm planning to send it back to S&W myself and even have a label ready to ship. But you could do too and it would cost you nothing since it's covered by S&W's warranty. I'd be fine with sending it back and doing a deal ahead of getting it back. It would be held for the person with no chance of it being kept or sold. I can send pics.

I'm also looking for a M1 Garand or an M1 Carbine. Things marked with HKP (Hong Kong Police) or RHKP (Royal Hong Kong Police) are also desired. Same with Hi Powers or Colt 1903s and 1908s. I have a C&R.

 I'd also consider an AK, FAL, or Cetme...yes I know they don't sell for the same as a Shield now, but Shields are hard to get so I figured I would toss it out there. 

I'd sell it outright with the ammo for $650 shipped and $625 for a FTF, but buyer pays the transfer of course."

- Fits all AR-type lower receivers made to Milspec standards. Will fit all select-fire AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. Will fit most of the semi-auto AR-type lower receivers (currently available).

- Height of rail (from the centerline of the bore): 1.215”. Weights (10 oz)

- The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

GUNS

2.Colt LE6920 AR15 Rifle - $1650
Newer version with the Rogers Super Stock.  Marked “Colt M4 Carbine” with a LEXXXXXX serial number.  It does NOT have the “restricted” rollmark on the right side of the mag well.  Don’t have the box, but it is in like new condition.  Has not been fired.  Includes all original accessories  from Colt (2 20 round mags, GI cleaning kit, sling, and paperwork).  I’m also including two NIP 30 round OD Green PMAGS, an additional Colt 20 round mag, and a NIP 3-pack of 30-round Troy Battlemags.  Includes paperwork/manual.

3.Beretta 92FS Police Special - $525
Brand new in the box and unfired.  Standard sights. Includes three 15-round Beretta mags.  Can also include up to seven additional 15 round GI mags for $20 each.  The GI mags are not in the package but haven’t been used by me.  The guy who sold them to me told me he got them new in the USGI NSN-marked packaging and didn’t use them either. Includes Beretta manual and case. 

4.Hi-Point 995TS Carbine 9mm - $350
New in box, haven’t even installed the sling mounts or charging handle yet.  Includes box, papers, and 1 10 round mag.

5.Glock 20 - $600
Low round count (under 200).  Currently has grip tape applied to grip, but it is easily removable if you don’t like it.  Standard sights.  Includes 2 15-round mags and original case.

6.Sig P232SL - $525
Very clean West German Sig P232.  Stainless finish.  Unknown round count as I bought it used.  Serial number puts manufacture date of 1997.  Includes 2 7-round stainless mags (rare and expensive) and original Sig manual.  Comes in very nice dark grey “SIGARMS” plastic case with dense foam cutout for pistol and mags.  

7.Smith & Wesson 1066 - $700
Very good condition with a few handling marks/scuffs.  This is the midsize model with safety/de-cocker.  These can be pretty tough to find, and they’re just about the toughest 10mm auto money can buy.  Round count around 1000 – mostly low-power target loads.  Includes 2  9-round S&W magazines.  I don’t have the box, but I’ll throw in a Plano pistol case.  

8.Walther P22 - $325
Used but in overall good condition.  OD green frame/black slide.  Has threaded barrel and 2 10-round magazines.  Includes case and extra front sight posts supplied when new.  

9. EAA Witness Elite Match 10mm - $600
This is the step-up from the base/ wonder finish model.  Full size CZ clone in 10mm.  Chrome and black two tone finish.  Includes 3 EAA 15-round mags.  Two of them are factory EAA replacements, and I’ve heard they don’t lock in well in the Elite pistols.  They made need to have their base plates filed down a bit.  I haven’t loaded them yet, so I’m not sure.  Brand new in box w/paperwork.

10.	Yugo 59/66 SKS - $425
Nice straight SKS.  Numbers match.  Includes bayonet and grenade launcher barrel attachment.  Original 10-round internal mag.  Wood is in pretty good shape.

11.Mosin-Nagant M44 Carbine - $250
Bought online from Aim surplus.  Nice looking rifle.  Needs cosmo baked out of the stock, as it leaves a greasy spot anywhere you leave it sitting.  Includes bayonet, but no other accessories.  Includes manual in Russian.  

12.Remington 870 Express Tactical - $500
Includes ghost ring sights and door breaching choke/flash hider.  Otherwise, it’s your run-of-the-mill  870.  Unfired.  No box but I do have the paperwork that came with it.  6-shot tube+1. 

13.Ruger 10/22 Carbine Package - $375
Unfired.  May have slight handling marks from sitting in my safe for over a year.  Carbine model with black synthetic stock and blued barrel.  Many extras including “Ruger 10/22” embroidered soft case, one original 10-round mag and one 25-round Ruger BX25 mag, a new in box Nikon Rimfire 4x32 riflescope (never mounted or removed from box), and a set of Burris Signature “Zee” rings.

I will ONLY sell these locally, so don't even waste time messaging me if you want them shipped. Sorry, but I've been burned before.

I have a .74 karat round diamond set in a setting with a total of 1.25 karats in it. The diamond is colorless or near colorless (H) and absolutely beautiful but you can NOT see any color in the diamond. It is a perfect cut diamond so it looks much bigger when diamonds are cut correctly or in this case its cut perfectly they take in the light and show it out and it looks great. You can NOT see anything in the diamond even if you look closely and stare (VS2). The diamond has a lifetime warranty with whoever owns the ring with replacement if the diamond is chipped cracked broken or anything ever happens to it. The warranty will come with the diamond wherever the diamond goes. It is through Kay and they are everywhere. The ring that the diamond is set in will also come with it and that will be free. It has a total of 93 tiny diamonds almost equaling a half karat. The ring is also under warranty for life as long as it is checked every 6 months. You can replace the diamond take it out or put it back in how ever many times you want and it is free. Free re sizing and re rhodium for life and the tiny diamonds are also replaced if they are lost broken chipped or anything ever happens to them. I have the certification for the diamond certified through GIA and bought from Kay it is a perfect cut so it is a Tolkowski. The ring has NEVER been worn and has been in the case since I bought it. Its in PERFECT condition and was never used. I bought it and broke up with my ex. I am more then willing to meet up with serious people and I understand this is a large amount of money to be spending so I am ONLY willing to meet serious people at a Key Jewelry store so they can identify the ring and tell you its real and worth what i am asking for it or another Jewelry Store. The Diamond is worth 5,500.00 before tax, and the setting is worth 1,000.00 and I spent just under 7,000 on it but I am asking 5,000.00 for it all. Brand new setting and diamond for less unused and in perfect condition with no tax and warranty for life. If you are interested call or text Josh at 530412O84O Thanks!

I have my RC car and all that it comes with. It is a 1/10 scale trophy truck; Traxxas slash 4x4 to be exact. I have two brand new THUNDERPOWER lithium polymer batteries that cost $140 each. I only used one of the batteries once! Brand new brushless motor, truck is totally waterproof and won truck of the year in 2009 and 2010. Also, it comes with the best battery charger. IT charges several types of metals and 4 different charging presets. It is the ONYX 230. You can charge it through an outlet or from your car battery so you never have to stop driving. Custom cooling system and tops out at 50 mph. Also comes with paddle tires(awesome for the dessert!) And several other upgrades and accessories. I really love it but it hurts my heart to see it sit. Plus I really want to start shooting for recreation but the funds are very low . I pray that you can help me out. If you are interested please call me, moses, at REDACTED or email at REDACTED.

Mossberg based this on the Stoeger’s Double Defense design with their Thunder Ranch edition of the HS-12 over-under tactical shotgun. Mossberg decided to  ditched the automatic safety that haunts most double barrel shotguns. Making the Mossberg Thunder Ranch HS-12 quick to the gun fight so that when you close the barrels the HS-12 is instantly ready to fire, without the need of engaging the safety button.

It’s got extractors, not ejectors, two barrel-mounted side rails for lights or lasers, a fiber-optic front sight and a picatinny rail scope mount that also has a rear sight notch. Why double barrel tactical shotgun? Well its simple you can get a tactical shotgun without all the evil black features some states prohibit. No magazine capacity or pistol grip to worry about on this one. Best of all no pumping, just load and you go.

More info from the website:
RCA has developed a revolutionary treatment eliminating the need for oil or grease on tactical components for the life of the weapon.

 Only OUR high performance parts go through a rigorous BlacknitridePlus℠ process that includes:



Molecular Realignment Technology 
RCA uses a proprietary thermal process
that aligns the steel's crystalline structure
to increase strength, hardness and wear properties which extends the life of the tactical component. 
Polymeric Adsorption:
We bind a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene to each part to reduce friction and improve wear. 


BLACKNITRIDE℠ Processing:
Much more than typical Parkerizing, phosphating or black oxide, Blacknitriding℠ is a thermal chemical diffusion of nitrogen and carbon into the surface of the steel. Only Rubber City Armory high performance parts have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal."

No greater names have ever been linked together more solidly than Winchester® and the Model 1894. Early on in 1862, Oliver Fisher Winchester began Winchester Repeating Arms Company  and followed with a series of fine rilfes like the 1866, 1873 and 1876. Then John M. Browning came along with numerous other designs which became legendary Winchesters, like the Single Shot 1885, Model 86 and the Model 92 among others. Then, in 1893 he presented to Winchester a model that was a perfect match for the new 30-30 smokeless cartridge, ushering in a new era in firearms development.  This rifle became the Model 94 Winchester. It was the ultimate iteration of Winchester levers and, although coming at the end of westward expansion, is often called ""The Gun that Won the West."""

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS – which stands for 1911 Compact SAS – comes from the SIG SAUER® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance."

 This gun has been fired and comes in the box and has the M4 style collapsible stock making this gun an awesome looker and awesome shooter. The box was opened and shot about 110 or so rounds.  I have the exact same gun that I regularly shoot with and it is amazing accurate with a good red dot on it and I can hit 5"" groupings at 150 yards with cheap ammo. The 110 round drum makes this gun a wicked force to be reckoned with. The way the government is acting, it sounds like these 110 round drums are going to disappear fast to never come back!!!!

This gun is awesome and hard to get right now because in addition to the 110 round drum there are 22 round mags that are available for them. This a fun gun with lots of adjust-ability for all kinds of shooters. From plinking to small varmint shooting to range shooting this gun can do it all!

Asking $700 cash or willing to trade for a good condition guns prefer 357 mag or 22LR or ?? . Please let me know what you got and how much you are expecting in value for the trade. Pics would be great too!

Hand-turn 1/4-MOA reticle adjustments (except 6-18x¿1/8 MOA; 1x20¿1/2 MOA) 
Guaranteed waterproof fogproof and shockproof 
Exceptional scope incredible price 
Side focus adjustment 
Lifetime Full Warranty 
The Nikon 6472 6-18 x 40 Buckmasters side-focus Nikoplex matte Riflescope is a rugged, waterproof, shockproof and fogproof scope. Put through an advanced vacuum process that removes virtually all air and water molecules, the scope's tube is then filled with nitrogen and O-ring sealed. This process ensures that the Nikon 6472 will perform under the most stringent of field conditions without suffering any effects of fogging or condensation.
The precision-ground and polished optical glass is coated with Nikon's exclusive Brightvue coating that allows 92 percent light transmission, giving you super clarity and high resolution. Positive, audible, manual 0.125 MOA (Minute of Angle) windage and elevation adjustments eliminate reticle creep or backlash. The scope features Nikon's specially designed Nikoplex reticle that is composed of a thick outer crosshair that steps down to a finer crosshair at the center. This feature leads your eye to the point of focus and allows for quick, easy targeting. This scope also features Nikon's side-focus parallax adjustment for even greater targeting ease. Just set the adjustment at the distance you will be shooting from and your targeting will be clear and accurate.

The Nikon 6472 features an adjustable 6x to 18x magnification and a large, 40 millimeter objective lens diameter, giving the scope an exit pupil size of 6.7 to 2.2 millimeters, depending on magnification. A 6x magnification setting on this scope makes the image appear six times larger than with the eye alone with an exit pupil of 8.9 millimeters. In other words, objects at 100 yards appear to be only 17 yards away through a 6x scope and the Nikon 6472 would work great at this magnification in fair light. At the 18x magnification setting, the exit pupil would be reduced to 2.2 millimeters. The Nikon 6472 is a full-sized scope with an adjustable magnification and exit pupil, making it an excellent choice for fair light targeting as well as long distance targeting in full light.

About Exit Pupil Size
The size of the exit pupil for a riflescope is determined by dividing the objective lens diameter by the magnification rating. The human eye pupil diameter ranges from 2 to 7 millimeters, depending on the amount of light. For proper light gathering potential, the diameter of the scope's exit pupil must be equal to or greater than the diameter of your eye pupil at the light level you will be using the scope. If you're working in low light, your exit pupil size will be of greater importance. With an adjustable 6.7 to 2.2 millimeter exit pupil, the Nikon 6472 6-18 x 40 Buckmasters side-focus Nikoplex matte Riflescope is an excellent choice for hunting in fair light or long distance hunting in full light.
