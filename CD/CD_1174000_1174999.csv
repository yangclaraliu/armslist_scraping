Hard to price the action job and trigger job as its roughly 6 hours combines of buffing and polishing small parts. Very tedeous job but improves action and trigger pull 200%!! I will say gunsmiths charge around $80 per hour or flat rate fees for trigger jobs and action jobs so id guesstamate it would cost you at least, at least, $150-$200 for the job to be done correct! 

Everything on this rifle is in brand new shape with the following brand new:
AKARS-Bushnell-Midwest-Case-Ammo

Stock Wasrs are going for $700-$800 used with just a mag!!! The SAR-1 is steps well above the Wasr so id hope it would go for well above that amount due to the $1000+ in upgrades!!

Has two hi cap ten round mags. Pics show it next to a 1911 for reference. Same grip width, more ammo than 1911. Frame is same as a 17 or 22, so grip is much smaller than a model 21 in 45 auto. Gun is only 1.1"" wide.  I will take $575 cash. Any reasonable trade for guns, ammo, optics, etc considered, but I prefer rim fires, 1911's, bolt guns and other stuff that is not inflated with the latest craziness (like ar, ak, etc).

Glock came up with this round to put 45 acp power in a short case that fits in a 9mm or 40 s&w size gun.  Because gap operates at modern pressures, it beats standard acp loads and is on par with +p loads. The ammo is from underwood, they made great ammo and their claimed velocity has always been legitimate in my testing. Much better than most. They rate the 230 hp at 900 fps.  My plus p acp LE loads usually chronograph at 875, so 900 is smokin for that big bullet. I have 8 full boxes and more is available from underwood, so no shortage like the other stuff.  It sells for 34.75/box plus shipping. I only want what I have in it. $290.

PENTAX PentaBright Technology: Your Best Solution for Top-quality Viewing

The complex science of optics requires attention to the type and quality of glass, design construction, eye relief, tube alignment, sealing against moisture, and user comfort. PENTAX has been an innovator in the field of optics for over 90 years, so no one knows optics better than PENTAX. We pioneered multi-layer lens coatings which greatly increase light transmission efficiency which delivers bright, high contrast images without flare. This establishes the core of our PentaBright technology.



Super-multi-layer Coating

All optical elements within every PENTAX product are treated with our time-proven multi-layer coating, which not only improves light transmission to deliver bright, high contrast images without flare, but also reduces eye fatigue even during extended observation.

High-refraction BaK4 Glass Prism

Due to its outstanding refraction index, the BaK4 glass prism is highly acclaimed for its perfectly round exit pupil and clear, unvignetted image.

Aspherical Optical Element

The PENTAX aspherical optical elements greatly improve image brightness and sharpness, while minimizing disturbing distortions.

High-resolution Phase Coating

The roof prisms of all DCF series models are specially treated with high-resolution phase coating. Previously incorporated only in the most expensive models, this special process cancels the phase difference created on the wave front of light passing through a roof prism, thus producing sharp, high-contrast images with much improved resolution.

Durable Construction

Every PENTAX Sport Optics instrument is built to the highest of standards using some of the toughest materials available. PENTAX binoculars and spotting scopes are encased in highly durable rubber-armoured housings, which are designed to protect the optical mechanisms inside from shock and damage, while making them easier to hold. PENTAX waterproof products are fully sealed and feature airtight construction. They are purged with laboratory grade nitrogen to provide a fog proof view in the harshest weather conditions, and extreme temperatures.*

*Not designed for underwater use.

Long Eye Relief

The long eye relief offered in all PENTAX Sport Optics allow the viewer to see the entire field of view clearly and effortlessly. This is especially beneficial to eyeglass wearers, and allows viewing for extended periods of time without added eye strain."

Fired less than 400 rounds through rifle so these have seen little to no use. 2 are CMI, 1 is Borg-Warner, 1 is Kileen Machine Tool Company, 1 is Springfield and the remaining 2 have no makers mark but I researched and belive they where made in South Korea with US spec Machining equipment from US. If you know the markers to look for I think you'll agree. They had a small amount of minor rust, and they where wire brushed to remove rust. They probably need to be re parkerized, and can be done for 30.00 worth of chemicals. I have done it before very easy. These aren't mine an old friend of mine is having me sell them. He had them listed for 50 a piece and I talked him into selling for less because the parkerization has been compromised. The rust wasn't deep at all, it was a dusting.

After a ten-year absence from the American import market, Arsenal’s SLR-101 has hit the shelves once again. The rectangular lightening cut at the front of the magazine well and the 2-chamber muzzle brake hint that this isn’t an ordinary AK, but a milled-receiver 7.62mm Bulgy . . .Milled-receiver AKs run hotter and heavier than their stamped-receiver stablemates, but the machined steel receiver holds the barrel and trunnion in a vise of thick, inflexible steel. Stamped-receiver Arsenals are unusually accurate for AKs, but the extra rigidity of a milled receiver can cut group sizes even further in a well-made rifle. Unlike some milled AKs, the SLR-101 comes with a side rail, for a better opportunity to explore its accuracy potential to the fullest.

510,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1174510,For Sale/Trade:  Lot of Tactical and Bug-Out Gear!,"Lacey, Southwest Washington, Washington",$ 450,"Listed On: Saturday, March 2, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Huge lot of surplus tactical/bug-out gear up for grabs.  Most items shown in photos, some are not.  Priced individually or by group, but I'll give a HUGE discount if you buy the lot!  See bottom of description for details.

(1) Large lot of ACU-pattern military uniforms. All uniforms are in serviceable condition, but show some fading and/or light stains, small tears, etc. They are in ""field condition"" at worst (ie, still very usable), and ""garrison"" (inspection) condition at best. Selling as a lot: No less than 5 complete sets of ACU tops and bottoms, with various (matching) sizes: M-R, L-R, L-L and M-L (R is regular, L is long). Also included are several ACU patrol caps and boonie caps. I say ""no less than 5 sets"" because there are actually several more tops and bottoms, but I haven't sorted them yet. You'll get them as well. Price is $50.00 for the lot, and I'll throw in a few pairs of desert-tan combat boots (for free) in men's 10-R and 10 1/2-R if you want them. BTW, I'm 69"" and 190 LBs with a 36"" waist, and all of these uniforms it me decently...the mediums are just right, and the larges are loose but not poncho-like.
(2) CVC liner/commo system (for tanker's helmet). If you've ever had to buy one, you know how much the Army charges for these. Comes with the liner, commo system, and detachable cable. $25.00
(3) BDU-pattern NBC/CBRN suit (jacket, trousers, suspenders). Not in sterile packaging, so issued as ""training"" uniform. Pretty thick material, similar to a canvas Dickie's or Carhart. Believe these are mediums, but may be larges (don't recall at this time). Like-new condition, and meant to be worn over clothing, so they'd be great for hunting, working around the yard/farm, or messy chores. $25.00 for the set.
(4) 2 field-knives. One is a decent sized ""hillbilly toothpick,"" and the other is a small dive knife. Dive knife is stainless, but has some build-up on it that you'll need to scrub off. Other one has a slightly bent tip, but is still very usable. $10.00 for both, and would be great for bug-out bags and heavy cutting that you don't want to wear down your favorite blade on.
(5) Really nice, very large, ACU assault pack. I'd actually call this a ""frame-less ruck sack."" It's in really good shape, holds as much (or more) than an ALICE pack, has MOLLE and ALICE attachments, 2 large side pockets, and 3 medium pockets on the face. Also has a removable internal frame (plastic sheet), and a built-in water resistant liner. Only flaw is a small section on the flap where the stitching has torn, but that's a quick and easy fix. I've carried over 100 LBs in this thing for several miles at a time along ridge lines, and it was surprisingly comfortable. Was $140.00 new. Selling for $50.00.
(6) 2 ACU pattern 3L hydration carriers with bladders. One is used, and one is new. Both are fully functional, and I'll include a new Camelbak cleaning kit with the used one. The new one is Gerber, and I believe the used one is as well. If not, it is the exact same style. I prefer these to the Camelbak ones, because they're much easier to refill. $15.00 each, or $20.00 for the pair. Also have some ACU 3L Camelbak brand hydration pouches with bladders if you're interested.
(7) MILSPEC ACH (Advanced Combat Helmet). Size Large. Comes with ACU helmet cover, band, rabbit ears, chinstrap assembly, helmet pads...100% complete. This is the original ACH, meaning it's pretty similar to the current issue, but is slightly lighter. $50.00 (not pictured)
(8) ACU-pattern sleep system. Complete 5 piece set, with 2x compression sacks, heavy bag, light bag, and waterproof bivy cover. System is either new or like-new. $100.00 (not pictured)
(9) 1 set of M-R BDUs (top and bottoms). Excellent/like-new condition. $30.00.
(10) Complete IOTV, ACU pattern (not pictured). Slightly used, but in good shape. Includes the entire vest assembly and the kidney pad. Will include the throat/neck protectors, if I can locate them. Has kevlar inserts, and includes front and back class III plates, which are commercially-available MILSPEC plates, rated for 7.62 APM2. Plates and IOTV are size Medium, and sizes for these are pretty similar, as they are adjustable. If you are of fairly average size (say M-XL top), it'll fit you. $200.00
(11) 2x BDU large sustainment pouches (for ruck) and radio pouch (similar capacity to sustainment pouches). $10.00 for the set. 
(12) All ACU: 2x large sustainment pouches, 2x med sustainment pouches, 1x 200-rd SAW pouch (great for a drop pouch, and measures 4x4 rows MOLLE), 2x 100-rd SAW (or 6x AR-15 mag) pouches), hand-held radio pouch (works as quick graw AR-15 mag pouch, too). The large and medium sustainment pouches above are designed to utilize the entire side of a MOLLE ruck: 1x L and 1x M per side. $50.00 for all.
(13) Holsters: ACU drop-leg holser that attaches to a duty belt (right-handed). Multicam ambidextrous holster that has MOLLE straps on the back. Both are designed for large sidearms. Used, but fully serviceable. $10.00 each.
(14) Multicam pouches: 2x large sustainment pouches, 1x Tactical Tailor ""possibles"" pouch, and 1x knife/gerber/pistol mag pouch. $40.00 for all.
(15) Big bag o' chemlights: Estimate 3 dozen, in varying colors, including amber, orange, red, green, and IR. Old, but still in original wrappers. $10.00 for all.
(16) WWII-era pack frame. Got this for the big pack listed above. It's a pressed frame, with a canvas backing. I replaced the original lacing with paracord, and put on a removable padded waist band. I really like this frame, because you can mount anything on it; bags, game, bundle of firewood...it's pretty handy. I seem to think I saw a 1940s date-stamp on it, but don't recall with certainty. $15.00
(17) BDU IBA shell. Size is medium. No kevlar or plates. Includes kevlar groin protector. Works as a tactical vest (MOLLE webbing), and will accept a plate from vest listed above (giving you two vests with front coverage). $30.00
(18) Tactical Tailor ""tough case,"" and hard-shell eye protection case with safety glasses. Both are ALICE and MOLLE compatible (tough case uses MOLLE straps, and eyepro case uses clips). MOLLY case painted light tan to match multicam gear.
(19) 2x water/fuel cans. Both have been used for water only. One is a MILSPEC 5-gallon can, the other is a commercial 6-gallon can. Both are tough, durable plastic. Will include an unused screw-on spout that fits all MILSPEC cans. $20.00 or the set.
(20) IFAK (Improved First Aid Kit) in desert camo or ACU (you pick).  Includes 2 one-handed tourniquets, Quik Clot, and a lot more.  $50.00

Now for the best part: Even though I'm not in a big rush to sell, if you want to buy the lot, I'll knock the price down to $450.00 cash/trade value.  The only items I would be keeping (if I sell at that price) would be the 4 multicam pouches and one holster (you pick the one you want).  Really good price, as you get one of the best bug-out bags on the market, a water-proof sleep system rated down to -40F, full protective gear, some basic survival tools (water carriers, knives, chem-lights, etc), and quite a bit of very durable clothing! I'll even throw in some cold-weather thermal tops and bottoms, a wet weather bag, 100-feet of Para-cord, and more.

Now for the terms: I won't ship. You will need to meet me in the Lacey/Olympia area. I might be willing to travel a bit for the right offer, but I value my time more than selling off a couple pouches that have been taking up trunk space in my man-cave for a couple years. Next, I have tried to represent everything listed as honestly and accurately as I can. I haven't gone through everything and written down all the sizes, but will for someone who wants to make a serious offer. This is stuff my wife and I have purchased over the years, and much of it has been swapped out for other stuff that better suits our needs. Some is military surplus from local shops, other stuff ordered online, and a few items were actually found at Value Village (the WWII pack frame and the CVC liner with cable, for instance). It's all serviceable, though. Point I'm getting at is that in several places I've said ""I think it's Medium,"" etc. I listed my size above, and I can wear either a large or a medium comfortably."

Details such as the extended trigger pull which allows a much longer power stroke and the heavy duty components used in assembly are simply not found on other crossbows. The unique System 4 limb design, teamed with Radical Cam Technology and the continuous flight track assembly delivers incredible power, speed and performance. The Quad-300 is capable of delivering real speeds of over 300 feet per second when using 2219-XX75- 20"" hunting arrows. With this tremendous speed and heavy arrow projection, the power of the Quad-300 is bone crushing upon impact. In terms of speed and power, Barnett's Quad-300 out-performs all other production crossbows.

NEW Ruger 10/22's are VERY DIFFICULT to come by! By new to get the best support from Ruger (and they have excellent customer support).
This is the last one I'm selling. The last 2 I sold went within 1 day of posting and I have been unable to find any since.
Never been fired, new in the box. This is my favorite weapon to shoot! Affordable rapid fire shooting. It's so fun to unload a 25 round clip (and it'll cost you less than $1 to do so :D) Highly customizeable. I own three of these guns in different configurations!!
Comes with everything you get with a new Ruger 10/22 (10rnd steel mag, lock, manual, low-profile rail mount, etc).
I also have some 25 round Butler Creek magazine that I would part with for $50. These are reliable magazines. I have fired many rounds through Butler Creeks and never had a jam.

Barnett Quad-300 Compound Crossbow:
The Quad-300 is the fastest, most powerful production crossbow in the world. Barnett's leadership in innovation and superior technology is truly evident in this bow. Details such as the extended trigger pull which allows a much longer power stroke and the heavy duty components used in assembly are simply not found on other crossbows. The unique System 4 limb design, teamed with Radical Cam Technology and the continuous flight track assembly delivers incredible power, speed and performance. The Quad-300 is capable of delivering real speeds of over 300 feet per second when using 2219-XX75- 20"" hunting arrows. With this tremendous speed and heavy arrow projection, the power of the Quad-300 is bone crushing upon impact. In terms of speed and power, Barnett's Quad-300 out-performs all other production crossbows.

Foot Pounds Energy - 113,

Haven't shot it, to me its a collector pistol but if someone wants an inexpensive 10mm its a good way to go too I guess if you want to use it as a shooter.

This magazine is awesome. Ruger came up with an innovative design to couple two magazines together. Once the first 25rds are used, all you have to do is remove the dust cover and flip the mag over. As reliable as the standard BX-1 10-round Ruger rotary magazine. Stainless steel feed lips are designed to present cartridges into the action at a 30 degree angle for better feed reliability. Stainless steel, constant force spring provides feed consistency round after round. Anti-tilt follower is injection molded from a high lubricity polyacetal for consistent reliability. BX-25 X2 magazines will work with any factory original Ruger 10/22 Rifle, SR-22 Rifle, 22 Charger Pistol and 77/22 Rifle. The BX-25 will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition.

We all know the US and the internet is all completely out of AR Lower Receivers and back orders are 6-12 months long. Also, complete built new or used AR-15s are ridiculous in price so why not buy a lower and complete the rest when prices are normal.
The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for 2 months now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check. This is also a real machined lower, not a polymer one.

The World Famous PHAZZER Enforcer is a Conductive Energy Device (CEW) which immobilizes a target by firing two dart projectiles and delivering high voltage & minimal amperage into the target. The voltage and amerage is delivered through a pair of insulated wires, max distance of 15 feet in length for civilains and 30 feet recomended for law enforcement.

PhaZZer® Enforcer Conductive Energy Device (CEW) is a less lethal law enforcement-level self-defense device that provides the same effective take-down power as any Electronic Control Device (ECD) on the market.

PhaZZer® Enforcer is designed to be easy to carry and easy to use for self-defense purposes. When you slide the safety into the armed position, the device is ready to deploy an incapacitating pulse technology that interrupts involuntary muscle control in the nervous system. Neuromuscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology has been effective against any sized individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

PhaZZer® Enforcer CEW is similar to the Taser X26®, Taser M26®, and Taser M18® Electronic Control Devices (ECDs). PhaZZer® Ammunition is compatible with all Taser X26® and Taser M26® ECDs. PhaZZer offers six variations of cartridges including: Dart Pro 15 foot (4.5 meter); Dart Pro 21 foot (6.4 meter) LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY; PepperBall® 30 foot (9.1 meter); Rubber Ball 30 foot (9.1 meter); Paint Ball Mark 30 foot (9.1 meter); Multi-Target Pepper Powder 8 foot (2.6 meter); Dart Pro Non-Conductive Wire Training 15 foot (4.5 meter) and Dart Pro Non-Conductive Wire Training 21 foot (6.4 meter) LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY. PhaZZer Ammunition cartridges are a single shot application meaning you only get to fire each Cartridge once.

PhaZZer® Enforcer uses replaceable cartridges containing compressed nitrogen to deploy two small dart probes attached to insulated conductive wires that extend from 15 feet (4.5 meter) for civilians and up to 21 feet (6.4 meter) LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY. PhaZZer® Cartridges are compatible with all Taser X26® and Taser M26® ECD models. High Voltage carries low amperage sent over the wires into the dart probes. The pulsed electro shock can penetrate up to two cumulative inches of clothing, giving you a safe, convenient, and effective self-defense device you can carry with confidence as a less lethal option of protection. PhaZZer® Enforcer can also be used as hand-to-hand drive stun device independent of dart deployment. The charge transmits between the two probes into the body, interrupting sensory and motor functions to inhibit muscular control. This Neural Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) effect continues in 5 second cycles. Each time you pull the trigger, the cycle begins again, ultimately shutting down after the third trigger application. This new safety feature complies with numerous medical studies from the American Academy of Emergency Medicine advising physicians to consider additional treatment for individuals experiencing a CEW application of 15 seconds or more. Additionally, all PhaZZer® brand products come with a full one year replacement warranty (extended warranties available).
EFFECTIVENESS

PhaZZer® Enforcer is one of the only self-defense products allowing you to take control of your personal safety while physically incapacitating a potential physical threat.
SAFER FROM A DISTANCE

Unlike other self-defense products that require you to be close to the target, PhaZZer® CEWs are effective from a range of 15 feet for civillians to 21 feet (LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY), keeping you out of harm's way. Other personal defense options, such as mace sprays or direct contact drive stun devices, contain potentially dangerous chemicals and often prove to be ineffective for close range to an assailant or on individuals under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
EASE OF USE

The PhaZZer® Enforcer CEW requires no fees for registration to be activated, unless registration is required in the city, state, or country where the product is being exported to. Without the need to have activation codes, the unit is immediately operational upon receipt. The PhaZZer® Enforcer has been designed for easy use during high stress deployment situations. Combining a red LASER sight and LED flashlight with a quick slide safety, Enforcer allows you to respond quickly and effectively to a threat.
PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING & WORLDWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT TESTED PROVEN

PhaZZer® Enforcer is based on a similar design used by law enforcement worldwide. Compact and easy to carry, its 5 second cycle of incapacitation allows you time to get in control of a threatening situation and get to safety. When any PhaZZer® CEW is used in a self-defense situation, the CEWs may be deployed and left behind, providing the Operator User a window of opportunity to get to safety and call the authorities.

PhaZZer established a CEW Training Facility in Fort Myers, Florida, with the goal of ensuring our end user operators are thoroughly trained according to standard suggested usage. The Operator’s Training Program has been developed in order to instruct the user on proper CEW deployment. Our program features CEW characteristics, capabilities, operational safety principles and procedures. We also provide an Operator’s Training and Certification Manual that covers important information such as health effects, precautions, and equipment maintenance.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

Huge lot of surplus tactical/bug-out gear up for grabs. Most items shown in photos, some are not. Priced individually or by group, but I'll give a HUGE discount if you buy the lot! See bottom of description for details on that, and email me if you need more info about the items.

(1) Large lot of ACU-pattern military uniforms. All uniforms serviceable, but show some fading and/or light stains, small tears, etc. Selling as a lot: No less than 5 complete sets of ACU tops and bottoms, mostly med. and lrg.   I say ""no less than 5 sets"" because there are actually several more tops and bottoms, but I haven't sorted them yet. You'll get them as well. $50.00 for all, and I'll throw in a few pairs of desert-tan combat boots (for free) in men's 10-R and 10 1/2-R if you want them.
(2) CVC liner/commo system (for tanker's helmet).  Comes with the liner, commo system, and detachable cable. $25.00
(3) BDU-pattern NBC/CBRN suit (jacket, trousers, suspenders). Like new, not in packaging. Pretty thick material, similar to a canvas Dickie's or Carhart.  Meant to be worn over clothing, so they'd be great for hunting, working around the yard/farm, or messy chores. $25.00
(4) 2 field-knives. One is a decent sized ""hillbilly toothpick,"" other is a small dive knife.  Hillbilly toothpick has slightly bent tip, but is still very usable. $10.00 for both
(5) Really nice, very large, ACU pack. I'd call it a ""frame-less ruck sack."" In really good shape, holds as much as an ALICE pack, has MOLLE and ALICE attachments, 2 large side pockets, and 3 medium pockets on the face. Also has a removable internal frame (plastic sheet), and a built-in water resistant liner. Only flaw is a small section on the flap where the stitching has torn, but that's a quick and easy fix. I've carried over 100 LBs in this thing for several miles at a time along ridge lines, and it was surprisingly comfortable. Was $140.00 new.  $50.00.
(6) 2 ACU pattern 3L hydration carriers with bladders. One is used, and one is new. Both are fully functional.  $20.00 for both.
(7) MILSPEC ACH (Advanced Combat Helmet). Size Large. Comes with ACU helmet cover, band, chinstrap assembly, helmet pads...100% complete.  $50.00 (not pictured)
(8) ACU-pattern sleep system. Complete 5 piece set, with 2x compression sacks, heavy bag, light bag, and waterproof bivy cover. System is either new or like-new. $100.00 (not pictured)
(9) 1 set of M-R BDUs (top and bottoms). Excellent/like-new condition. $30.00.
(10) Complete IOTV, ACU pattern (not pictured). Slightly used, but in good shape.  Has kevlar inserts, and front and back class III plates, which are commercially-available MILSPEC plates, rated for 7.62 APM2. Size Med, and is adjustable.  If you are of fairly average size (say M-XL top), it'll fit you. $200.00
(11) 2x BDU large sustainment pouches (for ruck) and radio pouch (similar capacity to sustainment pouches). $10.00 for the set. 
(12) All ACU: 2x large sustainment pouches, 2x med sustainment pouches, 1x 200-rd SAW pouch (great for a drop pouch, and measures 4x4 rows MOLLE), 2x 100-rd SAW (or 6x AR-15 mag) pouches), hand-held radio pouch (works as quick graw AR-15 mag pouch, too). The large and medium sustainment pouches above are designed to utilize the entire side of a MOLLE ruck: 1x L and 1x M per side. $50.00 for all.
(13) Holsters: ACU drop-leg holser that attaches to a duty belt (right-handed). Multicam ambidextrous holster that has MOLLE straps on the back. Both are designed for large sidearms. Used, but fully serviceable. $10.00 each.
(14) Multicam pouches: 2x large sustainment pouches, 1x Tactical Tailor ""possibles"" pouch, and 1x knife/gerber/pistol mag pouch. $40.00 for all.
(15) Big bag o' chemlights: Estimate 3 dozen, in varying colors, including amber, orange, red, green, and IR. Old, but still in original wrappers. $10.00 for all.
(16) WWII-era pack frame. Got this for the big pack listed above. It's a pressed frame, with a canvas backing.  $15.00
(17) BDU IBA shell. Size is medium. No kevlar or plates. Includes kevlar groin protector. Works as a tactical vest (MOLLE webbing), and will accept a plate from vest listed above (giving you two vests with front coverage). $30.00
(18) Tactical Tailor ""tough case,"" and hard-shell eye protection case with safety glasses. Both are ALICE and MOLLE compatible (tough case uses MOLLE straps, and eyepro case uses clips). MOLLY case painted light tan to match multicam gear. $15.00
(19) 2x water/fuel cans. Both have been used for water only. One is a MILSPEC 5-gallon can, the other is a commercial 6-gallon can. Both are tough, durable plastic. Will include an unused screw-on spout that fits all MILSPEC cans. $20.00 or the set.
(20) IFAK (Improved First Aid Kit) in desert camo or ACU (you pick). Includes 2 one-handed tourniquets, Quik Clot, and a lot more. $50.00

Will sell entire lot for $450.00, or similar value in trade.  For that price, I would keep the 4 multicam pouches and 1 holster (you pick the one you want), but would throw in a lot of other stuff...cold weather gear, 100' para-cord, wet weather bag, and more.  Willing to meet up within 20 miles of Lacey/Oly."

PhaZZer®Dragon CEW is similar in operation and effect compared to all Taser® Electronic Control Devices (ECDs). PhaZZer® CEW Ammunition is compatible with all Taser X26 and Taser M26 ECDs. PhaZZer offers five variations of ammunition cartridges, including: Dart Pro 15 foot (4.5 meter); Pepper Ball® 30 foot (9.1 meter); Rubber Bullet 30 foot (9.1 meter); Paint Ball 30 foot (9.1 meter); and Multi-Target Pepper Powder 8 foot (2.6 meter). All PhaZZer projectiles have an average velocity of 155 feet per second (fps).

PhaZZer®Dragon CEW was designed to be easy to carry and simple to use. Strictly for self-defense purposes. When you slide the safety into the armed position, the device is ready to deploy an incapacitating pulse technology that interrupts the voluntary muscle control of the nervous system upon 2-5 seconds of contact with the target. Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology has shown to be effective against any sized individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

Professional Engineering& Worldwide Law Enforcement Tested Proven

PhaZZer®Dragon CEW uses replaceable cartridges containing compressed nitrogen that deploy two small dart probes attached to insulated conductive wires extending to max 15 feet (4.5 meters) for civilians. PhaZZer® Ammunition Cartridges have been professionally tested and proven to be universally compatible with all Taser® X26 and Taser® M26 ECD models and vica versa. PhaZZer® does not void any warranties if a Non-PhaZZer brand ammunition cartridge is deployed from any PhaZZer® CEW. High Voltage is sent over the wires into the dart probes. The electro shock pulse can penetrate up to two accumulative inches of clothing, giving you a safe, convenient, and effective self-defense weapon you can carry with confidence as a less lethal option. The charge transmits between the two probes into the body, interrupting sensory and motor functions to inhibit muscular control. This Neuro Muscular Incapacitation effect continues in 10 second cycles for the PhaZZer® Dragon and can also be used as a hand-to-hand drive stun device independent of dart deployment.

Effectiveness
PhaZZer® CEWs are one of the only less-lethal self-defense products that allows you to take control of your personal safety with the ability to effectively control a potential physical threat. Patent Pending alternative PhaZZer CEW ammunition options offer a non-lethal versatility only available through the PhaZZer® brand.
See PhaZZer ammunition links to learn more. https://www.phazzerstore.com/Ammunition_c_10.html

Safer from a Distance

Unlike other self-defense stun gun products which require you to be close to the target, PhaZZer® CEWs are effective from a distant capable range of up to 15 feet, keeping you out of harm's way. Other personal defense options such as mace and OC pepper sprays may be flammable and contain potentially dangerous chemicals, often proving to be ineffective at close range or at a significance distance to a potential attacker or on individuals under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. PhaZZer offers non-flammable non-lethal OC pepper rounds effective at short distances and up to 30 feet.

Ease of Use

The PhaZZer® Dragon has been designed to be easy to use during high stress deployment situations. Combining a red LASER sight and LED flashlight with a quick slide safety arming mechanisim, the Dragon CEW allows you to respond quickly and effectively to a threat.

PhaZZer ® Dragon is based on a convenient, easy to use design that is compact and easy to carry on a belt clip sidearm holster. The 10 second cycle of incapacitation allows an individual enough time to get in control of a threatening situation and out of harms way. When any PhaZZer CEW is used in a self-defense situation, the CEW may be deployed and left behind, providing the Operator User a window of opportunity to get to safety and call the authorities.

Lifetime Replacement Guarantee

PhaZZer®Electronics, Inc. will guarantee replacement for any PhaZZer CEW free of charge with a same or like product within one year following the date of the altercation if the customer provides the following information to PhaZZer Electronics, Inc.

armed mode. PhaZZer Dragon has a unique Circuit Disconnect Rip Cord that deactivates
the unit if taken away by an assailant, preventing it from being used against
the owner. The PhaZZer Dragon CEW has no activation fees and requires no

I've only ever found 1 of these new in the store.
This is an awesome item! Ruger came up with an innovative design to couple two magazines together. It comes with a rubber dust cover to prevent the intrusion of dirt and debris for the on deck magazine. Once the first 25rds. are used, all you have to do is remove the dust cover and flip the mag. over. As reliable as the standard BX-1 10-round Ruger rotary magazine. Stainless steel feed lips are designed to present cartridges into the action at a 30 degree angle for better feed reliability. Stainless steel, constant force spring provides feed consistency round after round. Anti-tilt follower is injection molded from a high lubricity polyacetal for consistent reliability. BX-25 X2 magazines will work with any factory original Ruger 10/22 Rifle, SR-22 Rifle, 22 Charger Pistol and 77/22 Rifle. The BX-25 will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition. 
These are going for upwards of $145 on gunbroker.com before shipping!

The PhaZZer Scorpion is one of the most unique compact high powered multi-function stun guns on the market today. The rechargeable/replaceable battery pack was designed to eliminate, the common trend of disposable stun guns. The superior Scorpion battery system was designed to gain a more favorable public response to counter the fact that too many poorly constructed low cost stun guns with D grade components flood the market and have created unsatisfied customers. This is the simple concept of you get what you pay for, and PhaZZers goal is to educate the public that our products have value in several different areas including; product quality, guaranteed warranty, RMA program, tech support, excellent customer service for a proven brand.   The PhaZZer Scorpion delivers a 3000KV High Voltage Shock and is the ONLY drive stun gun to our knowledge equipped with a replaceable/rechargeable 7.2 V Grade-A NiMH battery and self-contained charging system (A/C adapter built in). The Scorpions safety features include the Circuit Disconnect Rip Cord technology which deactivates the units shock feature to prevent the unit from being used against the owner in case an attacker is able to take the unit away during an altercation. Upon the Ripcord being removed from the unit the 120db Alarm system is activated to attract attention and possibly demotivate the attack. The LED light may be used to cause a few seconds of temporary blindness when shined directly into the eyes of an attacker. The Scorpion is equipped with a safety on/off toggle switch with a separate momentary trigger system, as well as a momentary push button for the blinding LED light.

Female college student reports story about dorm room rape incident to PhaZZer Electronics, Inc. in regards to the PhaZZer Scorpion Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun with 120 dB Siren Alarm successfully fending off the attack.

PhaZZer Electronics, Inc. was contacted by a female customer explaining that the PhaZZer Scorpion Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun with 120 dB Distress Siren Alarm saved her life and assured her safety in a highly dangerous attack/attempted rape by a dorm stalker. Our customer reported being cornered in her dorm room by the stalker and she repeatedly told her attacker ""NO"". Our customer had the Scorpion Stun Gun in her hand with the safety disconnect ripcord secured around her wrist.  She armed the unit and placed her thumb on the ""stun"" button and attempted to jab the attacker with the electric current. He knocked the unit out of her hand dislodging the disconnect ripcord from the unit which deactivated the high voltage stun feature. The disconnect ripcord feature also immediately activated the 120 dB ear piercing siren alarm mode and was heard throughout the dorm building attracting attention to the scene in which the attacker immediately fled in panic. The customer reported to PhaZZer that the Scorpion saved her from a rape situation and emotional distress. She also reported a rise in confidence now knowing she could protect herself. These types of incidents happen more than people think on college campuses. Protect yourself with a quality multi-function non-lethal weapon like the PhaZZer Scorpion Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun.
