Someone in the past has removed the original finish and polished it. When I got it, it also had very old after-market sights installed. It also had a trigger shoe installed. I assume one of its owners from back in the day must have accurized it for competition or something?I have gone completely through it and repolished everything, including all internals. Replaced the springs, firing pin and a couple of other items but I have all of the original parts too. Took it out 2 weeks ago and shot approximately 100 or so rounds through it and it is a great shooter with very nice recoil and accurate as well. The mags (2 of them) should probably be replaced as they are not the best. I would stick with ball ammo as I tried a few brands of JHPs, etc. and it did not like them.It has the pearl-like grips that are in nice condition and fit well in my hand. If I keep it, I will probably mount it in a display box and hang it on the wall as it is a beautiful piece of history but will function if the need arises.Make me a legitimate offer if interested in purchasing. I don't have a particular figure in mind however I'm not willing to give it away either and am in no hurry to let it go.I am only attempting to sell or trade it so that I can get something of nice quality in .45acp or 9mm with a threaded barrel that I can install a suppressor on.Feel free to text me at 281.seven 36-nine 678Please do not ask if it is available. I will take down the ad if I sell or trade it.I live in Spring, close to Kuykendahl and Highway 99 to give you an idea of my location.Thanks for lookingI have lots of HD pictures I am more than happy to text anyone interested.

Both mags have pinkey extensions and there is one additional flat plate if you want to change it.  The pistol comes with a small manual safety that you can use or leave off if you don't like a manual safety.  It is DAO and has 3 dot white sights that are actually usable, with the rear adjustable for windage.  They are dovetailed in so can be replaced if you want a different type of front and/or rear setup.  The gun is used but has been well cared for and shows very little wear.  Now for the small print: This is a face to face cash sale only.  I must see a valid Indiana Driver's License and a LTC is also prefered.  You must be at least 21 and be able to legally purchase and own a handgun in Indiana.  A simple bill of sale will be done.  You will get no BS from me and I expect non from you.  If you would like to set up a time to meet or if you have any questions just let me know.  Thanks."

The wooden stock is top quality and the engravings are all done by hand. Pictures dont do this gun justice. Its originally made in Turkey, and imported and branded by mossberg. I hate having to let go of this gun but I'm having difficulty keeping up with my med school tuition along with living expenses. This gun goes around 900-1000 new  but I have put about 150 rounds through it and there are a few Nicks in the front wooden handle. I'm asking 650 but I'm open to negotiations, as long as you're not lowballing me. I really need cash at the moment. If your interested shoot me a text at 8134083364 at any time. Am willing to meet up to sell. I will ask for a valid florida ID and if you are able to show a ccw that would be great too. Will sign a bill of sale if you request it!Thank you"

It is routine that ATF and/or anti gun groups regularly try to sucker you in to making illegal transfers- either without proper vetting or permits, or by trying to get you to make transactions across state lines. Those are illegal and can get you in trouble. Don’t take the bait. Within the state be sure to do everything possible to insure you are selling to an authorized individual. IE: permits, CCP etc. Out of state it is MANDATORY that you only sell to an individual through a licensed dealer. Don’t give these people an opportunity to ensnare you.

I am interested in various guns, with special attention given to 10mm and .357 magnum (no J frames, though, please).  If your gun retails for more than mine and you want a bit more, I also have a leather holster, a kydex holster and leather single mag and Blackhawk double mag carriers to throw in which all together add about $150 to the price I am asking.  Please see the list below for guns I would like to trade for.  These are pretty much what I am looking for, so something other that what I have listed would have to be really interesting.  I may take something of lesser value with add-ons or cash thrown in.  Not really looking to add cash from my side at this time.On a side note, I will actually reply to inquiries, usually on the same day, even if it is to say No Thanks."

STI continues its push for honest, game changing innovation with the introduction of the Costa Carry Comp. Its island comp BBL is machined from a single piece of stainless steel, which eliminates timing issues and the potential to come loose. The front sight is attached to the compensated BBL—making this the first ever barrel with a compensator in front of an island sight. The technology further reduces muzzle jump and enables you to keep eyes on the front sight rather than the blast of the comp. The comp reduces recoil by 63%. The STI RecoilMaster dual spring recoil system further reduces recoil, effectively making this the flattest, smoothest shooting pistol on the market. This gun comes with a hard box, soft carry case, two mags and all that came in the box. this pistol shoots like a dream"
