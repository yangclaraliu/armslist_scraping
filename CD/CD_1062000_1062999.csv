Rifle comes in original Sig M400 box. Lower Receiver Housing ONLY is a Brand New ADAMS ARMS unit.  Lower Receiver is full Mil.Spec. & a perfect match to original. 
Why the change?? I recently purchased/built a number of Adams Arms ARs for my sons & I. I also have been buying & selling a number of rifles in the last couple of months. I picked up a handful of NEW M400s and really liked that the Sigs came with an ambidextrous magazine release (I am left-handed.) So, I swapped the lowers out on a couple of the guns, keeping the Sig Lower Housings, but transferring ALL the original internal & external parts. 
What you're getting if you bid on this auction is essentially a Brand New Sig M400 with a different roll-stamp on the lower receiver. 
Unless you too are left-handed, you'll never miss the left-side magazine release. In return, you get to save a couple hundred bucks over what a 100% original gun is selling for. Take a look at the pix. You can't even see the difference. :)"

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

Edit | Favorite
I've got some guitars and a display case I don't use and I'm looking to trade them for some firearms.

The first is a SX Les Paul in like new condition. No imperfections of any kind and only been played a handful of times. Strings on it are fairly new. Asking $200.

The second is a custom built Frankenstrat like Eddie VanHalens. Pickguard and reflectors are like the original, aged tone knob, licensed floyd rose tremolo that only goes one way, body is northern ash, pickup is a Vintage Extra Hot from guitar fetish, single coil pickup in the neck does not work and is only there for looks like the original. The paint job isn't the greatest but it's good for what it is. Started to sand and relic it but didn't have the time to finish. Can easily be sanded down and refinished to look even better since all the correct part's are already there. Got about $450 in it and can get at least $350 if I parted it out but I'd like to sell it as a whole. Asking best offer.

The last thing is a never used guitar display case. Has rotatable led lights that have never been mounted, backing is blue and can be removed, has red underneath. Hole has been drilled to hold my les paul in place but the case itself was never mounted as I couldn't find anywhere solid enough to hang it. All mounting hardware is still on the case. Simply drill two screws into the wall and the hangers slide right over them. Asking $200.

Can provide more pictures or info about anything upon request."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

A New Perspective on the Automatic Rifle: The B.E.A.R.™ combines design innovation and precision manufacturing built upon the tried and true M4/M16 rifle platform. The Adcor Defense B.E.A.R.™ springs from the M4/M16 rifle platform but offers a completely new twist. Available in many configurations, it offers the operator many significant improvements: A Revolutionary Gas Piston System (Patent # REDACTED8) Free-floating barrel and increased accuracy: A gas-driven piston incorporated into the upper half of the forward rail system never touches the barrel. No carrier tilt: The operating rod is connected to the bolt carrier by hex head bolts reinforced with industrial grade Loctite® 262™ high strength threadlocker. They are then drilled and pinned to prevent loosening under adverse conditions. The operating rod then rides through a machined boss in the receiver rail system interface keeping the bolt carrier in a linear plane as it operates. No fouling of chamber and action: Hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver. Because heat reaching the upper receiver is diminished, lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified. Easily detached lower rail system: No special tools needed for quick cleaning and easy maintenance. Wear on critical parts is minimized: The operator can easily adjust the piston’s cyclical rate for a controlled rate of fire. No need for piston rings: Extremely close machine tolerances of the piston eliminate the need. Exclusive Port Dust Wiper with Cover Prevents entry of dust, sand or debris: The spring-loaded dust shield mounted on the bolt carrier allows the bolt carrier’s return to ready position; the port dust wiper moves into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver. Withstands temperature extremes: because of the highly durable, self-lubricating polymer shield. Ambidextrous Forward Placed Charging Handle: Simplicity is Beautiful. Simple design: allows the operator to keep his or her strong hand on the firearm and use the other hand to clear the rifle. Ambidextrous handle: detaches easily without special tools and returns to locked position once used. It folds forward, recessed, and easily swings back out in a single motion. Non-reciprocating handle: only engages when the operator charges or clears. Rail System ( 7075-T6 ) Innovative, key locked, highly rigid rail system mounts seamlessly to the upper receiver: Design ensures proper alignment of the rail with a redesigned boss, spline and groove system. Upper and lower rail guards separate with the push of a button: No special tools necessary. Fully compatible: with optical, image intensification or thermal sights; laser targeting systems; bipods; tactical lights and Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES).

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

The only sign of wear on this bad boy is a small area of discoloration on the top rail from scope attachment.  I've taken a close-up picture of it but it's hard to see, even if you're looking for it.  Otherwise, it's only had 200 rounds fired through it and has been cleaned meticulously.  I'm selling it because I need the money for my upcoming wedding.

These both are brand new, factory original, drop-free magazines for your Glock 23 in 40 S&W. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height.

Technical Informaion: •Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity.
 •If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load.

NOTE: All current production Glock magazines are also compatible with all previous generations of Glock pistols.

Will sell one for $60, or both for $115."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

The rifle is in great shape, and has given me no issues. Just sighted the scope in dead on at 100 yards this past weekend, and was putting round after round in a 3/4"" group. 

I am interested in pretty much anything. I'd like to trade for a bone stock Colt AR15, but will consider other trades as well. I like flat top AR's, as well as ones with detachable carry handles as well.

Will not sell to anybody that voted for Obama, and will not ship to communist states.
