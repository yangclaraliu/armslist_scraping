You can tell it's a 3rd Generation because of the barrel NOT having a flash hider.

It is in great shape with NONE of the problems you hear about in earlier Cetme's. The cocking tube is 100% straight with good cocking handle gap, creating a very smooth cocking motion.  It also does NOT have a ground bolt. I can e-mail you a picture, if you would like to see it.

It has recently refinished wood parts that look and feel very nice. It has a Port Buffer on it, meaning not only does your brass not go flying 30+ Feet (Common with all HK Clones), but will also keep it from getting mangled upon ejection, so you can reload the brass.

You would be hard pressed to find a better shooting Cetme. Put 2 in center bullseye at 100 yards using the iron sights when I was at the range 2 weeks ago.

I have alot of extra parts including stocks, hand gaurds, pistol grips, and a Carry Handle that I am including in the deal.
Comes with 3 20-Round HK Aluminum Mags, 1 20-Round Steel Cetme mag, and 1 5-Round Steel mag.

-Bell & Carlson A5 Medalist Stock in tan w/ black webbing - includes adjustable length of pull, adjustable cheek weld, and aluminum bedding block

-Vortex bubble level

Score High gunsmithing in Albuquerque did a trigger job and precision scope mount as well. Rifle was shooting very well with the original Hogue stock, and can only imagine tighter groups with the new stock and trigger job. Scope turret clicks were verified to be exactly 0.1mil per click, and glass is in perfect shape. An accuracy diagnostic was performed and showed the rifle to be in great shape.  

This rifle needs absolutely nothing to start shooting, just zero the scope! I just got it back from Score High, but decided that I don't need so many Rem 700's, and could use the $ to pay off some bills. There is over $2600 into this rifle not including the cost of the trigger job, stock bedding job, and precision scope mount.

EQUINE RUBBER SURFACES

SplashScapes Equine Rubber Surfaces are tough, durable, and non-slip surfaces. Our Rubber Surfaces are environmentally friendly, created from recycled rubber granules. The Equine Rubber Surface will not harbor or grow bacteria. The surface is generally ¾ -1 ½ inches thick and made up from a combination of recycled rubber and the highest quality polyurethane binder available. The surface is generally laid on a concrete, asphalt, or crushed gravel base.

SplashScapes Equine Surfaces Are Most Suitable For:

Pathways & Aisles
Stalls & Stable Floors
Exercise Rings
Barns & Arenas
Horse Trailers & Ramps
Wash Stalls & Tacking Areas

SplashScapes Equine Safety Surface can be installed in new or existing facilities. Our Rubber Surface will minimize clean up time and will reduce bedding costs up to 50%, saving both time and money. With a textured surface, it provides traction and reduces injuries. Our Equine Rubber Surfaces provides comfort for the horse and will reduce stress on their back, legs, joints and muscles while standing

SplashScapes Rubber Equine Surfaces are a seamless wet pour system. Our Rubber Surface will not roll, buckle, or curl. We offer two Equine Rubber Surfaces, a porous and nonporous surface. Our first Equine surface is unsealed, where any excess liquid will penetrate through the surface and drain out. Our second Equine Surface is sealed, creating a completely waterproof surface.

Top Reasons To Use Equine Safety Surface

Elasticity: suitable even for irregular surfaces
Safety: provides cushion and prevents injury
Hygienic: easy to clean, isolates dirty surfaces and deposited liquids
Non-skid: designed to resist wear and hoof scraping

The most compact EOTech holographic weapon sight yet, the XPS/EXPS series runs on a single CR-123 battery, yet delivers up to 600 hours of continuous operation. These sights deliver all the fast, heads-up, both-eyes-open target acquisition of the traditional EOTech sight in an ultra-compact package. Overall sight length is less than 3¾"" because the battery is mounted crossways, at the front of the housing. Sealed, waterproof buttons let you activate the high-visibility red reticle and precisely adjust the brightness level for any ambient light conditions. Automatically shuts off after 8 hours (user may reset to 4 hours) to preserve battery life. Fully adjustable for windage and elevation in ½ MOA clicks. Non-magnifying, fogproof optics of shatter-resistant, anti-glare coated laminate provide exceptional clarity and unlimited eye relief. Base requires only 2¾"" of rail space; fits MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver rail. Screw-on, O-ring sealed battery cap keeps out moisture (submersible to 10-ft. depth). Standard XPS models have rear-mounted control buttons. XPS2-0 model features a reticle with an easy-to-see 65 MOA circle with a 1 MOA aiming dot in the center. XPS3-0 is night-vision compatible with a night vision brightness range of 1,280:1 with NV switch engaged. Extreme-XPS3 (EXPS3) models are both Gen I-III+ night-vision compatible and feature a battery compartment positioned above the base so the sight can be mounted closer to the Delta ring. A slightly higher base positions the viewing window to co-witness with iron sights. Quick-release rail mounting system has a release lever that fits flush along the side of the sight, so the EXPS is no bulkier than the XPS. A locking tab prevents accidental lever release, yet enables easy intentional removal. Control buttons on the left side of the housing. EXPS3-0 has a 65 MOA circle/1 MOA center dot reticle. EXPS3-2 reticle has 65 MOA circle with two, vertically aligned 1 MOA dots, the top dot for targeting out to 200 yards, the lower dot for ranges out to 500 yards. EXPS3-4 reticle has 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA dot, AR-223 ballistic reticle specific to .223 caliber munitions. Compatible with Gen I-III & night vision systems (tandem operations). Has a raised 7mm base. Aiming dots may not be distinguishable without magnification."

Edit | Favorite
I'm wanting to sell/ trade my ACOG today due to a change in interests. The scope has been to the range about 5 times over the 2 years I owned it, and half of that time I was overseas. So saying it's a safe queen isn't an understatement. I'm asking 975 and will probably be pretty firm on the price because it comes with everything and is like new with no scratches at all. The glass is very clear, and has a BDC made specifically for a 14.5 inch barrel, so it's very accurate. Comes with a flash guard on the front as well. The scope is like new and in mint condition.
Comes with:
Case/ manual/ scope brush, and scope coat

The Gen 4 has a Multiple Backstrap System that allows you to add a backstrap to the rear of the grip so youcan get a custom sized grip that fits your hand perfectly. The backstraps come in to sizes, M=2mm and L=4mm, as well as two styles, standard and beaver tail (the beaver tail incorporates a flair that protects your thumb from the slide as it travels back during cycling). Also on the Gen 4 is a new grip surface known as Rough Textured Frame which helps you hold on tighter when your hands may be sweaty."

""The Target Grey stainless Ruger GP100 was one of our most popular double action special make up revolvers.

The GP100 has been the workhorse in Ruger's revolver line for years.  When they started putting the Target Grey finish on some of their other stainless guns, several of the Lipsey's employees commented on how good it would look on a GP100.  The Target Grey finish was applied by taking the stainless parts and putting them in a tumbler.  This gave the stainless that darker almost titianium look.  The guns came out very nice and now that Ruger doesn't do that finish anymore, it will be a great addition to any collection. ""

This is a P-64 9mm Makarov pistol, and is in excellent conditionm with near perfect bluing. (A little holster wear by the crown) This semi automatic pistol takes 6 round magazines, and is a double action/single action, with a manual safety which doubles as a decocker.

I've had the trigger polished by a gunsmith, and had the double action spring replaced with a lighter spring to facilitate the double action pull - the stock spring is really too stiff for double action. However, I still have the stock spring, which is included. 

The gun comes with the original holster, two ""pinky rest"" magazines, the original cleaning rod, and the stock hammer spring. I'll also fill up the magazines with hollowpoint defense rounds, so you can carry it right away. 

I carried this for 2.5 years, and its still the lightest, smallest pistol I've ever carried. I bought a $10 dollar fabric holster which I carried it in the entire time, and it worked great. It's also small enough for pocket carry - just decock it, and you are good to go."
