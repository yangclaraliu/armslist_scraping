Here is the description from the manufacturer:

The effectiveness of tire deflation 12 feet spike strip MS-12, Wrap & Roll The MS-12 was designed in response to demand for a lighter more compact unit. Do not be misled, Magnum Spikes are designed to fall out when deployed. This is a design feature that allows the spikes to be field replaced, deployment does not destroy the unit, and post deployment involves moving the used spikes to the side of the road as with any other spike strip. It is not a requirement to pick up any spikes for re-use. Spare spikes come with each unit. Upon deployment, Magnum Spike will replace spikes and any other part of the system that is damaged, at no cost of parts or shipping for 5 years. Additionally, you do not have to use a % of your stock prior to any replacement. This new unit incorporates the 4th generation improvements. It comes in the standard Wrap & Roll design, soft sided carry case, retrieval tool, 120 sharp edged spikes, and the famous 5 yr no questions warranty."

It is very clean and everything on it works great. The barrel has great rifling and the bolt chambers like the gun was brand new. Holds 5 rounds of 7mm ammo that is readily available at your local gun store and isn't going anywhere in any of our lifetimes.

So I finally decided to get rid of my upper receiver group for my AR-15 with the interest of building a new one as a hobby. I purchased this Upper as part of a complete AR-15 from another private party. It has 90 rounds through the barrel. It is painted; the paint-job isn't bad in my opinion, but I bought it that way and I really like it. It's a light coat and could easily be painted over.

HB 545 would ban the possession, sale, transfer or manufacture of certain semi-automatic rifles and magazines that are capable of holding more than ten rounds.

HB 545 contains no grandfather clauses. Therefore, under HB 545, if you are currently in possession of the semi-automatic rifles and magazines outlined in this bill, you will have 90 days from the effective date of this legislation to surrender, destroy or remove these currently lawful items from Missouri. If you fail to do so, you could be charged with a Class C felony if this legislation is passed and enacted into law.

Please take a few minutes and write or call your local missuori house representative and tell them to vote against House Bill No. 545!! Go here to find their contact information: http://www.house.mo.gov/ Share this with all your friends, and local gun owners and gun shops. Let's make sure this doesn't have a chance to pass!!!!"

After the last build, which is a was a mildly customized  ar/m4 midlength (pictured here complete),  I realized that I didn't need any more of them. This stripped, never assembled lowers' serial # is preceeded by the rifle you see at the top. It comes complete with everything you need except the barelled upper and bcg. All parts are new and ready to go, including the ssar15 slidefire stock. I originally purchased this stock in early 2012 with the intentions on using it on the most recent build pictured, but never had an opportunity to test it. It was installed but never used. This is why I still have the standard trigger guard on the rifle. It simulates full auto with an ATF letter of okee-dokee. Will sell without stock for 475.00 less than the listed price. Do the math yourself and don't ask me for trades. We already have everything we need. This is not cash and carry and a transfer is required."

Please refrain from sending me messages consisting of stories about your military hardships and why you feel you deserve the gun, followed by an offer of cell phones, body armor, etc. I feel bad turning them down but it has to be a trade consisting of something that interests me. Mainly looking for a vet who has an M9A1 or similar that would appreciate this more than their basic pistol. Other firearms may interest me as well so send offers my way!

The gun was built by K. L Kruger and has 29.625"" barrels, side lock receiver with detailed engraving.  The wood is a very nice fancy grade walnut with fine line checkering.  The gun has a double trigger and a horn trigger guard which is found on many of the German made drillings.  This is a beautiful shotgun with allot of detail and handwork.  I cannot find any information listed on K. L Kruger and am unsure if he built the gun or may have done the engraving as many engravers signed their work.  This was a GI bring-back from Germany during WWII.

The barrels both have Kruppscher Fluss Stahl

Comes with 2 new magazines, sling, and 60 rounds of IMI light AP rounds 5.56
Everything you need included to take out to the range.

The custom machined match barrels used in RGUNS rifles and uppers are made from 4150 chrome-moly vanadium steel manufactured in the USA. Each 5.56 NATO barrel is properly head spaced with an M4 feed ramp extension installed.

Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded ½ -28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life.  

Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, as well as a pulled-button rifling,  producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. Fluted models feature unique fluting designs to improve rigidity and aid in barrel cooling.

Once you BUY/OWN a Lancer AWF Mag....you will ""throw away"" your PMAGS!

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

Do some homework and you will figure out this is the BEST MAG MADE!

gun is mint, I'd have no problem doing a face to face for inspection purposes. But just a heads up the rifle hasn't even worn the traditional safety scrape into its finish.

I figure the price is fair seeing as how people are asking for 1600 for a USED Wasr-10 of all guns with just a mag and maybe a bayonet. I'd say 1300 for a higher quality rifle with mag and quality ammo as well as accessories is definitely more worthy of your money.

Using our own equipment to perfect our techniques, we live by the quality product we offer by using it in our own firearms. We offer something that is made for and produced by the serious shooter.

Nickel Boron has been receiving a lot of positive attention in the firearms community for many reasons. Firstly, it provides your guns parts with a finish that is highly resistant to corrosion. You will no longer have to worry about moisture causing rust on your firearm parts. It is also very resistant to wear, which is extremely important when working with parts that are constantly in motion. Lastly, Nickel Boron plating is self lubricating. You no longer have to worry about adding excessive amounts of oil which collects carbon residue and debris which can cause your firearm to malfunction. This cuts down on maintenance and cleaning requirements.

Below is the manufacturer description:  Thanks.

One of the finest AR-15 / M16 mags on the market today. Extremely reliable and durable and at a great price. By collecting input from military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters, TAPCO has designed a magazine that can be depended on from a trip to the firing range to deployment overseas. Molded of reinforced composite with aggressive horizontal ridges that provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions. This also helps to eliminate feed lip separation. The anti tilt follower has been designed to allow more dirt and grime to pass than any other magazine on the market. This allows the magazine to keep feeding ammo, despite loose dirt or sand that may have entered the magazine. The spring is made using a 1770 Stainless steel wire, featuring a unique shape for smoother, quieter loading through all 30 rounds. It also reduces overall stress on the magazine body, preventing spine cracks. 30 Round capacity. Fits All AR15, M4, and M16 Variants. Made in the U.S.A. with a lifetime warranty from TAPCO."

Not into prosecuting or asking questions. Guns were given to me by my great grandfather when he passed away. Will meet you, hand you cash, and walk away. Just want my guns back. Wear a beanie, ski mask, whatever, I don't care to know your identity. Please just help me. I will pay $2500 cash... much more than any pawn shop.
