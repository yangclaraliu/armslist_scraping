The lower is a Palmetto state  armory and features a magpul moe stock and grip. The upper is a ptac (palmetto state armory) with a 16” melonited barrel that uses the carbine gas system. The rail is a Midwest industries gen 2 ss (super slim) 12” rail with Midwest industries grip panels and three rail sections (rail and barrel nut installed by palmetto). The sights are the magpul mbus. The red dot is a vortex Strikefire. I painted the buffer tube, grip, and red dot to match the rail panels, the paint is showing some wear. I also wrapped a section of the  stock with matching para cord (because I thought it looked cool). There is a hook adaptor end plate (eye is on left side) that has a browncoat tactical brand sling (1-2 point convertible with hk hooks). The Gun has been shot approximately 600 times and has been 100 percent reliable with both brass and steel cased ammo. I bought a barrel nut wrench from Midwest industries and am includeing it. I have the mbus front sight tool and the x2 maginifer that came with the strikefire. I don’t have the manual for the red dot but vortex has an unconditional warranty. I’m including two 30 round gen2 pmags (they have my Id marks on them) and a 20 round aluminum mag with a magpul follower. The rail’s pic section is set up for use with a flashlight. I have a stream light tlr 1 that would include for an additional $100 if you are interested. I would require that the buyer show me their drivers license and sign a bill of sale. I only wish to sell to a permit to purchase/ carry permit holders. This would make a great starter rifle because in my opinion, it has everything a completed rifle needs for training, plinking and home defense. More pictures available upon request.

The PWS CQB directs muzzle blast, concussion and flash downrange. This is something that shooters don't fully appreciate until they take an AR pistol to an indoor range for the first time. The free float hanguard is round, practical, and extremely ergonomic relative to clunky quad rail, and the rail section can be relocated for various configurations. The red dot is dialed in and she runs very well, just not my cup of tea. If you do a quick Google search To build this setup, you're easily in the $900 - $1k+ range - $175 for the lower plus shipping/FFL, $279 for upper, $100 for BCG/CH, $150 for PWS CQB, $80 for MBUS2, $200 for the red dot and riser, $80 for the kak blade, $60 for the light and mount, $20 for the BAD lever... my price is fair and firm considering everything that's included. FTF and cash only, no trades, and as this is a pistol you will need a ccw or pistol permit to buy from me, no exceptions.Also, if we make plans for a specific date/time/location, PLEASE BE THERE! Things come up, I totally understand, but please have the common courtesy of letting me know ahead of time so we can make other arrangements or so I can sell it to the next guy...

There are two and one was made several decades earlier than the others. Each is a thick wool shirt, thicker than a Pendleton shirt that you can buy today, and was built to allow some customization for size. If it is a bit small, there are seams on the sleeves and I believe the back that one can rip out, then press flat. This has the effect of allowing the shirt to be sized slightly larger. These were issued starting in the 50's. It is size large for men with chest sizes from 41-45. I measure the sleeve length at 33.5"", which means it can be lengthened to about 34.5"" by ripping out the seam and pressing the fabric flat.  The older shirt lists the pattern date as JAN 1951.

There are two and one was made several decades earlier than the others. Each is a thick wool shirt, thicker than a Pendleton shirt that you can buy today, and was built to allow some customization for size. If it is a bit small, there are seams on the sleeves and I believe the back that one can rip out, then press flat. This has the effect of allowing the shirt to be sized slightly larger. These were issued starting in the 50's. It is size large for men with chest sizes from 41-45.

Extended Ejector RodFor positive extraction of fired cases. Taurus Security System (TSS)Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.
