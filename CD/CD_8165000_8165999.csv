Comes with 4 magazines and original soft case. I know I have more magazines, but I haven't been able to find them since the move. So for now it comes with 4- 15 round magazines and the buyer **may** get a couple bonus mags if I can find them. The RMR is the fiber optic/ tritium powered model (no battery!). Great optic (put it on my long slide 10mm and killed a few hogs down in Florida) and co-witnesses nicely with the suppressor height Trijicon night sights."

Introducing the Mark XIX Desert Eagle .50 AE and .44 Magnum in a new high temperature ceramic Cerakote™ coating called Burnt Bronze.The Cerakote coating is a multi-step process which results in a high temperature ceramic coating that holds up well under normal use. The Burnt Bronze model has attractive black appointments which gives the pistol even more appeal.The Mark XIX Desert Eagle .50 AE is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a 7 round capacity in .50 AE and 8 round capacity in .44 Magnum. The gun measures 10.75” in length with a 6” barrel, or 14.75” in a 10” barrel available in black as an aftermarket item.

The construction of the Mark XIX Desert Eagle utilizes the latest CNC machine technology providing exacting specifications with tight tolerances creating a work of art in a precision firearm.

Has an awesome foregrip that turns into a swiveling bipod with adjustable legs! Has a folding stock and a tactical point sling that is quick release and snaps into different points on the rifle. Comes with a Tru-Glo red/green dot(target) sight. The red part has a short or bad battery as it doesn't always work. The green is good to go. Comes with original case, 3 Bushmaster 30 round mags, original manual. barrel and bore are in excellent condition (but VERY hard to photograph!). Shiny bright. This rifle comes all apart with pins. There is an adjustable cheek rest too! Just about any and every feature you could want in a tactical rifle. $1,500.00 plus actual shipping (you can decide if you want the case as it will increase shipping, however I don't want it either so I won't discount to keep it).

The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bull pup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.
