Magpul is pleased to announce the latest addition to the PMAG family: the PMAG 30 M3. Like its predecessors, the PMAG 30 M3 is a lightweight 5.56 x 45 NATO / .223 Remington 30-round polymer magazine for the AR15/M16 platform, but with a number of new features which improve its durability, compatibility, and overall performance for the most demanding professional shooters. By combining the knowledge gained from years of PMAG production, extensive research and development of materials and manufacturing processes, and incorporating feedback from a broad range of end-users, the PMAG 30 M3 pushes the envelope of magazine performance one step further.

The PMAG 30 M3 features a corrosion-resistant stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower, pop-off Impact/Dust Cover that snaps onto the floorplate when not in use, and easy tool-less disassembly for cleaning and maintenance. Low-profile ribs and aggressive front and rear texture provide positive control of the magazine while helping ensure compatibility with common double and triple magazine pouches. The easy to disassemble standard flared floorplate provides drop protection and aids extraction from magazine pouches, but can be replaced by a PMAG Ranger Plate for improved handling, or the new M3 Slim-line floor plate to minimize bulk (not included). A paint pen dot matrix (click here for marking guide) has been added to the bottom panel of the magazine body for easy marking by the end user for magazine identification."

Great for sharing videos online or catching the thrill of the hunt. I want to sell everything as a package, so my loss is your gain. Here are some of the details.


The Lower:
I built the lower myself off of a Yankee Hill Machinery Lower Y-15 about six months I upgraded the trigger to a JP Enterprises trigger giving the trigger pull a nice light 3.5lb pull. Also has a Collapsible stock.

The Upper:
CMMG Piston Upper with a 16 inch Barrel with flash suppressor. The same time I upgraded the Trigger on the Lower I changed out to BCM Extractor Spring it is supposed to help with reliability which has NEVER BEEN an issue with this upper. The great thing about the Piston upper is the gasses are not blown back into the action and the carrier group stays cleaner WAY cleaner

Extras:

    One Five round Pro-Mag
    One Polymer 20 round Mag
    350 Once fired mostly Lake City Brass
    RCBS Reloading Dies

Some people will swear all day it's more reliable than an AR 15. I bought the gun because it looked cool and I wanted a gun . I was 18. It does what u need it to do .

If you want a call of duty tacticool mall ninja rifle it's not what you want. The sights can be adjusted with a .223 bullet . They are simple peep sight old school ghost ring sights , nothing fancy.

I have about three hundred rounds through it. Included are the stock 5rnd mag, 5-20 rnd mags, one drum 75 rnds I think, 3,500 rounds ammo in three cases, and a nice carrying case. This is the ammo that then president Clinton banned as cop-killer ammo, due to the fact that the bullets are steel, copper jacketed. China manufactured it that way not to kill cops, but because steel was cheaper and more available to them at that time. The US govt found that it would go through the then current vests in use. It shoots very well, and plays hell with gongs at the range, engine blocks, and so on. It is not the smelly, laquer coated, under powered crap everyone is trying to pass of as good ammo lately. Two cases are 60 boxes of 20 rnds each, one case is 1100 rounds in stripper clips.

It is listed as used as I can't remember whether or not I've fired anything through it.  If so it's less than a box for sure.  It has some marks on it, I know I installed it to check the fit and it must have been test fired at the factory with a 'proof load' so that would account for this.  It's in perfect condition, in the box, and I'll take it back if you're not happy with it.

Make an offer

I have added a Manticore Arms Night Shroud to the reduce the muzzle flash and help control muzzle rise when firing. I have also lubricated and cleaned it. The safety is rather stiff, but its a new AK. The increase in price is due to the lack of availability of these muzzle devices, I think the buyer will find it to be a vast improvement over the original muzzle device.

Why should you buy from me? With all the talk about requiring registration for personal sales, the only thing I require is that you sign a bill of sale that I will provide and retain for my personal records, and that you show me your drivers license to verify that you can legally purchase this weapon. 

I will provide pictures of the weapon itself upon request.

Xbox 360 slim 250gb bundle & Nintendo Wii bundle for sale

Will sell both bundles together for a discounted price of $395 or will sell the bundles separately, the xbox bundle for $315 and the Wii bundle for $115, but not splitting it up more than that so don't ask. I've lowered the price way under what its worth used.

You won't find a bundle/bundles this size for this low anywhere and you couldn't buy it all at gamestop for anywhere close to my price either. Due to a recent family crisis I need the money to help out in anyway that I can and Im not a gamer anymore so all of this is just taking up space. 

This huge bundle includes =

A lightly used xbox 360 slim 250gb glossy black comes with all original accessories, cords, manual, headset, ect. In total it has less than 20 hours of play time on it. I can't get the black controller to turn on its probably a simple fix I just don't know anything about controllers lol

Comes with a like new call of duty modern warfare 3 edition controller that comes with the un used downloadable avatar character.

----
Will sell both bundles together for $395 firm, will only meet around the cedar bluff or turkey creek area at a safe public place. 

No trades will be considered so don't ask. The prices are firm and non negotiable I've lowered the price way under what its worth so if you respond with an offer less than my asking price I won't reply. I'm wanting to sell asap

Will not let a stranger into my home to test out the consoles nor will I go into a strangers home to test them out. If you want to try the systems before you buy them bring a small tv and a way to supply power to it and the console. If you do that then your more than welcome to test everything, it all works flawlessly I just don't feel safe letting people I don't know into my home or going into the home of someone I don't know. Thanks for reading and god bless!

801,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1139801,For Sale:  GSG 522 high cap magazines (4) .22lr for sale,"Moncks Corner, Charleston, South Carolina",$ 113,"Listed On: Monday, February 25, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello,
  A month ago I purchased 4 new 22 round high cap magazines for a GSG 5 / GSG 522.  These were bought in anticipation of trading for a GSG 522 SD rifle with a gentleman here on armslist.  Aparantly he changed his mind, and the trade has fell through (don't you hate when that happens?).

So, I'm selling these 4 mags NIB.  Since I hate gouging, you pay what I paid for them.  The price is $112.75 ($99.80 + $12.95s/h).

I'm in Moncks Corner.  I'm also willing to mail them if you pay postage.  I'll even entertain gun related trades. 

My number is 843- three 1 tw0 - eightsevenNINEfive. (No texts....I can't stand texts and have had them turned off on my phone) 

I'll post pictures up when I get home, but rest assured they're stock twin packs.

Thanks for your time,

These are 7.62x39 chambered. If you are buying an AK it is important to know what you are buying. ATF stopped import of certain parts of the AK, most importantly the barrels. Therefore most of your AK 47's today will have miss matched US made barrels, some chrome lined some not. The days it is hard to find an AK which is built right ie with the correct high quality imported chrome lined barrels because the parts have all dried up. MWT built 200 guns. They were built from Hungarian Milled parts kits. The barrels are original chrome lined heavy barrels, not to be confused with the lighter barrels typically found on all AKM's. The furniture is hardwood with a Urethane finish coat. These were built with an ElK River receiver and have a target triggers! Comes with one steel mag. We have a few of these left and they wont last long with the current political climate."

Here is some info i found online: http://www.pyramydair.com/s/m/Stoeger_Arms_X20S_Suppressor_Air_Rifle/2406
Velocity up to 1200 fps muzzle velocity with alloy pellets

Two stage adjustable trigger with automatic ambidextrous safety
Black Synthetic Monte Carlo Style Stock
Includes 4x32 Illuminated Red/Green Scope
The latest innovation from Stoeger Airguns is the X20 Suppressor which employs Air Flow Control AFC technology. The Dual Stage Noise Reduction System designed by world renowned silencer designers Humbert CTTS makes it the quietest airgun in its class. Unlike other airgun manufacturers that utilize only sound dampening baffles Stoeger's X20 Suppressor utilizes the Dual Stage Noise Reduction System . By combining the functions of an internal air regulator ring and baffles that work in tandem noise is reduced better than any other airgun on the market. The air regulator ring has four decompression holes that bleed off most of the compressed air before the pellet even enters the baffles. The remaining compressed air dissipates throughout the baffles further reducing noise. When tested in a certified anechoic chamber by F Squared Laboratories an independent testing facility Stoeger's X20 Suppressor proved to be as much as 7.05 decibels quieter than the competition's ""quiet"" airguns. In velocity comparison tests the X20 Suppressor not only achieved the highest average velocity among the tested airguns but also produced the most consistent velocities. This X20 Suppressor comes with a quality Stoeger 4x32 compact airgun scope with an illuminated reticle.

The rifle mimics the A5 variant with the removable front grip that fits ANY MP5 FRONT GRIP assembly, unlike the internally silenced version, that can not be removed and altered easily.

It also has a fake Knights Armament silencer to accommodate the full 16"" barrel as required by law.
(HOWEVER, a silencer doesn't actually ""silence"" a rifle, per say. It only brings the decibels down to a level safe enough to fire it without having to wear ear protection, HOWEVER AGAIN, i do not recommend firing any gun without ear protection unless you have to, but i have fired this rifle numerous times without plugs and i have to say it is completely tolerable, probably because of the double sleeve match grade barrel and the extra sound dampening of the body and fake can.)

This rifle CAN be SBR'd with a proper tax stamp.
AND can have a threaded barrel for a real silencer with additional tax stamp.
ANNNNND it can be made full auto if ya wanna get that tax stamp as well.
Call your local gunsmith to verify he can do this work before purchase if that is your intent.
Either way, this will be a hard item to get when the private sale ban takes effect.
You will have to find one at a store and wait on background check, and the prices will be higher then, of course.
So get it now!
