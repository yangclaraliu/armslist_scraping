We do NOT charge credit card fees). We are an FFL operating out of South Bend Indiana and we ship all over the country. Our store front is open! We are located at 2604 S Main st. in South Bend Indiana and share a facility with Mark's Auto Care Center. If you're local, feel free to stop by! Our hours are M-F: 9am to 530pm and Saturday: 9am to 2pm. We care closed on Sunday.Built for use with suppressors, the P-10 C Suppressor-Ready has an extended/threaded barrel with 1/2×28 threads. High night sights and extended magazine capacity round out the package.Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.Item #: 91523UPC: 806703915234Description: CZU CZP10 9MM BLK 15RD TBBrand: CZ-USAModel: CZ P-10 Compact Suppressor ReadyType: Pistol: Semi-AutoCaliber: 9MMFinish: Black PolycoatAction: Double ActionStock: Polymer FrameSight: High Night SightsBarrel Length: 4.61 Overall Length: 8Weight: 27.1Capacity: 15+1# of Mags: 2Receiver: Polymer FramePackaging: Plastic Case with Cable LockFeatures: Fits Glock 19 Hosters, Threaded Barrel 1/2x28; Squared Trigger Guard, Striker Fired"

In the late 1920s, the gun was juiced up with the .38 Super, which has about 36,000 psi, depending on the load. Introduce the 1911 to the 10mm and you are talking about maximum pressure in the range of 37,500 psi. That’s enough to rattle the old pistol design, but not so with the Rock Island Armory TAC Ultra.

The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. With the combination of the .625 ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution hand guard, and the new reduced radius permanently affixed flash hider, we now have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler and longer than any other AR upper you own."""

I'm 57, NEVER sold any of my bows, as a rule I always stayed with one bow till it could no longer be serviced. The bow this one replaced was with me for 21 years. I had intentions of keeping this Lady till the end of my days....but alas....at 57 I blew my rotator cuff in my draw arm and ended this bows reign early for me. I was lucky enough to take a couple bear and a bunch of venison with it, and the thought of this bow sitting idle sticks in my craw. So here it is, an outstandingly smooth shooter, speed like launching smoke on a rail. Just needs to be in the hands of someone who will use it well. $350 and open to trades also."

The reticle offers a 1 MOA brilliant red dot with a crosshair within a wider circle with multiple illumination settings for daytime target acquisitions and two low-light settings for night vision devices. The red dot-crosshair and the circle can be turned on separately, together, or with holdover dots. The illumination circuit also features a Motion-Activated Illumination function (MOTAC) that powers up brightness when it senses motion, and powers the brightness down when at rest. It also helps to extend the battery life to 50,000 hours in normal use. The optical properties also allow for an unlimited eye relief. To extend the battery life even more and to allow a battery-free operation, this sight also features a top-mounted solar cell. To endure the toughest battlefield conditions, the housing is CNC-machined from a single piece of aluminum. It also provides a waterproof and fogproof performance. The windage and elevation knobs are knurled for a slip-free operation and offer 100 MOA adjustment ranges with 1/2 MOA increments. The sight offers two Picatinny mounting options: a standard hex Picatinny mount and a 1.53"" 1/3 co-witness Picatinny riser mount."
