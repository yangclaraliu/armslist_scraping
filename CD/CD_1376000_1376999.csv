February 10, 2013            Outstanding! Review: This was my first Beretta though my son has both a storm and a compact storm.

All I could say after the first magazine was wow! I have never picked up a handgun and have been so accurate out of the box. The rail makes it convenient to attach my tac lite. The recoil for it's size is minimal, smooth as glass with absolutely no issues. I installed aftermarket finger style rubber grips and it feels like a part of my hand now. Great product!

It's a 7+1 capacity.  That's 1 more then the ruger/taurus/diamondback/kel-tec/hellcat style pocket pistols.This is a variant to the Walther PPK pistols. James Bond style. It breaks down and functions just like a PPK/Makarov.  Quick and easy to brake down and clean. This ones made in Turkey and imported by Firearms Center of Victoria Texas. Its small and could be used as a concealed carry pistol but large enough to be comfortable in you hand and accurate. The PPK design features a fixed barrel, meaning the barrel stays attached to the frame when the slide is removed. This ads to the accuracy of the gun. Most pocket pistols or even alot of full size pistol barrels flop around when the slide is open. That means when you fire the gun the barrel could tilt upward while the bullet is leaving the gun. This gun is in very nice condition. Blue slide with a brownish color frame. Comes with a nice leather belt holster. Like I say perfect concealed carry gun. Reliable and accurate so you can carry it and not have to worry if its going to work when you need it. It features a safety/decocker that allows you to keep a round in the chamber with out having to worry. I buy sell and trade, so let me know what you have.

BER M9A1 9MM 15RD LTD
From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. 
The 92FS, Beretta's premier full metal gun, most resembles the military M9 9mm pistol. Accurate out of the box, this workhorse features an open slide design that virtually eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines de-cocking with a slide-mounted positive thumb safety, and a combat muzzle crown. Beretta's proprietary black, non-glare Bruniton finish gives your 92FS a wear-resistant coating, which means it will stand up to any special duty. The Inox model features a stainless steel slide and barrel designed for corrosion resistance.

The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces. The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in desert or other extreme conditions.

My list prices are FIRM --- and reflect the value of the bundled additional stuff -- stocks, scope, accessories, etc. Not trying to take advantage of the gun panic and not trying to score a ridiculous profit here. Not willing to sell the rifles separately. The rifles are in exceptional condition, and I have not even had the chance to shoot the Mosins yet since I had bought them. The Marlin 60 has seen maybe under two bricks of Federal Premium 22LR. Superb reliability as expected.

I am out of FA-10 FTF transfers for the year - must go thru my FFL in North Attleboro. He charges $25 per transfer, on buyer's dime.

Buy all three rifles for my ask price of $900 and I will take care of the FFL fees.

Interested buyers PM me for photos.

LOWEST PRICE I WILL GO. AFTER THIS I WILL PART OUT THE RIFLE. PLEASE DO NOT SEND EMAILS REQUESTING TO PURCHASE OUTSIDE OF GUNBROKER. I will ship to US States Only. I will NOT ship to these States: CA, CO, CT, DC, MA, NY, NJ, MD, IL, and HI. IF you think the rifle is legal in one of the above mentioned states please have a receiving FFL advise me of the legality, then I will ship there. Shipping will be flat rate $35 except Alaska which will be actual cost. Up for Auction is a used 7.62 Nato/.308 AR-10 style rifle. I have 10 rounds through this rifle. I started off with a Billet POF Nitride Lower. It has the ambidexetrous bolt release. It has a standard Lower Parts Kit with the addition of KN anti-walk pins and a chromed DPMS fire selector. I did some white color fill as seen in photos. I attached a Hogue Pistol Grip. The Upper is a DPMS Flat top. I purchased a chrome bolt carrier assembly from Red X Arms. The Buffer is an Enidine Hydraulic style buffer device. I have a MagPul CTR 6 position collapsible stock on the buffer tube. I modified a regular charging handle with a ""tactical"" ambidexterous latch. I installed a GGG end plate with left and right side sling attachment points. The barrel is a 18"" DPMS SASS fluted barrel with a 1 in 10"" twist. The barrel extension does have M4 feedramps. The Muzzle Device at the end of the barrel is a JP Bennie Coolie. I added a JP Free Float handguard ready for whatever JP rails you want to attach. I put the included JP 4 slot rail on the top front of the handguard. I modified a Non-JP 7 slot rail to fit on the bottom. I am including the bipod. I used a low profile gas block for the midlength gas tube. I am also including three (3) 20 round MagPul magazines. I did have to modify the POF receiver takedown holes by slightly enlarging them for the after market ""Infidel"" takedown pins. The Upper and Lower are very tight when pivoting on the front takedown. The takedown pins are slightly ""loose"" when pulled into the open, pulled out position. Here is what happened at the range. The rifle loaded without issue from the magazine. I was NOT using a bipod and was utilizing the magazine as a ""monopod"" steadying device due to the rifle NOT being ""light"". After the 2nd shot the 3rd round failed to feed completely. It was then manually chambered properly and fired. Next round fed properly and fired. The next round, again the 3rd round in the series failed to feed properly. It too was chambered manually and fired without incident. This cycle continued once more. After discussing the issue with my fellow shooter we came to the conclusion that it was possible the magazine was ""rocking"" a little too much and might have caused the failure to feed on the 3rd round(s). I then fired the last single round, bringing total rounds shot to ten (10). I recommend anyone who purchases this rifle to have it inspected by a certified gunsmith. I am not a certified gunsmith, this is more of a hobby. Please do not hesitate to ask any pertinent questions. I am not interested in ANY trades.

It is a full-sized replica of the 1911, even down to the 5"" barrel. The fit and finish is top-notch, as should be expected of a pistol in this price range. All functions are the same as a 1911, grip safety and ambidextrous safety. The pistol has had no FTF or malfunctions while firing CCI Velocitor ammo; and is very accurate. My only wish is that the weight and construction materials had been the same as a full-sized 1911. The Rimfire Super is constructed of all aluminum and is therefore very light. This might be a plus for a young person, but for a firearm to practice with, it lacks the heft of the .45ACP 1911s. Even the 10-round magazine is made out of plastic. At least the grip panels are wood. Overall this is a high quality firearm, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality .22 that replicates the full-sized 1911 in every way except weight.

IF you think the rifle is legal in one of the above mentioned states please have a receiving FFL advise me of the legality, then I will ship there. Shipping will be flat rate $35 except Alaska which will be actual cost. Up for Auction is a used 7.62 Nato/.308 AR-10 style rifle. I have 10 rounds through this rifle. I started off with a Billet POF Nitride Lower. It has the ambidexetrous bolt release. It has a standard Lower Parts Kit with the addition of KN anti-walk pins and a chromed DPMS fire selector. I did some white color fill as seen in photos. I attached a Hogue Pistol Grip. The Upper is a DPMS Flat top. I purchased a chrome bolt carrier assembly from Red X Arms. The Buffer is an Enidine Hydraulic style buffer device. I have a MagPul CTR 6 position collapsible stock on the buffer tube. I modified a regular charging handle with a ""tactical"" ambidexterous latch. I installed a GGG end plate with left and right side sling attachment points. The barrel is a 18"" DPMS SASS fluted barrel with a 1 in 10"" twist. The barrel extension does have M4 feedramps. The Muzzle Device at the end of the barrel is a JP Bennie Coolie. I added a JP Free Float handguard ready for whatever JP rails you want to attach. I put the included JP 4 slot rail on the top front of the handguard. I modified a Non-JP 7 slot rail to fit on the bottom. I am including the bipod. I used a low profile gas block for the midlength gas tube. I am also including three (3) 20 round MagPul magazines. I did have to modify the POF receiver takedown holes by slightly enlarging them for the after market ""Infidel"" takedown pins. The Upper and Lower are very tight when pivoting on the front takedown. The takedown pins are slightly ""loose"" when pulled into the open, pulled out position. Here is what happened at the range. The rifle loaded without issue from the magazine. I was NOT using a bipod and was utilizing the magazine as a ""monopod"" steadying device due to the rifle NOT being ""light"". After the 2nd shot the 3rd round failed to feed completely. It was then manually chambered properly and fired. Next round fed properly and fired. The next round, again the 3rd round in the series failed to feed properly. It too was chambered manually and fired without incident. This cycle continued once more. After discussing the issue with my fellow shooter we came to the conclusion that it was possible the magazine was ""rocking"" a little too much and might have caused the failure to feed on the 3rd round(s). I then fired the last single round, bringing total rounds shot to ten (10). I recommend anyone who purchases this rifle to have it inspected by a certified gunsmith. I am not a certified gunsmith, this is more of a hobby. Please do not hesitate to ask any pertinent questions. I am not interested in ANY trades.

This was made to pass the last import and assault weapons ban. This rifle can only accept the 10 round magazines made for this rifle and includes all 3 magazines sold with the rifle. This is the most accurate 7.62x39 AK-type rifle I have shot. The bi-pod is aftermarket and is fast to remove as it is a barrel clamp-on style. The barrel is hard chrome lined and the muzzle brake is pinned on at the factory. It has a factory-made Choate branded thumbhole-type stock. This rifle feels extremely solid. It has less than 300 rounds total through it and is very accurate and 100% reliability. I have owned it since 1999 and have enjoyed every trip to the range. I hate to sell this rifle but it is too nice to let it grow old in the safe!! Give it a good home.

Stainless Sako A7 22-250, Nikon Monarch 4-16x50mm rifle scope, Burris Xtreme Rings, 97 pieces of Norma brass, 10 pieces of Federal brass, 22-250 Lee Deluxe die set, Caldwell bipod.  The Norma brass is a mix between never fired, once and twice fired.  The Federal brass is once fired in a different rifle.  The Caldwell measures about 26"" when fully extended for sitting shots.  I will also send the load data that I came up with.  The Lee Deluxe die set has two bullet seating stems.  One for your common bullet and one for the long VLD bullets.  The rifle came with a 5-shot under 1"" at 100 yards guarantee from Sako.  It obviously does this.  I included a target that was shot at 100 yards.  The scope was professionally installed with lapped rings.

Everything was purchased a couple of months ago brand new.  Total rounds through the rifle are less than 50.  I did some load development and sighted it in and hunted with it just a couple of times.  I have too many rifles.  Just trying to clean my cabinet out and finance a custom build long range rig.  

I have the box and all paper work for the rifle and scope.  This rifle will shoot groups the size of a dime with 50 grain Sierra Blitzkings #1450 and .50"" or better with 60 grain Nosler Partition bullets #16316.  The barrel has a twist rate of 1:14"" and stabilizes the 60 grain Nosler Partition very well.  You can shoot anything up to whitetail with this.  The Partition bullet is a very good penetrating bullet.  The whole rifle weighs around only 7 pounds with scope, very lightweight."

This was made to pass the last import and assault weapons ban. This rifle can only accept the 10 round magazines made for this rifle and includes all 3 magazines sold with the rifle. This is the most accurate 7.62x39 AK-type rifle I have shot. The bi-pod is aftermarket and is fast to remove as it is a barrel clamp-on style. The barrel is hard chrome lined and the muzzle brake is pinned on at the factory. This rifle feels extremely solid. It has less than 300 rounds total through it and is very accurate and 100% reliability. I have owned it since 1999 and have enjoyed every trip to the range. I hate to sell this rifle but it is too nice to let it grow old in the safe!! Give it a good home.

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Shipping is via Priority - I am offering a discounted flat rate of $5 for up to 4 magazines, and $10 for 5 or more.

I just bought 2 boxes of winchester FMJ 9mm 50 rounds each for only  $14.00 each box at walmart.

For sale is some 2012 stamped 7.62 NATO, brass cased ball ammo. I bought this ammo new just a few days ago from an online, reputable ammo dealer. With shipping, they came to right at $50 a box of 50. Not bad for 7.62/.308.

The reason I have decided to sell it is that reviews show that it does not feed well in my particular gun. I have not actually tried it in my gun, but I should have read these reviews before buying four boxes of it.  Please read the reviews on the Samo – some people swear by it, especially in both action guns, and others say it does not feed well from their bottom fed AR 10 platform gun. Having said this, some people say it feeds fine. But my particular model, consistent reviews say that it does not feed well.

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability.

These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.
