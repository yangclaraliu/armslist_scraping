I've had so many different guns in my search for ""the one"" over the past few months my wife is, shall we say, at the ""rolling eyes"" stage.

Anyhoo, the XD9 Subcompact Bi-Tone in question was purchased just last Saturday, 6/29/13, from MGE in Mishawaka. It's had less than 200 rounds fired through it, all flawless, and, quite frankly, it's a joy to shoot. Super compact for carry, higher capacity than other subs, and I think it just looks cool. Comfortable, good looking, and with a second mag that makes it into the same grip and capacity as a full-size XD, you'd think I'd finally found the oh-so-elusive ONE.

Great gun, built, IMHO, better than a Glock, with a trigger that I love. Shot some of my best groups ever with this little beast.

Just a bit too large for me, though. (I'm 5'3"", give me a break!) For my preferred carry methods, just too much for me to deal with.

So....Cash price $450, or trade for a LNIB Gen 4 Glock 26.

FTF only, show IN DL and LTCH.

Located in Argos (Marshall Co). What with my kids' baseball and softball games, and work schedule, lots of travel to put something together just isn't going to work. So, will need to meet within a 50 mile radius or so of Argos.

202,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1845202,"For Sale:   BUFFALO BARNES LEAD FREE 125gr. TAC-XP 40 S&W, STANDARD PRESSURE, LOW FLASH   (ITEM 23D)","azusa, California, United States",$ 33,"Listed On: Friday, July 5, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=303

 This is a high performance STANDARD PRESSURE 40 S&W loading, which means it is safe to fire in all 40 S&W chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition.

The lightweight 125gr. all copper Barnes bullet will mushroom readily, yet penetrate as deeply as a typical 165gr. JHP style bullet, while generating the low recoil and fast velocities of a light weight projectile. This aids in fast/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 13 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone. 

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

Accuracy was excellent in every test pistol. Feeding and function was also 100% in every test pistol.

As always, we have used real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

    1420 fps -- Caspian 1911, 5-inch barrel
    1302 fps -- Taurus PT100, 4.7-inch barrel
    1300 fps -- Glock Mod. 23, 4-inch barrel
    1303 fps  -- Kahr PM40, 3-inch barrel

You’ll note that the shortest barrel did not give the slowest velocity. This shows that there is often internal barrel dynamics that influence velocity, more than barrel length alone."

As reminder, a transaction fee (currently $10) is required by HB-1228 for the State of Colorado to cover the cost of a background check by the CBI for a firearms transfer. Beginning July 1, 2013, HB-1229 becomes Colorado law and will require a background check on all firearms transfers. Referred to as universal background checks; the new law requires private gun transfers to be subject to a background check facilitated by a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL). The law states that an FFL can charge up to a maximum of $10 to conduct this type of transaction to defray costs. Any charge by an FFL is in addition to the HB-1228 transaction fee noted above.

As reminder, a transaction fee (currently $10) is required by HB-1228 for the State of Colorado to cover the cost of a background check by the CBI for a firearms transfer. Beginning July 1, 2013, HB-1229 becomes Colorado law and will require a background check on all firearms transfers. Referred to as universal background checks; the new law requires private gun transfers to be subject to a background check facilitated by a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL). The law states that an FFL can charge up to a maximum of $10 to conduct this type of transaction to defray costs. Any charge by an FFL is in addition to the HB-1228 transaction fee noted above.

These are all received very recently from the manufacturer.  These are also NOT reloads and all come in reloadable brass casings.  These are not the garbage ""steel core"" ammo that you see people selling that they won't let you fire in the indoor gun ranges.  See below in my posting for more details on what exactly I have available.

You can have them all for $420.00 total!!!!!  
***PRICE IS REDUCED UNTIL MONDAY ONLY***

I have had this exact same ammunition listed for the past week at $15/box and I've been accepting offers for as low as $13.50 per box when people made combination offers that included my other ammunition I have listed for sale.  I'm having my AR-15 professionally stripped/cleaned and some customization work done to it, so I'm going to be without my firearm for over 3 weeks and there's no reason to just let this ammunition sit here.  I have no problem leaving it up for the $14/box I had it at because it was selling nicely, just a little slow but I'm not in a big hurry, so I didn't care. But, here are the details of what I have available:

FEDERAL AMERICAN EAGLE - Brass Cased .223 REM 55gr FMJ - Made in USA
PMC BRONZE - Brass Cased .223 REM 55gr - FMJ-BT - Made in USA
REMINGTON UMC - Brass Cased .223 REM 55gr FMJ (MC) - Made in USA

Every single one of the boxes I have were tested with what they call a ""range magnet"" to verify that they will be allowed to be fired at any indoor pistol/rifle range. (as long as they allow AR-15s and allow .223rem ammo)

I have 700 total rounds - 35 total boxes - 20 rounds per box
I am asking $400.00 for all 700 rounds total (all 35 boxes)
However, I would consider selling the boxes in groups of 5 boxes at a time for $12/box

I think my price is pretty firm, but I guess I'll listen to any offer at all that did NOT involve me losing any money out of pocket.  I had to have all of these boxes shipped to me and as anyone who knows how much they KILL you on shipping on this stupid ammo, they know that I'm pretty much not making a profit here.  What made it worse is that I was limited to 5 boxes per order, which if you add up all the shipping cost, I was insane.  I was lucky to call them and argue with them on shipping on a couple orders though and they waived the cost.  I'm only telling you this in my posting so I can avoid all the lame ""low-ball"" offers out there.

All rounds are brand new commercial .223 REM FMJ 55gr ammunition packaged 20 rounds per box. Each round is brass cased, reloadable, boxer primed, non-corrosive, and has Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) 55 grain bullet. This ammunition is recently manufactured and arrived shipped from the manufacturer in the past 30 days.

If you are reading this, no reason to ask if the ammo is still available. Simply email me and I will reply ASAP and set up a time to meet with you.  Again, no reason to ask if they are available. This posting will be removed immediately upon sale being completed.

 I *WILL* reply to all emails. Please be patient. If you don't get an immediate reply, it's likely because where I'm at puts me with limited contact and access to a computer or my phone to respond to emails.

Thanks for looking. I have other ammo available! If you see anything else in the photo you want, just ask or see my other listings. People interested in multiple calibers all at once will receive the best prices/offer from me and will be given first consideration.

The triumphant advance of the smallest GLOCK pistol, specially developed for concealed carry and previously a domain of 5-round snub nose revolvers, started with the presentation of the GLOCK 26 in August 1994. 
The GLOCK 26 offers more than an alternative in this field. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services."

Truly cant adjustable. Either strap can be moved up or down enabling you to properly cant the weapon. There are 3 different eyelet holes on each side, and 3 belt sizes on the soft loop. The holster is equally at home in the appendix position as well as strong side.The an offset configuration of the soft loops helps tuck the grip into your torso for maximum concealment ability while still allowing the gun to ride high enough to get a firm purchase on the draw. The holster allows for a very smooth drawstroke.

Additionally the holster can be run with the single strap/strut configuration and you have a simple, tuckable holster that is easy to don on or off. 

In the dual soft loop configuration, the holster is not tuckable. We chose to opt of of a tuckable strut for the support side loop as it makes the holster stronger without it. A point of weakness is tuckable holsters is the strut assembly. Now in the event of a gun grab attempt, you have a second and more secure attachment point onto your belt. 

The soft loops are our new, slim, matte black laminate webbing with mil spec pull the dot snaps. They won't stretch, rot, or degrade and extremely strong. Ready for a lifetime of use.

Back then I hardly ever missed a show and they used to sometimes have a preview late Friday afternoon before the show officially opened on Saturday morning. So I decided to attend that Friday, and way back in the far corner of the civic center was a dealer I hadn't seen before. He had two tables and was showing off some neat German WWII collectibles. However the thing that caught my attention immediately was a rack full of SVT 40's, and he must of had 10 of them. 

So I went right to that rack and began examining each one of them. They were all in very good or better overall shape. However while all looked very nice on the outside - most had some sort of issue with their bore's. Some were noticeably pitted, some frosted, and some dark, but the one that I ended up with was the pick of the litter, and the bore was in great shape with no darkening, pitting or frosting. Long story short - I negotiated a deal and bought the rifle on the spot. I had attended just about every gun show there was in central Florida back in the 80's & 90's and I never ran into anyone who had a rack full of SVT's before that Friday and haven't since. The SVT was pretty tough to find back then, and it's darn near impossible to expect to find one at a local Gun Show today.

Anyway this rifle is an arsenal refurb that was done right after the war. It's a 1942 Tula and the original numbering on the receiver matches the original stamping on the stock. The bolt and trigger group have electro penciled matching numbers (force matched during arsenal refurb process). The magazine and bayonet/scabbard are original and are in excellent condition, but numbers do not match the rifle. The accessories - leather mag pouch, RKA style ammo bandoleer and stripper clips are high quality reproductions that I purchased later to make an attractive display. There is also 100 rounds of Russian non corrosive 7.62 x 54 ammo included with the rifle. Finally there is an original Russian hat crest pin that completed my display.

I wanted to mention that the rifle does appear to have an import mark. However it's so small and lightly struck that I can't make it out, and my vision is excellent. It's so inconspicuous that it's only discernable  upon a very close and careful inspection - like magnifying glass.

I've had the rifle on display in my home for the last 20+ years, but I have never fired it. I have enjoyed showing it off over the years, but I'll be down sizing soon in preparation for an early retirement. So it's time to sell this to someone else who will appreciate what a true piece of WWII history this really is. 

My asking price for everything is $1400. Please do some research to avoid a low ball offer that I won't respond to. A rifle in this condition is easily worth my asking price with the bayonet and other accessories. This SVT is the nicest one I've come across and I doubt you could find any better at a similar price.

I apologize for the picture quality but it's difficult to do better with the equipment I have. Plus ARMSLIST only allows 3 pictures.  I would be happy to arrange for an inspection of the rifle for a serious buyer, but don't have time for window shoppers - sorry. Of course you must be a FL resident and at least 21 to purchase. I'm not looking for an out of state sale that requires shipping to an FFL at this time."

This rifle is beautiful, I have refinished the stock after baking out most if not nearly all of the cosmoline. Bolt has been polished and all metal parts have had cosmoline removed. The rifle bore is in excellent condition, rifling is very strong and no doubt it has been fired very little. Rifle has all matching numbers, has the side folding bayonet. There are some stock dents that are still visible and I left all the armory markings in the stock and they are all still visible. A very nice rifle that should be a practical shooter or a nice truck gun. Rifle comes with the sling attached but not the ammo case pictured.

This is not a cheap carbon or polymer ar-15. This is all metal and doesn\’t lack essential features like a forward assist or dust cover.

The Acog has 0x magnification but the green dot reticle stays on target. It can be adjusted for windage and elevation. And it looks EXACTLY like a real Trijicon ta31 rco a4.

The Gentex Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) is based on the performance requirements of the U.S. Army for ballistics, impact, retention and other protective upgrades. Lighter than the previous PASGT infantry helmet, the ACH features a pre-drilled Night Vision Goggle (NVG) bracket hole. The helmet shell trim also eliminates the beak and has a higher side trim than the PASGT. The helmet also includes an improved 4-Point Retention and Pad Suspension System, which attaches at four points to the shell with ballistic resistant hardware. Adjustment slides are located on both the front and rear of the retention, allowing adjustment for proper fit and stability.

The Water Resistant Pad Suspension system supplied with each helmet consists of one crown pad, four lateral pads, and two front and rear pads. The pads are 3/4-inch thick with optional 1 inch thick pads available.
