It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger. Franklin Armory's BFS is easy to install with no custom fitting. The BFS Gen 3 offers a trigger pull of 4.5 lbs. (+/- 0.5 pound) the release phase now has a positive reset and an updated design eliminates backup disconnector. The stronger buffer spring (included) reduces the possibility of hammer follow. It works in Franklin Armory's F17 series in .17 WSM without modification. It works on .22LR and 9mm uppers without modification.

I prefer public FTF transaction only. I am located in Newcastle, OK. I'm willing to travel a reasonable distance to meet the potential buyer. Please be able to provide ID, otherwise I will not sell the firearm. I doubt that'd be an issue here, but just a precaution I always have taken in the past.Feel free to call or text me anytime, but if I do not respond immediately, I'll return your call or text in the order received.Thanks and god bless.Adam405 517 1379P.S. If you want a Yeti Tundra 50 Cooler - Tan color - literally only used 1 time and in basically perfect shape, I'll make you a hell of a deal on both!

The Operator includes forged national match frames and slides, both features found on Springfield Armory’s top-end 1911 models. A national match stainless steel barrel and precisely fit bushing help wring maximum accuracy from the Range Officer Operator.Designed to be a formidable companion for concealed carry or home defense, the Springfield Range Officer Operator is equipped with features that can make a difference when split seconds count. The sighting system is bright and fast, leveraging high-visibility fiber optic front sights and low profile combat-style rear sights that won’t snag during fast draws from the holster.The flat mainspring housing is checkered for positive grip, and the extended beavertail safety includes a memory bump for positive and unambiguous activation under stressful conditions. Rounding out the package is a long aluminum match grade trigger, skeletonized Delta hammer and Picatinny rail for light or laser attachment. To improve reliability, the ejection port is also lowered and flared.The Operator is designed around the full-size Government model frame, containing a five-inch barrel to generate maximum velocity from the user’s choice of ammunition. The large frame also allows for maximum sight radius, making it easy to get fast and accurate hits on target. Read more: http://www.handgunsmag.com/shot-show-2016/first-look-springfield-range-officer-operator/#ixzz5DEt2fT3e"

The barrel has been shortened and all metal has been refinished. The wood may or may not have the original finish but has no splits or cracks. There are some small dings and scratches and chips and someone has carved a small “W” on the left side near the receiver. The bore has some light pitting but is bright and has plenty of rifling remaining to make a good shooting rifle. The action is tight and really feels good when you work the lever with no play or sloppiness. To sum up here you are looking at a good tight Winchester model 1886 with a decent bore that should make a good shooting rifle.

Going through a divorce so I unfortunately need to part with it. Check out the pic of the hog shot with this rifle. The pic shows water being hosed into the cavity with water pouring out of the 458 entering hole on the right and the golfball sized hole on the left. Dropped the pig like a bag of rocks. Broke the chain shooting steel targets too. I never did get any 458 big bore mags for this rifle unfortunately. Sorry, it doesn't come with any 458 mags because I don't have them. I just used a couple rounds in a 10-round 223 mag for hunting and sighting in. Doesn't always feed in regular 223 mags. You'll need to get 458 big bore mags for reliable semi-auto shooting or modify steel GI issue mags. I can provide the information needed to modify steel GI issue mags upon request. This rifle is in almost new condition with only 57 rounds being fired through it.For an additional $70 I will include the Hornady 458 SOCOM reloading dies, 43 rounds of handloaded ammo, and 57 rounds of once fired brass. This would cost you $150 at $1.5 per round, $0.8 per brass, and $40 for the dies. 43 rounds of ammo alone would cost you $64.5.This rifle is built with the Radical Firearms 458 SOCOM 16"" upper assembly It has a Mag tactical ultra-lightweight magnesium lower receiver, Caliber = MultiThe stock is a Mission First Tactical BUSMIL Battlelink Utility StockThe grip is Magpul MOE+It has a standard triggerAlso includes front and rear steel flip-up sights (adjustable)Here are specs on the 458 SOCOM upper assembly from the manufacturer:*16"" 458 SOCOM 4140V Steel Barrel*1 in 14"" Twist Rate*5/8x32 TPI*458 SOCOM Chamber*Single Feed Ramp*.936"" Micro Gas Block*Stainless carbine-length gas tube*Direct Gas Impingement*Radical Firearms Panzer 5/8x32 Brake*Radical Firearms 12"" FHR Hybrid Rail System*Integrated Keymod attachment points on the sides and bottom with Picatinny Rails at the fore end for Mounting Lights, Lasers, Bipods & Sights*Custom Forged Upper Receiver with RF Dimpled Forward Assist, Shell Deflector, Dust Cover*Complete 458 SOCOM BCG, MPI, Melonite Coated, Staked*MIL-STD Charging HandleYou can get the 458 big bore mags for $40 each at Radical Firearms here:www.radicalfirearms.com/product-p/12.7mag.htmFor this sale to happen I will require that you sign a Bill of Sale. You will need to show me identification to enter details about yourself on the Bill of Sale. This Bill of Sale and it's information will be for my own personal records as a safeguard in the unlikely event the gun is stolen or lost and used illegally and traced back to me. I will also need you to show me an Idaho Concealed Weapons License OR be willing to conduct a FFL transfer at a local gun shop. Sorry, I won't budge on this. I don't know you and I want to make sure you are legally able to make this purchase. If we do a FFL transfer you will pay for the transfer fee to the FFL dealer (typically about $20-25) BUT I will deduct that cost from the sale price of the shotgun if you successfully pass the background check. Lastly, I will also choose the place of transfer. If you have a CWL the transfer will likely take place in the parking lot at the Meridian Police Station. I have confirmed with the police station that it is acceptable to conduct private gun sales in the police parking lot for safety with surveillance cameras. If we are doing an FFL transfer then the transaction will take place at a gun shop of my choosing somewhere in either Nampa or Meridian."

Very similar to the 590 shockwave, but built before their release. The donor gun is a Mossberg 500 persuader, the factor pistol grip only version. Conversion is completely legal and has the atf letters to prove it. Overall length is a hair under 27"" inches. The heat shield is factory mossberg, and was cut and rewelded by an experienced metal fab/welder. It attaches with the factory bracket, and is completely removeable. It is threaded for a bead front sight, but the factory sight was lost before I completed the project, and I never bother to replace it. There are a couple nicks in the finish, but it is otherwise in good condition. I've only shot 40-50 shells through it. Grip is capped with a sling swivel stud, so it can be used with a single point sling. I'll include the factory action screws if I can find them so the side saddle can be removed if desired.Comes in a violin case with dense gun case foam cut to fit.This gun has been described as ""mad Max"" or ""mall ninja"". It's just as impractical as the 590 shockwave but way cooler. I'm asking below cost. Not counting the case, or the many hours of work that went into this.If the ad is up, it's available. So don't ask.Price is firm, buyer pays their own transfer fees. Preferred dealer is Liberty Arms in Fort Collins, but meet anywhere in Fort Collins or Loveland, as well as Liberty Firearms institute in Johnstown."

It was made in 9mm Parabellum and can use the same magazines as popular handguns in that caliber. In keeping with a convenient American tradition of having a carbine and handgun using common ammunition. The carbine operates by direct blowback. Usually, the receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope mount. The stock was made of walnut-finished Maine birch. The Camp Carbine uses a detachable magazine that inserts into the magazine well in front of the trigger guard. The Camp-9 rifle magazine can be replaced by magazines from 59-series S&W pistols.

This extra weight helps to smooth the function of the AR-15 by slightly delaying the unlocking of the action allowing pressure in the chamber to decrease, resulting in more consistent and reliable case extraction. The extra weight also causes the bolt to move forward with more authority, stripping and feeding the next round from the magazine into the chamber more reliably. This can be especially helpful if the rifle is dirty or under lubricated.  Weight: 5.4 ozhttps://www.spicetac.com/products/ar15-h3-buffer See also Carbine Buffer, H Buffer, and H2 Buffer"

Korstog was the House brand of Mills Fleet Farm. Their firearms were manufactured by Adams Arms with high quality components  and with long distance shooting or 3 gun competition. In mind. I would rate this gun a 9/10. It has some markings from being in the safe but otherwise is brand new. I will ship this gun from my FFL to yours. I will not ship to states where it is prohibited to own. This gun was originally $1949.00Listing is for the complete never fired rifle. 1 GI mag and a storage bag.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tv500o47cDescription from Korstog Arms:
The Jager is the rifle for the precision shooter, competitor, or varmint hunter. This rifle was built with accuracy and high level performance in mind, and it does not disappoint. the rifle features an Ergo ambidextrous grip, Magpul PRS stock and Samson Evo rail for a top level furniture package. The stock is adjustable to the user both in height and length of pull. this allows the comfortable use of various scopes and optics in various shooting positions. In addition to being comfortable it is also rugged and durable even in unforgiving hunting, competition, or tactical environments. The 15” Samson Evo rail was made with modularity in mind, allowing the user to place accessories and rail sections where they want them. The long length of the rail also allows the user to use rest or sand bags with ease, and the options of mounting a bipod further away from the stock for virtually anywhere, allowing easy mounting of lights, aiming devices, grips, and other accessories. Additional rail pieces and other mounting options are available as well. The rail also features anti-rotational tabs making the rail that much more impressive, virtually eliminating the possibility of rail loosing alignment even under hard use.
The fire control group of this rifle features the amazing JP-EZ trigger system. This trigger provides a clean, crisp break at approximately 4.5 lbs. and a distinct strong reset. The performance of this single stage trigger is impressive as there is virtually no creep or take up. The Trigger also allows the user to configure the trigger to their needs by using difference spring kits. This rifle also features an ambidextrous safety selector from Battle Arms Development.
The rifle-length direct impingement gas system is the original gas system of the M16/AR15 family of rifles and has been tried and true in all environments and has been used by our arm forces for decades. The gas block is firmly secured under the Samson Evo rail with Unbrake set screws. By using a low profile gas block, the longer Samson Evo rail can be used allowing a longer sight radius if iron sights are used. The gas tube has been Melonite treated for extra corrosion resistance and reliability.
The bolt carrier group is an M16 weight carrier made from 8620 steel and is finished inside and out with a new, cutting edge proprietary coating process by Adams Arms. This revolutionary new coating process offers multiple advantages over and above traditional current coating processes on the market today. These advantages include a hard surface level then hard chrome, superior lubricity properties, and excellent corrosion resistance, all superior to traditional Mil-Spec Parkerizing. The gas key is heated treated and finished with the same new coating process as they carrier, attached to the carrier with Grade 8 fasteners manufactured in the United States, and properly staked. The bolt is manufactured from proper Mil-Spec Carpenter No 158 Steel, magnetic particle inspected (MPI), and has a carbine extractor spring insert, and Crane O-ring.
The Upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical dimensions held within +-.001” and type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec receiver extension/buffer tube is precision machine from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control.

I'm selling this one for 900 cash firm. That is a steal for this thing. The only reason I'm discounting it to that price is because I don't have the factory case with it and I know some people freak out about not having that. Gun is in awesome shape and the only marks on the frame are some tiny knicks on the edge of the beaver tail which I can also send a pic of. The barrel has normal wear on it.. I'm also including a holster that I had made for it but it only has good retention if you run the tlr-1 on it. I absolutely love this thing and the only reason I'm selling it is because I literally never shoot it and need the money for another project. Text me at 615 48zero 2eight5one. Thanks
