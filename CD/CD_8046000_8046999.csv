The ambidextrous lightweight thumbhole 10/22 stock is made of polypropylene with fiber additives for maximum strength. The stock comb height is designed high enough to comfortably and properly shoot with optics. The stock design also features a semi palm swell on both sides of the pistol grip, and a molded-to-fit hard rubber butt plate attached with screws. This rifle will be equipped with the Magnum Lite revolutionary patented graphite bull barrel, exclusive to Magnum Research. The patented uni-directional graphite fibers, parallel to the bore axis, results in a barrel with six-times the stiffness of conventional steel. The lighter barrel weights are easier to wield and dissipate heat up to 43% faster than steel. The result is rim fire performance of extreme accuracy. Other features include a .22LR Benz target chamber designed specifically for semi-automatics; full floating barrel for maximum accuracy, CNC-machined receiver from 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum forging with an integral weaver-type rail for optics and a black anodized finish.

Since these were basically retooled into the Sig Sauer P238, I run a Sig P238 mag due to the extra round and full handed grip the pinky extension affords. I also have the original Colt flush six round magazine. The holster is included and it is a DeSantis iwb. I wear it small of back as I am right handed, or you can wear it appendix, etc if you are left handed.I can sell it one of two ways. Everything for $475, or let me keep the Sig magazine and you can have it for $450. I included the attached pic of it next to my Sig P238 so you can see how they are just about the same, with Sig redesigning their slide contours to fit the Sig looks. I can actually exchange slides and barbells and either gun will run fine!!!- Face to face in Winter Park.

I’ve exchanged a few positive emails with some good people. Yes I know, I am selling at great prices. Just for fun, I’ve also exchanged a few emails with people trying to send me worthless cashier’s checks in the hope that I would spend a lot of money to give them some of my property. Don’t send me questions about my best price. If you want to make me your best offer, go ahead although I’ve already priced my items to sell and more than reasonable price. If I said that I wanted $200 for an item, then I want to $200 for an item. Your offer of $50 cash isn’t really an offer. Anyway......Colt 1903 Type III .32 manufactured in 1919Serial number 29841XOne of my great uncles by marriage, left this gun to my dad and my dad left this gun to me.It was stored under less than ideal conditions 50 years or so ago, because it is heavily pitted. No that is not an elaborate design, that is heavy pitting.It’d didn’t have any sentimental value to my dad as far as I know, but he hated for me to shoot it. I think he thought it was worth much more than what I am listing it for or maybe he just appreciated something that was that old and still shot well (as long as I didn’t shoot it too much).Now that he’s passed I’ve shot it a lot more.I wish that it looked better, but it doesn’t.I want one of the new reissue models but they are well over a $1000.00.I think I will just attempt to sell it. If you don’t want it or don’t have the money, no worries."

Mod. 2™ ergonomics are a next-level experience that you have to feel to believe and understand.

This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal. Like all XD®s, the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone™ ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact on target for round after round.

You may look and inspect this gun at Lost Creek Armory here in Bend, OR.  Please see Tom Tuesday-Friday, hours are from 10am to 6pm.  He is closed Sat. Sun. and Monday.   Please contact with any questions and or additional pictures. Thanks for having a look."

The Hatfield SAS 12 gauge uses an innovative operating system that blends gas and inertia operations to produce a fast cycling moderate recoil semi-auto shotgun. The gas piston moves only one inch to kick the bolt rearward and start the operating cycle. Fewer moving parts mean increased reliability in the field. The gas/inertia system works dependably with most commercial 2.75"" and 3"" magnum shells. It has a high strength aluminum receiver and a 20"" home defense barrel with a blade front sight. This is a tactical styled shotgun that features an adjustable stock and full length rail. The Hatfield SAS is an affordable semi automatic shotgun, that's ready for the range or the field. Specifications and Features:Hatfield SAS USA12T Semi Automatic Shotgun Gas/Inertia Operated 12 Gauge 5 Rounds 20"" Barrel Fixed Cylinder Bore Blade Front Sight 3"" ChamberHigh Strength Aluminum Receiver Full Length Rail Adjustable Synthetic Stock Black Finish Overall Length 40"" Weight: 7.2 lbs Brand: Hatfield Gun Co.

Very low round count (less than 150 rounds).Caveat is there appears to be a weld point where the brake connects to the barrel that causes the bullets to keyhole when they leave the gun, which is why I replaced it. You can just cut it and either use it as a pistol barrel or reweld after (Rehv Arms does it for ~$95). That's why I am selling it very cheap.I live in Kent and given this is a low cost item, I'd like you to meet me nearby."

I am in no hurry to sell this. I'm not hurting for the money. The only reason I'm selling it is because I want to step down to a Glock 19 or similar size pistol. So I'm willing to wait for the right offer.

The pistol has been used as an EDC CCW gun, and is one of the best for the role in my opinion. The pistol has had the WMD Guns Nickel Boron (NiBx) coating applied to the slide and barrel, which is very slick and tough. This makes the slide and barrel impervious to the corrosion or finish damage that can be caused by concealed carry. This coating carries a lifetime guarantee, and the WMD nomenclature is included with the package, should you need to contact them.
Trijicon HD night sights have been installed, as has a Ghost 3.5 connector, to improve low light/dark usage, and to improve trigger operation. The factory connector is also included in the package, should you want to go back to the stock configuration. The gun will come with 3 15-round factory magazines, 1 17-round factory magazine (from a Glock 17), and 1 32-round factory magazine (for those extended firefights!). You will also receive a Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster, as well as a Galco King Tuck IWB holster, with upgraded clips that won't damage your clothing! The Galco holster is designed to take the G26, G19, G17, as well as the G34 model guns.Price on the package is set at $700 obo. There is close to $1,000 invested here, and you'll be ready to go for CCW.As far as trades go, you're welcome to offer, but my only current wants are a CZ-P07 (latest model), or an AR-15 A1 style uppper, with matching 11.5-inch barrel assembly.I can be reached via the contact option on this page, or via text message at: 417-597-3030. Text will get you the fastest response, and I do my best to respond to ALL inquiries. Thanks for looking!"

The pistol has been used as an EDC CCW gun, and is one of the best for the role in my opinion. The pistol has had the WMD Guns Nickel Boron (NiBx) coating applied to the slide and barrel, which is very slick and tough. This makes the slide and barrel impervious to the corrosion or finish damage that can be caused by concealed carry. This coating carries a lifetime guarantee, and the WMD nomenclature is included with the package, should you need to contact them.
Trijicon HD night sights have been installed, as has a Ghost 3.5 connector, to improve low light/dark usage, and to improve trigger operation. The factory connector is also included in the package, should you want to go back to the stock configuration. The gun will come with 3 15-round factory magazines, 1 17-round factory magazine (from a Glock 17), and 1 32-round factory magazine (for those extended firefights!).

The Galco holster is designed to take the G26, G19, G17, as well as the G34 model guns.Price on the package is set at $700 obo.

Comes with 4 hi-cap mags, 14 rounds each & original case. This is an amazing gun, super comfortable, the trigger is really pretty amazing once you shoot it. It is better than the H&K LEM trigger and the Sig Sauer DAK trigger IMO It is a bobbed hammer fired gun with a consistent single action pull. Very, very light take up then a 4lbs break and sweet reset. One reviewer called this the hostage gun because he knew he could stage the trigger and make a precise shot to eliminate the threat of a hostage taker. Walther’s are known for there superior ergonomics, innovative design and rock solid reliability. This is no exception and is without a doubt a top shelf service weapon, Home defense, truck gun or go to war weapon. You will not be disappointed with this amazing piece. Only selling because I need to make room and it is the only .40 s&w piece in the safe. $300 cash in person and no stupid low ball offfers.

The pistol has been used as an EDC CCW gun, and is one of the best for the role in my opinion. The pistol has had the WMD Guns Nickel Boron (NiBx) coating applied to the slide and barrel, which is very slick and tough. This makes the slide and barrel impervious to the corrosion or finish damage that can be caused by concealed carry. This coating carries a lifetime guarantee, and the WMD nomenclature is included with the package, should you need to contact them.
Trijicon HD night sights have been installed, as has a Ghost 3.5 connector, to improve low light/dark usage, and to improve trigger operation. The factory connector is also included in the package, should you want to go back to the stock configuration. The gun will come with 3 15-round factory magazines, 1 17-round factory magazine (from a Glock 17), and 1 32-round factory magazine (for those extended firefights!). You will also receive a Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster, as well as a Galco King Tuck IWB holster, with upgraded clips that won't damage your clothing! The Galco holster is designed to take the G26, G19, G17, as well as the G34 model guns.Price on the package is set at $700 obo. There is close to $1,000 invested here, and you'll be ready to go for CCW.As far as trades go, you're welcome to offer, but my only current wants are a CZ-P07 (latest model), or an AR-15 A1 style uppper, with matching 11.5-inch barrel assembly.I can be reached via the contact option on this page, or via text message at: 417-597-3030.

The pistol has been used as an EDC CCW gun, and is one of the best for the role in my opinion. The pistol has had the WMD Guns Nickel Boron (NiBx) coating applied to the slide and barrel, which is very slick and tough. This makes the slide and barrel impervious to the corrosion or finish damage that can be caused by concealed carry. This coating carries a lifetime guarantee, and the WMD nomenclature is included with the package, should you need to contact them.
Trijicon HD night sights have been installed, as has a Ghost 3.5 connector, to improve low light/dark usage, and to improve trigger operation. The factory connector is also included in the package, should you want to go back to the stock configuration. The gun will come with 3 15-round factory magazines, 1 17-round factory magazine (from a Glock 17), and 1 32-round factory magazine (for those extended firefights!). You will also receive a Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster, as well as a Galco King Tuck IWB holster, with upgraded clips that won't damage your clothing! The Galco holster is designed to take the G26, G19, G17, as well as the G34 model guns.Price on the package is set at $700 obo. There is close to $1,000 invested here, and you'll be ready to go for CCW.As far as trades go, you're welcome to offer, but my only current wants are a CZ-P07 (latest model), or an AR-15 A1 style uppper, with matching 11.5-inch barrel assembly.I can be reached via the contact option on this page, or via text message at: REDACTED.
