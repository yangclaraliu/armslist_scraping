The popular CONDOR II™ backpack has a medium-sized design, but its surprisingly spacious interior can accommodate over 1950 cubic inches of gear and a 100oz/3L hydration reservoir with b-directional tube port (not included). However, what really makes the Condor II unique is that it's designed with more exterior PALS webbing than any Maxpedition backpack available. Its load bearing capability can be expanded greatly by using TacTie™ Attachment Straps to interact with a variety of Maxpedition® external pouches, pockets, and accessories. 

The Condor II will remain a comfortable carry no matter how much gear you decide to pack or attach, because it's ergonomically designed with padded, curvaceous backpack straps, sternum support, and soft, breathable back padding.

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount.  Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.
◾Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
◾Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space
◾Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
◾Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours.

I am selling slightly used and one of the best designed tactical headsets ever build. This headset is still in use by Army Special Forces, MARSOC and DOD contractors in most tactically demanding places all over this world. 

I used this headset during my two tour in Afghanistan, one deployment with United States Army and as private contractor working for DOD. Headset comes with two cables ANPRC and  MBITR cable, headset unit, brand new RTI quick clip ($50 value), headset cable with earbuds, spare earbuds, technical manual.

Here is information taken from manufacturers website. 

Quiet Pro hearing protection
The QUIETPRO+ Intelligent Hearing System is a fully automatic hearing protection and communication device. It provides enhanced hearing and hearing protection for the infantry soldier when performing mounted and dismounted operations. The upgraded QUIETPRO+ incorporates a number of functional improvements gained through the experience of the 50,000 users that reliably use the QUIETPRO in daily combat operations.
MOUNTED AND DISMOUNTED HEARING PROTECTION
The high performance in-ear device reduces the users exposure to continuous and impulsive noise when both mounted and dismounted. It features adaptive digital Active Noise Reduction technology to ensure stable and effective electronic noise reduction.
FLEXIBLE RADIO AND INTERCOM INTERFACE
A new software programmable, binaural interface for user defined stereo or split ear capabilities. Compatible with all current and future communication systems.
EXTENDED FUNCTIONALITY 
A selectable ‘whisper’ mode that enables extended use in low noise operations.
INCREASED USER CONTROL - DUAL CHANNEL WIRELESS PTT
Up to 5 wireless PTT remote control devices can be simultaneously used with a QUIETPRO+ system. Optional wired PTT controls are also available.
QUALIFIED AND APPROVED 
Following extensive testing and evaluation during 2008, the QUIETPRO® is the only in-ear communications device approved for use by the US Army.

You may find single radio Nacre Quiet Pro headsets selling online anywhere between $300 and $500 but you will be hard-pressed to find dual radio (ANPRC & MBITR) selling at all. If you are lucky to find one be ready to spend $800 or more. 

I encourage you to do your research before you call. Please don't bother calling me with some insulting offers. If this item doesn't sell I'll just keep it. Headset does not come with radios. 

Now, after you do your research and have cash money in your hand than feel free to call me and arrange meeting. my phone number is (three zero three) two, one zero - 3010"

The 3X magnifier is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

This is the 2nd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers a half inch more eye relief, positions the windage and elevation adjustments inside of the optic rather than in the mount, less moving parts in the mount which makes the mount even more stable, and has a quick release thow lever on the bottom of the mount which allows the quick removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accomadate the 7mm raised sights. 3x magnifier with Flip-To-Side mount and quick detach. Works with all existing HWS units.

The Taurus was purchased new by me about 2 years ago. I have put maybe 150 rounds through it (mostly Winchester white box) and it has never had a malfunction. There is not a scratch on it and it is pristine.

The S&W I got in trade. This gun is fantastic. The trigger is amazing and I have held very few guns that were as comfortable. It has Hogue grips and is not perfect cosmetically with a little holster wear on the end of the barrel, but I won't be sad if this gun doesn't get traded. It is wonderful, accurate, and functions flawlessly. It even sounds (mechanically) like a gun is supposed to sound. This gun alone is worth a used Glock."

Also i'm letting go of a 420 round can of Federal XM855. The 1/7 twist of the barrel makes the rifle extreamly accurate with this load. It does have a little gum up on the sling swivel rubber where the sling rubbed but other than that the upper has been very well taken care of. Cleaned and lubbed with froglube after every shooting session.

Apparently I was unclear before.

YES, IT IS STILL FOR SALE. If it is still posted, I still have it.
YES, I would appreciate a cash offer, along with your contact info, and a timeframe on when you're available to meet.
YES, I understand it's used/worn/unlucky/non-kosher/upside down/(insert random misc excuse). As you can see the prices are lower than you'll find at a shop/Bud's/Gunbroker/etc.  I do this for a reason.  I understand what things cost.
YES, I am open to reasonable offers if buying multiple items.  
YES, I probably do have extras to go with it.  Check out my other Listings.
NO, I don't have any more to say about the item.  I bought it at some point because it was a fair value, in good enough condition, and goes bang every time.  I wouldn't have bet my life or my families' lives on it if I had the slightest doubt.
NO, I'm not going to spend all day answering 'what's the lowest/least/etc amount you'd take for this today/tomorrow/after the apocalypse/etc' emails.  Don't waste your time or mine.
NO, I am not interested in trades at this time.
NO, I will not consider your lowball offers. I'm not a fix-needing junkie, this is not stolen, I don't need the money, and I'm not mentally challenged.
NO, I cannot deliver them across the state at these prices.  
NO, I do not sell to felons.  Again, not a fan of prison.  
NO, I don't take payments, food stamps, fake jewelry, broken cars, or used electronics.

Now that that's out of the way, I'm a straightforward guy.  I would much rather sell to an individual for a good price than watch people constantly lose $200 every time they go to a shop and try to trade something in.  I'm off work this week and will be heading down I-75 to Lexington at least once.

Apparently I was unclear before.

YES, IT IS STILL FOR SALE. If it is still posted, I still have it.
YES, I would appreciate a cash offer, along with your contact info, and a timeframe on when you're available to meet.
YES, I understand it's used/worn/unlucky/non-kosher/upside down/(insert random misc excuse). As you can see the prices are lower than you'll find at a shop/Bud's/Gunbroker/etc.  I do this for a reason.  I understand what things cost.
YES, I am open to reasonable offers if buying multiple items.  
YES, I probably do have extras to go with it.  Check out my other Listings.
NO, I don't have any more to say about the item.  I bought it at some point because it was a fair value, in good enough condition, and goes bang every time.  I wouldn't have bet my life or my families' lives on it if I had the slightest doubt.
NO, I'm not going to spend all day answering 'what's the lowest/least/etc amount you'd take for this today/tomorrow/after the apocalypse/etc' emails.  Don't waste your time or mine.
NO, I am not interested in trades at this time.
NO, I will not consider your lowball offers. I'm not a fix-needing junkie, this is not stolen, I don't need the money, and I'm not mentally challenged.
NO, I cannot deliver them across the state at these prices.  
NO, I do not sell to felons.  Again, not a fan of prison.  
NO, I don't take payments, food stamps, fake jewelry, broken cars, or used electronics.

Now that that's out of the way, I'm a straightforward guy.  I would much rather sell to an individual for a good price than watch people constantly lose $200 every time they go to a shop and try to trade something in.  I'm off work this week and will be heading down I-75 to Lexington at least once.  

Thanks for looking."

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist."

rifle is in good average shape .. bore is bright shiny and perfect , wood is in good shape , a few minor scratches and dents that you would expect to find on a 30 y/o used rifle , some blueing wear on the barrel from use as well . but again nothing unexpected ... rifle is in good average condition .
it shoots great and has less then 350 rounds threw it . is a nice fairly lightweight easy to carry hunting rifle .
rifle does not have barrel sights , it is drilled and tapped for them , it will come with rings but no scope .
