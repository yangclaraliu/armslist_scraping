W/original holster and in fine condition.  This pistol has a matching  serial number to the slide, Frame, barrel & mag.  This is a very rare opportunity and the  bore is MINT.  The internals are flawless I have not seen one in this kind of condition ever.  As it relates to the bluing  there is  very minimal holster wear  and this particular gun has a wear pattern consistent with the holster just like  all of the other German police contract models it's  absolutely normal  and it serves to prove the origins of the firearm. Gunauction.com had one sale for $1680 of the exact same type in 2014 that should tell you these do not pop up that often  this model has the internal extractor like the 1911 and I will be the first to say it shoots as good as any 1911 if not better it is very accurate very clean and very rare $1200 cash this is an absolute steal.  (The Browning hi power is no longer being made as of 2018.) ***** For More information contact me and I will get you my phone number. If I did not need the money I would never sell this gun!!!"

What makes the Mountain Ti Mossy Oak Break-Up Infinity different from other A-Bolts is its stainless steel barrel, a composite stock that features a Mossy Oak Break-Up Infinity camouflage pattern, and, more specifically, a titanium matte black receiver, which helps reduce its weight by almost 2 pounds from the standard A-bolt but add at least $1,000.
Features include a free-floated barrel, Browning’s Top Tang safety, which places the safety on the back of the pistol grip or where the action-hand’s thumb naturally falls. The bolt itself requires a short 60-degree lift. And, it has an adjustable 4-pound trigger. Trigger is set at 2 lbs on this rifle"

The gun is a 2003(AD code) manufacture pistol, which comes complete with the soft case, manual, warranty card, old school NRA offers, cleaning kit, several black O-rings for the barrel, all ther original tools, three ten round magazines, one ban era LEO marked twelve round magazine, and a Laser Devices Inc. BLAST laser/light combo. The polygonal rifling is immaculate, the finish on the slide is excellent, the polymer frame is excellent, the sights are original HK marked suppressor height match sights(not night sights), and everything functions perfectly. The soft case itself is the correct, original unmarked one made by Eagle for HK. Additionally, the slide is rollmarked HK USP TACTICAL .45 Auto rather than laster etched, the import mark is an eagle over N rather than the current CIP over N, and the frame is marked HK USP on one side and Pat Pending on the other. This was one of the final years that USPs were marked in such a way, so if you're picky about your markings like I am(and there's nothing wrong with that, considering people pay an extra few hundred dollars for a Chantilly imported P7), this is a great opportunity to get what is basically a modern(improved rifling, improved trigger, improved hammer strut, etc.) USP with classic markings. Also included will be 50 rounds of Federal .45ACP range ammo, and 40 rounds of Federal HST +P .45ACP. This only applies to local trades/sales.I am at a pretty firm $1100 cash price tag on this gun, USP .45 Tacticals seem to be a little less common on the market than they have been, and complete, excellent pistols are even harder to find, especially ones that have the classic style of markings. I'm in absolutely no rush to get rid of this gun, I'm just making it available if anyone is interested in a trade or a purchase.I will consider most WWI or WWII surplus rifles and handguns. No Garands, P38s or SMLEs, I've got those bases already covered. I'm pretty well versed in what most guns are valued at, and only have a really special interest in a good+ condition WWI issued Luger P08+cash or even trade, or an excellent condition K31+cash. If your P08 is of some kind of actual special provenance, like an artillery Luger or Kreighoff, I'm afraid I'll have to pass, as I'm not looking to add cash on my end. I have literally zero interest in Glocks, ARs, or anything in .40 S&W.All local laws followed, wait period begins with our first interaction, if an agreement is reached, FOID cards must be exchanged.I am willing to ship for a cash offer, but I require an exchange of driver's licences and any applicable FOID equivalent, and will not ship until payment has been received. Why would I ask for a licence and send you a photo of mine? That way, both parties are kept honest and no one can leave the other high and dry.EDIT: SALE PENDING"

Silver parts are shiny, all blue is dark and all stampings crystal clear. Some photos have fuzz from the cotton lining of the case...those are not scratches though its pretty obvious. On the inside, there is still full bluing on all parts with just signs of the slide being racked which I did several times taking it apart and putting it back. Notice the photos with slide back that the sliding surfaces are deep blue and no wear on the slide where it retracts in the frame. In the past 72 years it could not have been racked too many more times. The breech face is blued with no ring or sign of being fired. My others I have had were not like this one at all and they were nice. Grips have sharp checkering with zero wear or use or marks at all. I have a full set of photos that shows inside and out though lighting and reflecting doesnt show the same at each angle. The mag also is beyond superb and the 4 or 5 times I removed it this first day might be half of its entire 73 year life. If you want a fine example for your collection, this would be it. Priced half as much as some and far less than others. SHIPPING- It is less to ship through my FFL so it will ship to your FFL from mine. Shipping will be $36.

She was originally chambered in 8mm Mauser, but rechambered in June of 1929 to 8mm x 60S after WW1 due to The Treaty of Versailles which banned civilians from owning firearms with military chamberings. It was a ""liberated"" rifle taken from postwar WW2 German.This rifle's seen a lot over the 110 years since it was hand crafted in Germany, as evidenced by it's dinged up beechwood stock, but mechanically the old girl's flawless, she cycles like a brand new Beemer right off the showroom floor. The bore's bright and shiny with very strong lands and grooves and prestine crown.Say what you'd like about Germany itself, but apparently it's true about what's touted of their engineering, because after her bagging of what I'm sure was her fair share of big game back home, two World Wars, and a trip across the Atlantic in one of our servicemens duffle bags, she still hasn't lost her touch.This rifle has tons of history and has seen a LOT over its life, and I'd love to sell or trade her to someone who recognizes and appreciates that. That being said, if I don't feel you'll treat her like the war prize she is, you'll have about as much of a chance of getting her from me as Germany had of winning the war after we decided to join in and save Europes a**.Again, she's a beautifully crafted and balanced rifle with a bit of cosmetic wear to her, but an excellent example of what a hunting rifle should be. I'm open to offers and trades, and the worst I can do is say no."

This custom designed enhanced forging is machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and compatible with all mil-spec AR15 parts. Aside from the visual upgrades this custom engineered design provides that challenge much more expensive billet options, we have added several functional features to the lower receiver to simplify the assembly process for the at home builder.M4E1 Lower Receiver Improvements:- Threaded Bolt Catch Roll Pin - Allows for simple installation of the bolt catch and virtually eliminates the chance to damage the finish during installation (pin included). 1/16"" Hex Key required for assembly.- Integrated Trigger Guard - Eliminates the possibility of breaking the trigger guard tabs by integrating the trigger guard into the lower, creating a stronger more rigid platform to build upon.- Upper Tension Screw - Allows users to fine tune the fit of the upper and lower receiver using a nylon tipped tensioning set screw inserted in the grip tang of the lower receiver. This provides a tight fit with any standard AR15 upper receiver.- Threaded Takedown Pin Detent Recess - Allows user to easily install the Takedown Pin detent and spring with the use of a 4-40 set screw (no more launching detents across the room).- Increased Magwell Flare - Increased the flare of the magwell to aid in quick and efficient magazine changes.- Marked and milled to accept short-throw safety selectors, but will work with standard selectors as well.Includes:- Stripped M4E1 Lower Receiver- Nylon tipped tensioning set screw- Threaded Bolt Catch Pin""https://aeroprecisionusa.com/m4e1-stripped-lower-receiver-fde-cerakote.html$100 cash only, not looking for any trades at the moment."

These are the two most important upgrades you can do to your Ruger Precision Rifle! This is what the majority of the Ruger Precision shooters use!
 
These two pieces will make your R.P.R. rock steady on the bench, and allow you to make precise adjustments. The items here are made specifically for the R.P.R.
 
I sold my R.P.R. when the TVA Range closed, and kept these accessories to sell later and try to recoup some of the expense. All items are R.P.R. specific.
 
The Bipod retails for $279.95
The Monopod                   94.95
 
I will let them both go for $350- and I will throw in the knurled black oversize bolt knob wich was $49.99 and the Black anodized aluminum trigger shoe that was $34.99
 
The larger bolt knob makes the action soooooooo much easier to open and close and the trigger shoe is an absolute MUST! My groups improved noticeably after installing it and defeating the trigger blade. One less distraction!
