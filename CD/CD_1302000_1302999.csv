It has been used, but the black walnut stock and grooved forearm are intact, though there are some bonks and scratches in the varnish. The metal is more dark plum brown than bright blue, but the gun has never been polished to make it shiny. The action is smooth. I have never fired it in the 8 years I've owned it.

Standard design employed round barrel, creeping style loading lever, barrel and cylinder held in place and easily removed for loading by releasing removable wedge, three screws, rounded cylinder with notches, brass trigger guard, iron back strap with notch for engaging shoulder stock, walnut grips.  

The top of barrel is marked "" - ADDRESS  COL. SAML COLT NEW - YORK U. S. AMERICA -"" although visible the marking was partially defaced at some time in the past.  Left frame is marked ""COLTS / PATENT"".  Cylinder is marked ""COLTS PATENT No. XXXX (last four digits of serial number) / PAT. SEPT 10TH 1850"", and a Texas Naval battle scene which is usually very weak but is visible on this revolver at 20%-30%.  Additional Inspector marks, cartouches on both grips appear to be “JT” (John Taylor) inspector, ""H"" on trigger guard, ""B"" on barrel under loading lever, and Greek symbols “ØØ” on the cylinder.   Matching serial numbers, 55XXX, appear underneath on both sections of frame (full S/N), trigger guard (partial S/N with some defacing), backstrap (full S/N), cylinder (partial S/N).The serial number indicates production during 1862. Serial numbers have been photo shopped out of the photos for security but are definitely there. 

The metal appearance is pleasing with smooth grey patina. The wood grips are solid with usual dings and scratches from use and what seems to be the name J.H. Croger carved in the bottom of the grips. The mechanics are fully functional. It has an 8” barrel with a good bore that shows rifling and minor pitting. The barrel is an overall dark brown and gray patina with minor oxidation. The cylinder has a similar patina. The three screw frame is a mottled silvery and brown case-hardened patina. The backstrap has a case-hardened patina. 

The Colt 1860 It was used as a side arm by cavalry, infantry, artillery troops, and naval forces. Model 1860 Army revolvers purchased by government services had brass trigger guards as does this one and civilian versions had silver plated trigger guards.  The time frame for production is correct, the finish of the gun is correct, and the presence of inspectors’ marks lend credence to this revolver being an original Colt manufactured piece in service during the Civil War and a desirable wartime example of the Colt Model 1860 Army.

Included is the original rare left handed holster in good condition with the leather still flexible.

Glockmeister has put together a package that will allow the Glock enthusiast to add performance to his/her gun with a minimum of effort. With the kit, the shooter will be able to switch between their competition trigger set-up and their stock set-up with the removal of a couple of pins. The kit includes the stock competition trigger kit mounted in a new trigger mechanism housing (for the specific caliber) with a hand selected trigger with trigger bar assembly - completing the drop-in package. This is a complete package, so there is no juggling of small parts necessary. A major benefit to this package is the fact that you retain the carry parts for replacement if you sell the gun or periodically use the gun for carry. Additionally, the gun does not have to go out to an Armorer for an extended period of time for modification. The unit is tested for perfection - it is one of our finest pieces of work."

Harrington & Richardson Model 732 revolver chambered in .32 S&W. This is a nice revolver that I have been using as my primary carry for the last 6 months or so. I obtained this in a trade and really like this fun little revolver. Condition on this pistol is good, very clean. It has the 4” barrel and most of the bluing is very good. Based on the serial number (AM68###) it appears to be manufactured in 1974 (best info I could find) It really looks great for the age. Only reason I’m selling is to clear a couple of calibers and make room for some new stuff. This is a 6-shot .32 Smith& Wesson (long or short) DA/SA revolver that functions perfectly. Great gun for teaching young/new shooters the proper handling of a revolver. Shooting with the .32 shorts is almost like a .22 with very little kick. Package comes with the pistol (no factory box – sorry), Uncle Mikes IWB (nylon?) holster, 160+ rounds (mostly long & a few shorts). $250 CASH/Trade. The Ammo is easily $100 worth

Must meet F2F. I will not travel to meet you (unless a trade deal really favors me). You must provide a copy of your OHIO DL or Concealed Carry permit for my records. You MUST be 21 – no exceptions. I will provide a Bill of Sale that includes my information for your records and the SN of the pistol.

I have a little Mossberg 702 plinker for sale. 
It's similar to a Ruger 10/22. 

I got it for plinking a few months ago, and have only been out to the range twice. 

Given the scarcity of ammo these last months (even for .22) I only managed to put 150 rounds through it. 

I like it, but I know myself well enough to know it is going to sit in the closet for the next eternity. GF is in spring cleaning mode, so I am letting it go so I can keep my other toys. 

You can buy it from me, or trade it. 
I spent around 250 for the gun, magazines(3 in total), and ammo (300 rounds). 
Logically, I know I am not going to get that, so I won't bother. 
Give me a fair offer, and you can take it home. 

I am going to need your valid FL drivers license for sale. Make my life easy, please remember to bring that. 

Text me at 4O7 4I5 I893

I am looking for a decent tent. 

You have an old tent that fits 8 to 12 people, I will trade you a gun. 

Make sure it's around the same value.

They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.
 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters."

Smith & Wesson model 60-14 .357 Magnum revolver. This is a stainless finished 5-shot revolver with 2 1/8” barrel. This is a VERY clean “shooter” not a show piece. If you are looking for a .357 CC/Carry revolver, this is it. I really love this gun. I purchased this to use as a carry pistol, but it is just too big for me to carry every day. I have put about 200-250 rounds through this (mostly .38spc) and as expected with a revolver it fires perfectly and the action is tight and smooth. I used this to qualify for my CCW. Package comes with the revolver, original box, lock, saftey key and a very nice fitted IWB leather holster. (willing to throw in a 20 round box of Federal Protection .357 HPs for the right deal) $550 CASH or trade deal

Very few rounds through this gun.  I am selling this gun because I am focusing on 9mm so I don't have to worry about different calibers of ammo.  Price is firm; if I can't sell it for this price I will just suffer through the thought of owning it myself.  Oh the horror!  But I will manage dealing with it with the assistance of a few ""rounds"" of range therapy every once in a while.

MSRP of this gun on the Sig Sauer webpage is $1156. The picture shows 300 rounds of Fiocchi ammo I'm selling in a different ad, but as stated, this gun comes with 1000 rounds of new Magtech brass ammo in 20 boxes of 50 rounds each.    
Gun comes with 2 holsters, original box and paperwork, extra factory magazine and 1000 rounds of new, brass casing ammo.
Simple, face to face transaction w/ minimum required legal paperwork of identity.  Buyer must be 21 or older.  New Colorado gun laws require we do a background check, so an FFL transfer will be required if you are a Co. resident (sigh)
I am not interested in any trades.  I hate to sell this gun but I need the money!  I am firm on price, and firm on selling the ammo with it because after I sell this gun, I don't have anything to shoot it with.
I'm basically asking $900 for the gun, and $.50/round for the ammo for $1400 total price.
Thanks for reading my listing."

 Our tactical carbine rifle cases are produced with no regards to expense. We've put in the best of what we could possibly get our hands on, in terms of material and hardware. We've had the prototypes field tested by a number of folks who've all indicated that this is a very impressive case. The ability to attached any of your existing PALS related pouches was a big hit.

ATTN 3-GUNNERS : The 42"" length version of the TCC case is long and large enough to hold (for example) a Remington 870 pump (or 11-87) and an up to a 16"" barreled AR in the main compartment while the rest of your accessories and required ammo can be stored in the outer pocket using any PALS compatible pouches.

    Currently only in Black, OD and Multicam (adds +10% to price).
    This 42"" case is designed to fit into a Pelican 1720 case. Our case dimension is 42"" (L) x 13"" (H) x 4"" (Thickness).
    Made out of 1000 denier authentic Invista Cordura.
    PALS Webbing both on the insides of the main compartment and the large outside pocket allows you to configure the mount and provides sufficient space for you to attach any of your existing PALS related pouches.
    Height - The height of the case (13"") is such that you can mount a fully loaded carbine/rifle, with optics / NVD and a 30-rounder, ready to go.
    Length - These cases are produced with about an additional inch or so in length since feedback we received indicated that most cases are too tight a fit.
    Two Set of External D-Rings allow versatility of strap placement; shoulder carry or quiver carry (rear).
    Non-Slip Padded Strap
    Heavy Duty DURAFLEX Hardware
    Velcro Loop Patch on the front pocket to allow you to attached your unit patch, your name tag, etc.
    Close Cell Foam (1/2"" on each wall) with Plastic Inserts - protective padding and the inserts prevent any printing / signature of the carbine.
    The shoulder straps are now adjustable on the go with the use of cam buckles.

Case is black in color (used tan colored pictures to show details better).

125.00 (compare to 170.00 retail) Will trade for 556/223 ammo.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well. 

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Price Breakdown, it's a bargain.
Rifle at this time = $1200+
Ammo = $200+
Optics and mounts = $300+
Mags = $100+
22 Conversion kit = $150+
Misc Accessories = $150+
Total = $2100+
I'm asking 1900 or best offer, won't be able to buy any of this new, possibly for the next year due to shortages and huge backlogs of orders. So prices will remain high on the used guns. My price is very fair considering, it's practically what I paid when the items were available.

Rifle price 7 months back when I bought it was $900, so, either way, it's a bargain considering current prices and shortages.

The serial number, 64***, places its date of manufacture between 1889 and 1900, and it is a numbers-matching piece.  It was evaluated by Tucson Guns and Western Artifacts in 2009, who found that “the shotgun is in excellent mechanical condition but the barrels are corroded”, and they estimated its value at $850 (I have the documentation).  The furniture is in very good condition with scratches one would expect from 110+ year old piece, and the checkering is original and has not been re-cut.  The buttplate is the original hard rubber with the Remington Arms logo and all fasteners are original.  $400.00.  No trades."
