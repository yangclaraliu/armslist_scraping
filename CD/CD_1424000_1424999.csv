   HENRY GOLDEN BOY 22MAG  PRIVATE PARTY

Whether you choose one chambered for  .22 Magnum,, the Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. Henry selected the Golden Boy as the canvas for the application of fine hand engraving which elevates an already beautiful rifle into a work of art. The result represents the true marriage of state of the art gunsmithing with the centuries old craft of engraving.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols

The sight still allows you to use irons or laser--its your choice. It has a match grade barrel and has been a reliable shooter. Would make a great self defense gun. Comes with replaceable backstraps (3 total) to allow sizing for your hand. Asking $700. The laser is $150value and the extra 4 magazines add at least $170 in value. I also have a bunch of 40 sw ammo to add for the right deal.
WILL TRADE FOR:

Looking primarily for 1911 guns and parts. Will take gun deals with cash added depending on values involved. I do not want cheap used and worn guns. This is a very clean almost new looking gun and I am expecting something close in condition in exchange. You can however put guns together for deals and let me know what you have to offer as a unique gun can make a difference in me trading.

This bolt action repeater is chambered for the .218 Bee cartridge and wears a 24"" barrel. It features a detachable box magazine an as a ""Deluxe"" model has the checkered walnut stock with factory swivels. The earlier Model 43's were not drilled and tapped for scope however this rifle was factory drilled and tapped. The leading edge of the rear bridge does not have the bevel found on those rifles that left the factory without scope holes. This rifle is fitted with a very nice Weaver K6 scope in Weaver rings. The rear barrel sight was removed and a filler block installed in the dovetail. Overall condition is very good. The metal finish rates about 93-94% with some colt blue touch-up on the bolt handle knob and on the trigger guard. There is some fine pitting on the trigger guard but no other rust or pitting anywhere on the rifle. The stock is in very nice shape, free of cracks or chips. It does appear to have a coat of tru-oil added but the wood has never been sanded and the overall appearance is excellent. The mechanics are in good working order and the bore is in excellent shape. The Weaver scope is also in fine shape with nice bright optics. A Pachmayr leather sling is included. The Model 42 was manufactured between 1949-1957 with approximately 62,600 produced."

This is a ""Post-64"" rifle with the decorative basketweave stock checkering. Chambered for the flat-shooting/mild-recoiling .243 Winchester cartridge, it has a 22"" barrel and features a detachable 4-round box magazine. This rifle is in excellent overall condition. The original blue finish rates 98-99% with very little wear of any kind. The stock is also in excellent condition but does show a few handling marks (most to the left side of the receiver). The stock is free of cracks or chips and has never been sanded or refinished. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is excellent! The Model 88 was manufactured from 1955-1973 with a total of about 285,000 made. According to the serial number, this rifle was made toward the end of production in 1971. An excellent example in collectible condition"

This carbine is not an import, nor is it an arsenal rework. All parts on this carbine appear to be correct and original to the date of manufacture with the possible exception of the barrel band. The band is of the correct Type III variety with bayonet lug but normally one would expect to find it marked with a ""C"". Other than this one item, I believe all the parts have been together since day-1. The finish is original and the amount of wear is consistent throughout. Condition is very good and the original finish rates about 90% with some thinning to the blue finish on the round bolt and a little thinning to the finish on the barrel. There is no rust or pitting. The stock is correctly marked and of the correct Type III design. There are a few nicks and dings but no cracks or chips. The crossed cannons cartouche is original and well struck. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is excellent with bright rifling and a low muzzle erosion reading of under 1.0. It comes with an original sling, oiler, and Type II 15-round magazine. This carbine was part of Winchester's final serial block and was likely manufactured in mid-1945. A very good example, head and shoulders above most carbines you find today."

This is a Hungarian AK manufactured FEG SA2000M made to pass the last weapons ban. Rifle takes 10 round magazines and includes 3. Most of these guns have been modified to take standard 30 rnd mag's & so can this one--if it's legal to modify where you live. This is the most accurate 7.62x39 AK-47 I have shot, and it's solid. The bi-pod is aftermarket and is a fast to remove barrel clamp-on style. The barrel is hard chrome lined and the muzzle brake is pinned on at the factory. It has less than 300 rounds total through it, is VERY accurate, & is leave-you-smiling reliable. I am the only owner & had it since 1999. I hate to sell this rifle but it is too nice to let it grow old in the safe!! Someone give it a good home.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

 if for any reason you're concerned about how hard it might be to install I'll do it for you when we meet. just bring your rifle with a collapsible stock.

I bought it and put it on my AR. I ran several clips through my rifle and had a blast but a) my gun is mainly home defense so full auto isn't exactly required and b) my wife wants me to unload some gun stuff to raise a little cash. So I took it right back off my rifle and put it back in the bubble wrap and in the box.

It is in brand new condition with all the bits and pieces in the box including both parts in the original bubble wrap, paper work, and the allen wrench it came with.

$300 for the stock and like I said, I'll install it for your on a collapsible stock rifle if you want me too. No shipping costs, no waiting on backorders. This stock is listed in the new ""assault weapons ban"" bill. Once that thing passes they won't be able to make these anymore."

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

It is a Bushmaster XM15 lower reciever with a 223/5.56 Compass Lake upper receiver. It has a heavily fluted 20"" barrel with a lathe turned muzzle brake on it that does come off, but is put on so perfectly that you can't see the seam between the brake and the barrel. The barrel is a heavy contour under the Nordic Components hand guard, but fluted well to balance it. After the gas block it is .750 to the muzzle. 
The lower has been reworked by Compass Lake with their 2 stage match trigger and it is light and smooth as can be with a very clean break. It has a Magpul MOE fixed stock, which offers a shorter length of pull and better cheek weld than the A2 stock. 
I will include the Leupold single piece mount designed specifically for ARs to bring the scope up and forward allowing correct eye relief and head positioning, and the SWFA SS fixed 10X scope. Also I will include the Bipod and 4 20 round PMAGS, which fit better than the 30 rounders in the prone.
I am asking $2800 for this setup and am not willing to sell the scope, mount or bipod separately. I would like to do face to face in the FT Lewis area of Washington. I will meet you halfway from me to anywhere in the state for a full price offer.
