A cut-down barrel on a Model 1873 carbine gave a man compact firepower while he worked to make his fortune on the rivers of the frontier. This 1873 is made in the classic carbine style with a carbine strap butt plate and a forend with a barrel band. The 16″ barrel matches the length of the tubular magazine with holds nine rounds of 357 Magnum (or 38 Special), plus another round in the chamber for good measure. The blued steel barrel contrasts perfectly with the color case hardened receiver. Pick one up and feel how smooth the action cycles with the ultra-reliable brass lifter action. The real deal. It is hard to imagine a more beautiful representation of the Model ’73 mystique. With its steel cased colored receiver, that is tough and rugged, and its classic round barrel with traditional sights,  this rifle is as ready for serious shooting and hunting as the originals were over 140 years ago. Known as “The Gun That Won The West,” it is certainly ready to win for you in this century.       Item Number 534250137 UPC 048702008993   Caliber 357-38 Barrel Length 16″   Overall Length 35″ Length of Pull 13″   Drop at Comb 2″ Drop at Heel 3″   Weight 7 lbs 0 oz Magazine Capacity 10   Twist Rate 18 3/4″ Barrel Finish Brushed Polish   Stock Finish Oil Wood Grade Grade I   Receiver Finish Color Case Chamber Finish Polished   Barrel Material Steel Barrel Contour Sporter   Stock Material Black Walnut Recoil Pad Carbine Metal Strap   Pistol Grip Cap None Checkering None   Sling Swivel Studs None Receiver Material Steel   Trigger Finish Brushed Polish Bolt Slide Finish Brushed Polish   Magazine Type Full-Length Tube Trigger Material Steel   Trigger Guard Material Steel Trigger Guard Engraving None   Drilled and Tapped for Scope No MSRP $1,579.99"

The new LCRx in .357 Magnummaintains all the features of the original LCR, including Ruger’s patented friction-reducing cam, a next-generation design in fire control systems that results in a smooth, non-stacking trigger pull. The double-action trigger pull force on the LCR builds gradually and peaks later in the trigger stroke, resulting in better control and a lighter felt trigger pull. The LCRx also incorporates crisp single-action functionality for precise shooting. The LCRx is equipped with an integral u-notch rear sight and a pinned, white ramp front sight for quick target acquisition. The Hogue® Tamer™ Monogrip® with finger grooves provides outstanding control under recoil. The LCRx chambered in .357 Magnum has three main components: a polymer fire control housing, a stainless steel monolithic cylinder frame and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder.  Monolithic frame is made from 400 series stainless steel. Patented friction reducing cam is a next generation design in fire control systems that results in a smooth, non-stacking trigger pull. Patented polymer fire control housing holds all the fire control components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduces weight significantly and helps reduce recoil. High-strength stainless steel cylinder is extensively fluted (reducing weight) and features a PVD finish for excellent durability. Grip peg allows for a variety of grip styles to be installed. Replaceable, pinned ramp front sight with white bar. External hammer for single-action use.

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a “ZERO-Energy” striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use. The WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for any shooter. Features: Compact Polymer Semi-Automatic; Low Profile, White Dot, Windage Adjustable Sight; Double Action/Single Action Trigger; Enhanced Slide Serration The polymer-frame Pavona, available in .380 ACP, 9 mm Luger and .40 S&W, provides a choice of viable and popular calibers along with a 13-round capacity (nine for the .40) and broad palette of sparkling colored polymer frames, adding a little bling to the bang. Five base colors are available: Charcoal, Black, Fandango (a light purple), Imperial (a darker purple) and Sapphire (blue). Additional customization is offered through a choice of either a blued or chromed slide to go with the 3.5″ barrel. Of note, the subtle but elegant metal flake is injected into, not onto, the polymer, so there is no loss of finish after repeated use. Gone are the days of the pre-“Wonder Finish” wear points. The frame also sports integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Lamentably absent is an integral Picatinny-style accessory rail, which would have been a further draw for defense-minded shooters. Still, the Pavona, like its namesake bird, is a looker. But the appeal of the Pavona is not just in its feathers. It’s also in its function."

From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.

With a smaller profile and 6 rounds of hard hitting .45 GAP, this sub-compact GLOCK 39 is the ideal for platform for personal defense! GLOCK has a well established world famous reputation for being utterly reliable, durable, and accurate. It’s no wonder why more law enforcement, military, and lawful citizens rely on GLOCK to protect themselves and their loved ones then any other pistol. Get yourself a GLOCK G39 today and experience for yourself why they call it “GLOCK Perfection” The Glock 39 is a semi-automatic small-frame pistol chambered in .45 GAP. The G39’s cartridge, .45 GAP, is a shorter version of .45 ACP and offers comparable stopping power. However, the cartridge was specifically designed for compact pistols like the G39. The G39 has standard Glock features such as a polymer grip that’s lightweight making it 1.6 pounds loaded. On the front of the grip are finger grooves and the sides have a rough texture that feels a bit like sandpaper. Its double-action trigger is also “safe-action” meaning the safety is on the trigger rather than the side. The only way a round can fire is if the shooter pulls the trigger because its internal design won’t allow the firing pin to punch forward any other way. This prevents accidental discharges if the pistol is dropped.

A traditional single/double action with ambidextrous safety decock levers, and Novak low mount three white dot sights, the gun was designed for concealed carry. The S&W metal semi auto pistols have always enjoyed a reputation for being accurate dependable handguns and this example is no exception. It runs perfectly and the target you see was shot by me here on our indoor range. That is five rounds shot off hand two handed standing from 50 feet. I’m sure the pistol is capable of better but that should be sufficient for most social encounters. Mechanically the gun is in excellent condition with an excellent bore. Cosmetically it’s showing a bit of “character”. There are some shiny spots on the old girl from sliding in and out of a holster and some light scratches on the grips but no signs of any abuse. It is still a good tight gun with a long life in front of it. Good luck. If you have questions please feel free to write or call.

None from me, I got it at a gun show long ago and he said it was BNIB as far as I know it's only been fired at Kriss.Why havn't you ever shot it? Sounds fishy.: I just never did, not much to tell you really, I shoot my pistols mostly when I want to shoot. Why'd you even get it then?: America. Willing to trade for HK, Sig, or FN pistols (perferably five seveN), Sig MPX, B&T GHM9(long stretch there), SAM7 AKs, or PS90. Not really wanting an AR or anything other than a sam7 ak. If you offer me something that I don't find appealing I probably won't reply, this isn't because your gun is a bad gun or an ugly one, its just not my taste.All trades can be negotiated with cash from my end or yours."

The costs of which, when included with the purchase price of the Sig Sauer p238 alone, is significantly lower than my current asking price. Keep that in mind. Asking for $599 or best offer. Looking for cash but if you have something interesting to trade I'll consider it. CZ-USA, FN, Sig Sauer handguns in 9mm and SKS rifles are of particular interest.                                                      After a mere 175 rounds exculsively of Sig Sauer brand Performance ammunition fired I've from it since I purchaced the firearm about 7 months ago. This p238 is as close to out of the box condition as one could hope for. It's small size and light weight make it a perfect conceal carry weapon, easily concealable even during the summer months. While the p238 sturdy alloy frame and high quality feel, unlike more flimsy pocket 380's on the market, gives you the peace of mind that should you ever find yourself in a situation where you must defend yourself or your family, it will reliably function and fire flawlessly to neutralize the threat. You and your loved ones safety is something never to skimp on.   As a first time Sig owner, I can't say enough about this gun. Even being only a moderately experenced shooter myself I found that the accruarcy from 15 yrds all the way out to 25 yards I achiched was incredible and futher evidence of Sig's well earned reputation for excellence. At the range with my buddy, he and I did a side by side comparision of his Glock 42 and my p238. While both being fantastic firearms, we both prefered the softer recoil of the alloy framed p238 and the accuracy that it provides. I would not think to part with this firearm at all but I must in order to raise funds for unexpected car repair costs.       Offer includes:Model: Sig Sauer p238# of mags 3:  1 6+1 flush mag that come in box with origional purchase 2 Sig Sauer brand 7+1  extended mags purchased (arfter market) Caliber: 380 ACPBarrel:2.7 inchesOverall Length: 5.5 inchesSights: SIGLITE Night Sights Frame: Alloy FrameType: Semi AutoAction: Single ActionFinish: NitronStock/Grips: Houge Rubber Finger GrooveGun Case: Lockable Sig Hard Case/ a Drago Gear soft case for easy accessable storage everywhere from your the glove compartment to your range bag.

The second gun is an equally fine Colt 1851 Old Model Navy. The guns will be sold separately or together to facilitate a speedy sale. The case will be part of the sale of either gun or will go with the pair if sold together to the same party. This London addressed gun is in superb factory original condition with all matching parts. The 7 ½”, .36 caliber barrel retain 96% factory blue that is the rich, dark blue you hope to find on such a revolver. The bore is bright and shiny with a few scattered patches of minor pitting. The cylinder retains all the sharp, clear engraving, 85% factory blue, and clean London proof marks. The frame, rammer, and hammer all retain 98% vivid factory case color. The mechanics are crisp with strong springs, solid cylinder lock up, and all pins remaining as new on the cylinder. The original factory walnut grips have no cracks or repairs and most all of the original varnish remaining. This is an incredible find and a remarkable Colt 1851 with the desirable London address. The grip straps are the proper London blue with only a small amount of blue loss on the front of the grip strap and hard edges. The screws are only slightly marred and in very good condition. The condition of this gun is collector quality and rarely seen on a Colt that has had 161 birthdays. A true investment quality Colt revolver. If you are able to buy both and keep them in the more modern made French fit box you would have a most impressive pair of Colt 1851 Navy pistols, one from each of the period manufacturer’s address’ and both in superb factory original condition. Thanks for looking and don’t let this Colt get away! Better yet, buy them both!

The second gun is an equally fine Colt 1851 Old Model Navy. The guns will be sold separately or together to facilitate a speedy sale. The case will be part of the sale of either gun or will go with the pair if sold together to the same party. This London addressed gun is in superb factory original condition with all matching parts. The 7 ½”, .36 caliber barrel retain 96% factory blue that is the rich, dark blue you hope to find on such a revolver. The bore is bright and shiny with a few scattered patches of minor pitting. The cylinder retains all the sharp, clear engraving, 85% factory blue, and clean London proof marks. The frame, rammer, and hammer all retain 98% vivid factory case color. The mechanics are crisp with strong springs, solid cylinder lock up, and all pins remaining as new on the cylinder. The original factory walnut grips have no cracks or repairs and most all of the original varnish remaining. This is an incredible find and a remarkable Colt 1851 with the desirable London address. The grip straps are the proper London blue with only a small amount of blue loss on the front of the grip strap and hard edges. The screws are only slightly marred and in very good condition. The condition of this gun is collector quality and rarely seen on a Colt that has had 161 birthdays. A true investment quality Colt revolver. If you are able to buy both and keep them in the more modern made French fit box you would have a most impressive pair of Colt 1851 Navy pistols, one from each of the period manufacturer’s address’ and both in superb factory original condition.

Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black nitrided finish provides corrosion resistance.
 
Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.
 
Rifle-length gas system provides smoother operation and reduces felt recoil.
 
Handguard is free-floating for accuracy and the slim, 15"" length provides enhanced ergonomics and support.
 
Magpul® M-LOK® accessory attachment slots along the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions with additional slots on the angled faces near the muzzle.
 
Ruger® muzzle brake is a radial port design that significantly reduces felt recoil and muzzle movement. The 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.

Yes... you read right. This IS a .308 PISTOL. From the Sig Sauer factory in 2014 as a pistol. NOT converted from a rifle IN TO a pistol, which is illegal to do in the first place. This is VERY RARE. You can’t find these  ANYWHERE. And if you end up stumbling across one, it sure as heck isn’t NIB. These were a short production run and they didn’t make very many. Only produced for a year or 2. This one is from 2014. This is the exact same thing as the iconic battleproven Sig 716 piston operated .308 battle rifle. One of the most popular and widely used AR10 platforms in the world. It’s just a 12” version. So much firepower in a very small and compact package. The recoil isn’t as bad as you would think and I’ve taken it out to 300 yards with complete accuracy (the furthest I have access to). It is loud though, haha! All of the parts are identical to the standard 716. Same barrel specs, same controls. Only differences are the barrel length and the brace.These went for $2,150... period... the end. That was the price no matter where you got them online. More if you got them at a physical storefront. The actual model is Sig P716 12” (P means “pistol”) uses a short-stroke piston with a fully adjustable gas block for custom loads and suppressed shooting.Comes with (2) 20-round mags Also comes with one of the BEST triggers on the market. The Timney Skeletonized fully adjustable match trigger. They normally go for $270 (adjustable pin tension settings for no rattle or “pin-walk”, adjustable weight and length of pull). $2,420 setup, my price is $2,200 FIRM. You can absolutely go and try to find another; be my guest. If you really don’t want the Timney I will put the milspec Trigger in it. This is in like new condition. Less than 250 rounds through it. No optics included , can include a little bit of ammo for the right deal. NO TRADES! Cash only! If you want serious firepower in a small package with world class reliability, then THIS is the firearm FOR YOU! Please message me for more info!"

It is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match. Its 15-round magazine is precisely engineered to take a dive to the prone position and naturally roll up toward the target.

Four interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use.

This pistol has original holster and two mags. Ammo is easily available and a very potent necked cartridge with 1640 FPS muzzel velocity. The CZ 52's operating controls consist of a single-action trigger, an external hammer, a magazine catch located at the heel of the grip frame, and a combination de-cock/safety lever located on the left rear side of the receiver aft of the left grip panel. The manual safety blocks movement of the sear, which prevents the hammer from releasing and firing a round. A second safety, in the form of a spring-loaded firing pin block, prevents the pistol from firing unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear; this feature renders the pistol ""drop safe"". Military Parkerized Finish with grooved miltary plastic grips. This Caliber is hughly more powerful than the 9mm Luger cartridge.MN buyer needs MN state ID and permit. Out of MN residents pay $30 shipping to local FFL for transfer."
