This gun was purchased late December 2017, so it's only a few months old. This pistol is great and would be perfect for CCW use like I had been using it for, but I'm looking to help finance an AR9 build and I also plan on jumping up to the larger Walther PPQ as my carry gun and also so I add a suppressor to the threaded PPQ for home defense use. Nothing wrong with the pistol, in fact I love it. If I had more money I'd be keeping it. It's a great shooter, awesome ergonomics - which is the reason I bought it, feels perfect in the hand. The Glock 43 felt like crap to me and the Shield 2.09 felt just slightly less good in my hands, so I went with the PPS. I've put approximately 500 rounds through it, all brass case ammo. 3 total range trips, 30 minute sessions each time. Thankfully it never had to be fired when carrying concealed. Pistol was cleaned well after each range trip. The PPS M2 will come with:-Pistol-3 total magazines: 6/7/8 rounders. That's 2 extra mags that normally run $40ish a piece. *The 8 round mag was given to me by another, it's in perfect condition but it may or may not have had more rounds through it, a stranger on the internet gave me it for shipping costs and a small AR part in exchange. Looked new enough when I got it, just adding this in the interest of full disclosure-I've installed rubberized talon grips onto the pistol, and I'll install them onto any future gun I own. My groupings improved just from installing them. They make it so you have a lockjaw grip on the gun while firing. The PPS ergonomics plus talon grips leads to a great shooting gun. Love this thing-Sticky Brand Holster. Uses friction to keep it in place, and I used this for my concealed carry. I never had any issues with it sliding, won't budge in jeans and stays still even with athletic shorts. Plus side is it's also comfortable enough so that holster contact w/ skin is nothing to worry about-Original Walther storage case-Cable Lock-Red Chamber Flag - might need this at some shooting ranges*I'll toss in any 9mm-specific cleaning supplies I have on hand if you ask, some people already have cleaning kits and some don't. If you don't have anything to clean it with I'd rather give away some of my spare things so you can keep it running clean. Price will be $300. That's the lowest you'd ever find this in a shop and it'd have to be on sale, and it definitely won't have all the mags includededit: since i can only upload 3 images, here is link to an album with more photos of the pistol: https://imgur.com/a/U9m3bAw"

With the exception of the manufacturers test rounds, this Glock 26 GEN 4 has NEVER been used and is BRAND NEW in the box. My sale comes with a full ""shooter's"" package which includes 3 added FACTORY high capacity (15+1) magazines with the addition of custom GRIP X magazine well covers (so the extended magazines don't have that ""hang out the bottom"" look), 3 standard 10 round magazines, the Glock muzzle cleaning brush and gun lock, magazine loader assistant, the additional interchangeable backstraps, a LED tactical carry light, ear muzzle, eye protection, AND a custom molded to fit black leather inside the waistband concealed carry holster which is normally $125 but is included here at no additional cost). (**Don't forget this Glock can use all standard Glock 9mm factory magazines as interchangeable mags from 10 rounds to 30 round magazines!**)The FAMED Glock 26. As featured in the Blockbuster hit - John Wick 2, this 9mm subcompact Glock is the favorite of clandestine special forces across the globe including America's SEAL TEAM 6 and for good reason! People don't own Glocks because it's a ""designer"" name brand. People own Glocks because they are the most reliable firearm in the world in all situations from self defense, police use, and military combat.This Glock 26 GEN 4 9mm has 2 ""instant"" configurations: the 10 round super compact (totally invisible carry) mode and the full on 16 round (full combat chasis - big ham hands) grip. The 10 round magazine configuration is the ""gentleman's carry"" option; it allows for full Glock performance in the ""invisible carry"" mode. With the 10 round magazine, you can easily forget that you are concealed carrying. This package ADDITIONALLY includes the high capacity 15 +1 round factory magazines which effortlessly and securely loads into the Glock 26 seamlessly with the included addition of the custom GRIP X magazine add ons (as pictured in the high capacity configuration view). I've included 3 of these high capacity magazines which do NOT come standard (each high capacity magazine set up costs $50 each wholesale but are included in this sale as the standard package); these are in addition to the 3 standard 10 magazines that DO come as standard issue for the Glock 26. In essence, you have the option of the ""gentleman's carry"" for zero profile concealed carry (if you're properly licensed) OR with the 15+1 magazine configuration. The full combat or DUTY CARRY configuration does easily and comfortably fit standard Glock 9mm inside the waist band concealed carry or outside the waist band duty and range holsters.The price is firm and this is a package deal - please don't waste your time trying to talk down the price. If you are an experienced shooter, you know this is a massively discounted price (if you can find the GEN 4 Glock 26 in stock anywhere it normally retails for $579 - $625 by itself).(***Because this is a private owner sale, for safety, security, and a stress free sale, meet up place is ONLY available at the Deltona Police Station ""safe zone"" OR the Sanford Police Station ""safe zone""***)"
