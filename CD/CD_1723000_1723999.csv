This is one of two of the last of my collection of classic 22 autoloaders from the 50s and 60s when 22s were made of walnut and blue steel. This was known as the Gill Rifle due to the slots on the left side of the receiver in the action area and was sold under many names, this is the 87D model which was the highest grade version. This rifle originally had a factory finish that was a reddish varnish type of finish which I did not care for so I stripped that finish and did my own refinishing job that brought our the natural blonde color and grain of the wood, and it turned out very nice. This rifle can also be made to function as a single shot by moving the bolt handle slightly inwards, a neat feature. The rifle is complete and is missing nothing, it loads, feeds, fires, ejects, and reloads perfectly with the 50 rds of hi veloclity 22 ammo that I put thru in for functions check when I first got it. After those 50 rds, I cleaned it, placed in a silicon gunsock and into my climatically controlled vault where it has sat until I took it out just now to take these pictures. Its a really neat rifle and if you had one as a kid, you know what fun it is. I will meet buyer half way between us geographically for a FTF cash and carry sale in a public place during daylight hours. Buyer must be legal resident of Maryland who is not prohibited by law from owning firearms, active duty Military stationed in Maryland OK. I am not interested in counter offers or trades and I will not ship this rifle. thanks for looking and please email with any questions."

Also has a Magpul stock with added thicker rubber backing for more recoil support, Magpul grip, BAD lever, Tactical extended charging handle, Geissele SSA 2-stage trigger, upgraded Bolt Carrier group, EOTech 556, Magpul back up sites (front and rear), Numerous rail accessories and parts to add or detach, Vism Flashlight/Laser foregrip, Tactical two point/single point sling, 3X magnifier with side-flip mount.  I also have additional parts that have come off the rifle such as the original mil-spec 7 inch hangaurd, Stock gas block, original stock, cheek riser for original stock and few other random things.  Additionally i have a 1000 federal brass rounds to go with the rifle. Along with all that I have an Upper receiver chambered in 300 Black Out with a Vism Scope.  The 300 Black out is extremely awesome to have because it uses all standard 223/5.56 parts.  So all you have to do is remove the upper receiver chambered in 223 and add the 300 black out for more knock down power.  The set is great.  Ive used the set for numerous shooting competitions.  I have 2,130 rounds through the 223 receiver and 49 rounds through the black out receiver.  Yes i keep track of every round and write it in a note pad.  I have taken extremely good care of this rifle.  I will add photos showing all the parts and accessories.  Keep note that the lower receiver is the same in all the pics.

I got this shotgun on trade with the intention of fixing it up and having it be awesome. I want a different project though and now want to sell this. It really seems to just need the fore end. There is a chip in the wood fore end and it bothers me. It may not bother you as much. You can tell that someone has repaired the stock as well. Google search the name and check out the history of the gun. You may not want to shoot it, and it would make a great wall hanger with a couple old promotional posters to accompany it. If you fix it up it is moredesirable to collectors than the 12 gauges due to fewer being made. Your choice! I WILL take trades obviously that's how I got this one. I would love a nagant revolver or black powder gun. Almost anything with history will peak my interest. Shoot me an email and we can see what you have. I also like money though."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents."

In the stock and hand guard, also the cleaning rod is matching.  Every number matches even the screw heads. No import marks, Russian marks, Israeli marks as well, the stock was cut for bring back and professional affixed back together.

The SureFire High-Capacity Magazine is compatible with all Mil Spec AR-15 variants and other firearms that function with standard AR-15 pattern magazines. Constructed entirely from Mil-Spec aluminum and then Type III hard coat anodized for durability.

Surefire magazines feed smoothly and reliably were designed to be left loaded indefinitely. Additionally, Surefire Magazines can be disassembled for cleaning via the removable floorplate. Also, unlike other high capacity magazines, the Surefire High-Capacity Magazines DO NOT require dry lubricants for reliability. 

Due to their unique 4x2 quad stack configuration, the magazines add firepower without excessive bulk. The 60-round magazine is only an inch and a half longer than a standard 30 round magazine and narrower than two 30-round magazines clipped together. 

Surefire High-Capacity Magazines can be seated in a rifle with a closed bolt, even when fully loaded-no downloading required. Surefire ensured this by allowing for differing tolerances between SAAMI and NATO specifications.

I've fired 150 rds through it since it was returned with no issues (100 rds of 115gr 9mm and 50 rds of 147gr 9mm Gold Dot).  Good gun, basically a mini 1911 in 9mm.

This is by far the best laser you can get for a handgun and its custom for the XD.  Being a green laser it falls closer to the center of the visible spectrum, therefore making it more suitable for daytime usage.  I will post links below for more information.  I also have approximately 350 rds of .40 federal to throw in for the right deal.

Edit | Favorite I’m looking for a black powder (cap and ball) revolver.
 Preferably in .36 caliber. Either 1851, 1860, or 1862 model (I’m not a big fan of 1858).
 Not looking for anything fancy, just something entry level.

Cabela’s has new ones for $179, so if you’re asking that or more for a used one, I’m not interested. Other store sometimes go down to $139 for new like Pietta,NAVY Arms.
Look for new or used in 90% condition. 
 I live in LOS ANGELES AREA, and am willing to drive up to 50 miles to get it (if the price is right)....OR RECEIVED BY CERTIFIED MAIL.

They don’t require a FFL dialer transfer. But make sure you have a legal right to sell it."

I am primarily looking to trade, but I will consider a sale, albeit for the right price. It is a laminated stock, ex-dragoon. It was made in 1929 by Izhevsk. I have ammo pouches, bayonet, and sling to go with it. If face-to-face, I can include bullets(40). The stock was refurbished by the Soviets, that is what the box with the slash through it means on the stock. The stock itself is from Hungary. All the numbers match. All the cosmoline has been cleaned, and the rifle is dead-on with the bayonet, and pulls a bit to the left without. It still is dead-accurate.

I can travel a bit. I will also ship, however buyer pays shipping. I will also sell, but since this is my first and only gun,  it will need to be a good offer. I have more pictures, and can take more as requested."

He passed about 3 years ago and I have only fired the gun twice. It was extremely accurate and fun to shoot, but I just dont have the time to shoot anymore. I have done some research and the gun appears to be very rare, a simillar Underwood line out I saw sold for $1100. The manufacturer listed on the receiver is Underwood with a line through it SN 2758335. The barrel is buffalo (9-1943) but is also stamped with the underwood flaming bomb. It has the flip saftey and the magazine release marked M. It also has the bayonet lug, I used to have the bayonet, but unfortunately lost it during a move. I am also including 4 WWII era magazine hodlers marked from 1943 - 1944 each with 2 magazines from the same time. I have seen the holders with magazines sell from $100 a piece. The gun is in overall good condition for being 70 years old. It does have a few small scrathes in the wood and normal wear showing on the barrel/receiver, but nothing substantial. No cracks. Text me for more pictures/details @ REDACTED I am asking $1,200 and from the research I have done that appears to be fair and quite possibly a steal. If you feel differently, let me know your offer and why it is fair.
