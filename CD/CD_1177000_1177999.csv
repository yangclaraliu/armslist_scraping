I am in the military myself and have been around guns my whole life (as well as a qualified expert with the M-9 and M-16).  I understand everyone wants to make some money, but we don't have to ruin the once prized gun community to do it.  We all know that before the crazies took over, SCARs ran for a maximum of $3000, 2500 used.  Due to the political environment the prices have soared.  I honestly hope there isn't a buyer out there for $10,000 for a $2000 SCAR as I have seen in some ads.  

So down to business.  I have $3500 in cash in my physical hand right now to the first person with a brand new never fired SCAR 17 and $3000 for a lightly used one.

SW . Very well kept, about a year old. Used lightly. Green laser attachment . Factory case and holster included. Double action. 13+1 capacity  . However has 2 10 round  magizi Es. Came from Hawaii where only 10 rd mags were permitted. Has all original paperwork and lock.

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

Key Features:
•Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates
•MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories
• Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
•Multiple trigger firing modes available
• Patented HK recoil reduction system
•One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel

Buttstock Specifications:

Magpul CTR 6 position adjustable mil-spec stock. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. (INCLUDED)  The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder placement and comfort.

Mil-spec Magpul 30 round PMag. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floor-plate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

Upper Receiver Specifications:

Spikes Tactical upper with T markings. Machined from a Mil-Spec 7075 T6 forging. Type III Hardcoat Anodized finish. The forward assist is installed and the ""Don't Tread On Me"" with snake is on both inside and out of the ejection port door. I am also including a Spikes Tactical Ejection Port door with Spikes Logo. The charging handle is a Bravo Company VLTOR medium latch. Heavy-duty charging handle has an innovative, over-sized latch that distributes pull force evenly across the handle to aid in fast, smooth, reliable operation with the support hand. Prevents the critical roll pin from breaking and rendering the latch inoperable. Machined from 7075 T6 billet aluminum with extra metal reinforcing the stress points to stand up to hard operational use.

Bolt Carrier Specifications:

The bolt carrier is an Adams Arms one piece bolt carrier made out of high grade stainless steel and treated with a proprietary meloniting process that gives it the same, if not better, hardness level and corrosion resistance of hard chrome. It is also designed with ""skis"" on the back to eliminate any wear you may experience on the extension tube.

Bolt Specifications:

Kies Nickel Boron Bolt that has been MPI tested and marked as such on the bolt. The bolt is made from Mil-Spec Carpenter 158 Steel and Nickel Boron coated. Nickel Boron has proven itself to be the Most durable finish on the market. It's so good that it's being adopted by the Military and many Government agencies. It will Never chip, peal, or flake off. It's much smoother than Hard Chrome, it's easier to clean and you can run it almost lube free for thousands of rounds due to it's self lubricating properties. These BCG's are a huge improvement over a Phosphated BCG, They are even an improvement over Hard Chrome.

Firing Pin Specifications:

Mil-spec chrome plated firing pin.

Cam Pin Specifications:

POF roller cam NP3 coated. The roller cam design reduces wear on the inside of the upper.

Flash Hider/Compensator Specifications:

The Compensator/Flash Hider used in this build is a Yankee Hill Machine Phantom 5C2 Comp/Flash Hider. The popular Phantom Flash Suppressor has been redesigned to work as a muzzle compensator while maintaining the excellent flash hiding capabilities of its predecessor. This 5 port design has no downward facing port which helps eliminate dust problems when shooting in the prone position. It features a smooth ""No Snag"" design.

Barrel Specifications:

Black Hole Weaponry 16 inch 416R stainless steel carbine gas system. BHW's rifling shape is a series of arcs instead of square corners, as in the traditional land-and-groove rifling. This arc shaped rifling has long been held in very high regard for its accuracy, increased velocity, reduced gas cutting and ease of cleaning. Glock uses this same barrel design due to these benefits.

Troy Flip Up iron front and rear Back Up Sights.
Troy Single Point Sling.
200 Rounds Factory .223/5.56 Ammunition.
Black Soft Rifle Case with magazine pouches on the outside.

only trade acceptable is a draco Ak pistol in 7.62x39

i've seen the lowers with crappy standard furniture sell  at the gun show for this price without the upper or the upgraded stock and grip.

I have for sale a great condition, flat-trajectory hunting rifle; Savage Arms 110 bolt-action, 5 round blind mag, synthetic stock, bi-pod, carry strap, and 3-9x40mm scope; this is NOT the accutrigger model, just a clean, crisp pull (as best I can describe it).  Will come with 20 rounds of quality Hornady 130 grain SST hunting ammunition.  The scope is a Tasco Buckmaster; if you want it without the scope, then I will take $300 for the rest listed (but will leave the top 'rails' so you may mount your own).  Firm at $325 for all.  No trades, please, just selling it to buy something else.  One of the best things about these is that ammo is available everywhere; no 'shortage' as in other calibers.  I've checked several sites to make sure this is priced fairly, or below the average asking price...also YouTube has a lot of short videos about this particular model rifle.  I am not a big hunter, much less the sniper type, so will sell to new home.

764,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1177764,For Sale:  Wood refinishing and bolt polishing,"Lake Villa, Chicago, Illinois",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, March 2, 2013",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Do you have some handguards, a stock, pistol grip, or any other wood you'd like to have repaired or refinished?  Well I can help you.  Send me a picture of what you have and I can give you a price.  When I work with the wood, I'm not some hack that throws a bunch of polyurethane on it and sends it back.  What I do is carefully and painstakingly remove as many dents as possible, completely remove the old finish, and sand it working from a low to a high grit and make sure it's smooth as butter.  After that, I seal all the pores in the wood and then slowly work a finish in.  The finish I use, is resistant to heat, seals the wood against the climate, and can be made to shine or a more matte finish.  

I can also polish your bolt/bolt carrier to a mirror like finish as well as internal parts.   This service helps increase the reliability of the firearm and ensures a very smooth action.  I also can classic rust blue them or if your looking for a flair- a little color!

This is not my hobby, this is what I do for a living, and I take great pride in my work."

The Kiwi's stainless steel handle has a thin-profile and ergonomic two-finger choil. The Wharncliffe style blade has Spyderco's thumb hole for easy opening.

SLIPIT non-locking folding knives, like the Kiwi aren’t a new concept. They’ve been around for centuries without much change but continue selling among a sea of modern locking knives. The reason? While many knife buyers appreciate the traditional aspects of a non-locker, more want this type of knife because they live or work where laws prohibit carrying and using a locking pocketknife.

846,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1177846,For Sale:  Spyderco GrassHopper SS Folding Keychain Knife,"Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States",$ 15,"Listed On: Saturday, March 2, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Non-locking folding knives aren’t a new concept. They’ve been around for centuries without much change but continue selling among a sea of modern locking knives. The reason? While many knife buyers appreciate the traditional aspects of a non-locker, more want this type of knife because they live or work where laws prohibit carrying and using a locking pocketknife.
Spyderco perceived a gap between traditional slipjoints and modern locking folders and created a product line called SLIPITS. SLIPITS offer reliable and sophisticated non-locking folders that open with one hand, have a finger choil for comfort and safety and are conveniently accessible.
As the overall SLIPIT line expands, a subcategory of micro-sized SLIPITS with stainless steel handles is populating within and Spyderco calls them Bugs. The first Bug was matter-of-factly named, The Bug. Its non-locking blade is just barely over an inch long. Next up, a two-inch blade called the HoneyBee followed by the release of a larger one yet, The GrassHopper. Affable Bugs draw comments like “how cute” - a beneficial perception in a knife-cautious world but their size trumps the reality that they’re serious business when it comes to cutting.
The GrassHopper’s size is closest to that of a true penknife with its blade over two-inches. Its PlainEdge Cr13 stainless steel blade stays open when you’re cutting, held by resistant pressure at the knife’s pivot area. GrassHopper handles are chamfered with no squared-off edges to dig or bite into a gripping hand. The handle is also stainless steel with a laser engraved Spyderco bug and enough blank area for a small amount of engraving or customization as jewelry or a gift item. Handle lanyard-hole welcomes a chain for wear around a neck or a keychain."

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

The machined G10 scales are radius contoured to fill the grip and the full, stainless steel liners create a formidable foundation for tough use.
