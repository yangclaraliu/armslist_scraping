It accepts all browning HP mags. 13rds in the mag and 1 in the pipe. The grips feels awesome with no need to enhance them at all! I have purchased am extra mag for it so it has 3 total. I've put about 150 rds down the pipe and have had zero ftf or fte. It has luminous sights on it for low light and the metal body makes it a breeze to shoot. Very little recoil at all.

The ONLY reason im selling it is because it was an impulse buy and I have 2 9mms already that I cant get rid of being passed down. Id like to buy my wife a gun. This gun here should cost $500 but the awesome thing is it's affordable and is the most bang for your buck. Ill include a 50rd box if ammo. Not a scratch on this gun! You'll love it. Cash or credit.

Instructor Qualifications:

CCH Instructor since 2007
Full Time Police Officer
Certified Police Firearms Instructor
NRA Pistol Instructor

30 years Firearms Experience

I have real-world experience and teach from that perspective. I add to the basic curriculum to help better prepare students for the challenges of concealed carry and the potential use of deadly force.

We cover CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Armed Response / Self Defense, Interaction with Law Enforcement and much more.

This is an excellent class taught by a knowledgeable instructor with considerably more qualifications than NRA instructors...

Many instructors base their classes on things learned in books and pseudo tactical as seen on TV and have not had to demonstrate their own marksmanship ability. My certifications required a score of at least 90% on a 60 round Police qualification (I shot 95.69%)

My instruction is based on proven and experienced technique and instruction

I have the opportunity to interact with many Concealed Carry Permit holders and have found that many times the information they received was inaccurate and sometimes dangerous. Case in point the useless non-resident Utah permit (ask me how that 'doesn't' work..)

I believe in Concealed Carry and the right to self defense and that is why I teach. If you are wanting to carry a firearm, just be sure you ask questions of your instructor; their philosophy and true credentials. It is easy to become concealed carry instructor, but it takes experience in armed conflict and full knowledge of the law to offer what is really required. It is possible that your life, or in the case of a wrong decision your liberty, will depend on the quality and accuracy of the instruction you receive."

It was imported and sold through herter's when they were in business from the 1930 up till 1981 when they filed bankruptcy. This one is in 22lr caliber. Has steel hammer, trigger, pins, screws and barrel inset into the casting. Not thin liners like a lot of the new derringers have but actual steel barrels inset into barrel casting. 

Has the eagle over N proof marks for nitro proofed. For smokeless powder. Also has the ULM proof house mark which is the stag antler and date of 68 next to it. Meaning it was proofed in 1968 when it was made. 

For anyone not familiar with the ulm proof house they are the ones who HK exclussively goes through and walther uses them as well as far back as WWII. They are a quality proofhouse and proof quality firearms in return. 

Marked Western Derringer, Made in Germany. Not made by rohm either. It has the Kaschie factory stamp under the grip and Kaschie manufactured lighters from 1923 to early 60s. They made lots of metal goods for the german military during WWII. Just as their lighters are quality and collectible so are their derringers. 

This derringer has nice grips, black plastic checkered, nickel plated finish, nice steel barrels with shine and crisp rifling. Locks up tight, fires great. Has a safety as well. Basically a copy of the Old West  Remington model 95 derringers in 41RF.

Description

M910A
The M910A attaches by means of a dual thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail on the underside of the forend. It produces a brilliant beam configured for close- to medium-range applications, and also features two low-output navigation lights available in white, red, or blue. The primary beam output is 125 lumens for one-hour of runtime using an MN10 lamp assembly (included) or 225 lumens for 20 minutes using an MN11 lamp assembly (included). The M910A has four primary beam switches: two momentary-on pressure pads to activate the main light (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), a constant-on rotary switch for the main light, and a system-disable switch that locks all lights in the OFF position to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage. The navigation lights are operated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. Available in Desert Sand.

- Frame, receiver and barrel have been refinished with baked-on DuPont Teflon black coating. 
- All of the internals (trigger, hammer, sear, disconnector) have been replaced with brand-new stainless steel internals from a MK II. 
- All pins and springs have been replaced. 
- The bolt has been jeweled 360 degrees. 
- New firing pin, firing pin spring, extractor, extractor plunger, and extractor spring installed.
- I had a custom bolt assist handle made and installed on the back of the bolt - makes cocking this pistol much easier. 
- Lyman precision bead from sight - perfectly sighted. 

The sear, hammer, and disconnector have been honed to give a very crisp 3.5-pound trigger pull. This gun is cherry, the nicest MK I you will find short of an unfired factory original.

Here is some info on the gun.  I do not have the choke wrench or other chokes available.  

Mossberg Model D
The original model produced from 1947-1950. The gun was distributed with three choke tubes, which mount by screwing to the outside of the barrel, as opposed to the inside, like the Remington 870 or other modern shotguns. The shotgun was shipped with a wrench for removing the choke tubes.

Weight 6 1/4 lbs, barrel, 25"" with three interchangeable choke tubes, Modified, Full & Improved Cylinder

The shotgun will only accept 2 1/2 & 2 3/4-inch shotshells, and will not accept larger magnum shells.

While the magazine only holds two shells, it is possible to load three into the shotgun by first loading a shell into the chamber and then inserting a full magazine.

The stock on the shotgun, a Monte Carlo-style, also has a pistol grip shape with a black plastic trigger guard with finger ridges.

Model D-A
Model 185D-A Bolt Action. Produced only in 1950

Model D-B
The Mode D-B featured a change in firing pin design. This variant was produced from 1950 – 1955

These are much rarer than the carbine length uppers. Still new in the plastic. $879 plus $24.99 Priority Mail Shipping.

Nickel Boron Bolt Carrier Group and charging handle included. These BCGs sell for $400-500 alone on GunBroker. Nickel boron is popular because it doesn't require lubrication and is much easier to clean than a standard BCG.

Melonite coated inside and out to resist corrosion. You can shoot cheap Russian surplus all day and not worry about ruining your gun.

I originally bought this to shoot 5.45, because the ammo is still cheap and available for around $180/1000. You can easily spend double that on .223 lately. It's a good investment during this panic--if you shoot a couple cases you've already broken even on this upper. Note that Spike's test fires a few rounds out of these at the factory.

I am out of 5.45 magazines but I can show you where to get some for $25 each shipped. I would suggest using a heavier buffer and Wolff hammer spring as well, just because the 5.45 uppers function better that way.

I accept discrete PayPal Gift and Money Order. PayPal charges an extra 3%.

""The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms. The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar. The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed. The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer hand guard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer. The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes. The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location. The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip. The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories. The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts."""

First up is a Remington made P17 Enfield sporter in .30-06. It has scope mounts and a very ""california style"" stock with white line spacers and white diamond inlay. It has a 21"" barrel and holds six (6) rounds. Accuracy has been minute of deer out to 200 yards. I have nothing to complain about, I just don't use it enough to justify the space it takes up. Price is $325
Next is a nice Savage 340 .30-30 winchester.  It has a set of peep sights that were on it when I bought it. I have never hunted with it, but have never had any problems. I think I've put about 50 rounds down it since I bought it about 6 years ago. Price is $225
Lastly I have a Ruger Redhawk .44 Magnum. I bought it from a friend and built it to suit my needs. I shortened the barrel from 7.5"" down to 3.75"" and milled a new sight slot, and put in a custom ramped front sight with a 3/8"" dovetail. The sight can be changed to suit just about any load you'd ever want to put through it. The rear sight is the standard Ruger adjustable express rear. I also added a set of Hogue Cocobolo grips. It shoots well and is much less obnoxious without the porting it came with.  I had a veteran machinist do all millwork, so this is not a ""bubba job"". Price is $500.

On Tuesday, April 2, the state Assembly Committee on Public Safety will hear pro-gun Assembly Bill 871.  AB 871, introduced by ""A+"" rated state Assemblyman Brian Jones (R-71), changes the definition of ""good cause"" for the issuance of Concealed Carry License (CCW) to include ""Personal Protection or Self defense"" creating a statewide standard for issuing of CCW permits.

It is imperative that you call members of the Assembly Committee on Public Safety and respectfully urge them to SUPPORT AB 871.  The right to carry a concealed handgun for self-defense is a constitutional right and law-abiding citizens who apply to carry concealed should be allowed to exercise that right rather than it being a discretionary decision at the local level.

On Tuesday, April 2, the state Assembly Committee on Public Safety will hear pro-gun Assembly Bill 871.  AB 871, introduced by ""A+"" rated state Assemblyman Brian Jones (R-71), changes the definition of ""good cause"" for the issuance of Concealed Carry License (CCW) to include ""Personal Protection or Self defense"" creating a statewide standard for issuing of CCW permits.

It is imperative that you call members of the Assembly Committee on Public Safety and respectfully urge them to SUPPORT AB 871.  The right to carry a concealed handgun for self-defense is a constitutional right and law-abiding citizens who apply to carry concealed should be allowed to exercise that right rather than it being a discretionary decision at the local level.  Please forward this alert to your family, friends and fellow gun owners in California and urge them to do the same.

As with most of these rifles, the bore is dark but still shows grooves. Rifle is 7.62x54R and comes with 1 ten round magazine and gas adjust tool. Rifle has scope rails and has a B-Square scope mount attached. No scope, no bayonet.
