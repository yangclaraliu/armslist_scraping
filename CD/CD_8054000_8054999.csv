It Works flawlessly as a shotgun should.This one that I offer has all the traditional Scroll Engravings and since it was invented by the man himself (John Browning) There is a small engraving of him on the receiver as well. The bluing is in great condition, keeping the metal well preserved. The wood has some minor dents from being moved around over its years but, it is well preserved and the checkering is still great for that perfect grip.Comes with two Pre-Choked Barrels, (** = Modified or 1/2 Choke, 28""), and (* = Full Choke, 30""). The Full choked barrel is still new and has never been used. The Barrels are Steel Shot rated and quite pricey to buy new.It has recently been thoroughly cleaned and lubricated with fresh CLP Lubricant/Cleaner. This has one of the smoothest actions you will feel on a shotgun, even compared to more modern ones today. Recently replaced some old parts with new Bronze Friction Piece with Retainer Clip and New Friction Ring. These parts are needed to adjust the type of load you will be shooting. I simply left it for light loads for Skeet because it does that so very well with it's natural pointing for aim.It will be received as seen, in all original condition. No modifications have been done on this fine shotgun since it was new. NO Box or Docs will accompany it.It is simply a Fine, Classic that works and is a pleasure to use.You can find the Owners Manual Online Here: http://stevespages.com/pdf/browning_auto5.pdf"

Front Sight memberships sell for THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. I am selling these at this price ($300 for one or $250 each when you purchase 2 or more) because I think it’s so important to get training in the hands of responsible gun owners.

I have a wooden custom-made speed loader.  It works beautifully looks awesome and is pretty important when you want to save your fingers when loading a magazine. I paid $100 for it. I have a Magpul AR wrench I paid $25 for it.  And gun case. Which was $50. 
 
These all totals to $825. 
 
I will discount this to $350.  
 
Lastly ammunition: I have 1500 rounds of .223 for the gun worth $500.
 
I will discount this to: $400
 
A total of $1250. Which is a good deal I hope you think it is as well.   Call me and we can meet for you to look at these things.  It is an all in one package."

It's a great gun but I just got a performance center shield that I carry. This model has the real deal tritium night sights. Some models have the glow paint, which in my opinion aren't true night sights. I also have a +1 pinky extender that I had to order extra and that cost me around 30 bucks. This model with tritium sights on Grabagun is around 650 which is a great price. In gun shops they usually charge well over 700. I'm really looking for a fair trade but I'd prob take 525 cash.
