     The only ding with this rifle is one of the trigger guard ""ears"" is broken, but i did JB weld it back on there, so it is on there pretty good and in no way affects the rifle, just not pretty to look at, but you cant see it because the Stark grip, with its built in trigger guard, i have on there covers it up nicely (see pictures). So with over $400 worth of accessories ( And i actually paid more for them, the prices listed above are just an average of what they're going for online) and 450 rounds of ammo,that is hard to find right now and super expensive ( $1.00+ per round), i find this to be a great deal.  I will also include an extra  Black-Magpul MOE grip and all the original parts that came with the rifle. might be wiling to work on the price so if your interested please shoot me an offer, and if you need any more pics or info just let me know. please contact mike @ REDACTED  YOU WILL NEED VALID NEW MEXICO ID AND LEGALLY ABLE TO OWN A FIREARM.

Yugo AK rifles are unique in the industry in that they have a bolt hold open capability and when used with original Yugo mags will lock the bolt back after the last shot is fired. Rifle will of course function properly with any AK mag but only the Yugo mag facilitates the bolt hold open. 
Rifle also features an exclusive safety lever design that also acts as a bolt lock / hold open for ultimate safety and lightning fast chambering.

Receivers are stamped but slightly heavier than typical stamped receivers. These are built like tanks.... If you can only have one AK in your Arsenal let me suggest the PAP.The Yugo AK's are regarded as some of the finest quality AK rifles in the world and these are no exception.

The heart of the Model 2000, the Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt, an inertia spring, the bolt body, and a rotating locking head, for more reliable operation. This simplistic system uses no propellant gas venting in, keeping the gun cleaner. Five choke tubes, from cylinder to extra-full turkey, come standard. Red bar front sight helps you pick up the target even in low-light hunting situations. Realtree MAX-4™ finish."

It has magpul trigger guard, pistol grip, stock, hand guard, front pistol grip, and flip up co-witness rear iron sight. 

This is one tight weapon. Everything fits amazingly well. For those who do not know, a dissipator is a sort of hybrid AR15. It is still just as compact as a regular AR15 (16"" barrel), but with the M16 hand guard which allows much more control of the weapon, as well as loads of room for accessories. The front sight post is moved forward to allow for this longer hand guard, which means more accuracy with iron sights due to the longer distance between front and rear sights. The sights on it are almost exactly the same length as a full length m16. The gas system is still in the mid barrel(carbine) location, which is important for a reliable weapon to cycle. A low profile gas port was fitted by bushmaster and TACKED DOWN rather than simply clamped like most do. This dissipator is equipped with a heavy barrel as well. This barrel is almost twice as thick as a Mil-spec barrel. This means no warping due to heat, and a much tougher, longer lasting barrel. I absolutely love this thing, and would not think of selling it if I didn't have to. As a Veteran, I have learned these rifles inside and out. I picked this one out because of its unique qualities, as well as the snug fit of all its components. I have inspected the weapon from top to bottom for defects, and had a professional check the head space. Not a scratch on it, nor a single blemish. 

The photo I used is a stock photo of the weapon. It is EXACTLY as pictured and in brand new condition. I simply do not want to have pictures of the serial number posted. This is to protect the buyer. I will gladly email pictures of it to anyone interested.

Will consider trades/reasonable offers.

75 rounds of mixed ammo

Cosmetics:
This was my EDC for several years, so it naturally has a few cosmetic blemishes but nothing major or that would impact the function of the firearm. Some wear on the upper near the end of the barrel. 

Function:
Because this was a CCW firearm, I regularly oiled and cleaned the gun after every range day and every month of carrying. Fortunately it is such a small gun it doesn't take long to clean.
I have had a few jams with the really cheap ammo, but the good stuff goes through smooth as silk. No misfires or clogged pipes.

Reason I am selling:
It's a great conceal weapon, fits in your pocket and is completely unnoticeable. The problem is that this gun is no fun to shoot at all and I would like to get something a little more comfortable.

Willing to drive 30 minute radius to sell, 2 hour radius to trade for Shield in .40 + cash.

Everything you will need is included.  Complete beginner setup.

First let's start with the Dillon XL650:

Dillon XL650
45acp kit
      Added Accessories
 - Spare Parts Kit
 - Casefeed Assembly
 - Powder Check System
 - Strongmount
 - Bullet Tray
 - Aluminum Roller Handle
 - Toolholder with Wrenches
 - Low Powder Sensor
 - Primer Flip Tray
 - Primer Pickup Tubes

Along with this I added Lee Carbide Dies
 - Factory Crimp
 - Sizing Die

Case of 50 Dillon Ammunition Boxes
Case + of Random Size Dillon Storage Boxes

Lyman 2500 Pro Magnum Vibrating Case Cleaner

Case/Media Separator

Silica Gel Packets

50lbs of Walnut and Corncob Cleaning Media
brass case polish

2500+ lead bullets (+ is there because I know I have 2500, it could be more.. I forget how many I bought)
Brass.... I have no idea how much brass I have.  I have a 5 gallon bucket full of brass.  A few thousand at least - probably 5k+.  I purchased some and added my own once fired brass.
20,000 large pistol primers
16 lbs of Hodgson Clay

A custom made Reloading Bench - roughly 5ft wide x 30"" deep with a storage hutch.

Digital Scales

Somewhere I have a couple of reloading manuals also.  Can't seem to find them at the moment.

A complete beginner package.  I was going to get into reloading 5 years ago.  Researched and bought the best that was available... and then got married and I no longer have the time to reload.  Everything is brand new and unused except for the Case Cleaner and separator.  I cleaned a bunch of the brass.  Also dialed in the XL650 so it was ready to reload, just never added powder.  This will save you a ton of time getting into reloading.  Everything you need is included.

I have over $3,000 into this, plus research time, setup time, etc.  In this day and age I would like to know that somebody is using it, since I am not.  I'm willing to make a deal to know that it is getting used.  With that said I will do a package price of $2,500 for everything.  

Text or email with questions.  If you call and I don't answer leave a message and I'll call you back.  I have more pictures I can text or email as well of course (can't gaurantee those won't be sideways also though....).  Text me at 865 six 1 seven 546 five"

Not a lot to say about these, they speak, or I guess in this case SHOOT for themselves. Probably the best all around rifle I believe I've ever had. I've taken deer with it and the recoil is very manageable for a woman, or young person. Scope is a Simons White Tail Edt. 4X. Last deer I shot with this gun I had climbed up in a huge old Cedar Tree over looking a creek bed near Elk Falls Kansas. Wasn't till I got up in it that I realized my View and shooting lanes were very poor, but I was there and the limbs were big and comfortable to sit on. About 2 hours later a buck walked right under me and I had no shot at all from the angle he came upon me, or when he passed by. As he was walking away I noticed there was a small hole about 6 inches in diameter that a man could shoot through, but the view through that you could see was way off in the distance almost over the hill. Well darn if that old buck didn't keep a walking straight away and just as he was toping the ridge and fixing to go out of sight he stopped right in that little hole on those branches. Just as he went to step out of sight I had the cross hairs right in the middle of the back of his neck. That's the first deer I ever shot from directly behind, but that neck shot dropped him so fast he fell straight down on his belly nose straight out. Looked like he was sleeping when I got to him. Anyway, its a tack driver of a rifle and shoots better than I can. I have a 30-40 Krag, and a Rem. Mohawk 600 308 and have been mainly hunting with Bow, or Muzzle Loaders. I just am not using this rifle anymore and someone ought to have it that will shoot it. My Brother-in-law bought it new, traded it to me after two years for a log splitter. I have enjoyed it for around 20 years. If I still hunted over big areas I would keep it, but all my hunting is woods hunting and 100 yards is the longest shot I've took in a long time. If your interested its for sale, if you have a pistol you want to trade let me know what you have and I'll tell you yes, or no. I'm looking for a nice .40 Auto, or a .38/.357 revolver. Reason is I have some brass for each and re-loading dies I just bought second hand and don't have a gun to reload for in either caliber. I gave 700.00 trade for it when it was almost new. Looking at Arms List overall on this gun it seems the market right now is around 500.00 and up. I'll swap with anyone who has a gun of equal value. Or I can add, or take a little cash to Boot. If you have a offer to make e-mail me with your offer and phone number and I'll call, or text you back. I've got a few rounds left, if you want I have a place a mile away from me that we can shoot it a few times. MW."

Have YOU seen the ADs like this:

""Get it NOW before they take it away""  I don't see any laws on the table taking away hi capacity mags or sporting rifles.  And if they ever do why would one human use that event to take advantage of another?

""You will not get this ammo anywhere Cheaper""  I just left a little gun store with 200 rounds of brass 5.56 less than these ads advertise.

""Very rare, you will not find this anywhere else""  Saw this on an ad for a Henry Survival  Rifle.  While at the same gun store I got the ammo they has TWO of them and at a decent price.

The same store also had the rare Ruger Mini 14, 7 AR-15s, 3 AK-47s.  I guess I should have asked him where he got all those RARE guns?

We are partially paying the crazy prices we are paying because of people taking advantage of others.  Yes its ""free trade"" but is it RIGHT?  I grew up on the gulf coast of Texas, when a storm was coming everyone purchased plywood to board up the windows.  I was just a kid but I knew it was wrong when on any given day a sheet of plywood cost $25 but 5 days before the storm the same plywood magically cost $60.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!
