This is the ultimate pack and carry 22LR! It comes with it's own carry bag.

Included in the package:
- new Ruger 10/22 takedown SS model # 11100
- new bore sighted, properly mounted 3x9 by 42mm compact scope with illuminated reticle with elevation adjustable turrets for dialing in distance, as well as the yardage.
- 525 Remington Golden Bullets 22lr Brass plated Hollow Points, 1280 FPS 36 grain
- 5 high capacity magazines and 1 regular magazine (6 TOTAL Mags!!!)
- 2 Ruger Factory Bx-25 Magazines (New in wrapper- people say they are the best!)
- 1 32 round, steel lipped by Pro Mag (new in wrapper)- very hard to find
- 2 Butler Creek Steel Lips clear 25 round magazines (new in wrapper)
- 1 factory 10 round magazine (that came with the gun)
- extra battery for the scope (new in package)
- as well as everything that came with rifle, lock, paperwork, ect.

Couple of things about the package. I'm selling it because I want to switch to an  .17hmr semi auto. I've grown weary of standing in lines waiting for 22LR ammo, so I'm switching to 17 which is a little easier to come by albeit 5-7 times the cost of 22lr. Either way I've decided to sell my 10/22 dream to finance part of my next project.

The scope fits inside the bag, in the sleeve. If you've done you're homework you will understand that I put a lot of time and effort to find a scope that would accomplish that. You can't buy a regular length scope and have it fit in the bag, much less fit in the sleeve. But you will want the scope to be in the sleeve for protection.

The magazines are difficult and expensive to find. Do a quick search and you will see the outrageous prices being asked for a bx-25, and especially for a 32 round pro mag. The butler creek steel lips are somewhat available but the clear colors are hardest to find in Colorado.

Everything is ready for you. I mounted the scope and boresighted it. You should be able to hit paper when you shoot it.

This rifle has NEVER been shot, brand new. However it is ready to go to the range. I've included ammo so you can head straight there after purchase (if you want.)

I'm not in a hurry to sell. Not interested in trades. Cash or Credit Card for payment.

Do your research, you will see that I'm below market value for this package (especially when you add up all the magazines and add ammo to the deal), and I'd prefer to sell this set-up to someone who will appreciate it. 

Check out impact guns for a similar package that has been out of stock since December 2012. http://www.impactguns.com/product.aspx?zpid=33649 Their package sells for $699, does not have the magazines, does not have the ammo, plus you need to add $25 for ground shipping, $35 for ffl transfer fee, and $10 for Colorado's new background check. IN other words their package is $769 when it gets to you.

$825 takes this package home. AND I'm not looking for trades at this time. Unless you have an Alexander Arms Ar-15 in the 17 HMR caliber."

This is a Ruger 10/22 Target Model.  This rifle comes from Ruger with a .920 stainless steel bull barrel, upgraded trigger/internals, and Walnut stock.  This is top of the line when it comes to 22 rifles.  It performs flawlessly and is lots of fun to shoot at the range.  Included with the rifle is a 3-9 illuminated scope from Leapers UTG (excellent reviews on opticsplanet, so good they are constantly on backorder), a 10 round Ruger mag, a brand new in box BX-25 mag, and 575 rounds of CCI mini mag ammo.  Rifle will come in a  new soft case or hard case, you choose.  You will be hard pressed to find a better 10/22 package at this very reasonable price.

The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands."

This item is new, we are a licensed gun shop and we received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

We are also willing to accept trades on this firearm, like rifles, handguns or quality optics.

Hello and thank you for checking out our listing. We have a factory new Guncrafter Industries Model 2 chambered in 45ACP this pistol has the melonite finish which is the toughest finish available on the market. This 1911 was built with slide top serrations, GI Trijicon straight 8 night sights, crowned and flush barrel, flush slide stop, and the one awesome detail that sets this 1911 apart from all the rest, the monolithic rail. This rail is not only useful for adding accessories, but it adds a few ounces to the front of the gun for extreme balance, reduced muzzle flip and recoil.

We are a Guncrafter Industires dealer and always try to have their Model 1's, 2's and 3'sin stock, along with Pistol with no name and The American. The Model 2 has a rail underneath the barrel for mounting lights, laser's, etc. The Model #1 is a classic 1911 with no rail and clean smooth lines. Model 3 is a #1 in 4.25"", The American and Pistol with no name are standard 1911 45ACP Gov. models.

This #2 has had it's finish upgraded from the standard parkerized finish to my favorite custom finish, where it is bathed in a boiling almost 1,000 degree Nitride Salt Bath giveing it what is known as a MELONITE finish. Not some spray on or bake on finsih.

The Melonite finish is a $275 upgrade and has the following benefits:

The pores of the metal are sealed to prevent Rust
Corrosion Protection
Scuffing Resistance
Surface Hardness
Improved Wear Resistance
Beautiful Black Finish
Lower Coefficient of Friction
Improves the Strength of the Finish When Heated, such as when firing several magazines
Slicker Running Behavior
Decreased Surface Roughness
Low Light Reflection
Increased Pressure Loadibility

It is an improvement over Stainless, Hard Chrome, Color Case Hardening and many, many other traditional finishes. It is a Salt Bath Nitride finish which is hundreds of times thicker than black oxide coatings and the Melonite will still be there after the black finish has worn off. After bathing in almost 1,000 degree salt bath the finish is left with a thich corrosion resistant very hard surface.

This also features their Aluma-Grips which are attractive and 100% aluminum. It also has a complete reliability job A 5"" Stainless Steel Heavy Match Grade Barrel Full Dehorning Job so it won't snag or catch on your clothes and holster.

This is the ultimate fighting handgun so Buy IT.

Will pay $500 for the gun and 2 mags, if you have the other standard stuff (box, etc) that's cool and if not it's fine also. I don't care about a bit of wear here or a few scratches. Really unless the gun fell off a motorcycle on the highway, was in a fire or something else crazy it is good enough for me.

Not interested in paying full retail for every accessory you purchased for the gun. This means I do not want a $750 package of the gun, 2 weird custom holsters, 3 boxes of ammo at a 300% mark up or whatever so don't ask. Really just looking for the gun. Whatever you want to toss in for $500 is fine with me. 

Would like to meet in the greater Sierra Vista area including Benson. Can make it up to Tuscon but it would have to be on the weekend.

Let me know if you can use $500 for a Glock 26 that's taking up space in the safe."

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.

FACTORY NEW IN BOX!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!! Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. 

This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. 

The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. 

The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength.

 They have head stamps of 7.92 / A / A / 1955. They were originally on stripper clips but were removed for cleaning. I have had no time to properly clean these rounds, I was able to tumble 200 rounds that seem to come out great. They might need a more abrasive tumbler material... I used my fiends tumbler which removed almost all surface rust and the tumbled ammo looks shoot able. In the pictures, I tried to show some of the ""worst"" looking ammo on the left to the cleanest looking ammo on the right... I am selling these as use for components because I have not shot any and don't know reliability.... You can clean them and try them out or pull the bullets and check the components then reload and shoot....

You are getting 200 rounds tumbled clean and 795 rounds not tumbled...  I also have to original crate that the ammo came in... If you are picking up the ammo, I will include the crate but I will not include it if I am shipping the ammo unless you pay for shipping...

The bottom row is the cleaned, tumbled ammo.. They are smooth and seem shoot able,  any discoloration in the ammo is no longer raised... The shells and bullets are now smooth to the touch...

FACTORY NEW IN BOX!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!! Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. 

This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. 

The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. 

The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength.

FACTORY NEW IN BOX!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!! Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. 

This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. 

The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. 

The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength.

985,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1523985,For Sale:  Spikes Tactical AR15 Lower Parts Kit + ALG Trigger Kit,"West Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 175,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 13, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Great high quality package to build your stripped lower with including a top notch trigger that wont break the bank. 1 Spikes Tactical AR15 LPK plus 1 ALG Defense Trigger Kit, which is tuned by Geissele. Everything you need to build your stripped lower with high end internal components. Everyone knows Spikes products are great, and their parts kit is one of the best available. And of course Geissele triggers are widely regarded as some of the best made, running $200-$300 easily depending on model. The Geissele technicians tune this ALG trigger. ALG Defense is connected to Bob Geissele - see below - so it makes sense they put together this upgraded trigger pack with their knowledge and skill for people on a budget. Listed below is all the information on the ALG Trigger Kit. This is a great set up with much improved performance over a stock trigger without going to a high dollar true Geissele branded trigger (which would cost 3 - 4 times the price). Price is firm, cash only, if interested please include a number to contact you on in your reply, thanks.

ALG Defense was founded by William Geissele’s wife — Will being the founder of Geiselle Automatics, one of the top commercial trigger manufacturers in the world. The idea behind ALG is to provide triggers that are tuned by Geissele’s technicians while still being affordable by the average shooter.

ALG Defense Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) Trigger is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the QMS is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however the majority of the associated grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the well known reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs. *If interested and serious please include a phone number to contact you on in your reply. No number no reply.

**Tuned by Geissele Automatics**

Performance Advantages for the Shooter:
The ALG Defense QMS trigger pull is smoother and sharper than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by honing the sear surfaces smooth while not removing metal below the valleys of the stock surface finish.
Sear geometry has not been changed from the standard profile so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged.
Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness.
Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness.
Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications.
A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition.
Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. Both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated.
Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.5lbs.

Advantages for the Armorer:
The ALG Defense QMS trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged.
There is spare parts commonality between the QMS and stock triggers
Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets.
Since it is a trigger meeting the U.S. Military trigger specifications for the M4 Carbine, the ALG Defense QMS can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements."
