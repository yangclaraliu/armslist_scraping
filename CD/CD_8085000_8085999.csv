Rifle is an absolute blast to shoot and can back up all the hype behind these rifles. With factory ammo it will basically stack a group at 1000 yards! Everything on the rifle is factory. I’ve owned the rifle and the scope for less than a month. Had some unexpected expenses come up and need to let it go. Having said that, I will not, repeat, will not even look at lowball offers. It comes with a Nightforce NXS 3.5x15-50 F1 scope and a Nikon mount. Scope has the illuminated reticle and ZeroStop. Rifle comes with an accu-tac bipod. If you’re not familiar with these bipod do yourself a favor and check them out. This is a very accurate, dependable, and extremely comfortable set up that won’t let you down. I will ship the rifle once payment has been recieved and cleared in my bank account. I will not accept checks, cashiers checks, or PayPal. If you are interested in the rifle/scope combo and want to buy it we can set up a safe and legal bank transfer that will leave both parties happy and confident that neither party or their boss’ (wives) have tried to pull a fast one. Thank you for checking my ad out and I look forward to speaking with you about this awesome rig!! I prefer text messaging and my cell number is six15-two89-3two2eight I am available almost all of the time lol! Literally! So text or call away!

This system has 200 rounds or less put through it. For those of you who don't know much about the 6.8 mm round, here is some fascinating information I suggest you read if you are interested in this amazing rifle;The 6.8mm SPC cartridge was designed to address the deficiencies of the terminal performance of the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge currently in service with the U.S. Armed Forces.[7] The cartridge was the result of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge program. The 6.8 SPC (6.8×43mm) was initially developed by MSG Steve Holland and Chris Murray, a United States Army Marksmanship Unit gunsmith,[8] to offer superior downrange lethality over the 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington in an M16 pattern service rifle with minimal loss of magazine capacity and a negligible increase in recoil.[9] The goal was to create a cartridge that would bridge the gap between 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm.The 6.8 mm Remington Special Purpose Cartridge (6.8 SPC, 6.8 SPC II or 6.8×43mm) is a rimless bottlenecked intermediate riflecartridge that was developed by Remington Arms in collaboration with members of the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, United States Special Operations Command[5] to possibly replace the 5.56 NATO cartridge in a Short Barreled Rifle(SBR)/Carbine.PRICE REDUCED The price is $1,100 plus the buyer pays transfer fee. We will meet at my local gunsmith who provides decent prices on transfers.Get in touch with me if you'd like more pictures or if you need to ask any questions.

It is in very good condition for it's age. There is a slight turn ring, there are a couple very faint idiot scratches on the frame and, come to find out, a couple slight scratches on the left side shroud tip. I have kept this revolver in a soft case which I now know has an exposed zipper on the inside and that is what I believe scratched it. It has a Pachmayr ""Presentation"" grip, no medallions. The action is tight, lock up is good, bright bore and good rifling. This is a Monson Mass. made revolver. I believe this is an early version as the over-travel adjustment is in the trigger, not the frame (visible in the last pic which also shows the slight idiot scratches). If you are looking for a pristine safe queen this isn't it. If you are looking for a nice Dan Wesson you can enjoy shooting this could be the one you are looking for. It's been a good shooter for me. There is no barrel tool or gap gauge included. Face to face at a local FFL or I will ship from my FFL to your FFL for an additional $25.00. If you have any questions or would like additional pics send me a message, I will do the best I can to get you the info you are looking for.I am NOT looking for any trades."

I test fired 12 rounds through it and my old eyes held a 2 inch group at 50 yards off hand.  The wood is in great shape and has been redone at the factory Im assuming because there is a awesome looking factory splice reapair on a small section of the buttstock.

I know the T6B you can get on backorder is $56 shipping, not to mention the wait, so it and the T6 at $50 a box is a steal. The other two are right at what Jay asks on his site also, but like the T6, they are also on backorder. These prices are firm-I will not go a penny less as I am already losing money. I am not trying to sound like an ass, I just simply can't lose anymore than I am at these prices. If you buy all 6 boxes for the $280 they come up to I will throw in a new in box FNH Five-Seven 20 round mag which are about $40 each (made my FNH, not ProMag).

Not that there’s anything wrong with its appearance. The Super Grade’s satin stainless steel’s warm sheen gives the gun a subtle, business-like look. Paired with black cherry grips and classic 1911 cues, the Super Grade is a modern take on a timeless design. Which, of course, it is. Like a lot of high-end 1911s.Roberts Defense’s motto is “never compromise.” If hand-fitting means never having to say never mind, they’re living up to their creed. The Super Grade’s clearly benefitted from a lot of hands-on care and attention. The frame-to-slide fit is exceptional, with no hang-ups and no rattle. None. Racking the Super Grade’s slide isn’t like manipulating a greased lightning Cabot (what is?) but the 1911’s action is at least as smooth as a Wilson Combat custom.Like most 1911 guys, I worry about tight-fitting guns; a John Moses Browning meisterwerk with tiny tolerances can foretell future function failures. The barrel bushing was so tight on Robert’s blaster I couldn’t remove it without a bushing wrench. Like a town bicycle, it will loosen up over time. The grip safety is blended very well to the frame, but it isn’t as well-sorted as it is on a higher-priced custom gun – yes there are many – like an Ed Brown. With a price of “just” $1649.00 I’m willing to let it go.Roberts Defense fashioned the Super Grade Pro’s hammer and sear from D7 tool steel. According to diehlsteel.com, that’s a “high carbon high chromium die steel with added carbon and vanadium for abrasion resisting qualities. Useful for applications involving extreme abrasive wear.” Roberts says the metal maintains its shape and angles much better than other steels.The trigger feels like a gunsmith-tuned go pedal, though it’s got a lot of wiggle inside the frame. The trigger pull is as clean as an airline pilot’s kitchen and as sharp as Saville Row suit. It has the perfect amount of take-up leading to to a solid wall, followed by a crisp break. If your sights are moving when you fire the Super Grade, it’s all you.Perhaps this is a good time to mention that all Roberts Defense guns come with a transferable lifetime warranty. If your third-hand Roberts Defense has feeding problems or the sights come loose – perish the thought – you can send it in for free warranty work. As customers of high-end 1911s will attest, personal and prompt service is one of the major benefits of working with a small gunmaker; they’re willing to take responsibility for any and all issues and fix the problems fast.The first thing I look for in any gun I shoot: reliability. The Robert Defense Super Grade has it in spades. RF ran 250 rounds of Winchester White Box RF through the gun (“just warming it up, Wes”) sans problem. I fed it another 500 rounds. In addition to standard 230 gr. ball, I shot three popular self-defense rounds: Hornady TAP FPD 230 +P, Federal Hydrashok 230, and my personal favorite Federal HST 230 +P. All of these loads fed through the pistol without the slightest hiccup. There were no malfunctions whatsoever.The pistol is ridiculously accurate. It shot so well I had to compare it side-by-side with a Les Baer Thunder Ranch Special with a 1.5 inch guarantee (a gun that will be getting it’s own review sometime soon). The Les Baer was slightly more accurate, but that could be down to user familiarity (i.e. it’s my gun). Considering the Baer’s $800 premium over Roberts Defense, that’ll do.A lot of TTAG readers balk at paying a grand-and-a-half for a gun. Any gun – never mind a 1911. Especially when they can find perfectly serviceable 1911 for $800 to $1000. But the Roberts Defense Super Grade has “it”: the high-quality hand-fit feel and rock-solid performance buyers expect from guns that sell for $2k and up. The company is fast, friendly and passionate about their product, willing to stand behind their gun for as long as ye shall live. And beyond.The only potential problem: the Super Grade Pro’s extremely aggressive checkering and grips. As they say about strange sexual practices, if you don’t understand it, it’s not for you. But if you’re willing to suffer a bit of pain for a lot of gain – shooting a proverbial tack-driver – you can’t do any better at the price. And maybe even higher.Caliber:                .45 ACPBarrel Length:              5”Weight:                  36.8ozFinish:                 StainlessCapacity:                     8+1Price:            $1549 MSRPRatings (out of five stars):Style * * * * *If you’re looking for a custom 1911 that screams CUSTOM 1911, this isn’t it.
