Bought on April 11, 2013 and received a week later but found that I already have the same exact model. I thought my first one was EXPS-2 but it turned out to be EXPS-3 as well, so I  am selling the one I just bought. Got it from Bass Pro Shop online and now it's unavailable anywhere, selling at purchase price with receipt. Never registered, never used.   This is the fastest way to acquire a sight picture for initial and follow up shots, a staple in competitive shooting.  The EXPS is better than the XPS because the built in QD mount raises the EXPS 7 mm so it eliminates the need for an extra riser mount yet still allow a lower 1/3 co-witness, also the controls are locared at the side instead of the back for much easier use especillay if you plan on having a magnifier behind it.  EXPS-2 is not night vision compatible which is important for night competitions and hunting.  EXPS is the best sight for Close Quarter shooting but is also good for long distance up to 500 yards with a cheap 3x magnifer, I use PA."

This is a Ruger Mini-14 in .223 caliber with an American hardwood - both upper and lower -stock.  The rifle comes with a Simmons 3 – 10 x 44 Wide Angle 44 MAG scope already mounted and bore sighted.  There will be two 30-round magazines and the original 5-round magazine included as part of the sale.  Rifle will also come with 100-rounds of Herter's 55 grain .223 hollow point ammo.

The bore is clean and shiny like it was when it was stored in 2007 – the last time it was out prior to 2013.  

This rifle has been professionally inspected, test fired, cleaned, and oiled by Ahlman's (Morristown, MN).  It was then picked up on July 19th, 2013 and has not been fired since - paperwork is available to support this. 

This is a quality firearm that has been well taken care of; any trades should be presented in the same condition.  

If you need additional photos or have questions feel free to ask.  

I am interested in many types of firearms.  I am especially interested in Savage (.22LR, .17HMR, etc.); Kimber (.45 ACP) products; an M-1 Garand; or a Marlin lever action 30-30.  Trades do not have to be restricted to those choices, but that is where my preferences are.  

Let me know what you think the value of your trade is.  If there is a difference between our values we will have to work that out.  There’s no sense in either of us taking a hit on a trade.  

I will need to see a valid permit to purchase or carry and a valid MN ID to complete this sale / trade.  I will fill out a transfer paper, the paperwork is not intended to go anywhere but for me to keep for my personal records.  You can have a copy of the paperwork also if you like.

Reciever & bolt numbers match. Here is some info on this very collectible rifle:

History:
The FR7 and FR8 were introduced in the 1950s when the Spanish military was already implementing the CETME automatic rifle, but did not yet have sufficient inventory to equip and train all troops. The rifles were made from existing stockpiles of Mauser bolt-action rifles, the FR-7 from the rifle model 1919 Santa Barbara and the FR-8 from the 1943 Santa Barbara carbine. They were adjusted to the new NATO calibre 7.62×51mm, and being of a suitably compact built, the FR 8 was used well into the 1970s by mounted Guardia Civil units in the Sierra Nevada (Spain).

Features:
The flash hider was designed to be compatible with NATO standard rifle grenades. The under-barrel tube, which resembles the gas cylinder found on automatic weapons, actually serves as the bayonet mount and as storage for cleaning gear. The rear sight is a diopter elevation-adjustable rotary type with aperatures for 200m, 300m, & 400m as well as an open ""V"" notch for 100m. Operation is identical to the standard Mauser design.

Price is $500. FTF only with pickup in the Valrico/Brandon area. You must be a FL resident & 21 or older to purchase."

The 5906 is a full-sized, double/single action, staggered-column magazine, 9 mm pistol. The weapon's construction is all stainless steel. The firearm is chambered to fire 9 mm Luger Parabellum ammunition. While a true double-action pistol, the firearm shares the magazine disconnect feature with Browning Hi-Power pistols: it cannot be fired without the magazine in place. This feature was developed to meet the needs of various law enforcement agencies interested in providing another level of safety for their officers. In the event that they lose control over their weapon, they can render it useless by dropping out the magazine.[citation needed] The 5906 comes standard with a 15 round magazine. Other features include ambidextrous safety levers, a one-piece rear wraparound grip, and a choice of either fixed sights or a rear sight fully adjustable for windage and elevation. A popular model with law enforcement and military units in the United States.

The FN Forty-Nine is a recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol developed by the Belgium company Fabrique Nationale (FN). The Forty-Nine uses an improved linkless locking principle intended for police use. The pistol is striker fired and uses FN's Repeatable Secure Striker mechanism.[2] This means that unlike many other striker-fired pistols, such as the Glock family, the Forty-Nine operates on a double-action only (DAO) trigger mechanism, meaning that the hammer is cocked by the trigger pull before every shot. This allows the user to re-strike a misfired cartridge simply by pulling the trigger again.[1] The Forty-Nine has no external (manual) safety switches. The double-stacked detachable magazine holds sixteen rounds in 9mm caliber and fourteen in .40 S&W. The frame is constructed of polymer and the slide of stainless steel. An accessory rail under the barrel allows for quick and easy mounting of laser aiming modules and flashlights."

One of the issues I had when I acquired the LCP was the low profile sites that were almost non functional for the accuracy that the LCP was capable of delivering so I had the slide dovetailed and fitted for better profile sights including a front tritium night sight. This is something Ruger decided to deliver with the new LC 380 pistol except that the new pistol is significantly heavier, nearly twice the weight. In addition, the feeding ramp has been highly polished  to increase reliability and the trigger/sear has been polished for smooth trigger pull. This offering includes the original manuals, three magazines, case, and all that came with the original purchase. The gun has 300-500 rounds through it to break it in for reliability and I have fired a broad range of ammo without any malfunction. After the break-in and ramp polishing, this been absolutely reliable. For the buyer, I would have suggestions for ammo as I do considerable ballistic testing and have done that with this particular gun. The gun is also fitted with a Crimson trace laser and the gun is sighted dead on with both night sights and the CT laser for 30 feet combat distance. I have also fitted the gun with a belt clip and a home-made trigger block safety of my own making for IWB carry. The trigger block safety I crafted is easy to activate, you just push it out to the left or right as you place your finger on the trigger, yet adds a level of security to enable carrying a round in the chamber. I got the idea for a product I saw for glocks.  I have carried this gun for nearly a year and it disappears; you don't feel it at all in your WB. I have also used a pocket holster and it disappears in your pocket. It is incredibly light for a .380; a great summer carry gun. This gun is capable for excellent accuracy for its size, shooting 2-3"" groups at 7 yards in fast fire mode for me. The offering comes with the original box, documents, locks, soft case, etc. It also comes with a book hide out I created which holds the gun and two magazines with a dust jacket for a book called 'Forgotten Valor' - see photos. It also comes with 3 each of extra different weight Wolf recoil and firing pin springs.   I have trusted this gun with my life. You can buy a new LCP for less money, but you won't get the customizations or reliability out of the box you will with this one. Will accept cash or PayPal. Not interested in trades."

2 boxes 30-06 Red Tracer ammo by Talon Mfg. - $60 for both.

2 boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser FMJ bullet & 2 boxes of wood bullet ammo. The wood bullet ammo was considered to be ""blank"" when used with a special  adapter that shredded the wood bullet. However be extremely careful if firing without adapter because wood bullet can be fatal at close range. $50 for all four boxes. All 6.5 Swedish ammo above is non-corrosive.

5 boxes Nazi 8x56R ammo. This ammo was made in 1938 as Hitler's war machine was gearing up. This is the correct ammo for the M95 Steyr ""straight pull"" carbine & long rifle. Ammo is in amazing condition given it's age and each box and every individual round bears the date of manufacture, and the Nazi proof  ""War Eagle"". The vast majority of this ammo will fire reliably and I shot many boxes through a M95 carbine I used to have. Recoil is quite stout though in the carbine. This ammo is a ""super collectible"" piece of WWII history. Price is $20 a box or $80 for all five. Each box contains 10 rounds packed on 2 blued steel M95 stripper clips which sell for $5+ each on Gunbroker & Ebay today.

I am really looking for a mark 23 but will settle for a usp with threaded barrel with lots of mags or ammo.  The quad is easily worth in the range of 1800-2200 but I need it out of my storage unit so I can close it down and not have to pay any more. The suzuki is good shape. The only thing it needs is brakes and that will have to be done right away because they arent on there anymore. I do not have time to mess with it anymore so here you go. I am letting it go for a gun. haha, first person who offers something decent is taking it. no joke, not stolen just want it out. It runs good and the plastics are good.  It has brand new front tires and the back tires are in good shape. It does not leak a drop and it had a fresh tune up a few months ago but I have not touched it in several months now. It will come with a bill of sale. I may be able to get the title but Im not sure. I had it when I was moving from Ga but Im not sure what I did with it.  I have an idea where it might be so I might have it by the time we talk. this was a spur if the moment decision so I haven't been able to call and check. I am getting rid of it one way or another so if you are interested let me know what you have. I put it on here so I can get a gun. nothing big please.  thats why Im getting rid of it to begin with.Thanks"

Don't let the name scare you because this thing NEVER jams or malfunctions. With this purchase you will get the carbine, 1 magazine (holds 10), forward grip, and sling (sorry no ammo i cannot find any) you can also get extended 15 round mags for pretty cheap! This gun shoots flawlessly with a light trigger pull that can get rounds down range pretty quickly! Also almost no recoil, so it would be perfect for home defense for your wife or child. Charging handle locks to the rear after mag is empty and mag release is on the grip like a pistol.

With this purchase (and only with purchase) I will throw in a FREE 12 gauge pump shotgun with some shells. the shotgun is a sears roebuck & co. pretty old and has some cosmetic flaws and a little rust but it functions perfectly.

I will sell face to face only. no shipping.
Price is firm and I will not go a dime under $400.
I will drive to meet anywhere in the upstate. 

This is a steal so jump on it before its gone!

As noted by the manufacturer:
The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab. 

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
      The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

It's a factory assembled Rock River lower that's used and the upper is a collection of parts assembled by me. The lower has used with a 9mm upper and has a couple of wear marks inside the magwell, but no other flaws. The spots in the pictures are oil. Trigger springs were replaced with JP yellow springs. It's not ""sweet"", but pretty decent compared to most mil spec triggers. I don't know who made the upper, but it's got a keyhole forge mark and a fresh coat of matte black Duracoat. There is now a forward assist in place where the plug was shown in the pics.  Barrel is a 16"" 8 twist lightweight gvmt. contour with a mid-length gas system. A2 flash hider is timed with no crush ring and is not pinned. Handguard is a custom creation. It's 15"" or so long and comes to the back of the flash hider. There is an aluminum ring on the end of the handguard to prevent any damage to the tube. 

I built it to be a nice lightweight rifle for multigun, but got my sbr stamp and now have something even smaller . I only fired it to make sure everything was good with it before listing it, so it has about 25 rounds on it. My load with 69gr smk and Varget went right at an inch and my 55fmj with Armscore bullets was about 1.5"", which is typical for that load. The Hornady's seem to be much more consistent in my rifles, but I didn't take any of those with me. A better scope and ammo might be helpful. I doubt it's a tack driver, but don't think it's a turd either. Rifle without the optic weighs 6# 1 oz. and is 32 3/8"" long. Scope and mount in the pics is gone.

Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS Calibers: 308 nato Weight unloaded (no magazine): 8.1 lbs Length: 26"" Barrel length: 18"" Magazine: 10 or 20 or 30 FAL Practical range: 1200m 600m The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Five 30 round DS magazines and one 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with Vortex Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. Folding iron sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including M9 Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle.
