The Eotech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sight was developed after extensive testing of various optical sights, and US Special Operations Command has standardized on the Eotech Holographic Weapon Sight as its 1X weapon optic for close quarter and urban combat zones. To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by our elite fighting forces, EOTech has developed the EOTech Holo Sight M 553, modeled after the ever popular, battle proven Eotech HWS design. The EOTech M553 Holo Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. The advantage of EOTech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sights is its holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. The magic of EOTech Holographic 553 Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. The EOTech Holographic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when the laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target with point of aim/impact being maintained and fully functional, the operator can still engage with confidence. Pick up this red dot sight for maximum shooting performance!

Transition quickly from close-in to long-range shots! This G33 Magnifier adds 1-3X adjustable magnification to your Weapon Sight.

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

It also comes with a front and rear 3 dot sight system when not using the factory laser.  

This is an excellent firearm for concealed carry and has multiple safety features including a de-cocking mechanism which drops the firing pin making it impossible for the firearm to discharge accidentally.  This firearm also field strips easier than a Glock, and is a good of quality (my opinion) as a Walther PPK.  

I have all original paperwork and the box for both the firearm and the LaserLyte laser sights, and will include a brand new Uncle Mikes Sidekick Size 15 holster which fits the pistol perfectly.  I originally purchased the entire set up for my girlfriend, but she ended up liking my Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .38 Special better, so don't have much use for this .380, but I'm also not desperate to sell it by any means, so please don't make unreasonable offers as I won't reply.  

I'm always interested in trading and am partial to Ruger, Remington, Mossberg, Benelli, Kimber, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, and perhaps Glock depending on the model.

It is in excellent condition and is about the same size as the popular Ruger LCP .380's, so it is very concealable, but fires a more powerful round.  The ammo is readily available and chaper than normal 9mm rounds, will sell 50 rd boxes of Silver Bear FMJ for $20 each.

The pistol comes with two 6-round magazines, one with the standard pinky extension, and one with the pinky extension ground off.  Removing the pinky extension helps it fit larger hands and makes it even more concealable and less likely to get caught on clothing.  I would personally grind them all off, but some people like them original.

Due to the fixed barrel blowback design, this pistol is highly accurate.  It is not too difficult to put all 6 rounds on a man-sized target from 50 YARDS!!!

The knock on this pistol is that the stock double action trigger pull is HORRIBLE.  I have replaced the mainspring with a reduced power Wolff spring which makes a HUGE difference.  I have the original spring available if you would like it.  The single action trigger is just about as nice as any pistol out there.

The Eotech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sight was developed after extensive testing of various optical sights, and US Special Operations Command has standardized on the Eotech Holographic Weapon Sight as its 1X weapon optic for close quarter and urban combat zones. To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by our elite fighting forces, EOTech has developed the EOTech Holo Sight M 553, modeled after the ever popular, battle proven Eotech HWS design. The EOTech M553 Holo Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. The advantage of EOTech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sights is its holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. The magic of EOTech Holographic 553 Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. The EOTech Holographic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when the laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target with point of aim/impact being maintained and fully functional, the operator can still engage with confidence. Pick up this red dot sight for maximum shooting performance!

Transition quickly from close-in to long-range shots! This G33 Magnifier adds 1-3X adjustable magnification to your Weapon Sight. Dramatically increases accuracy without sacrificing speed to the target. 100% waterproof and fogproof. Tool-free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, precise focusing.

Both have the quick attach mounts and the magnifier has side release that moves the magnifier over to the side for close quarters. 

Would rather sell package deal but will split if price is right. This package is less than a year old and retails for over $1300. Open to all offers except trades. Cash money only."

P-3AT
The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

384,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1761384,For Sale/Trade:  Like New Honda eu1000i Invertor Generator,"Downtown Portland, Portland, Oregon",$ 800,"Listed On: Friday, June 14, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is an unused, like new condition Honda eu1000i Invertor Generator in classic Honda red.  The only reason I'm not listing this as brand new is because I do not have the original packaging, and I did start the generator the other day just to make sure there were no issues at all, and there weren't.  Started right up and put out enough power to feed a shop vac, a computer, and oscillating fan all at the same time.  

My Grandfather purchased this generator brand new as a backup for his RV in case of emergency, but he passed away and the generator has been stored (dry) ever since.  He never got the chance to run it even once, and paid well over $1K for the unit.  These generators are very sought after because of their size, power capacity and portability.  Honda states one full tank of premium gasoline will power the generator under normal conditions for 6-8 hours.  It also has an ECON mode for further fuel conservation.  

Please feel free to ask any questions, I'll do my best to answer them.  I am somewhat flexible on price, but for a new generator of this class, I don't think my asking price is too awfully high.  I will also include a 5 gallon matching gas can with purchase.  I think my Papa bought the Honda cover for the unit too, but I would have to look for it."

Sauer developed the model 38H from their earlier semi-automatic handguns. It was necessary to compete with companies such as Mauser and Walther in the commercial market. However, with the outbreak of the war, most pistols went to various German police agencies. These pistols were stamped by those agencies and some can still be found with the holster and additional magazine with which they were distributed. Sauer 38H pistols presented to Nazi officials often featured custom engraving, ivory grips, and often gold inlay as well. For example, in September 2004, the Rock Island Auction Company sold a Sauer 38H, serial number 363573, that belonged to Sepp Dietrich for $43,125.00.
The Sauer 38H was produced in three basic models. Generally, the slide of the first model says ""JP Sauer und Sohn"" on the left. The second version says only ""CAL 7.65"", and the third version omits the safety and the cocking/decocking lever. Towards the end of the war, weapons produced were simplified for quicker, cheaper production. For the 38H, this meant simpler markings, rough finish, and the elimination of features like the slide-mounted safety. So-called ""late-war"" models were still fully functional though. Final examples, produced until April 1945 when the factory was overrun by the Allies, feature mismatched serial numbers and poor fit and finish.
The spirit of the Sauer 38H lives on in the SIG Sauer P232 and its predecessor the P230, which also feature a fixed barrel, decocking lever, and similar internal design. As a testament to their fine design, many Sauer 38Hs are regularly used by owners to this day, albeit usually with replacement grips.

FEG SMC-918


From Gene Gangarosa's ""Complete Guide to Compact Handguns"", courtesy of Gregg Brewer:
K.B.I., Inc,of Harrisburg, PA, began importing this small Hungarian-made pistol in mid-1993, but its history dates back to the late 1950s. At about the same time FEG began making the Model PA-63 (see listing below), it also developed a smaller PPK-sized 9mm Makarov caliber pistol, called the RK-59. An excellent little pistol, similar to Poland's Model vz.63, it is highly regarded in military circles, serving the Hungarian military and police forces.

In 1991, Century imported about 3,000 RK-59s into the U.S. The small size of this gun makes it especially handy as a hideout gun, used mostly by high-ranking officials, pilots and various vehicle crews who occasionally need a pistol but are forced to work and fight in confined spaces. Handgun expert Leroy Thompson has argued that the RK-59 is perhaps the world's best military pistol, because it uses a fighting cartridge powerful enough to be taken seriously, yet is compact enough to carry comfortably on the person at all times.

A slightly improved version of the RK-59---the SMC-380---appeared in 1991. It's actually the same gun rechambered to the slightly less powerful, albeit better known, .380 ACP round. Its frame is still a lightweight alloy, but for commercial sales it is anodized black to match more closely the blued slide of the pistol. In its military version, the frame is left unfinished, as in the PA-63 described earlier.

The SMC-380 is of historical interest because it is the smallest gun ever imported legally into the U.S. since the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (according to which a gun cannot be imported if it is less than 4.0 inches in height). The SMC-380, which is barely 4.1 inches high, had to have a target-type left grip installed to meet the government's stringent importation criteria. The left target-style grip widened the pistol from 1.1 to 1.3 inches, but that was a small price to pay. A thinner, flatter left grip panel is also available on request.

Like the PMK-380, the SMC-380 is available only in .380 ACP caliber. Its alloy frame makes it smoother and two or three ounces lighter than the PPK. It also carries better in a pocket than the higher-priced German gun and it fits the average hand better. Its sights, while tiny, are easy to line up quickly, thanks to the comfortable curve of the backstrap. In testing an early SMC-380, the pistol proved quite accurate. One 25-foot offhand group placed five shots in a one-inch pattern, using Remington 88-grain jacketed hollowpoint, the second-best group at the same distance measured 1.1 inches across, using Samson 95-grain FMJ. Unfortunately, the pistol used required an extended breaking-in period of several hundred rounds before it fed consistently and reliably. Later, though, a second SMC-380 tested much better, with only one breaking-in jam. It's always a good idea to run at least 200 rounds (four boxes) of any particular brand of ammunition through any gun, without a single malfunction, before relying on that gun/ammunition combination for personal protection.

FEG SMC-918 

When K.B.I. observed the popularity of the SMC-380 in the U.S., it decided to import the 9mm Makarov version, the SMC-918. The Hungarians had made this model (with slight modifications) since the late 1950s, with importation beginning in late 1994.
The debate continues whether the 9mm Makarov or the .380 ACP is a better defense cartridge. Neither is particularly powerful, though some of the loadings---particularly the faster hollowpoints and exotic rounds (such as MagSafe)---have caused incapacitating wounds when fired in self-defense.
The SMC-918 we tested handled well. With its clean lines and rounded corners, this pistol carries comfortably in one's pocket and is light and handy. It also boasts good instinctive pointing, with a trigger pull that is noticeably smoother and lighter than that found in the SMC-380s tested. Despite the improved trigger pull, however, the SMC-918 proved slightly less accurate than the SMC-380. Whether this is a quirk of the 9mm Makarov cartridge or an inherent situation is difficult to tell. Regardless, the test pistol had no trouble feeding any ammunition tested, including Hornady's XTP hollowpoint. Recoil with SMC-918 was sharp, similar to firing a small .38-caliber revolver. The shape of its backstrap could be at fault. By rounding off much more than that of the Walther PPK, for instance, the Hungarian designers have created a gun that is smoother in contour but a bit more difficult to fire. Compact guns are, after all, an exercise in compromise.
The SMC-918 offers the 9mm Makarov cartridge in a package that is appreciably smaller and lighter than the Soviet-designed Makarov pistol or its derivatives. The SMC-918 is, in fact, the smallest pistol currently in production for the Makarov round. The price to pay is a gun that is easier to carry and slightly more difficult to shoot. Given its mission of self-defense, though, that's a compromise many buyers will surely find acceptable.

In general, the FEG SMC offers a Walther PPK level of performance for much less the cost than a German-designed gun"

Sauer developed the model 38H from their earlier semi-automatic handguns. It was necessary to compete with companies such as Mauser and Walther in the commercial market. However, with the outbreak of the war, most pistols went to various German police agencies. These pistols were stamped by those agencies and some can still be found with the holster and additional magazine with which they were distributed. Sauer 38H pistols presented to Nazi officials often featured custom engraving, ivory grips, and often gold inlay as well. For example, in September 2004, the Rock Island Auction Company sold a Sauer 38H, serial number 363573, that belonged to Sepp Dietrich for $43,125.00.
The Sauer 38H was produced in three basic models. Generally, the slide of the first model says ""JP Sauer und Sohn"" on the left. The second version says only ""CAL 7.65"", and the third version omits the safety and the cocking/decocking lever. Towards the end of the war, weapons produced were simplified for quicker, cheaper production. For the 38H, this meant simpler markings, rough finish, and the elimination of features like the slide-mounted safety. So-called ""late-war"" models were still fully functional though. Final examples, produced until April 1945 when the factory was overrun by the Allies, feature mismatched serial numbers and poor fit and finish.
The spirit of the Sauer 38H lives on in the SIG Sauer P232 and its predecessor the P230, which also feature a fixed barrel, decocking lever, and similar internal design. As a testament to their fine design, many Sauer 38Hs are regularly used by owners to this day, albeit usually with replacement grips.

AND

FEG SMC-918


From Gene Gangarosa's ""Complete Guide to Compact Handguns"", courtesy of Gregg Brewer:
K.B.I., Inc,of Harrisburg, PA, began importing this small Hungarian-made pistol in mid-1993, but its history dates back to the late 1950s. At about the same time FEG began making the Model PA-63 (see listing below), it also developed a smaller PPK-sized 9mm Makarov caliber pistol, called the RK-59. An excellent little pistol, similar to Poland's Model vz.63, it is highly regarded in military circles, serving the Hungarian military and police forces.

In 1991, Century imported about 3,000 RK-59s into the U.S. The small size of this gun makes it especially handy as a hideout gun, used mostly by high-ranking officials, pilots and various vehicle crews who occasionally need a pistol but are forced to work and fight in confined spaces. Handgun expert Leroy Thompson has argued that the RK-59 is perhaps the world's best military pistol, because it uses a fighting cartridge powerful enough to be taken seriously, yet is compact enough to carry comfortably on the person at all times.

A slightly improved version of the RK-59---the SMC-380---appeared in 1991. It's actually the same gun rechambered to the slightly less powerful, albeit better known, .380 ACP round. Its frame is still a lightweight alloy, but for commercial sales it is anodized black to match more closely the blued slide of the pistol. In its military version, the frame is left unfinished, as in the PA-63 described earlier.

The SMC-380 is of historical interest because it is the smallest gun ever imported legally into the U.S. since the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (according to which a gun cannot be imported if it is less than 4.0 inches in height). The SMC-380, which is barely 4.1 inches high, had to have a target-type left grip installed to meet the government's stringent importation criteria. The left target-style grip widened the pistol from 1.1 to 1.3 inches, but that was a small price to pay. A thinner, flatter left grip panel is also available on request.

Like the PMK-380, the SMC-380 is available only in .380 ACP caliber. Its alloy frame makes it smoother and two or three ounces lighter than the PPK. It also carries better in a pocket than the higher-priced German gun and it fits the average hand better. Its sights, while tiny, are easy to line up quickly, thanks to the comfortable curve of the backstrap. In testing an early SMC-380, the pistol proved quite accurate. One 25-foot offhand group placed five shots in a one-inch pattern, using Remington 88-grain jacketed hollowpoint, the second-best group at the same distance measured 1.1 inches across, using Samson 95-grain FMJ. Unfortunately, the pistol used required an extended breaking-in period of several hundred rounds before it fed consistently and reliably. Later, though, a second SMC-380 tested much better, with only one breaking-in jam. It's always a good idea to run at least 200 rounds (four boxes) of any particular brand of ammunition through any gun, without a single malfunction, before relying on that gun/ammunition combination for personal protection.

FEG SMC-918 

When K.B.I. observed the popularity of the SMC-380 in the U.S., it decided to import the 9mm Makarov version, the SMC-918. The Hungarians had made this model (with slight modifications) since the late 1950s, with importation beginning in late 1994.
The debate continues whether the 9mm Makarov or the .380 ACP is a better defense cartridge. Neither is particularly powerful, though some of the loadings---particularly the faster hollowpoints and exotic rounds (such as MagSafe)---have caused incapacitating wounds when fired in self-defense.
The SMC-918 we tested handled well. With its clean lines and rounded corners, this pistol carries comfortably in one's pocket and is light and handy. It also boasts good instinctive pointing, with a trigger pull that is noticeably smoother and lighter than that found in the SMC-380s tested. Despite the improved trigger pull, however, the SMC-918 proved slightly less accurate than the SMC-380. Whether this is a quirk of the 9mm Makarov cartridge or an inherent situation is difficult to tell. Regardless, the test pistol had no trouble feeding any ammunition tested, including Hornady's XTP hollowpoint. Recoil with SMC-918 was sharp, similar to firing a small .38-caliber revolver. The shape of its backstrap could be at fault. By rounding off much more than that of the Walther PPK, for instance, the Hungarian designers have created a gun that is smoother in contour but a bit more difficult to fire. Compact guns are, after all, an exercise in compromise.
The SMC-918 offers the 9mm Makarov cartridge in a package that is appreciably smaller and lighter than the Soviet-designed Makarov pistol or its derivatives. The SMC-918 is, in fact, the smallest pistol currently in production for the Makarov round. The price to pay is a gun that is easier to carry and slightly more difficult to shoot. Given its mission of self-defense, though, that's a compromise many buyers will surely find acceptable.

In general, the FEG SMC offers a Walther PPK level of performance for much less the cost than a German-designed gun"

It was just sitting out and caught my eye. I'm not really a collector but i do like plinking around. After doing some research, I have come to realize that this isn't something to plink with. The Arisaka's that you see posted on here, those could be plinkers, but this belongs in someone's collection. It seriously has everything. 

Mum is In-Tact - no filing, marking, X'ing or anything. It's flawless

Has MATCHING serial numbers on Bolt and Receiver

Has Monopod

Bayonet band is an original piece, but serial doesn't match

Bolt is the milled model, not the ditch model (since the serial's match on bolt and receiver you can rest assured that this wasn't a ""Frankenstein creation"")

Has the Anti-Aircraft Sights (This is my absolute favorite part of the gun), has both fold out sides too

Has Dust Cover with only very minor wear on the sides, these are pretty rare too

Serial number is very legible, no scratches around it. Has Nagoya Arsenal Stamp on the receiver by the serial. Bayonet shows Toyoda under Nagoya Supervision emblem.

Rifling is absolutely amazing condition. Couldn't have been fired or even used more then a handful of times. 

Wood has possibly been refinished. The only thing that isn't original is the strap. 

Bayonet is a type 30 Straight Quillion, Squared Pommel (No Serial)

Why acquire this historic weapon? It's been 68 years since VE Day so fewer WW2 Mauser rifles are obtainable for collectors, despite the great volume of this particular model's manufacture during the war. Prices for Mousers have increased over 400% in the last 10 years and are poised to increase again over the next decade. This weapon has an excellent condition barrel and cartridge chamber. The seller has fired only eight (8) test rounds to verify its superb accuracy. It has no importation markings or cartouches which significantly increases its value. The ammo fired by the seller was factory manufactured ball only and this firearm has been responsibly stowed and cared for since its manufacture and issue to the present time."

If you are unfamiliar with the 22TCM round it is a essentially a short .223 casing with a 40gr bullet. (See pictures 22TCM on the left, 9MM on the Right)

This pistol with the 22TCM has muzzle velocity of over 2100FPS and delivers quite punch. You Tube 22TCM and you'll see for yourself.

The pistol is a traditional full metal 1911 design. It has a fully adjustable rear sight for elevation and windage. It comes with two barrels and two recoil springs one in 22TCM and one 9MM. It has all the factory bookets, test shells, sight adjustment tool, 9MM Extractor, and 17 Round magazine. It is all packaged in the factory plasic case.

I have shot 200 rounds of 22TCM and the 9MM barrel has never been shot and is still sealed in the factory plastic.

The pistol with come with 100 Rounds of Armscor 22TCM and 25 Rounds of COP 9MM. All are JHP rounds.

The pistol has been cleaned and oiled all three times I have gone shooting at Lock and Load. It has never seen a holster and has no marks or inperfections.

This pistol is a blast too shoot, its sends a huge fireball down range and has a very distinct (loud) sound, but hardley any recoil. It is a really fun gun and get attention any time you are at the range. Lock and Load always has ammo for it because the owner has this pistol as a demo gun on his wall. So there is no worry about ammo supply in the area.

I am willing to sell the rounds with the gun or keep the ammo, depends on the deal. I also have utg rail gaurds. All the extra on the gun are either UTG, Tapco or ATI. The trigger is a two stage and very light. Never had a failure. I absolutely love this gun, but my dad recently bought one and put a slide fire on, so I've come to realize we dont need 2. I am open for cash offers, or interested in trades plus cash."
