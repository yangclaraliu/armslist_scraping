Do-All Outdoors Spin Cycle Targets adds a little frenetic unpredictability to your personal shooting range. These windmill-style targets feature two independently rotating windmill arms, one on each side. When you hit a target, the arms spin around, forcing you to adjust your position for the next shot. In competitive dueling, you can choose to keep your targets moving or stop your opponents', leading to a dynamic duel every time. Target acquisition, speed, and accuracy are all improved when shooting on moving targets like the Do-All Spin Cycle, and the difficulty ramps up even more when you add a friend into the mix. This set of Do-All Outdoors targets includes one 4"" target and one 6"" target on each side, and the targets themselves are sturdy and high visibility. Do-All Outdoors has included a bullet deflection plate into the base for additional safety, and the three leg base is stable enough to take anything you throw at it.

Features of Do-All Spin Cycle Targets:
•Two 4"" targets and two 6"" targets
•Windmill design creates moving targets
•Ideal for competitive duels; keep your side spinning or stop your opponent's side
•Built-in deflector plate at base
•Stable three legged support
•Steel construction

This spinning windmill style target is perfect for improving your accuracy, speed, and target acquisition skills. Great for competitive head-to-head shooting. The large, high-visibility targets return to their up-and-down set positions after each shot. Bullet deflection plate built into base for added safety. Sturdy steel construction with stable three leg base."

225,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1553225,For Sale/Trade:  2003 badass crown vic police interceptor trade cash + guns,"North. Baptist road, Colorado Springs, Colorado","$ 6,500","Listed On: Wednesday, May 1, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my 3 (4) owner 2003 Crown Victoria p71 police interceptor. This car was actually a detective car so there were no holes drilled for the spotlight, like most p71's this year. The first owner was the police station in Chicago, then it was moved to colorado by the third owner about 2 years ago i believe. Car has 155xxx on the odo and has no lights on the dash. Clean title. Runs strong just leaves some oil drips when its parked overnight. I have owned the car for about 6 months now and ive put roughly 8-10k miles on it. Im selling so i can get a 4wd, i miss my old one too much. Price is $7000obo which i believe is fair because you can strip the car and get near that much just in parts. Sound and aesthetics were done by second owner and performance mods were done by third owner. I have not upgraded the car since ive had it. Car has the 4.6l V8 motor.

Interior Upgrades:
Awesome pioneer touchscreen deck w/ CD, MP3, iPod hook up, navigation, AM/FM and can also play movies while driving ;)
Kicker 700 watt amp
2 10"" subwoofers in custom made box. Im told it was the second owners hand-made box
2Kappa 2-way speakers 6x9
2 aftermarket tweeters in the front. Im sorry i do not know the brand but the sound quality is pretty amazing.
Full vehicle dynamat, so only you can hear and feel your music. Also the music can be up with no rattles inside or outside of the car. 
Practically new dvd player in the back, still has the screen protector. I believe its a 10-12"" version, the nice one. Both players have been rigged to play the same thing if desired.
Car has custom gauges
Aftermarket tachometer, stock ones dont come with RPM gauge
""custom"" cup holders/ tray. It was from another ford so it fits the rails but it doesnt fold conveniently into the dash like the stock Crown Vic's do.
Interior compass and temperature gauge thats from an older ford explorer but it is wired to work and it fits the interior seemlessly, you wouldnt be able to tell the difference.
6 seats and seatbelts, 3 in front, 3 in back. Very roomy and would have no issue fitting 6 people
LED lights instead of a dome light. 
Windows tinted, 20% in the rear and 35% in the front. 

Exterior/engine
20"" Saleen premium black chrome rims. These were taken off a wrecked Saleen so they are a bit scuffed up but still in good cond. I had the front right one re welded in a spot because there was an expanding crack, no issues since then.
Premium drilled and slotted Brembo brakes, caliper and rotors. I can easily say that these brakes are some of the best out there. The crown vic weighs roughly 4400 lbs but these brakes make you feel like you are driving something that is hardly 1500 lbs. you can and will stop on a dime with these.
VERY bright HID headlamps
Custom LED lights replaced in taillights and parking lights
Has a very loud aftermarket horn
Tires are the worst part about the vehicle. Rear tires are worn and will need to be replaced before the weather gets cold again. The fronts are in decent shape but are mismatched treads. 
Chrome trim, shines up very nice. 
Mirrors have been modified to hold a blinker LED strip.
NOW, what makes this car unique. The EXHAUST. It has 3 exhaust settings, quietest, kinda loud and NASCAR loud. It is a dual exhaust with 4 exhaust tips, 2 for each pipe. However, right after the engine block electronic exhaust cutoffs have been installed and they make this car sound GOOD. I mean really good. Ive had a police officer comment on how good it sounded while he was giving me a ticket for speeding. Unfortunately these plates do tend to move around due to the vibrations the loud exhaust puts out. A plate on the passenger side fell off but i am having it re-welded as I type.
I am completely confident selling it while the part is welded because it doesnt hinder from the car or the experience, AT ALL. 

The car has other misc. things that im sure i forgot. Like the Viper alarm kit w/ remote start. Or the basics like power seats, windows, A/C is cold and heat is really hot. Engine has a K&N air filter. Hood is wrapped in carbon fiber, no bubbles, looks clean. Car comes with a 3 ring 1"" binder full of service reciepts and even other previous owners paperwork that probably could have been taken out but i will just leave it as is for the new owner. If the car doesnt sell ill just keep it, id like a 4wd but if i get nothing but lowball offers i have no issue driving this for another year or across the country if i needed to. I can take any pictures you would like. The interior isnt clean yet but i will detail for a buyer. I have a husky/shepherd so there is an abundance of dog hair and would be very hard for me to keep continually clean until the car sold. Any questions you can feel free to email me, it goes through my phone so it will be answered in a timely manner. I am open to almost any offer, worst thing i can say is no thanks. Only trade i am open to is a trade +CASH. What do you have? Ill even take guns +cash, car+cash, cash+cash, you name it."

Serial dates it to 1996. Pristine condition. Only fired twice by me to confirm the inertia triggers were working. Passed down to me three weeks ago from an uncle's estate. I just won't use it and it's too nice to let it sit in the safe. I've taken 15 pictures to show details. There are no dings, dents, scrapes, rust, chips, tarnish or anything else to mention. It's literally like new and has never been in the brush. One of these sold in excellent condition(minor rust spots and no box) on GunBroker for $879 in December 2012. Gander Mountain had several for $479 and had them listed as ""Fair Condition"".  I've contacted several local gun shops and the consensus seems to be $1000 to $1200+ retail value. That being said, do your own research. If you're into Trap/Skeet or various fowl hunting, you know what this is and how much it's worth. I'm really interested in trades. I like lever action rifles, bolt action rifles and military rifles. Maybe others. Just email what you have and your offer. I'm putting a fair trade value of $1000.00 on mine and expect any trade (plus cash, silver, etc.) to equal mine in value. I am also willing to add the same if yours is worth more. Just moved to Charlotte and am working in Pineville, Matthews, Mint Hill and Albemarle part time. Not looking for cash but if you have $1200, I'd accept. Thanks for your interest!

486,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1553486,For Sale:  .380 personal protection ammo,"Highlands Ranch, Denver, Colorado",$ 40,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 1, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have two boxes of .380 95gr Winchester Supreme Elite Bonded hollow point ammo for sale.

This feeds well in my Ruger LCP and is a very effective self defense round.

$40 per box of 20.

The Bonded PDX1 is engineered to maximize terminal ballistics, as defined by the demanding FBI test protocol, which simulates real-world threats. A large reason that the FBI has chosen this round for defensive purposes is because of the proprietary bonding process that welds the lead core and the jacket together preventing core/jacket separation after impact. This results in better weight retention and expansion which is why this round has earned such a good reputation. 

The jacketed hollow-point bullets are designed for maximum energy transfer upon impact and controlled expansion during penetration. The nickel-plated cases are designed to help prevent corrosion over time.

Manufactured by the legendary Winchester Ammunition Company, this product is brand new, boxer-primed, nickel-plated brass cased, non-corrosive, and reloadable."

 Ruger's answer to the replacement of the 1911 frame for police/military. The P90 was made for safer operation under stressful and harsh conditions, safer meaning additional design consideration for protection against accidental discharge in the event the firearm is struck, dropped or while its owner might be in a struggle for possession of the firearm. Double action operation, decocking capability, captive inertial firing pin, trigger and sear disconnects, even finishes that keep materials in working order longer with less maintenance all contribute to a very solid gun for carrying in the truck or home protection.

I have a Bersa Ultra Compact Pro .45 caliber, that shoots flawless, it's in excellent condition and accurate! ( 200 rounds down it) comes with 2 Magazines and Laserlight! I don't care if I don't part with it! Check the reviews on this gun, they are just as good as the XDS 45! 

This gun was compared to the Glock 30 by some on the net. I fed it different ammo out of the 200 I shot through it and it ATE it all up. Round Ball, Remington Golden Sabre, Magtech, COP, even a few rounds of Hornady Zombie. - NO PROBLEMS! 

I will not part with this gun easily. Say what you want about the Bersa, it shoots every bit as good as any gun in it's class. 

I also have a Charles Daly 20 gauge youth Model up for sale with extra's. It's NEW, only a few shots. It has a Blackhawk single point tactical sling, ammo and special 40 dollar choke, and packs a wallop with slugs! It's still twice as powerful as a 44 mag! 


Also for the right deal? I have a brand new TAG Tactical Vest ( Have pics) not used once and will include for the right XDS or 1911 Sub Compact. 

I MAY CONSIDER OTHER .45 Caliber Compacts or even .40 Caliber if you have ammo with them! 

Why am I trading all of this for the XDS, when the Bersa is just as good? I'm an Springfield guy, that simple. 

My loyalty is your gain!"

I have been trying to estimate a reasonable price and have found similar examples that have sold or are advertised between 650-1000$...I know, it's a huge price range, realistically I suspect mine falls somewhere in between.  I'll let it hang out on Armslist for 2-3 weeks and see what happens...maybe it's worth more than 750, perhaps less.  Don't be afraid to send me a lowball offer, I won't be offended...but I am in no big hurry to let it go so you might get outbid eventually...I'll let you know and you can decide whether to pass.
