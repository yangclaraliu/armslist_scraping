The 4th Generation Glock ""Safe Action"" brings revolutionary design changes
to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately
apparent is the multiple backstrap design of the frame, which can be
instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands. The surface of
the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame scientifically designed,
real world tested. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly
substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine
catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters.
The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory
attachment.

This will be a perfect Varminter for someone.
I bought this May 26th, 2013.
Paid $470 for it.
Got it home, tested the trigger pull and found it would not reduce to the 3.5 pound as advertized.
Called T/C (which is now a division of Smith & Wesson)...talked to a tech. He sent me a return label and I shiipped the rifle to them.FREE...
Receved the rifle back in one week and they had replaced the trigger. It now breaks at 3.5 pounds! Nice...plus...Great Service from them!

I then bought a 8.50-20x50mm Mueller Eradicator Scope...$239 +tax.and Rings, $23.

The scope has been mounted for my eye relief, but NOT bore sighted...so you will need to adjust for your shooting style.

I got this to take Prairie Dog Hunting but plans fell thru and I am looking to sell or trade this...with or without scope.
For those 'scope bashers' who only like or use Nightforce, Schmidt & Bende or Swarovski scopes...well good for you :) I have had 4 of these Muellers on my rifles from 17HMR up to 300 Win Mags and I LOVE these things...
NEVER had any failures....just saying!

Below is from T/C :
Thompson/Center introduces the T/C Venture, the most value packed bolt action rifle available on the market today. 
Thompson/Center Venture offers a 5R rifled match grade barrel and match grade crown, adjustable precision trigger and a classic style composite stock that puts it in a class all its own. 
A rugged, reliable tool for the outdoorsman, the T/C Venture features T/C's renowned innovation, craftsmanship and cutting edge barrel technology. Guaranteed to deliver Minute of angle accuracy... 1 inch groups at 100 yards!.

This is a NEW rifle and scope.
I have ~$700 in it....so Trades based on this.
Cash offers need to be reasonable.....and those offers will be responded to.
Idiotic offers will be treated with the respect they deserve.
I am retired and trade for fun and to try different guns...so let's keep it fun for all.
++++ The ammo, dies and new cases can be negotiated, since I have NOT included their cost in what I have in the rifle and scope+++++
The Redding Cometition Seating Die was $110.00 alone, at GRAF, Brass was $40.00 at Cabelas, and Redding Body Die was $30 at Midway and the Lee Collet Dies were also $30.00 and Ammo was $44.00 for two boxes..So to replace these...at least $250.00+++++
Trades I would look at...?...most anything except no blackpowder.
I really like, BUT NOT limited to:
.45 acp handguns...but also .357 wheel guns in Carry size, not a 9mm fan Unless it is 
something like Sig Nightrmare....you get the idea.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with it, I'm just going back to ACOGs. Honestly I got this thing a year ago and never even sighted it in.

TR-24G: 1-4x24, also the reticle pic doesn't do it justice. When outside the triangle is crazy bright, but you can dial it down if need be (the fiber optic has a sliding cover). Uses fiber optic and tritium to achieve a battery free illuminated reticle in all conditions. Very nice/sharp optic favored by a lot of 3 gun shooters.

It sits in a Bobro extended QD mount. I've tried pretty much every quick-release mount (Larue, ADM, GG&G), and consider Bobro to be heads and tails above them. No adjustments, just returns to zero every time with the clamping of one lever.

Really looking for cash on this one, will negotiate a little, so if a trade is a must I am open minded, but please make it advantageous to me a little (after all, cash pays bills, not guns (however nice they may be)). Have a great day!"

This is a Colt Gold Cup Trophy chambered in 22lr. For those that aren't familiar it's made by Carl Walther in Germany and imported by Umarex. This is a real nice shooter that's a ton of fun and very accurate with the 5"" barrel. It's the same size as a full size 1911 but not hardly as heavy. It was manufactured in November 2012. It comes in the original hard case with all paperwork, tools, etc. Also included are 2 12 round mags, hip holster, and a new brick of Federal Auto Match ammo to get you started since nobody wants a new toy with nothing to feed it. The gun is in perfect condition with no flaws at all ( looks brand new). Also included are Hogue rubber finger grooved wrap around grips, factory grips included as well. The gun shoots great and has cycled everything I've put through it fine, mostly bulk brick ammo. Only had a couple duds and that was the cheap Armscor ammo. Looking to trade only for now. Some of my interests would be 12 gauge shotguns, small pocket sized 9mm, or 22 rifles either lever action or pump. A Henry Golden Boy 22 lever gun would be awesome. Let me know what you got. Thanks"

The Walther P22 is fascinating in its compact size, while still maintaining all of the features of a full size pistol. Constructed using a modular manufacturing concept, the P22 offers several different equipment configurations. Features include interchangeable backstraps that create an ideal fit to the shooters hand, ambidextrous controls for right or left-handed shooters, an integrated trigger lock and loaded chamber indicator, a magazine disconnect, a hammer safety and firing pin safety for safe and reliable operation, a fixed barrel for incredible accuracy, and a windage adjustable rear sight that combines with an interchangeable elevation adjustable front sight for variations in shooter operations."

This gun was brought back from Vietnam by a friends relative many years ago and just found recently stored away. I have broken it down (easy) to photograph and check parts. It is in found condition and needs to be cleaned. The serial number is a rare C series. Supposedly there are less than one thousand of these guns in the USA, and chromed ones like this one are much rarer. The general cosmetic condition seems to be excellent. Just a few minor pits in the chrome and a slight barely noticeable chrome separation right at the end of the barrel. All the parts seem to be here. Includes one original magazine in stainless. I think that one spring may be very dirty or a bit weak - the really small one for the trigger - because the trigger only fires if a slight amount of pressure is put up on the mechanism. The hammer spring seems to be strong and excellent. Maybe just a cleaning and lube will do the trick, but I am not even close to being knowledgeable on repairs. No signs of rust or major defects. Barrel looks good. Grips are not damaged, and screws are good. I have done a lot of macro photos and have tried to describe this to the best of my ability. So, please ask questions if you need more info - Due to the age and type of gun, I am selling this as-is, unfired, with no guarantees. Do not fire this unless you have had it checked out first by an expert who deems it safe. Make sure you qualify to purchase this gun. I will only ship it to an FFL who will take it directly from me, or, if it needs to go FFL to FFL, there will be an additional $25 cost. Description from website 'World Guns - Modern Firearms': At the end of World War Two, the French army had a mixed stock of pistols. The Police were armed with an even wider array of various pocket pistols made by French companies, as well as some foreign pistols, mostly imported from Belgium and made by FN. Recognizing the need for a more modern and powerful military pistol (which would fire NATO-standard 9x19 ammunition also suitable for sub-machine guns), in late 1946 the French army issued a requirement for a new 9mm military pistol. Several designs were tested and in 1950 the army adopted a design from the state-owned MAS arsenal based in St.Etienne (Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Etienne). This pistol, known as the Mle.1950 or M1950 was broadly based on the pre-war M1935 pistol, strengthened to use the more powerful 9x19 ammunition which also was intended for MAT-49 sub-machine guns. These pistols were made by two state-owned armories, MAS and MAC (Manufacture d'Armes de Chatellerault) between 1956 and 1978. During their lifetime, many pistols were factory refurbished and returned for service. In general, the troops liked these guns for their strength and durability; accuracy was less than ideal, but still acceptable for a military pistol. The M1950 pistol was manufactured by the MAC (Chatellerault) factory between 1956 and 1963, and by the MAS (St.Etienne) factory between 1961 and 1978. The Model 1950 pistol (also designated as Mle.1950 or M1950) is short-recoil operated, locked-breech weapon of all-steel construction. It uses Browning-type locking with the barrel engaging the slide via two lugs made on the top of the barrel, just ahead of the chamber. Unlocking and locking is controlled by the swinging link, which connects the barrel to the frame. The trigger is single-action, with an exposed hammer and a manual safety mounted on the slide. The hammer / sear module is made as a single, easily removable unit, following the 1935-vintage Charles Petter patents. Magazines are of single stack variety, and the pistol is fitted with an automatic magazine safety; the sights are fixed. Manual safety is lever at the left side of the slide, next to the hammer. To put on safety, push the lever up; to set to “Fire”, pull the lever down How to disassemble M1950 pistol: 1) remove the magazine by pressing the magazine release button; 2) check that the chamber is empty; 3) pull the slide slightly back and hold it there; 4) while holding the slide slightly retracted, push in the slide stop pin from the right, then pull the slide stop out of the frame to the left; 5) release the slide carefully and then push it forward and out of the frame; 6) put the slide upside down, and remove the return spring with its guide; 7) remove the barrel from the slide; 8) pull the hammer unit up and out of the frame. Reassemble in reverse order. Subject to prior sale as it is also  listed on gun broker and other websites. Shipping will be between $25-$45, depending on wether your FFL will accept from a private seller. If it needs to go FFL to FFL, the cost will be $45. More pictures can be sent to serious buyers."

Considered by many to be the best concealed wheelgun ever made.  Developed by the legendary Bill Jordan to be the ultimate carry revolver.  

The dash 4 is pinned and recessed.  Truely a great handgun.  It comes with the original Uncle Mikes combat grips.  Everything is solid and locks up tight.  Great shooter. This handgun does have some holster wear.  It is not a collector piece, it is a work horse.  If you are a revolver fan and looking for a great everyday carry gun, this will never fail you.  

This Smith was made in 1980 according to the serial numbers.  It is the sought after 2 1/2"" barrel.  Will shoot any .38 special/.357 mags available.  No shearing and cone is good.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or want additional pictures.  I also have a custom carry holster that could go with it for the right deal.

It's a 2 door, 350/350 car, NO MOTOR OR TRANS. Very straight body, partially sanded for paint, there is one small rust spot in the drivers quarter, otherwise the body is great. Interior is decent, but not perfect, tires/wheels are pretty much junk. Interior isn't great, but I've seen a lot worse, later model seats have been swapped in. All the trim/lights are in the backseat, the previous owner removed them to paint. I haven't measured the cowl hood but it's probably about 6"" and needs finished. Also, it hasn't been parked in a field, that's just where I parked it to get it out of my way on 6/18/13, was previously in a garage. This would make a great base for a drag car, or just paint it, drop a 350 in, and drive it. Asking $900 obo, or trade for guns, gooseneck dovetail trailer with ramps, pre '72 gm that needs motor, or whatever else catches my interest. Call/text REDACTED or email.

The carbine was manufactured from 1985 to 1999.

As the name implies, it was designed as a utility firearm to be used around hunting camps for foraging or defense. It was made in 9mm Parabellum and .45 ACP calibers and can use the same magazines as popular handguns in those calibers, in keeping with a convenient American tradition of having a carbine and handgun using common ammunition. The carbine operates by direct blowback. Usually, the receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope mount. The stock was made of walnut-finished Maine birch.

The Camp Carbine uses a detachable magazine that inserts into the magazine well in front of the trigger guard. The Camp 9 rifle magazine can be replaced by magazines from 59-series S&W pistols. The Camp 9 magazine well is sized for 12-round magazines; magazines with higher capacities extend beyond the bottom of the well. A 20-round magazine was produced, but discontinued in 1989. Numerous aftermarket magazines and drums were produced for both models.

This Model 9, SN 10885230 is in like new condition with the original factory inspection sticker still attached. The metal and wood are flawless and the bore is bright and crisp.
From what I can find via the Serial Number I believe this Model 9 was manufactured in 1990.

The original recoil spring was replaced with a stronger one and new aftermarket recoil buffer is installed.

Included in the sale are; A Barska Red Dot Sight, Leather Sling, 1 Marlin 12 rd factory magazine, 3 aftermarket 20 rd  magazines and 1 aftermarket 30 rd magazine for a total of 5 magazines. I have fired rounds from all the mags with no problems.

This is a fun to shoot Carbine in like new condition.

The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

The detachable magazine was right at the top of the -optimisation list. Here we managed to find the perfect solution – ergonomically ideal and convenient to use. But we have also taken the fans of the integral magazine into account. Either way, it was important to us that our bolt action rifle remained the benchmark in compact design and usability. And we were able to do this without restriction. Nevertheless, the new magazine type is just one of a multitude of innovations that make the R8 so unique. The trigger as a crucial factor in precision and its safe functioning, even under extreme conditions, posed a very special constructional challenge, one that has been brilliantly mastered. In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, we attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. We made all efforts to achieve maximum technical performance without compromising on superior style and design. Our passion for gun making is perfectly reflected in the dynamic but elegant contours of the R8. Unmistakable in its overall design, the R8 sets a new standard in 21st century firearm technology and aesthetics.

British Lee Enfield NO#4 MKI in .303 British. Earlier Century import with the small import mark on the barrel, not the huge billboard import mark found on later guns. Overall a very nice rifle, would rate surplus very good by most standards. Metal retains about 85% finish. Stock shows some dings and handling marks typical of these guns, but no cracks, splits, repairs, or serious gouges. Original ""L"" type rear sight. Bore is very good and gun feeds from the magazine reliably. Really nice shooter and an above average rifle that is getting harder to come by at a reasonable price. collectors item."

The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

UPGRADES INCLUDE

ATI tactical adujustable stock with pistol grip. (for a Home ""d"" shot gun a pistol grip WITH buttstock is better for control, its much harder for someone to wrestle this away in a struggle)

ATI pistol forgrip

HEAT SHIELD with ghost sights. (easy sight picture, with side walls to protect sights)
