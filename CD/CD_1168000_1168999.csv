Rated ""The Best In-Line Muzzleloader Available"" By Jeff Quinn of Gunblast.com

I have hunted with a 10ML-II for nearly ten years and this gun is the only reason I got into muzzleloading.  By shooting smokeless powder, it does not require cleaning immediately to avoid corrosion.  Shoot It, put it away and clean it when you clean all of your other guns.  Using the recommended loads, this gun is deadly accurate.  I have my personal one equipped with a Leupold 3-9x scope.  I use 50gr. of Hodgins 4227 Powder, Hornady XTP Mag .45 caliber bullets with sabots and Winchester 209 shotgun primers. It has a bolt action to load the primer with no tools needed.

Condition: Factory New
Up for auction is a brand new, hard to find Springfield Armory Scout Squad 7.62.I had this gun listed prior and ended it early because I received an email that since I am not an FFL I can not list it as new. This gun is now listed as used but make no mistake. It is new in the box. I removed the gun from the plastic for the first time, and I am the only person who has handled this gun. The gun was removed from the plastic and box for the photos and placed back into storage. The gun has never been fired. I apologize to the high bidder for having to end and re-list the auction,The 18” Scout Squad gives you the short barrel and still maintains the standard gas system of the battle proven M1A (unlike the redesigned gas system of the SOCOM 16) This gun is fast becoming a law enforcement favorite. The Scout comes with a forward mounted optical sight base that provides an excellent platform for the Aimpoint military sight. The gun is also fitted with National Match .062” Military Post and Military Aperture adjustable for Windage and Elevation.

The Scout is 7.62X51mm NATO (.308 WIN), 18” 6 groove 1:11 right hand twist, 2 stage military trigger, and comes with one 10 round magazine.

This is a super nice gun! It was removed from the plastic for the first time today and was only handled so that I could take pictures. I have to say that after holding this gun today, it is difficult to part with it is just that nice!! It is brand new and has never been fired. As you can see in the pictures, this rifle was completed on 01/09/2013. My reserve is very reasonable. If you email, I will let you know the reserve amount.

I will only ship to an FFL, and will need a copy of their signed license as well as their contact information prior to shipping. Please do not bid if this rifle is not in compliance with your state or local laws. If your FFL will not accept this gun from a non-FFL, please add $30.00 to the shipping so I can have my FFL ship the gun.

I am new to gun broker, but feel free to check my feedback on eBay. I have 160 transactions there with 100% positive feedback.

I will accept postal money orders, or paypal  as payment. Item will ship FedEx or UPS with signature required."

261,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1168261,For Sale:  Beretta PX4 45 ACP,"Miami, OK, Oklahoma, United States",$ 549,"Listed On: Monday, September 23, 2013",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction).

I feel like such a failure.  I live near the river and for years I wanted to try fly fishing.  Alas, I purchased a decent fly rod and reel and set off to learn how to cast.

I watched videos, I've read stuff on line to no avail.  So now I will admit defeat and offer this rod and reel for sale or trade.

These shotguns are manufactured in a wide spectrum of models, with different stocks and options, but all are based on same action with patented features such as Tri-bore barrel profile and Pulse Piston gas operated action. FABARM SAT-8 shotguns are gas-operated, semi-automatic weapons. Gas piston is of  ring type, and is located around the front of the magazine tube, below the barrel. The patented Pulse Piston system consists of a polymer brake ring which is compressed between the gas piston and operating rod, which is connected to the bolt group. Upon discharge, this brake provides constant velocity of recoiling parts (regardless of the power of ammunition used) through the self-adjustable friction between the polymer ring and outer surface of the magazine tube - the heavier the load and the higher is pressure in the barrel, the stronger the ring will be compressed and the more friction will be added to the whole operating system. Barrel locking is achieved by single swinging locking piece, which is installed in the top of the bolt. The locking piece engages the notch in the barrel extension, and drops (rotates)down when bolt is unlocked. Return spring is located around the magazine tube. Feed is from underbarrel tubular magazine, which holds 7 rounds (total capacity is 8 rounds, assuming that one round ischambered). Receiver is made from aluminum alloy, and features integral Picatinny rail. Furniture (for end and buttstock) are made from polymer. Barrels are made using FABARM's proprietary TriBore bore profile, and can be equipped with interchangeable chokes or muzzle brake /compensator.

Come on guys I know some of you must have some old 22 rifle laying around that you have no use for, never use, and is sitting there collecting dust...and it isn't some valuable European model. Pump, lever, semi, or bolt is fine. Only condition is that it is safe to use and doesn't require gunsmithing or some oddball trick to make it work.

This is a great Truck gun or perfect for home defense. These are never going to be made again. All FEG receivers were gone three years ago and the AMD parts kits are nearly impossible to find. A true FEG AMD 65 like this one has collector value. 6788twotwo20six8 text for quick response."

Since I've had it for awhile I've acquired a few accessories: 
Blackhawk holster convertible from paddle to belt loop
Kramer IWB horse leather. The horse leather is much thinner than cow and this holster is amazing. 
D&D Leather IWB ""tuckable"". This is the one that is turned a bit in the picture. You can see that the belt loops are connected to a long, stiff strap that connects to the bottom of the holster. It is made so that you can wear it under a shirt which you are tucking into your pants.
Galco single magazine holster
.40 BoreSnake (not pictured)
160 rounds of ammo. About 30 of it is the Federal HST and then there are 2.5 boxes of range ammo.

I need to see a DL and CPL and will need a receipt for my records. Please don't low ball me on this, it's a fabulous gun with top notch gear.

I'm looking to sell this pistol, not trade it. That being said there are a couple items I would consider for partial trade: 9mm range ammo. Aftermarket upgrades for a Ruger 10/22 (Barrel/trigger/stock) or an XDm. AR parts, excluding the lower. If your item isn't on this list then please don't offer it to me. Thanks.

It has the 18.5 inch barrel and 5+1 shot capacity. I have put approximately 150 shells through it, and it has been thoroughly cleaned after each trip to the range. There is no visible wear on the shotgun, and the Marinecote finish is in perfect condition. For $425, I will include the following:

- an unused Hogue forend & stock ($57.99 on Amazon.com)
- the original forend & stock
- a MOLLE scabbard ($25 at gun show)
- a shotgun stock shell holder 
- the original Mossberg manual
- the original Mossberg gun lock
- the original magazine capacity limiter
- a ridiculously long screwdriver for installing a stock

For an additional $50, I will include 235 shells of #7.5 & #8 shot and 35 rifled slugs. Here's the exact price breakdown:

- Remington Gun Club Target Load (#8 Shot, 2.75 inch): 4 boxes of 25 at $6.49 each
- Remington Gun Club Target Load (#7.5 Shot, 2.75 inch): 4 boxes of 25 at $6.49 each
- Federal Target Load (#8 Shot, 2.75 inch): 1 box of 25 at $6.49
- Remington Nitro-Steel High-Velocity Magnum (BB Shot, 3 inch): 1/2 box of 25 at $18.99
- Remington Slugger Rifled Slug Shotshells (2.75 inch): 5 boxes of 5 at $4.99 each
- Federal Premium Vital-Shok Rifled Slug Shotshells (2.75 inch): 1 box of 5 at $5.29
- Less-Lethal Rubber Slugs (2.75 inch): 1 box of 5 at $7.99

Total: $106.14 + 6.75% sales tax = $113.30

This is what you would pay at your local gun store. I haven't listed these at MSRP- this is how much Bass Pro Shops charges. I figure it would be reasonable to sell it for $50 total, which is 44% of the price calculated above.

So here's the deal: I will allow someone to take the shotgun and accessories for $425. For the extra $50, you get all 270 shells for less than half of what you would pay in stores. Price is firm. Don't try to tell me that this shotgun sells for less elsewhere; I am thorough in my evaluation of the selling price, and I have done my research. You can't get a better deal.

For the Model 36, they sought to design a weapon that could fire the more powerful .38 Special round in a small, concealable package.

The only rounds fired were from glock themselves. The instruction manual envelope is not open. I bought it to replace my other aging Glock 19, but at the same time got a great deal on a 19 in FDE. This one just sits in the safe collecting dust. At the same time, I really don't mind having an excess in a desirable firearm. The price shows.

This 19 is all black with factory goal post sights. It comes with two magazines and the speed loader that is given from the factory, along with the cleaning rod.
