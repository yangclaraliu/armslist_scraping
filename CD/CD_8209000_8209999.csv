And my revolver is not for sale, and any offers that do not end with me getting a 4"" barrel 357 magnum revolver will be ignored.I will consider a trade for a similar revolver with a barrel length of around 4'' but it has to be a .357 magnum with a 6 round capacity. If that is what you have, make me an offer! If you offer me singing other than an EAA Windacator, I have a custom kydex OWB belt holster, and a nylon IWB clip holster that I would include with my EAA Windacator. I will also include 4 speed loaders if they do not work for the revolver you would trade.Please let me know if this sounds good!!!"
