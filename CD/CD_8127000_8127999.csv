Reliability and simplicity have made GLOCK® semi-automatic pistols a favored sidearm for law enforcement, military, and civilian use all over the world. The GLOCK 17 is a full-size service pistol, shooting the 9mm pistol cartridge, a standard defense round with proven knock down power. Rough grip texturing on the polymer frame provides a sure hold on the pistol when hands are wet or sweaty, and the enlarged magazine catch is reversible, accommodating left- or right-handed shooters. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of a plethora of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The dovetailed rear sight is drift adjustable and has a white outline around its notch; the fixed front blade has a white dot. Sight acquisition is quick in any light. The GLOCK 17 Gen3 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for field carry, at home, or in a vehicle. The model 17 comes with two standard 18-round magazines.

It was originally developed by Colt for the Air Force as a survival pistol in case of a crash. Colt lost interest and bushmaster took over. A couple thousands were delivered to the Air Force But They were rejected them because of the finish. The Air Force then abandoned the project bushmaster then sold them to the general public. The pistol cannot be shot as a rifle because the ejection would hit the shooter in the facel. The mid section pistol grip and trigger rotates to the side and the gun is hel that way to use. Look at the “B” on the pistol grip and on the safety. It takes standard ar15/m16 mags. Read up on the model for more information. Looking for a reasonable trade. I have more pictures. The pistol is semi automatic.Will trade for: offer. Military surplus  Arsenal AK

Reliability and simplicity have made GLOCK® semi-automatic pistols a favored sidearm for law enforcement, military, and civilian use all over the world. The GLOCK 26 is a subcompact-size service pistol, shooting the 9mm pistol cartridge, a standard defense round with proven knock down power. Rough grip texturing on the polymer frame provides a sure hold on the pistol when hands are wet or sweaty, and the enlarged magazine catch is reversible, accommodating left- or right-handed shooters. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of a plethora of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The dovetailed rear sight is drift adjustable and has a white outline around its notch; the fixed front blade has a white dot. Sight acquisition is quick in any light. The GLOCK 26 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be for field carry, at home, or in a vehicle. The model 26 comes with two standard 10-round magazines.

It was originally developed by Colt for the Air Force as a survival pistol in case of a crash. Colt lost interest and bushmaster took over. A couple thousands were delivered to the Air Force But They were rejected them because of the finish. The Air Force then abandoned the project bushmaster then sold them to the general public. The pistol cannot be shot as a rifle because the ejection would hit the shooter in the facel. The mid section pistol grip and trigger rotates to the side and the gun is hel that way to use. Look at the “B” on the pistol grip and on the safety. It takes standard ar15/m16 mags. Read up on the model for more information. Looking for a reasonable trade. I have more pictures. The pistol is semi automatic.Will trade for: offer. Military surplus Arsenal AK

The L-Frame Smith & Wesson is a medium/heavy frame specifically designed to hold up to prolonged use with full pwer .357 magnum loads, as well as any .38 special ammunition.  The 686 Plus features a 7-round cylinder, giving you one extra shot over a conventional 6-shooter.  A full-length ejector rod shroud puts extra weight out front to reduce muzzle flip, allowing for faster sight acquisition on follow up shots.  The single-action trigger pull on the 686 Plus is light and crisp for precise shooting; the double-action pull cycles the cylinder smoothly for rapid fire.  Stainless steel construction provides corrosion resistance and low maintenance for prolonged holster carry, or while camping in the backcountry.  The synthetic rubber grip provides a sure hold in any weather, and helps to absorb recoil."
