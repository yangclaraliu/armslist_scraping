I purchased this gun new from Kames in Canton a year ago and it has been sitting unfired in my safe since then.  I'm selling it to fund a different Baer model.

As I said, this is the 5 inch Ultimate Tactical Carry model.  It has the fixed night sights, single sided safety and the thin Cocobolo grips.  The sharp edges have also been nicely blended which I find to be both functional and good looking.  This gun also has the blued finish.  Les Baer builds an incredible 1911, but their blue finish seems to be hit or miss at times.  I can honestly say that the finish on this gun is perfect.  I see a lot of Baers with different shades of finish on the frame and slide when they are new, but the bluing on this gun matches perfectly.  No scrapes or scratches anywhere, as you would expect from a new gun.

The frame to slide fit is perfect, and the lockup is tight as a drum.  Anyone familiar with Les Baer 1911s knows how tight some of them can be, and this one is no exception.  As with most of the semi-custom manufacturers, Baer recommends a 500 round break-in period for each of their guns, after which they smooth out considerably.  Whoever buys this 1911 will have the pleasure of getting to know the gun during the break-in, as you will be the first to fire it outside of the factory.

I have many close-up high resolution pictures uploaded to my Photobucket page.  Unfortunately, Armslist does not allow clickable links in their ads, and some people have still not figured out how to copy and paste, so send me an email and I will answer any questions you have as well as send you the link to the pictures.  It's very rare to find a high-end 1911 on Armslist that is not for sale by a dealer, so get it while you can and skip the taxes.  Buyer must be over 21 years old, have a valid Ohio drivers license and be able to legally own a firearm in the state of Ohio.  CCW holders are preferred but not required.  If more than one person responds to the ad, I will give priority to anyone with a CCW.  Thanks for looking."

I bought this gun from a neighbor when her husband died and it had not been fired.  We searched for the original box but it was not found.  I bought everything he had in his safe, including the safe.  I put 4 mags of WWB through it and then sent it to Sig so they could replace the dead NS and do their SSP work (it makes no sense to send a gun back to Sig for NS w/o having the SSP done, as they include it for nearly free.)

There are no marks on this gun anywhere; the slide and frame are perfect.  The front strap, trigger guard, high points (this gun has never been in a holster) are all perfect.

Norinco are one of the top 2 leaders on the market for their SKS rifles. These rifles are rugged, and reliable. Just like the AK series of rifles, these rifles can take one helluva beating and still go bang when it's all said and done with.

This SKS shoots a 7.62x39 round. It has a Fiberforce Composite Dragonov stock, a sling, and a Leapers 3x9-40 scope. This rifle has been meticulously cared for by me, it's owner. Cleaned after every trip to the range, and never firing it for hours on end. I have this gun looking its best and performing at it's full potential every time I took it to the range. I fired rougly 200 rounds through and the original owner fired around 2-300.  so altogether it's save to say only 500 rounds tops have been through this rifle. The magazine is a fixed 10 round magazine, however there are companies like Tapco that make higher capacity mags at low cost.

The bore shines like a mirror, no pitting nor any erosion on the rifling which is where it really matters when it come to guns. It has all matching numbers except for the stock.

I have not used the leapers scope as I am a iron sights kind of guy, so the scope will need to be zeroed, I'm adding the scope with the gun at no additional cost to you.
Also with the rifle you will get 1000 rounds of Wolf WPA 123grain Hollow-point ammunition, which from experience is some of the best matched ammo to this rifle. This rifle would be a great hunting rifle, and is an awesome shooter. Great for all ages, super easy to clean and take down, and super easy to take care of.

I am asking 900 for the rifle, the scope, and the ammunition. 

CASH ONLY, FACE TO FACE, NO LOW BALLERS. 

I look forward to your replies. Happy Hunting!"

There are only 3,300 miles on the bike but I am riding it for the time being until I sell it.. Both tires are like new with only 1,000 miles on them. The bike has never been wrecked, but there are a few dings and scratches and something green in the paint that is either something splashed on the tank or some kind of discoloration caused by gas getting on the paint. There are no cracked fairings or bad road rash, but I do think the bike has been tipped over in a driveway or parking lot. There is slight scuffing on the tips of things like the front break lever, right bar end, and exhaust.

This is a great starter bike, I have had two of these over the years. Do not be afraid to buy this as your first bike. I will be happy to work with you to show you the basics of riding for the first time.

Less than 3100 Hawkeyes were produced making these highly collectible. S/N for this one is 1555. These were made only during 1963 and are getting harder to find each year in this condition. This example was made in 1963 and is all original with the correct taps for scope mounting on the barrel. Bore is in excellent condition, bright and shiny and strong rifling. It is in excellent mechanical condition as well as having an excellent finish. It does show some very slight handling marks and the only discernable blemishes are a wear spot on the upper forward ejector rod housing and some small dings on the lower let side trigger guard and some light marks on the bottom right grip panel.

This firearm has come a long way from the ""sporting"" version that they come as when they are imported into America. The Saiga 12 is constructed entirely of steel and is an incredibly robust, reliable and powerful machine. Chambered for 3"" shells, it is capable of firing the hottest 3"" shells or low-brass 2 3/4"" with just a turn of the gas tube valve. Barrel is fully chrome-lined, which not only significantly increases barrel life but requires less maintenance than a barrel of plain steel construction. List of modifications and aftermarket parts equipped are as follows.

Tapco USA Made T6 Telescopic stock with recoil pad, single-point, two-point sling mounts and a pistol grip storage compartment.

Tapco USA Made forearm with 3 removable picatinny rails mountable on the left, right & bottom of the forearm.

Magpul USA Made AFG II (Angled Foregrip Second generation)

DPH Arms USA Made door breaching thread-on muzzle brake

SGM Tactical (Surefire Gun Magazines) USA Made 10 round magazine

BreakO USA Made mercury recoil reduction system (installed in Tapco stock), recoil is easily half of any standard pump shotgun.

Carolina Shooters Supply USA Made gas tube shroud

Correctly polished action for increased reliability which also provides significantly smoother functioning and feeding of the weapon.


Original stock, forearm and factory Izhmash matching serial number 5 round magazine are also included with this package.

Weapon has cycled hundreds of rounds flawlessly from cheap Federal Multi-Purpose 8 shot to 3"" 1.25 ounce foster slugs. I have cleaned every inch of the internals of this firearm after each time it was fired, action was also kept properly lubricated at all times.

I paid $18 each bag of 50 so not trying to guoge anyone here but I already have about 1000 rounds of reloads that I made when I first bought my reloader so I absolutely would not sell any of those since I am not that confident in my reloading skills since I am so new to it, so please don't ask.

JUST TO BE CLEAR!!!  THE AMMO I AM SELLING IS PROFESSIONALLY RELOADED, THE STUFF I HAVE FOR MYSELF WAS RELOADED BY A ROOKIE (ME) AND I WOULD NEVER SELL THESE SINCE I WOULDNT WANT TO HURT ANYONE IF I DID ANYTHING WRONG.  BUT WHAT YOU WOULD BE BUYING IS EXTREMELY RELIABLE AND PROFESIONALLY RELOADED AMMO!!!!!!

I guess these were just an impulse buy since it is so hard to find 9mm but I really don't need them so I know there are people out that could really use this ammo more than me so just trying to help out.

If you want them I am at Southfield Rd near downtown Allen Park.

Price is $40 FIRM each bag is $18 x 2=$36 just give a whopping $4 profit for my time, otherwise I will just keep them and shoot them someday.  Please I will not sell just one bag, not worth the hassle!

The bad part is I haven't gotten around to installing the rear gears. I have the gears and install kit brand new in the box G2 performance gears. 
There are a few small leaks, but it's only the silicone gasket material...I installed the tranny pan after a fluid and filter service when it was 10° out so the silicone didn't form properly....same with the diff covers, very minor but mentionable.
One rear wheel is slightly bent so at high speeds you can feel the shake. $150 for a new wheel from what I've found.
Also the fuel gauge doesn't always work. 

Other than that it's a monster and gets a lot of attention. My loss your gain, with a little more effort you could have a seriously solid trail rig/rock crawler."

This was originally a ban rifle.   I had the barrel concentrically threaded and I installed a Krebs muzzle adapter.  This allows the use of the original Bulgarian Compensator that is currently installed.  I have an original FSB, but have never bothered to install it.

This gun is well used, but runs flawlessly.  I have put, at least, 4 tins of 7N6 through this gun. 
It was cleaned correctly each time to ensure that all corrosive residues were removed.

This was a numbers matching kit when it was build by Arsenal

I refinished an area on the bottom of the receiver behind the pistol grip.  The finished popped off during an extended shooting session.
The refinished area has been through several shooting/cleaning sessions since and has held up well.

The gun is being sold with it's original equipment, NOT as it is configured in the pictures.
The original gas tube, fixed stock and pistol grip will be reinstalled as well as the original safety lever.

The ultimak, Surefire light/mount, E. German sidefolding stock , SAW grip, sling , Enhanced safety lever and PA micro dot are NOTincluded.
