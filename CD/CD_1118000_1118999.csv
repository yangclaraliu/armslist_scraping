This is a copy of the H&K MP5 and shoots .22lr.

This gun has been fired and comes in the box and has the M4 style collapsible stock making this gun an awesome looker and awesome shooter. The box was opened and assembled and shot 110 rounds or so. I have the exact same gun that I regularly shoot with and it is amazing accurate with a good red dot on it and I can hit 5"" groupings at 150 yards with cheap ammo. The 110 round drum makes this gun a wicked force to be reckoned with. The way the government is acting, it sounds like these 110 round drums are going to disappear fast to never come back!!!!

This gun is awesome and hard to get right now because in addition to the 110 round drum there are 22 round mags that are available for them. This a fun gun with lots of adjust-ability for all kinds of shooters. From plinking to small varmint shooting to range shooting this gun can do it all!

Asking $700 cash or willing to trade for a good condition guns prefer 357 mag or 22LR  but will consider others. Please let me know what you got and how much you are expecting in value for the trade. Pics would be great too!
I also have some .22lr ammo I will sell to the buyer of the gun if you need some to play with.
 I travel to Indianapolis weekly so if time is flexible I can meet you in Indy."

It also features the LEATHER INTERIOR which is more durable and old school than the cloth and also CANNOT be purchased at the Washington Arms Collectors Gunshows. Leather goes for an extra $10 dollars online so with shipping this ended up costing me $40, so I'd be happy to part with it for $30!

Since I had never seen the leather version in person, I stuck my own J-frame (SW 642) inside to test it out which caused some subtle leather streaks on the interior (see pics) which will no doubt happen when you stick for snub nose in here too, so don't let that detract you from the purchase, nor the ""8CH"" written in sharpie which comes on EVERY Remora holster you buy.

From Ruger-

 THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.
The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

I inherited one of these..but have had nothing but problems with feed..went to dump it at a local gun shop and the guy refused to consider a buy due to the feed issue's he has had in the past with these.. the pos sold for 54 bucks new..so this is a last call to see if any brand of ammo might just feed if anybody knows of any..of if you have one and corrected the feed issue i would like to know how.

I have worked on a couple of them. They are very ammo and magazine sensitive. Many of the parts are made of pot metal/Zinc diecastings which also doesn't help. You might try CCI mini-mag solids just loading 5 rounds in the mag at first. One of the ones I worked on had a bad mag that would only work if it was partially loaded. The feeding angle from the mag to the barrel is so extreme that HP or flat nose bullets have a tendency to jamb.

Have had several and found the same pointers repeatedly ... do not ""fill"" the mag completely. And each that I had ate CCI best of all the stuff that I had tried through them. 

I figured that with the mag. it has to do with the force and speed that the top round is presented (perhaps having to do with the speed of the ""memory""of the spring extending).

Tied to that is how quickly the bolt cycles from the expended round, etc. When CCI's did not work for me ... I cannibalized for odd parts if needed."

Brand new complete S&W M&P15 lower in  pristine condition.

Upper fired one 30-round mag flawlessly and thoroughy cleaned (I used a different lower to keep this rifle as new as possible and still try it out.) Only selling to consolidate ammo types. Other may want variety in their arsenal.

Complete rifle with almost 1500 rounds (1470). The 5.45x39 ammo is still readily available. And yes they make non corrosive ammo for slightly more for those who do not clean their guns like they should. I have included some with this gun.

Although the ammo is available, these rifles are not. Very hard to find a complete S&W. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. Please just compare apples to apples. Complete M&P15R to complete M&P15R, that is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of their rare discontinued status these will continue to climb in value even after the market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson is pleased to announce the M&P15R Rifle (along with the new Upper Receiver Assembly). This new rifle is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifles come with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

With Colt carry handle, bolt carrier group, and charging handle, just add a lower and you have a rifle. Colt A2 buttstock also available if needed. 

If you know what this is, you know its a find. Chrome lined and chrome chambered 1/9 twist barrel with consistent diameter throughout (no turned down areas to warp in heat and throw off accuracy). Most accurate carbine out there.

All Colt parts makes for a quality rifle ready to clip onto your lower and head to the range with confidence.

These uppers combined with a bolt group and carry handle sold for close to $1000 even before the current chaos, and just recently an identical one went for $1700 that gun auction site for some reason. That's just silly money, and I certainly don't expect that much out of it, but I am not dumping it off to some lowballer either, so please be reasonable.

I am willing to take any reasonable cash offers and even offers of partial trade.

Car is in excellent condition, but I just got another car, so it's time for this to find a new home.

Maintenance includes: Uppwer and Lower Intake Manifold Gasket (Around $1200, but this is the only weak point on these motors), brakes, wheel bearing, motor mount, a valve in the transmission, oil has been changed by me using synthetic every 6k miles.

The Bad: The radio backlight is out, and hard to see (Common problem on these cars). Normal interior and exterior wear.

The car is really reliable; it was just time to replace it with a new one. Average MPG is around 24.5 mixed hw/city. Garage kept in Fort Wayne up until about 4 months ago. The traffic there is very light compared to Indy, so the miles were a little easier traveling at a consistent speed vs the stop and go down here.

Send me an email for some more pictures. I've got about 30 of them or to set up an appointment to look at the car.

Will consider full/partial trades (or even cash on my end) for: Motorcycles, things that go boom, ammo, surround sound systems, or other NICE things. For the right trade, I may even give you money.
