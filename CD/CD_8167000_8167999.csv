The M&P Bodyguard semi-automatic pistol also comes equipped with front and rear sights, dovetailed into the slide, for use when the laser is not needed. The Crimson Trace sight sends out a red laser dot that can be seen in bright daylight as well as in total darkness. Laser sights greatly facilitate hitting targets in poor lighting, from awkward shooting positions, and in stressful personal defense situations. The Smith & Wesson M&P Bodyguard Semi-Auto Pistol has a frame constructed of reinforced polymer, and a stainless steel slide finished with a non-reflective black Armorite® hard coating, making the Bodyguard extremely resistant to corrosion caused by carrying the pistol daily next to a perspiring body. Fish scale serrations machined onto the slide provide a non-slip surface to grasp when loading or unloading the firearm. The M&P Bodyguard is hammer fired, with a DOA (Double Action Only) trigger; a manual thumb safety prevents the pistol from accidently firing. Comes with 2 magazines.  Flat Dark Earth polymer frame Comes with Crimson Trace laser sight Stainless steel slide with Armorite finish Back up front and rear sights Double Action Only trigger Fish scale slide serrations Manual thumb safety"

This a unique sight with a large chevron and red dots. Comes with a 1/3 and low mount, box and tool. This would go great with the magnifier I have listed. You can read more about it below or on Primary Arms website$160 FTF in the triad areaHere's some additional information.Primary Arms and Holosun have combined forces to bring you the power of the patent pending ACSS® CQB reticle in a red dot sight for the first time! The problem with dot sights is that a large dot is great up close but less useful at distances beyond 100 yards, because the dot becomes too large to aim with precision. A small dot used in conjunction with a magnifier fixes that problem, but is slower to acquire in close range snap shooting. The ACSS reticle uses a large chevron that the eye picks up very easily for up close shooting. At longer distances, the tip of the chevron is an infinitely small aiming point perfect for taking precise shots.The ACSS features three BDC dots underneath the chevron, allowing an unprecedented 600 yards of bullet drop compensation in 7.62 NATO or 5.56 NATO calibers. Auto ranging and wind leads are also incorporated into this smart reticle. A CQB horseshoe grabs the eye instantly for close quarters shooting and also approximates the spread pattern of 00 buckshot at 25 yards. The retical for this sight is a central 2 MOA dot, centered in a 65 MOA circle with four positioning points. The diameter of the circle reticle represents approximately 5'5"" at 100 yards 170cm at 100m.The HS503G is a proven micro dot sight with an auto-on function that switches on the power with a slight movement of the sight. It comes with a 1913 Picatinny base which is removable, revealing an Aimpoint Micro-compatible base underneath. It also comes with the lower 1/3rd co-witness riser mount shown in the photos. Primary Arms Exclusive! This is the only place to get Bullet Drop Compensation to 600 yards, wind holds and auto ranging all in a micro red dot."

Military surplus MEP-002a 5KW Diesel Generator on trailer with ASK (acoustic suppression kit). Underrated for continuous duty. I upgraded the fuel filters and oil filter to spin-on filters.

Trailer uses a pintle hitch.Aditional Images: https://flic.kr/s/aHsmhUaif8Video: https://youtu.be/MVMERuha9No This unit is a 5 kilowatt, 60 Hertz Generator Set. It consists of a revolving field alternator powered by an air cooled diesel engine.  Output voltage is switch selectable. These outputs are via the output lug connections. 120 VAC 52 AMPs single phase, 2 wire 120/240 VAC 26 AMPs single phase, 3 wire 120/208 VAC 17.3 AMPs three phase, 4 wire All at a Power Factor (PF) of 0.8 There are also two 120 VAC 15 AMP on-board convenience outlets next to the control panel. Engine. 1. The engine powering this generator set is a 2 cylinder, 4 cycle, air cooled engine, with a 70 cubic inch (cu. in.) displacement. A mechanical governor keeps engine speed at 1800 revolutions per minute (RPM) under rated load conditions. 2. Fuel is supplied either from this unit's self-contained fuel tank or, by using an adapter, directly from a 55 gallon drum or other source. 3. Two 12 volt ""wet cell"" batteries in series supply power for a 24 volt electric starter and for glow plugs, located in the cylinder head, and for two air heaters located in the intake manifold, used for cold weather starting. An alternator located beneath the blower wheel, and completely separate from the main alternator, automatically recharges these batteries when the engine is operating. Generator. The generator on this set is a four pole, revolving field type. Alternating current, supplied by the exciter assembly, is rectified and used to create the four pole, revolving field. A solid-state voltage regulator assembly automatically adjusts this current to obtain a constant (±3%) voltage in the main stator (output) windings. Controls. All operator controls and indicator gauges necessary for running the engine generator set are located on the control panel. On ASK equipped generators, an oil pressure gauge is located on the engine under air intake door and a fuel level gauge is located on the fuel tank. The speed control is located behind a small flap on the rear panel assembly below the control panel. Controls for selecting output voltage are located on the output control box. Generator Set Electrical System The generator set's electrical system consists of two distinct systems: (1) The DC system used primarily for operating control and excitation, and, (2) the AC output system to supply power to the load. The DC source consists of a 24 volt battery set (BT1 and BT2) that is kept charged by a battery charging alternator (G2) and voltage regulator rectifier assembly (A5). Fuse (F1) protects the alternator from overload. Circuit breaker (CB2) protects the battery charging system from overload. Slave receptacle (J15) permits an alternate external supply to be connected to the battery circuit. Dimensions and weights: Generator Only Overall length 58 in. (147.4 cm.) Overall width 36 in.

Based off of the GLOCK platform, ZEV pistols use ZEV’s own manufactured upper mated to a highly-modified stripped GLOCK frame fitted with ZEV parts. ZEV Technologies slides are precision machined from 17-4 stainless steel. The tolerances are held extremely tight for increased consistency in barrel lockup and slide to frame fit, attributing to exceptional accuracy and performance. ZEV Technologies slides are also lighter than GLOCK, allowing for less perceived recoil when cycling, which reduces fatigue and attributes to a flatter shooting gun for faster follow up shots. The RMR cut allows for the use of the Trijicon RMR red dot sight, while co-witnessing iron sights. Alternatively, the cut can be covered with the ZEV RMR Adapter plate for a seamless appearance when using iron sights only. This slide, mated to the ZEV match grade stainless barrel, results in an extremely accurate, yet reliable pistol.The lower utilizes a highly modified Glock frame which has been professionally textured; the trigger guard is also undercut to allow for a higher grip on the gun. Both features allow for improved recoil management while ensuring the pistol is extremely comfortable in the hand. ZEV Technologies pistols also feature the Fulcrum trigger providing a crisp, clean, trigger pull with a very positive and short reset. The trigger is also fully adjustable for not only weight, but also length of pull (via overtravel and pre travel adjustments). The magazine release is oversized for quick access without the need to shift one’s grip on the pistol. Barrel-DLCZEV Technologies Match Grade drop-in Glock replacement barrels feature extremely tight tolerances and are manufactured with pre-hardened burnt bronze stainless steel (416R) that was originally designed for use in Match Grade rifle barrels. This material provides high tensile strength and toughness to withstand typical chamber pressures while still being highly corrosion resistant.ZEV™ Match Grade barrel bores are some of the most precise in the industry. The threaded barrels come with 1/2 x 28 standard suppressor thread pitch. Every barrel is double honed (rough and finish) until a minimum surface finish of 16 RA is reached. During this process the barrels are held to a final dimension of +/- 0.0002"" for consistency and accuracy.The barrels are cut rifled and 100% inspected for groove dimensions and broach finish. Slide Cut- Spartan CutThis visually stylish slide was created for a special project ZEV did a few years ago. Since its creation many people have asked us to offer it as a signature cut. The wait is over! This slide takes some of the best and most requested features from our other slides and combines them into one. Its angled front and rear serrations offer plenty of grip without getting hung up on your holster and the small top serrations help to reduce glare. The window cuts on the top edge of the slide round out the slides highly customized look. Sight Cut- ABSOLUTE CO-WITNESS RMR CUTCNC Machined RMR Mounting position in front of the factory location of the rear sight. has positioning posts that hold the RMR at a center zero point on the slide. Slide comes with proper mounting screws for the RMR of any model. Co-witness sights are suggested for usage with this cut configuration such as the ZEV Co-witness sight set. Blue Loctite recommended for proper sight retention.includes Rmr (7) / magazine extensions / Pelican case with zev Tech embroidered on front"
