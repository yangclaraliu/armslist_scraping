It can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45C combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Like stagecoaches, swinging saloon doors and Pony Express riders, there are many innovations of the Old West that have long faded from use and live on only in Western movies and history books. But there are still a few frontier staples that were so effective and ahead of their time that they remain in use today. Take, for instance, the intimidating octagonal barrels commonly found on the repeating rifles of that period. These heavy-duty workhorses sported added mass and extra weight to aid in heat absorption, making them the forerunners to the bull barrels used on modern target and varmint rifles."

The 2"" barrel has a full underlug to protect the ejector rod during concealed carry unlike the Colt snubbies. Cock the hammer for precision shots or go double action for close fast use. I used this for target practice with .38 SPL ammo to prevent wear and tear on my Airweight but it would be a good home defense gun as well. It looks very good and has always worked perfectly. If you want a .357 Magnum snubby, I respectfully suggest that you TRY a light weight before you buy. A STEEL snubby will absorb some of the snap that many find unpleasant in the plastic or aluminum .357's.

I have taken several high mega pixel pictures that can be copied and enlarged. This will give a better description of the rifle's true condition than I can. These pictures will show details the naked eye can't. And in most cases will show flaws worse than they actually exist. These pictures were taken outside in natural sunlight. There may be some specs of dust that reflect the sunlight. If you have questions or need additional pictures PLEASE contact me.

As far as I know these are not available anymore. This particular rifle has a threaded barrel as well. This rifle was never offered with a threaded barrel, but I originally bought 2 10/22s, one was a standard synthetic model with the threaded barrel. I did that for the sole purpose of swapping the barrels and then sold they synthetic rifle. This rifle also comes with a Boyt Custom canvas bag. In addition this has a DNZ game reaper 1"" mount for mounting your optic. If you have never used one of these mounts they are fantastic. They are very lightweight, streamlined, and solid. I am asking a bit of a premium for this because I don't think you will find another 10/22 like it out there. This is a great classically styled suppressor ready backpacking rifle (and it runs great with subsonics). Great for your son or daughter's first rifle as well. I also have another auction for a Leupold 2-7 VX-1 Rimfire scope that served very well on this rifle, please check it out if you are interested. If you have any questions please ask."

The reticle is a Fine Duplex. This model has been discontinued and replaced by a 33mm model, the Fine Duplex reticle has been replaced by a regular duplex or LR duplex. Personally I like this one because of the compactness and lighter weight. The new model is 9.9oz and this one is 8.5oz. In addition the 28mm obejective allows you to mount it closer to the bore. The scope has very clear glass with a bright image and is once again is very light weight. This is a perfect scope for a light 10/22 or really any 22. Capped turrets, fully coated lenses, and Leupold's LIFETIME warranty. This scope originally retailed for over $300. The lowest price I can find on one now is $230 and I can't even tell if it is in stock. The new model retails for $179 for the duplex reticle. The LR duplex reticle goes for $249. I will undercut the new model and do $175, this scope is like new, lighter weight, more compact, and has a more precise reticle."
