It is a compact, self-contained laser aiming system that features three functions: Visible Aiming Laser, Infrared Aiming Laser, Infrared Illuminator. The battle-proven LA-5B/PEQ is a weapon-mounted system that easily attaches to any M1913 Picatinny Rail with a standard rail grabber mount. The The co-aligned infrared and visible aiming lasers are easily adjustable; making for a simple zero procedure (zero one, and the other moves with it). Utilizing the same basic footprint as the AN/PEQ-15 the LA-5B/PEQ is one of the most versatile, lightweight, and compact aiming lasers available.The exceptional functionality of this unit gives you everything you could want in a single compact package. Its design seats the unit low on the rail, and wraps around the Picatinny for a snag-resistant, low profile. This is accomplished by utilizing a recessed rail-grabber mount. The recessed controls are located on top of the housing for easy access in the field with gloves. The body housing is constructed of a high-density/ impact polymer and is extremely robust. The material takes a lot of weight out of the unit, which is appreciated during long hours of carrying a rifle. The LA-5B/PEQ also features a rear-facing battery compartment which allows the user to remove the battery (we all know not to store our high-end NV and laser equipment with batteries installed, right?) without removing the unit. The battery cap is spring loaded, allowing for the system to absorb more recoil from automatic weapons. A molded-in lanyard loop rounds out the back. Windage and Elevation for the aiming lasers is controlled by easily accessible knobs for quick adjustment in the field. Adjustment for the Illuminator is done with tiny flat head screws that require a tool. This is because the illuminator does not need to be adjusted in the field as much as the aiming lasers.The main power differences in the LA-5B/PEQ compared to the AN/PEQ-15 are found in the visible laser and infrared illuminator. The higher power visible laser provides much better performance under direct sunlight. The higher power infrared illuminator allows users to reach out to much greater distances, using the illuminator as a pointer.The LA-5B/PEQ is heavy weapon and machine gun hardened.Manufacturer:L3/ Insight TechnologyNSN:5855-01-533-0555Dimensions:4.7″(L) x 2.8″(W) x 1.6″(H)Weight:7.5 oz. w/ BatteryPower:One (1) 3V DL123A BatteryBattery Life:>3 Hours (Dual High)Waterproof:6 Meters for One HourWarranty:1 Year WarrantyIR Laser Spec:—————————————————-IR Laser Class:1 (Low), IIIB (High)IR Laser Output:0.6mW (Low), 25mW (High)IR Laser Beam:0.5 mRad DivergenceIR Laser Wavelength:820nm – 850nmIR Laser Range:>600 Meters (Low), 2,000 Meters (High)Visible Laser Spec:—————————————————-Visible Laser Class:IIIR (Low), IIIB (High)Visible Laser Output:4.5mW (Low), 20mW (High)Visible Laser Beam:0.5 mRad DivergenceVisible Laser Wavelength:625nm – 665nmVisible Laser Range:>150 Meters (Day), 2,000 Meters (Night)IR Illuminator Spec:—————————————————-IR Illuminator Class:IIIR (Low), IIIB (High)IR Illuminator Output:3.0mW (Low), 80mW (High)IR Illuminator Beam:1-105 mRad DivergenceIR Illuminator Wavelength:820nm – 850nmIR Illuminator Range:>600 Meters (Low), 4,000 Meters (High)Includes:Soft Carry Case, Operator’s & Unit Maintenance Manual, Quick Reference Card, One (1) 3V DL123A Lithium Battery, Allen Wrench (3/32 Hex), Illuminator Diffuser, Aiming Exit Port Cover, Remote Cable Switch, Velcro Tape Fastener, Optical Pattern GeneratorsManufacturer’s P/N:ATP-100-A47, ATP-100-A47"

I'll also include the bipod and sling!Next up is a Russian VEPR in 7.62x39.  Has a full conversion done.  Circle10 AK metal triangle stock wrapped in 550 Paracord.  Magpul MOE+ rubber grip.  Dinzang Arms bullet guide.  SLR Rifleworks 13.5"" handguard.  Authentic Chinese Cheese Grater gas tube (these are very rare!).  Also has a Manticore Arms Nightbreak flash hider.  The VEPRs sport a 1.5mm receiver and a heavy 16.5"" RPK barrel. This rifle has exatly 20 rounds through it to make sure it cycled after the conversion.  Ran through a box of ammo without a hiccup.Finally is ammo and mags.  Now I'll do my best here, but counts are an educated guess and on the low side.  Meaning I have more than what I'm listing here.  First off, I have at least thirty eight (38) magazines for the AK-47 platform.  Roughly thrity two (32) are 30 round capacity, brands ranging in Magpul/Tapco/Russian/Romanian/Polish.  The other rest range in 5/10/20 round capacity, and are mostly Romanain.  I also have roughly two thousand (2,000) rounds of ammo.  Most of it is 154 grain soft point, with the rest being 122/123 grain hollow point and 122/123 grain full metal jacket.  There are also about 57 rounds of Federal Fusion, some premium white tail deer hunting ammo.  No, I'm not going to count out every single round of ammo for you.Now, let's talk possible trades.  Only things I'm really honestly interested in would be a CZ Bren 805 pistol in 5.56x45, CZ Scorpion Evo 9mm, an MP5 in 9mm, a VEPR in .308/7.62x51 with a 16"" barrel, a DSA FAL in .308, a PTR-91 in .308, a Bushmaster ACR in 5.56x45, or a Sig 556xi in 5.56x45.  Not really interested in anything else.  I just threw a price on the post. Let's talk cash, the price is just a starting point.  I have the box for both rifles as well.  Armslist made me edit my pics. So I'm sorry about the bad quality and editing. I have better pics ready to be sent through email or text!"

Only the frame color is different from the standard model and the fde frame model.    A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.     Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters."

Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was."

These rifles were used for training troops on the CETME rifle and share the same sights, overall length, muzzle device, sling loop, grenade launcher and bayonet lug. The FR8 was converted from the Spanish army's stockpiles of large ring Mauser 98 rifles to chamber the new 7.26 nato standard round at the time. These are safe to fire with 150grain 7.26 NATO ammunition.  Included is the sling and CETME bayonet.The rifle has wear consistent with its use as a training rifle with some dings to the wood. There is a repair to the stock at the wrist which appears to be done while in use with the Spanish military as the wood in the repair matches later FR8 rifles. Rifling is strong and bright with no issues with the barrel. The metal is finished with a dark parkerizing that is quite rust resistant, finish shows minor wear on the bolt and muzzle device.I have owned this for a couple years and do not take it out much, have put less than 100 rounds through it myself.

Nickel plated as well, 2.5 to 3 inch barrel, black grips, presumably hard vulcanized rubber or maybe plastic. The finish is fairly rough on this as well, bore looks toast.
