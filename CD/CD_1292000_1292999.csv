Selling my used Browning Special Sporting Clays Edition over/under. It's in 12 gauge and has 30"" ported barrels. Has a right hand palm swell, mid bead, wide sporting rib, adjustable trigger for LOP, 14.5"" lengh of pull. Comes with the Browning case shown, 5 extended choke tubes (invector plus SK,IC,M,IM,F), and a choke wrench. This Browning is in great condition. Still has its beautiful deep blueing and wood finish. There are several knicks and scratchs from normal use. It's an absolute joy to shoot. Action opens and closes smooth like butter. Only selling because I upgraded to a Perazzi.

The SCAR-L, for ""light"", is chambered in the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the SCAR-H, for ""heavy"", fires 7.62×51mm NATO. Both are available in Long Barrel and Close Quarters Combat variants.

The FN SCAR systems completed low rate initial production testing in June 2007.[11] After some delays, the first rifles began being issued to operational units in April 2009, and a battalion of the US 75th Ranger Regiment was the first large unit deployed into combat with 600 of the rifles in 2009.[12] The US Special Operations Command has currently cancelled their purchase of the Mk 16 SCAR-L and are planning to remove the rifle from their inventory by 2013. However, they plan to purchase 5.56 mm conversion kits for the Mk 17, supplanting the loss of the Mk 16.[13] The SCAR is now one of the competing weapons in the Individual Carbine competition which aims to find a replacement for the M4 Carbine.[14]

Ok... Most places still sell ammo at reasonable prices. 380ACP $15-$18   9mm $12-$16   .40 $15-$18   .45 $20-25
Why are people posting ammo for so much? Your only hindering the supply and causing the price to temperamentally to jump. Ammo is coming back in stock slowly and soon all of you that just went out and bought hundreds in ammo hoping to make a buck soon will have to take a hit. I work for a major retailer and ammo just hit our shelves this past week. I was able to get some 9's for 12 dollars a box. A box of .40 for $15 and just last night was able to get some 22's 100 packs for 8 dollars! There was and is no ammo shortage. Just stupid people trying to make money off stupid people. And for the people buying this ammo... Why not just shop around? Are you planning to go to the range in the next day that you have to have ammo now? The dumbest people are the ones who justify this stupid buying as ""My rights might be taken away and that's why I'm doing it."" Why? Ammo was never the cause of concern. They are after the guns. If you don't have anything to shoot ammo with why should they care?
Don't take it from me... All I can say is I have ""enough"" ammo and never spent more then 18 dollars on a single box and that was for my 45's. All my ammo acquired during this ""ammo scare."" I know no one will care but figured I should let people know that ammo is coming back. Go ahead and keep stock piling. People like me will only keep buying ammo before you can and selling it to people who need it at the cost to me and not 10 dollars over. 9's Should never be over $15 unless they are +p or JHP. We want our freedom to own firearms in peace but sites like this prove that ""we the people..."" are just as greedy as the fat cats in the capital. Please show respect and show your fellow shooters respect. If ammo is this expensive people will stop shooting. Less shooters = less support when the gun ban bill hits the floor of congress soon. Also means less people to buy your over ammo in the future.
Go ahead and flag this. This is just a friendly wake up call to everyone trying to make a dollar and for the ones getting soaked. Let the stores recover. There will be ammo. Only people who should be scared is congress when we stand up to them if they try to take our guns away."

222,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1292222,For Sale:  Blackhawk STOMP II Medical Aid Backpack - Tactical ACU,"White Bear Lake area, Minnesota, United States",$ 135,"Listed On: Thursday, May 2, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am offering a deal on this brand-new in the wrap complete with hang-tags ACU STOMP II Medical Backpack by Blackhawk Industries.
I ordered this and misjudged the size....it is a bit larger than I need and more suited to Paramedics and Emergency First Responders.
It would make a great kit for a Doctor, Paramedic or Medical Professional to keep n their vehicle for emergencies.....these are the same bags our Armed Forces Medics use in Combat. It has extra straps and is ""Jumpable"" but unless you are a ""Paratroopin' Paramedic"", it is unlikely you will ever need to jump with this bag.....but it does keep everything snug inside! (NOTE: Mine is empty and does NOT include any supplies....but it is a complete pack assembly).

Information about this bag is here on the Blackhawk website: http://www.blackhawk.com/product/FireEMS-STOMP-II-Bag,1625,1504.htm

It has two large zippered pockets full of elastic bands, pockets and pouches, zippered compartments, etc. to hold all your first aid gear. Mine is Military ACU (urban digital camo) as I like the pattern and it looks cool. Mine is complete with the extra red and blue handled removable pouches for organizing other meds and instruments - see page 2 for details about the pouches here:
http://www.blackhawk.com/catalog/Medical-Packs-Gear,1504.htm

It has padded backpack straps and a back-stiffener (closed cell foam) for unbelievable comfort, as well as a chest strap and a waist/hip strap.....you can load this up and carry it all day comfortably....but that is what Blackhawk is known for.....the finest quality Mil-Spec gear on the market!

And my price? Just $135.00 cash - a whole lot less than others....see here on Amazon.com:

http://www.amazon.com/BLACKHAWK-S-T-O-M-P-Medical-Coverage-Jumpable/dp/B000EWN8DK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=REDACTED&sr=8-2&keywords=stomp+ii

As you can see, my price of $135 is the best deal you will find on this type of brand-new bag on the internet, and mine is new in the plastic, complete with tags and all straps intact. it is perfect in every way and the price is even better!

I have several more pics - let me know and I can email them to you!

Thanks for looking and Thanks to our Troops for our Freedom!"

Whether you are buying your first AR-15 rifle, or need a simple and effective carbine, the DPMS A3 Lite 16 is for you. This carbine earns its name with its 16"" light profile barrel, A3 style flat top upper receiver, and 6-position collapsible stock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.5 lbs. The simple A3 upper receiver, with its built-in picatinny rail, allows for the addition of almost any sighting optic you can imagine. The 16"" barrel although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. And the collapsible stock makes this carbine very handy and compact.

Additional Description: The DPMS Panther A3 Lite 16 could be the perfect semi automatic AR-15 rifle. A 16"" lightweight barrel, 30 round detachable magazine and the fabulous DPMS Pardus collapsible buttstock are just some of the highlights of this black anodized beauty. Whether you are buying your first AR-15 rifle, or need a simple and effective carbine, the DPMS A3 Lite 16 is for you. This carbine earns its name with its 16"" light profile barrel, A3 style flat top upper receiver, and 6-position collapsible stock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.5 lbs. The simple A3 upper receiver, with its built-in picatinny rail, allows for the addition of almost any sighting optic you can imagine. The 16"" barrel although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. And the collapsible stock makes this carbine very handy and compact. We have added a Midwest Industries Quad Rail, a Magpul Rear pop-up Sight, and an additional 30 round MagPul Gen 3 magazine to get you started.

Additional Description: The DPMS Panther A3 Lite 16 could be the perfect semi automatic AR-15 rifle. A 16"" lightweight barrel, 30 round detachable magazine and the fabulous DPMS Pardus collapsible buttstock are just some of the highlights of this black anodized beauty. Whether you are buying your first AR-15 rifle, or need a simple and effective carbine, the DPMS A3 Lite 16 is for you. This carbine earns its name with its 16"" light profile barrel, A3 style flat top upper receiver, and 6-position collapsible stock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.5 lbs. The simple A3 upper receiver, with its built-in picatinny rail, allows for the addition of almost any sighting optic you can imagine. The 16"" barrel although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. And the collapsible stock makes this carbine very handy and compact. We have added a Midwest Industries Quad Rail, a Magpul Rear pop-up Sight, and an additional 30 round MagPul Gen 3 magazine to get you started.

Front AND Rear night sights for your AR-15, made by the well known and trusted Trijicon company (makers of the ACOG). They fit on flip up BUIS as well as fixed carry handles and A-post type sights. If you can remove the rear peep and front blade, these will work for you! Front blade has a generous green dot, outlined in white to make it easy to see during the daylight. Rear dual peep appeture displays two green dots, also outlined in white, making it quick and easy to center the front sight for super fast target aqquisition. I bought these a year ago, so the tritium (sourse of illumination) gasses are fresh and bright. These work great for stealthy, night time work because you don't need a flashlight in order to aqquire your target thru the sight picture. Personally, I found using a flashlight with the night sights best because the torch leads the way AND the sights still glow-in-the-dark brightly since they are positioned behind the light source. Really makes for a nice setup for shooting at night for night-time Ops, or just shooting targets in the dark!

The Russian Vepr rifles are built at the Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant (Molot) in Russia. They are built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

Ok... Most places still sell ammo at reasonable prices. 380ACP $15-$18   9mm $12-$16   .40 $15-$18   .45 $20-25
Why are people posting ammo for so much? Your only hindering the supply and causing the price to temperamentally to jump. Ammo is coming back in stock slowly and soon all of you that just went out and bought hundreds in ammo hoping to make a buck soon will have to take a hit. I work for a major retailer and ammo just hit our shelves this past week. I was able to get some 9's for 12 dollars a box. A box of .40 for $15 and just last night was able to get some 22's 100 packs for 8 dollars! There was and is no ammo shortage. Just stupid people trying to make money off stupid people. And for the people buying this ammo... Why not just shop around? Are you planning to go to the range in the next day that you have to have ammo now? The dumbest people are the ones who justify this stupid buying as ""My rights might be taken away and that's why I'm doing it."" Why? Ammo was never the cause of concern. They are after the guns. If you don't have anything to shoot ammo with why should they care?
Don't take it from me... All I can say is I have ""enough"" ammo and never spent more then 18 dollars on a single box and that was for my 45's. All my ammo acquired during this ""ammo scare."" I know no one will care but figured I should let people know that ammo is coming back. Go ahead and keep stock piling. People like me will only keep buying ammo before you can and selling it to people who need it at the cost to me and not 10 dollars over. 9's Should never be over $15 unless they are +p or JHP. We want our freedom to own firearms in peace but sites like this prove that ""we the people..."" are just as greedy as the fat cats in the capital. Please show respect and show your fellow shooters respect. If ammo is this expensive people will stop shooting. Less shooters = less support when the gun ban bill hits the floor of congress soon. Also means less people to buy your over ammo in the future.
Go ahead and flag this. This is just a friendly wake up call to everyone trying to make a dollar and for the ones getting soaked. Let the stores recover. There will be ammo. Only people who should be scared is congress when we stand up to them if they try to take our guns away.
Another thing I keep seeing bulk ammo. The bucket of 1400 Remington 22's ran me $80 at Cabelas! Not $100+! The 500 packs run about 30-40. Anything more is a scam."

I put ONLY 20 rounds through this weapon to ensure functionality and sight in the scope, then I cleaned and lubricated it up. Its brand spanking new!! Colt is a perfect mil spec weapon with a lifetime warranty; high end stuff here.

Included with the weapon is a beautiful Bushnell red/green dot scope with 4 different sight reticles. You can select a red dot for higher light situations or green for lower light with 10 different brightness settings, and 4 different reticles to choose from; everything from dots to cross hairs. I also purchased a 1/2'' picatinni riser so the Colt flip up rear sight and front sight align perfectly through the scope. If you dont want the scope and riser mount, I'll knock $50 off the price.

Sale includes original box, paperwork, cleaning kit, two 20 round Colt magazines, and sling.  I also purchased a front grip that goes on the picatinni rails that I havent put on, you can have that too.

I collect only high end guns and this one fits the bill beautifully. Between the gun, tax, and scope, i'm taking a loss on the weapon. Suppliers are squeezing dealers right now, so even a stock 6920 model is going to run you well north of $1500 -1600.. This is a great buy for the money.

Buyer must have a PTP/PTC and be willing to sign a bill of sale. Cash only and buyer must pickup locally please. Price is firm give or take a few dollars, I'd rather just hold onto it than take a greater loss on it; I don't need the cash, there are just other things I would rather have.

Please email me with any questions, but my guess is if your looking at this ad you already know what you are probably getting, and appreciate harder to find high end guns.
