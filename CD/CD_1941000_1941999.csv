I will try to put pics on here in the next day or so. I am asking $400 for it, or I may be interested in trades, just let me know. E-mail me for more info. Thanks."

Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations

READ THE HISTORY OF THE SIDE ARM::::::

Two similar but distinct French military pistols carry the designation ""model 1935"", the model 1935A and the model 1935S. Both were designed to compete in the 1935–37 French military trials conducted by the Commission d’Experiences Techniques de Versailles to select a new sidearm. While similar in concept and design due to the specific requirements of the trials committee, they share no parts in common.


The Pistolet automatique modèle 1935S (Automatic Pistol Model 1935S) or Modèle (Mle.) 1935 S was a semi-automatic pistol chambered for the 7.65mm Longue cartridge. It was designed by Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Saint-Étienne (MAS), a French government arsenal. It was a competitor in the 1935-37 French military trials to select a new sidearm, losing to the SACM 1935A. However, as France prepared for the looming war in Europe it became apparent that SACM production was inadequate to meet the military's needs. In 1938 additional contracts were given to MAS to produce the 1935S, and all production of the commercial MAB model D and MAPF ""Unique"" model 17 pistols was diverted to the military. MAS began initial delivery of the 1935S to the French military in early 1939, but production ceased after only about 1404 pistols were built when German forces occupied Saint-Étienne in the summer of 1940."

NEWS RELEASE

California Attorney General to Feds: No Handguns For You

Apparently, Attorney General (AG) Kamala Harris has changed California State Department
of Justice policy and is now limiting federal law enforcement agents' ability to
acquire handguns. The AG says the feds can only buy firearms listed on the Roster
of Handguns Certified for Sale(like
the rest of us).

Understandably, federal law enforcement officers aren't happy about it. Welcome
feds, to the California disarmament festival.

California law restricts the types of handguns people can acquire through licensed
firearm dealers (PC 32000). As backwards as it sounds, before most Californians
can acquire a handgun, that firearm must not be considered ""unsafe."" To not be considered
""unsafe,"" handguns must pass performance tests and have certain features that (in
theory only) make the firearms allegedly safer (PC 31910). Most problematic for
the California public is the recent development that before any semiautomatic pistol
can be added to the Roster of guns approved for sale they must be equipped with
""microstamping"" technology (PC 31910(b)(7)). Starting a couple months ago, this
easily circumvented engraving technology is now required on new semiautomatic pistols
before they can be added to the approved roster (pistols submitted for safety testing
when ""microstamping"" was certified, on May 17, 2013, can still be added to the Roster).

California citizens are just as frustrated as federal law enforcement officers with
the situation. When the roster of available pistols they can purchase dwindles down
to a limited few - because manufacturers are refusing to implement ""microstamping""
- federal law enforcement's objections will grow louder. And if pending legislation
(SB 293) concerning ""smart guns"" passes and is signed by the Governor, federal law
enforcement will also be forced to choose from an even more limited number of models
... just like civilians.

Forgive us mere civilians if we aren't completely sympathetic to the plight of the
feds.

The Feds predicament stems from a recent (and correct) change in the Attorney General's
interpretation of existing California law. While California law restricts the sale
of ""unsafe handguns"" by dealers, there are some exceptions to the restriction. The
exception used by most law enforcement agencies and officers, and the one used until
recently by federal law enforcement officers, was the following:

The sale or purchase of any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being
concealed upon the person, if the pistol, revolver, or other firearm is sold to,
or purchased by, the Department of Justice, any police department, any sheriff's
official, any marshal's office, the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, the California
Highway Patrol, any district attorney's office, or the military or naval forces
of this state or of the United States for use in the discharge of their official
duties. Nor shall anything in this section prohibit the sale to, or purchase by,
sworn members of these agencies of any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable
of being concealed upon the person.

Pen. Code, § 32000(b)(4)

You might notice, as did the California's Attorney General, that federal law enforcement
officers are not mentioned in this exception! The ""Department of Justice"" referred
to in this section is the California Department of Justice, not a federal agency.
So the AG's analysis is correct: federal law enforcement is not exempt from the
""unsafe handgun"" restriction.

Welcome to the party guys!

Hey, maybe the feds can try to take advantage of a number of other exceptions to
""unsafe handgun"" sales restriction.The private party exception (PC 32110(a)) allows
""unsafe handguns"" to be transferred between two individuals who reside in California.
That works sometimes. In fact, maybe federal law enforcement officers can convince
their friends in the Sacramento Sheriff's Office or Los Angeles Police Department
to purchase firearms on their behalf, as a few officers from those agencies have
been doing. But oops, turns out that's illegal. (See the following links concerning
the federal criminal case filed against members of the Sacramento Sheriff's Department,
and articles concerning the LAPD illegal transfers).
Okay, if that won't work maybe the federal officers can take advantage of the ""single
shot pistol"" exception (PC 32100). Some civilians have tried this, by finding a
single shot version of ""unsafe handguns"" they want to acquire, then modifying it
after purchase. This voids the warranty, but we do suggest that feds buy these
before the legislature closes this exception as well (AB 169 is currently in the
appropriations ""suspense file"" but may be brought back at any time).

No doubt this screwing of federal agents will be ""fixed"" by the legislature when
and if federal law enforcement agencies find a state politician with a compassionate
ear. Despite the law's potential change, the question remains: why is law enforcement
allowed special privileges to acquire firearms to defend themselves and their families
when the general public can't acquire the same firearms? We are all at risk. So
why limit anyone's right to access the best tools to defend themselves and their
families? Why the double-standard?

Barring those few exceptions we, the self-defense civil rights activists of California,
welcome federal law enforcement officers to the State of California disarmament
festival. We thank them for their service. We look forward to them joining us in
the limited exercise of our Second Amendment rights, or fighting for its expansion
... for all of us!"

I am sure this was a relabeled NEF or another manufacture of that era. It is in used condition, some of the bluing is worn and it is missing the recoil pad, it had a slip-on pad but it fell apart when I cleaned it. This has been sitting in my safe for a long time and I don’t think I have ever even shot it. Everything works well on it, the release, trigger, and hammer. I am just looking for something that I may be able to use a little more. I am open to just about any other type of firearm, just let me know what you have and we will go from there. I live in St. Pete and would like to me local if at all possible. If interested please email or text me at 727-515-7076. Thanks for looking"

Yes there is a difference the Glock 30s has a 30sf frame and a Glock 36 slide which is a little slimmer makes for a perfect carry weapon even with a full mag (10 rounds) you do not even know it is there .
One of the best features is it will accept Glock 21 magazines in a pinch (they stick out about a inch) but if you own a 21 presto you have extra magazines to use if need be.

Choose from Black, OD Green, or Flat Dark Earth.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A."

There has never been a higher demand for self defense handguns than there is today. The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can’t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well. We wanted to give our customers the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power.

Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.

The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.

If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed."
