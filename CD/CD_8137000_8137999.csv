It’s a very smooth bolt action and very smooth double hook trigger with chrome lined barrel and matching low “five”digit serial #s. It was pulled from original box a couple years ago and has been a safe queen ever since. Has two thirty rnd mags and a cleaning rod. This gun is basically perfect for the collectors other than not having the original cardboard box.  It is a slant receiver.. I carefully backed out the two stock screws to make sure since I knew it would be asked. For the asking price.. I do have a whole set of furniture including a real wood pistol grip that has not been finished/stained. You would have to modify it yourself or have a professional fit it for the slant receiver if you wanted to get rid of thumb hole stock. This thing is beautiful and I really hate to give it up but some things are more important.  If it’s still listed it’s still available. If interested leave a contact number.. If you’re really interested you will answer a blocked caller ID phone call , if not then pass it up.. I understand if you don’t want to answer but I’m tired of the bullshit scammers!

I’ve had some 1911 experts look at it, and have been told that the slide is a type 2 Remington Rand slide, the magazine is correct for the period, and the frame appears to have been decommissioned by the military and then re-manufactured, certified safe and issued a new serial number by the BATF. It was then purchased from a specialty gun shop in Idaho in the early nineties. You can see a faint line next to the serial number in the last of the pictures where the frame was welded, and you can see a shiny spot on the L hand side of the slide in the first picture where the frame and slide aren't perfectly aligned.I have shot this pistol, to see how/if it would fire: it does indeed fire, cycles just fine, and is accurate. Spent cases are slightly ballooned near the base, however. Pics have been added of spent rounds. Own a piece of history: $450. Please, no lowball offers. Happy to work a trade for a Glock 43."

Surplus arms lower receiver
Milspec trigger group (unknown branding)
Unbranded compensator (18 hole pattern)
Magpul MOE buttstock (commercial spec), lower reciever grip and BUIS 
Free floating handguard (NOT a real noveske handguard, the keymod attachment points DO NOT work) fitted with (real) Noveske handguard covers
Surefire Scout light M600 (Tan/FDE, has thumb switch and pressure switch hardware, flush and offset mounts)
Holosun HS403C red dot optic 
Extended release on charging handle
Magpul MS1 sling (setup as a two point sling, works wonders, rifle hardly moves when shouldered with good tension on sling)
 
I also have a pair of 20rd magpul pmags, a few USGI steel 30rd mags.
Looking to get $1600 for this rifle, I believe this is a fair price, the rifle operates smoothly, very flat and doesn't malfunction. The optic is great, saves on needing to change out batteries all the time and I have yet to find a flashlight that is brighter than the surefire on this rifle, it is like having a micro sun at your disposal. Contact Murray at 360-903-3512 if you want more pictures or more information on the rifle. Sale will be conducted at an FFL in Vancouver WA, you pay the transfer fee."

Sig Sauer P290RS—9mm
 
The Sig Sauer® P290 RS EDC (Every Day Carry) is an extremely reliable and concealable semi-auto pistol that offers the ballistic advantage of the battle-proven 9mm cartridge. The P290 RS EDC features a durable, corrosion-resistant, lightweight polymer frame, and a Nitron™ coated stainless steel slide. The pistol operates with a locked-breech, short recoil action (instead of blowback) that locks the action closed. Slide serrations enhance the shooter's ability to pull the slide back for loading and clearing the action. The DAO (Double Action Only) trigger allows the shooter to get shots off quickly without having to remember any safety switches during high-stress personal defense situations. The P290 RS also has restrike capabilities in the case a cartridge does not fire the shooter simply has to pull the trigger again. Textured and replaceable grip panels, and textured front and back straps provide a non-slip grip for enhanced fire control. The Sig Sauer P290 RS EDC Semi-Auto Pistol comes with contrast sights, dovetailed to the slide. The P290 can be carried comfortably all-day—everyday, keeping it within reach for situations that call for rapid deployment of well-placed shots from a more than adequate cartridge for personal defense.
