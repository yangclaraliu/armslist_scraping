The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators."

 EVD-3000 Hand Held Explosive Detector

 The EVD-3000 is the world's first and most recognized portable explosives trace detector with comprehensive explosives detection capabilities. Ready to operate in only 60 seconds, the EVD-3000 is the only hand-held device capable of detecting the presence of plastic and high-vapor-pressure explosives, including taggants. If portability, quick detection and clear results are crucial, then this is the explosive detector needed. The EVD-3000 detects traces of both particulates and vapors, allowing for non-invasive searches of luggage, mail, vehicles, documents and containers.

 Features
• Proven: The EVD-3000 is the only hand-held detector capable of detecting traces of plastic and high-vapor-pressure explosives - giving clear results you can trust.
• Flexible Power Sources: The EVD-3000 offers you the choice of a 12-volt DC rechargeable battery pack, external battery pack and AC adapter, making it convenient to use in virtually all application environments.
• Sensitive and Selective: The EVD-3000 can detect and identify minute traces of C-4, TNT, Dynamite, PETN, Semtex, EGDN, DMNB, RDX, and Nitroglycerine.
• Portable: The EVD-3000 is self-contained and lightweight (less than 7 lbs.) and comes in a fully equipped, rugged carrying case, ready to use when and where you need it.
• Easy-to-Use: The EVD-3000 is ready for operation within one minute from turn on. A simple push of a button automatically activates the sampling and analysis mode. Results are displayed on an easy-to-read LCD making the EVD-3000 ideal for all non-technical personnel. 

Operation
The EVD-3000 is flexible and easy to operate, offering both vapor and particulate sampling without the use of a radioactive source or external carrier gas. Vapors are sampled directly via the sampling nozzle. Particulates are sampled by swiping a suspected object with cotton gloves and then transferring the traces to a screen which is then inserted into the sampling port. This dual capability enables users to select the most suitable method of sampling for the explosives of interest. The EVD-3000 starts processing samples immediately and gives results in just seconds. All results are indicated on the LCD and by a volume-adjustable audio alarm, making detection a simple one-step process.

Trying to see if anyone is interested in my .243.  It is a Savage with the AccuTrigger, Nikon 3-9x40 BDC optics, telescoping adjustable height 6-18 inches bipod and possible hard case.  I bought this thinking it is the rifle I wanted for game hunting in the area.  However I have had little to no time to get out and do the hunting I want.  Additionally, I think I might try my luck on some larger game this upcoming hunting season.  The rifle is in New condition, only having approximately 40 rounds down the barrel.  It is the synthetic black stock and black barrel.  I will include a link for the specifics from Savage, and for those that are truly interested I will gladly take a few pictures.  Anyhow, only selling to local area, and prefer someone that has some sort of proof of legally able to own a firearm (CC permit).  I have about a half box of rounds I will send with it.  This is a highly accurate rifle, just not getting the use that it should.  I am able to easily hit 500m targets at the local range.  I haven't been over to the Cheyenne Mountain Shooting complex to test it further than that distance.  Email works, text is preferred, and like I said, after checking out the link and you are still interested, let me know and I will take some actual pictures.  PS I have only had this firearm approximately 3 months, and it was custom ordered in the Left Hand configuration.

**Update** In a effort to move this rifle, I am now willing to accept PARTIAL trades.  To be honest I am only interested in a couple things..............an acoustic guitar, I have preferences, and if you offer walmart junk I am going to turn it away.  I also have Verizon cell service, and would be willing to PARTIAL trade for a new smartphone for my wife.  Once again, this would be a partial trade offer.  Either a guitar + cash to make up the difference, or a Verizon smartphone + Cash.  Could be a good deal for the right person.  We can discuss details further if you make an offer.  Let me know what you have, send pictures, and what you are feeling is fair on your end cash wise.  Thanks for looking!

According to Hornady, at this weight the velocity is 2,360 ft/s (720 m/s) and energy is 3,536 ft·lbf (4,794 J). This cartridge is used for CXP2 and CXP3 types of game (medium and heavy animals) and is very popular in Europe for wild boar.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

The tanto point is even stronger than comparable tantos because Kershaw makes the tip thicker and gives it a tough flat grind. The result is an über-strong tip that takes on the toughest piercing tasks with no fear. But the RJ II isn’t done yet.

This knife offers a full range of cutting edges. The plain edge is ever so slightly curved, giving the RJ II slicing capability—something not all tanto blades offer. In addition, the blade is partially serrated to make cutting through tough or fibrous materials a breeze. The blade is made of 8Cr13MoV stainless steel that’s tough, wear resistant, and takes a keen edge. For a distinctive look and enhanced performance, the blade is coated with titanium carbo-nitride.

The RJ II also features 3-D machined G-10 handle scales and a secure stainless-steel locking liner. It opens with one-handed ease thanks to the SpeedSafe assisted opening system. Access it with the built-in flipper or thumbstud. The pocketclip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry. Tactical looks and a multifunctional blade combine in the RJ II—also available in a larger size as the RJ I.

 Technical Specifications
•2-Step Serration
Serrations assist in cutting through particularly tough or fibrous material, such as rope or cord. The Kershaw 2-step serration is a more aggressive style of serration.

•Flipper
May be used on either manual or assisted opening knives. The “flipper” is a protrusion on the back of the blade that the user can pull back on, or flip, in order to move the blade easily out of the handle.

•SpeedSafe®
Assists you to open any SpeedSafe® knife quickly and easily with a manual push on the thumbstud or pull back on the flipper; built into many Kershaw best sellers.

•Liner Lock
Locks the blade open during use; one side of the knife’s steel “liner,” the steel plate to which the handle scales are attached, moves into position behind the blade to securely lock it open.

•Reversible
Pre-drilled holes in the handle enable the user to change either the tip position or the side on which the knife carries.

I started working on it but the opportunity came up for me to purchase another rifle that I'd like to have.  I decided to sell this SKS once I complete the project.

So... that got me thinking, instead of just making it how I like it, maybe I'd post it for sale now and give the purchaser options so it could be finished according to their preferences.

So far it's been shortened to 16.5"" with the barrel crowned to 11 degrees.  Debating on putting a muzzle break or flash hider on it (or leaving it with the target crown), I'll leave this up to you.  It's currently in the raw (bare steel); I was going to Parkerize it, but figured the purchaser may want it blued, so I'll leave that option up to you.  I should note, when I say blued, I don't mean that ""cold blue"" rub on chemicals, I mean hot blueing (blueing salts at 290 degrees type).  

I was in the middle of a trigger job, but the pins on the trigger are kind of a bear, couldn't get them punched out for the life of me.  Drilling them out would probably alter the tolerances of the holes, so I plan on just getting a replacement trigger group.  I may or may not do a trigger job on it, depending on the purchaser.

I have a wood stock, was looking at the Tapco stocks, but figured someone may want a side-folder or the strikeforce.  

For optics, I can get the rail cover picitanny rail pretty cheap but don't believe those hold zero as well.  I'll most likely be getting the mount that replaces the rear site.  Again, this is up to you.

If there's any interest, let me know.  I'm sure we can negotiate a price.  I can either do the work and hand it over, or if someone is interested in taking part, we can do it together.  This will be a really nice rifle.

I'm not a bubba (I do pretty good work if I do say so myself... my friend who wanted my other SKS would probably agree).  If you have any questions regarding any of the modifications, feel free to ask.  even if you're not interested in the rifle, I don't mind answering questions or giving you tips so you can do work on your own guns.

Lastly, if there are any other mods you may want that I didn't mention, we can talk about them (i.e. bolt closed magazine insertion).  Hope to hear from someone who will appreciate a nice rifle and the blood, sweat, and tears that goes into a quality custom job."

I have only used the gun a few times over the years myself, as for condition I would rate this gun very good, I am going by NRA standards for rating firearms. Looking at it with my eyes, I see no major scratches, I can see no rust, only some minor scratches around the front area of the butt, then finish looks to be in good condition, only minor wear as it has been in a holster the entire time I have owned it. I am the 2nd owner of this gun, as said was owned by a former police officer.  I have described the gun to my best ability, the gun performs and works just fine, no issues, has never been restored, repaired. I will post a picture here, if you want more pictures please email me and I can email more photos."

Matte Black... Not that new, shiny, cheap-looking black.

All Steel And Aluminum - No polymer on this Rifle except for the grip, stock, and handguard

An Original WINDHAM, ME Bushmaster (XM15-E2S) Now know as Windham Weaponry  This Rifle is NOT made by THE NEW BushMaster and NOT made in NY!!


This is one of the great ones... it's lean and mean and made for shooting.

(I've actually been at the range shooting my Bushy with guys who were shooting their ""High Quality"" builds and they couldn't even get a full mag out without something jamming or sticking and this Bushy just pounding down range.. eventually they would just shoot mine.. nothing worse than a $2000 AR you just built that's not worth the gas it would take to set it on fire! hahaaa )

The Bones:

*A True 14.5 inch barrel with pinned front to make it Legal for Civilians (a hair over 16 inches)- Can be Un-Pinned and Flash hidden but it's awesome the way it is... 

*Gun-Fighter Tactical Charging Handle Latch 
*Ejection Port Cover
*Shell Deflector
*Forward Assist
*M4 Feed ramps
*Chrome Lined
*M203 Grenade Launcher Cut-out
*Fixed Carry Handle

*** ""MPI"" FULL-AUTO BCG ***  Yes... Full Auto BCG. (Heavy)

* ""MPI""  Magnetic Particle Inspected
*StainLess Steel firing pin/ Stainless Steel Bolt ""rings""
*Phosphate Coated & Shot Peened (Bolt and Carrier)
*""No Leak"" Gas Key w/ Proper Staking of the gas key screws
*Upgraded Buffer (Heavy, solid slider.. no rattle)

*6 Position Stock (Black)
*Over-Sized Carbine Length Hand Guard- faster cooling- I have the small one's if you'd rather have those...
*Aluminum ""Gloved Hand"" Trigger Guard- (Have the straight one too ) 
*Bottom Rail 

*1 30 round and 1 10 round (original BM Magazine) 
*30 rounds of Steel Case 
*Original BM case made by KolPin

This things eats up cheap 55 grain steel-case with no problems at all!! So you can buy all the Wolf and TulAmmo you can afford with no worries...


All you guys talking, ""I can go get THIS from HERE for this PRICE..."" DO IT. Then you'll find out exactly how stripped and cheap those ""Great Price"" AR's are. I understand that most of you don't know an AR from an AK (everybody starts somewhere) but this is one sport where you're stupidity WILL cost you... and cost you a lot! And at the same time Trying to be the Cool Kid with the most expensive stuff isn't necessary either. 

AR's are like Tattoos... Good Tattoo's aren't cheap and cheap Tattoo's aren't good.
My rifle's price is cheap because I want someone else to enjoy it, but by no means is it cheap... I'll put it up against any Colt, DD, Noveske, ect.. any day of the week. And if you wanna bet some money on it... ""I'll be your huckleberry.""

N.I.B. (Unfired/Old Stock). This weapon is pristine! You will not find a new SCAR 16S better than this. It has been stored in a gunsafe with a dehumidifier and is in perfect condition. The weapon you are bidding on is the one pictured. It comes with a 30 round magazine, flip-up sights, box, manual, rails, etc (listed below). It also comes with an ATN MK350 Guardian Night Vision Scope (also new), a tactical extendable bipod, and 500 rounds of Remington Law Enforcement 62 grain ETSP. You will not be disappointed. It is milspec all the way around, and definitely the ultimate pig-hunter. This is the semi-automatic version of one of the newest rifles used by U.S. Special Operations personnel as well as numerous law enforcement agency tactical teams. The 16S has a huge advantage over the 17, due to the availability and cost of .223/5.56 NATO vs the significantly more expensive and allusive .308/7.62 NATO. The value of this weapon is far better than a Colt 6920. It is gas-piston operated - a pricy upgrade for a regular AR-15 style assault rifle. It has four quad rails for accessory mounting (at 12, 3, 6, and 9). Additionally it has ambidextrous safety and magazine releases, as well as the ability to mount the charging handle on either side. We accept cashiers checks, money orders, We will ship upon receiving payment and signed copy of FFL. We ship firearms UPS or USPS."

You asked and we listened. The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v5 is perfectly adapted for end-users who plan on attaching the ever popular red dot, holographic or magnified optics to their firearm. The slick top monolithic upper receiver provides operators with valuable top rail real estate for accessories that fit their shooting needs.

Daniel Defense was always apprehensive about releasing a factory made firearm with a set or clap style gas block. Therefore the Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v5 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.
