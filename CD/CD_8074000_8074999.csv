More fun than laughing at a liberal with a my little pony hair do at a anti gun protest . It comes with 5 polish magazines and a 75 round Korean drum . Russian hand guards and original wood furniture . If interested contact through arms list and I will send detailed pictures . This one is only going to go up in value and once they have their way the price for one of these will sky rocket , use your tax dollars to invest in this one and you won't be disappointed . One sweet AK bump gun."

I think we all know the fde versions don’t pop up on armslist very often and I was thinking of going .300 blackout with this but the kit is just to over my head to justify $1200 for a conversion. Very low round count. Less than 200 rounds total! It will come with a BCM vertical grip and the stock grip. IT WILL NOT INCLUDE THE HK GRIP SEEN IN THE PIC. It will come with the stock grip. I do also have an Ergo grip specifically cut for the Scar from Parker Mountain Machine I can include for $40. It will also come with a Leupold Mark AR Mod-1 1.5-4x20mm Matte Firedot-G SPR scope on a Leupold scope mount. It’s a very nice powered scope. I have the box for the scope and the original box for the Scar 16s, and it comes with the stock fde mag, sling, and accessories in the box. As far as trades Id consider a Sig Rattler, Sig MCX Pistol in .300blk, Tavor of X95, MP5, Omega Gideon Shadow, Hk Mark 23, other sub gubs like CZ Scorpion. Mainly looking for more nice subguns but my total value is $3000. MP5’s are running $1800, so an MP5 and $500 won’t cut it and I’m not looking to keep the scope. It’s a package. Not looking for any AR’s, Shotguns or boltguns. Serious inquiries only and i don’t need help with pricing. You will need to add cash or a great optic to any of the above trades. Be fair with your trade value or just don’t waste my time. REDACTED"

(Shipping is not included in price.)We accept Cash, Mastercard or Visa for payment.Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design. Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.Black Sheep Price is $363.78 + Spare Magazine $29.95.
