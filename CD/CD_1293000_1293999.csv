Harry Reid shoots down Feinstein gun-ban bill

**FILE** Sen. Dianne Feinstein seeks to reimpose weapons bans that expired in 2004. The California Democrat’s current bill would go further than her 1994 law, which was sunsetted. (Associated Press)
By Cheryl K. Chumley -The Washington Times Tuesday, March 19, 2013
Sen. Dianne Feinstein emerged from a closed-door meeting with Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday — but her ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines didn’t.

Mr. Reid turned down her attempt to bring her ban on 157 different weapons and ammunition clips aboard the Democratic Party’s comprehensive gun bill, Politico reported.

“My understanding is it will not be [part of the base bill],” said Mrs. Feinstein, California Democrat. “I would like to [see it moved], but the leader has decided not to do it. … You will have to ask him [why].”

Her bill instead will have to go forth separately or as an amendment — and that means it’s probably not going anywhere.

Conservative blog Hot Air characterizes its chances for passage by itself as near zero and counts supporters at about 35.

Mr. Reid’s decision was likely aimed at bolstering the party’s chances to pass some gun control, even if it’s not as restrictive as many on the left would like. As Hot Air noted, Mr. Reid can now play the two bills off each other and make the case that he kept out Mrs. Feinstein’s more controversial version.

Mr. Reid is also likely looking at the 2014 elections, when several Democratic Senate seats are open for contest in conservative states, analysts say.

You can buy a complete AK 47 rifle from classic arms for 799.00 and that comes with 4 30 round magazines and a tactical carrying case, and oh ya they're in stock.  The magazines alone a worth 120 dollars or more, plus the tactical carrying case is probably 50 bucks.  That means the gun sells for around 600+/-, and it is built and ready for the range.  For those that haven't built an AK47 from a parts kit......it is fun, but far more expensive than you would think.  You will need to buy numerous amounts of tools and dies to complete your build.  There are some shops out there that will build your AK's for you but it will cost, typically upwards of a hundred dollars. Ak's are going to come back down in prices just wait and be patient.  When the part kits comeback down where it makes it cost effective go ahead and build.  Oh ya don't forget your 922r compliance costs when you build.

For your consideration is this very rare M1C sniper rifle, originally built during WWII. 
Non-import rifle, as I purchased this from the CMP auction several years ago. Will sell with the CMP Certificate which proves it is an M1C, as well as a letter of authenticity from the nation's leading M1C Researcher. 
Sale may include an original  USGI replacement parkerized receiver bracket (scope base) if final price is close to what I want for this rifle.

Happy to provide more info on request to serious enquirer's. Please do a little homework, unlike one ""gentleman"" who asked for information and obviously didnt understand M1 Garands, much less the sniper variants or the SA-52 rebuild program. 

Serious offers considered.

READ THIS PLEASE:

Purchaser must live in a city/county/state where the purchase of this item is legal. I will not break any laws in order to sell this. I am not desperate for money. I do not live beyond my means. MO residents must show proof of residency and sign a bill of sale.

Out of state residents must provide a copy of their own or their dealer’s FFL. I will ship this through a FFL dealer local to me, to your FFL, ONLY. 

ATF/MIAC/OTHER trolls, pls take your trolling elsewhere, as I will not mail a firearm to your home, I will not sell to you locally if you are from out of state, or any of the other tired ploys you guys have tried. Really guys? Get a life and go after the Islamic jihadists who are actually killing Americans!! I am a retired Army Officer for Pete’s sake, GO AFTER THE REAL CRIMINALS, NOT PRIVATE CITIZENS WHO PAY YOUR SALARIES!

Other firearm owners: Beware, they are trying to build a case against private transfers of firearms, in state, or out of state through FFL dealers, as well as trying to gather dirt on Armslist in general.


 I would consider a partial trade plus cash of a good AR-15 rifle by Windham Weaponry, Colt 6920 or 6720 or other Colt, Armalite, or an older Colt SP1. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have more questions or would like to see more pictures. Thank you."

For those of you who may not be familiar with the 1911 pistols, this is a warning that this ad is for a ""Frankenstein"" 1911. Colt NEVER has made a high capacity 1911 pistol. The only part of this gun that is of Colt production is the slide, and because of it being a series 70, we can guess it came from a Colt manufactured prior to 1983 when its production line was cancelled. 
The frame and parts of this gun that you can see in the picture are not of colt manufacture, but instead this ""high quality and rare"" gun is a home-built collaboration of cheap and mismatched parts. The rear sight is not even for a 1911 pistol, and hangs out over the back of the slide. The front sight is what appears to be a ""glue on"" home job of some type or another. The beavertail safety does not match the frame, and considering how low it is sitting in the frame, is probably disabled or does not work at all. You can see by examining the pictures that the seller has ""rubbed out"" the marking on the barrel so you cannot see its stamping, and the manufacturers label on the frame has been edited so it cannot be read as well. I am guessing that it may be an older Caspian high capacity frame, but it is more likely a frame that was bought unfinished such as this one:
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=333040302. or possibly an el-cheapo STI or RIA frame from the Philippines. 

I would steer clear of this obvious scam, but if you are desperate, please do not pay more than a couple hundred bucks for the sum of its hashed-together parts, as it is quite likely that most have been damaged beyond use. Better yet, report obvious scammer's like this one and get it removed before an un-knowledgeable buyer gets ripped off."

I checked this out on ""Truth or Fiction"" who verified it. I trust them more than Snopes. Marlin Firearms is already closing its doors! They are doing it to us, America ! This needs to be spread to all gun owners and sportsmen/women. We cannot rely on the media to inform us of these types of matters. Something you may not know that Is happening ... Who is buying the companies manufacturing guns??? For the last several years a company called The Freedom Group has been buying up gun and ammunition manufacturers. Some of the companies are Bushmaster, Marlin, Remington, DPMS, Dakota Arms and H&R. Some people worry that this Freedom Group is going to control most of the firearms companies in the United States . If you control the manufacturers you can decide to stop selling to civilians. What a perfect way to control guns. Now if you do some digging you will see that The Freedom Group is owned by a company called Cerberus Capital Management. Guess who controls Cerberus??? GEORGE SOROS, Obama's chief financier!! He wants to restrict or ban all civilian guns. Please pass this on to all your freedom loving friends. This needs to come out. Why have we not heard about this in the ""mainstream"" media? I would think this would be BIG news. (Soros also owns Progressive Insurance). If you don't know who George Soros is, you need to do some research. This One-World Government atheist backed Obama with millions of dollars and Obama is a puppet on a string controlled by Soros. Send this to every gun owner you know!"

I have had a load of fun with this guy, and can honestly say it has never failed me. It comes with two 500 rd magazines, iron sights, two battery packs, and a bag with close to 2000 6mm bbs left from my last shoot.
That's not all. I mounted a picitanny rail on the lower end of the hand guard in order to accept various attachments, such as a laser or a front grip (things i'm keeping...). I also mounted sling attachments.
Finally, the full purchase comes with the smart-recharger kit. This in and of itself is a $150 purchase. It recharges your batteries to the point of them being fully recharged. MOST chargers will simply keep charging them, forcing the batteries to either stop working, or, in bad cases, explode. This charger will not do that!

This gun is loads of fun! They just opened up a CQC airsoft range here in town, so this carbine would be absolutely perfect to get some! Fires on single or FULL AUTO, at 440 fps, and if you spin the magazine while you hold down the trigger, you can let off all 500 rounds in pretty rapid succession. Pulling back the charging handle reveals a dial that will allow you to control the backspin of the bbs themselves, increasing or decreasing the backspin will increase or decrease the range of the bb.

Whither assault weapons ban: “Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said on Monday that a controversial assault weapons ban will not be part of a Democratic gun bill that was expected to reach the Senate floor next month,”  Politico  notes. “After a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday, a frustrated Feinstein said she learned that the bill she sponsored — which bans 157 different models of assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines — wouldn’t be part of a Democratic gun bill to be offered on the Senate floor. Instead, it can be offered as an amendment. But its exclusion from the package makes what was already an uphill battle an almost certain defeat.”"

Assault weapons ban dropped from Senate gun control bill


Published March 19, 2013

FoxNews.com



The leader of the Democrat-controlled Senate on Tuesday dropped a proposed assault weapons ban from the chamber’s gun-control package – dealing a blow to supporters of the ban, though it could still come up for a vote. 

The sponsor of the measure, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., revealed that Reid told her the proposed ban would not be in the initial package. Feinstein said she's ""disappointed"" with the decision, and is expected to nevertheless offer it as an amendment. 

But the move by Reid to cut it from the main bill signals a lack of congressional support for a proposal that would not only revive, but strengthen, the decade-long ban that expired in 2004. 

The proposed ban passed out of committee last week along with three other measures. The other three dealt with providing more school safety aid, expanding federal background checks on potential gun buyers and helping authorities prosecute illegal gun traffickers.

Feinstein has led the gun-control charge since President Obama called for federal legislation in the wake of the Newtown and other mass shootings.

Feinstein: Reid excluded the assault-weapons ban from Senate gun bill
POSTED AT 9:21 AM ON MARCH 19, 2013 BY ED MORRISSEY


No one expected the assault-weapons ban proposed by Dianne Feinstein to pass as part of the Senate’s gun-control package. Now it won’t even be a part of it. Last night, Feinstein told reporters that Harry Reid had excluded it from the final version of the legislative package:

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said on Monday that a controversial assault weapons ban will not be part of a Democratic gun bill that was expected to reach the Senate floor next month.

After a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday, a frustrated Feinstein said she learned that the bill she sponsored — which bans 157 different models of assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines — wouldn’t be part of a Democratic gun bill to be offered on the Senate floor. Instead, it can be offered as an amendment. But its exclusion from the package makes what was already an uphill battle an almost certain defeat.
“Almost certain defeat”? Left on its own as an amendment, Feinstein’s bill would be lucky to get 35 votes. She knows it, too, which is why she vented her frustration:

“My understanding is it will not be [part of the base bill],” Feinstein said. “It will be separate.”

Asked if she were concerned about the decision, Feinstein paused and said, “Sure. I would like to [see the bill moved], but the leader has decided not to do it.”

“You will have to ask him [Reid],” she said, when asked why the decision was made.
Do we need to ask? Reid can be accused of many things, but he’s not clueless when it comes to the politics of guns. Reid wants to pass a bipartisan bill to expand background checks, and he’s more than willing to sacrifice Feinstein’s effort to get it, especially since Reid was never enthusiastic about the renewed AWB in the first place.

This way, he gets two wins. First, using Feinstein’s proposal as the extreme of the effort, the background-check legislation looks more reasonable, even where it may not be. Second, by allowing Democrats in red states to vote against the AWB in a separate floor action, he protects them from attacks in the 2014 election. It’s a win-win for Reid.

It’s more of a mixed bag for gun-rights advocates. Depending on whether the Senate bill includes federal registration of all firearms, it’s a big loss — but that has absolutely no chance of passing the House anyway, and Republicans in the Senate won’t have any reason to stick around if it does. If it doesn’t, it’s more of a headache than a problem. The upside will be the outright rejection of the AWB, which should stick a stake through its heart for another decade after politicians who took the risk to demand it ended up with egg on their faces."

It is in very good condition.  It has not been shot more than 30 times since purchased.
It has a Bushnell Sportview Scope and case.
A totally recoil-less, spring piston airgun seemed little more than a dream before the recent appearance of the Model 54. In order to realize this goal the engineers spent years experimenting with different systems until they created this mechanical marvel. Simple but durable, the 54 uses a floating action riding on rails to achieve a totally recoiless system that stands up to the pounding of our 1100 fps system. Not only does this arrangement prevent transmission of felt recoil to the shooter, it also permits the rifle to excel in the accuracy department. When the rifle is fired, the action moves back lightly within the stock, absorbing the recoil, and permitting the pellet to exit the barrel before any of the spring vibration affects its travel. This system dramatically improves the accuracy potential of this magnum air rifle, making it a first class choice for either long range pest control or the precise demands of field target shooting. This side lever cocking magnum rifle's other features include adjustable trigger, adjustable rear sight, scope rail, Monte Carlo stock with cheek piece and checkering, and an automatic safety. Lifetime warranty.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XDs disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein announced Tuesday that a new assault weapons will not be included as part of a forthcoming comprehensive gun control bill, according to the Associated Press. 

While this doesn't mean that the ban – which would make it illegal to purchase a set of firearms deemed by regulators as ""assault weapons""  — is off the table permanently, the measure won't be included in a major reform package that is expected to reach the Senate floor next month. 

Possibly contributing to the removal of the ban is the political liability the bill would pose for a number of Senate Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections. Some Democrats have also expressed reluctance that including the assault weapons ban would doom the rest of the comprehensive package. 
 It's unlikely that a ban on assault weapons would have any chance of passage in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives, potentially causing a ""poison pill"" for comprehensive gun control reform.
 Three other gun control measure were approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee this month, including an expansion of federal background checks for gun buyers, increased penalties for gun trafficking, and an increase to school safety money."

Besides that, there are a few cars I've got my eyes on, so selling off my guns could fund some new projects. 

I've got the following all for sale:

HK USP 45, Full Size. Excellent shape, 6 mags total all HK not knock off crap. Minimal wear, rifling is great, shootings perfect and is close to brand new in quality. It'll come with the factory hard case, manual, 6 mags, pistol, and Blackhawk! Serpa holster. $1000 obo

Sig Sauer Pro Series (SP2009), 9mm. One of the 5,000 that were hand built for the South African Special Police forces for a private contract that they then welched on and the pistols were subsequently sold off to various dealers. Has a slide safety, Trijicon night sights, short tactical trigger, hand fitted frame and slide, and two mags. Comes with manual and original box and the pistol itself. One sold on Arfcom a few weeks ago without the Trijicons and a standard trigger for 750+ shipping, I'm looking for 800 obo on it since mine's got a few extras. 

Irwindale Arms Javelina 10mm Auto 1911, Hunting Model, has stainless steel slide, Millet sights, bull barrel, tight fitting bushing and slide, custom 3# trigger job, 2 mags (one Colt, one Mecgar), upgraded backstrap, upgraded Hogue grips and all the factory parts, manual, and box. Last one sold on gunbroker for more than $1200 and was bone stock. I'm looking for $750 for it, excellent shape, just can't really find ""plinking"" ammo for it. 

Finally I've got my Walther P1. I went through 37 different boxes at Cabela's when they got in a shipment of these to find THE ONE. It's a P1/38 that is completely numbers matching, and has never seen service or firing besides the proof of function test shot at the factory. It's marked for service on October of 1985, but was never given to an officer. I had my friend's father, who is the Chief of Police in Munich's subsidiary towns check the serial number in their system, and it was never entered to be issued. Thus avoided any use for over 25 years. It's a perfect example of the firearm, and I haven't fired it, just cleaned up old grease and lube and relubed it. I've had a few offers on it, but until recently wasn't looking to sell it at all. Looking to get $500 for it, and won't budge from that, since it's probably one of the few unfired ones left out there. 

Feel free to make offers"

When the guns sell on a normal basis they run 799 to 825.  This one has tons of mags and Acces. with it! The Ammo could be sold for 300 alone currently!!

This is the least I will take for 2100 I have invested! So again please do not try and insult my level of intelligence as I know what I have and what it is worth,aswell the value and worth~ I am NOT out to be like the others in the GUN Community. Just an Honest sale of my rifle! I could sell the Ammo and Mags and make nearly half as much as I am presntly asking for what ALL comes with this weapon! I will be doing a Bill of Sale as well asking for Copy of your State ID etc. 

I am not being like those ""GOUGERS"" that are asking 3000 to 2700 for them! Although I do have 2100.00 invested!! The Ammo comes with it and as per the Ammo it is the 1080 count tin and is opened but never shot any of it as our local range does not allow FMJ! Then I have 9 boxes of the Wolf WPA Polyformance Ammo 5.45x39 55 grain HP left ,and 30 to a box so that is 370 of those. I only used to of those boxes so 60 rounds instead of 40. So the rifle has been shot 60 times now and sighted well at 50 and 75 yards so far. I have the bullet Trunion guide so you can use the standard AK 74 mags in it and not JUST the Arsenal/Saiga ones. I have 6 Tapco 30 round Mags and then 4 factory 10 round Mags that come with it. So it will not shoot ALL forms of AK 74 mags! 

Bought Rifle, Scope ,Scope bracket,All Ammo,Trunion Bullet Guide Kit,Muzzle Break,Lifetime Nylon Sling,Higher quality Sling Brackets,6-Tapco 30 rnd Mags, 2 10rnd Tapco Mags and of course it came with one factory 10 rounder,and the extended mag release button! So with all that said I am asking 1250 for it as I itemized it for myself. I hope that gives you the general idea of what all I put into this rifle and ammo. Please feel free to call me at anytime! I am always up late!

Plus there are a few project cars and my upcoming wedding I could use the money for. So, these are up for sale as a result. The following three rifles are for sale:

Custom 300 Blackout AR-15 Build
Aero Keyhole A3 upper
Kreiger Stainless Match Barrel, .750 profiled, carbine gas ported with a standard A2 FH
PSA Multi-marked lower (no specific cal marking, picto, good to gofor hunting in other states)
DPMS LPK with enhanced roll pins, pins are roughly twice as thick as standard lpk equipment
BCM MPI/MPC BCG and Bolt, staked, peened, and nearly brand new
Milspec buffer tube, spring, and buffer
Hogue grip
Magpul enhanced trigger guard 
Magpul CTR stock
DPMS Freefloat tube and nut
Will come with various mags (USGI, Magpul 20 &30, Lancer 20)
Excellent rifle, extremely accurate, heavy hitting and fun to shoot. To build another you'd be looking at waiting for barrels, bcg's, ect... I've shot less than 500 rounds through it, basically testing different factory loads and hand loads to find what's best. I built it for a hog hunt that appears likely won't be happening now. It'll come with a scope and rings that are sitting on top of it and are sited in with 147gr super loads. Looking to get $2,000 obo for it, I had a few offers higher than this before, but wasn't REALLY looking to sell at the time. 

Next up is a British Enfield SMLE (1916) in 303 British that's been partially sporterized. All matching numbers, head spacing is great, all functions as it should, no issues to note at all. Wood is in great shape, rifling is good, bluing is still pretty strong and there aren't any visual defects to note at all. It has the forend wood cut down and no longer has the top wood covering the barrel. Also has a different front sight and leather sling. Great looking rifle, just haven't been able to shoot it like I would like. Looking for $400 obo

Last up is the one that'll get me in trouble if it sells, the HK 416-22 rifle. It has a Barksa holographic red dot on top, foregrip, utg rail covers, and is simply a blast to shoot. I've put a LOT of ammo through it, and the rifling shows no signs of giving up at all, and has had one malfunction ever which was due to lack of cleaning in a test of the rifle. Functions perfectly, and is a blast to shoot. Fiance said not to sell it, so the price reflects her desire to keep it around the house. $600 firm on it, because I could buy her something shinny if it sold."

I have seen the people's anger and growing mistrust for the Democratic leaders and all who voted yes on the gun control bills without turning such an important issue over to the people to vote on. I have seen day in and day out the words from my fellow Americans asking and pleading to all of those like us to say NO, to call and write the House, Senate and Governor and ask them to turn down these or most of these opressive and unjust bills. I have also seen what comes from calling and writing these SHMUCKS! I composed a letter a while back and sent it to every E-Mail of anyone involved with these voting processes and from the ""Supporters of the People"" I received back thoughtful and heart felt responces and ever a couple phone calls. From the Dirty D's I received either quick Cut-n-Paste ""thank you for your concern"" letters that where nothing shy of insulting. 

Here's what I say! 
I know there are several petitions out there to recall certian people who have voted yes, I have heard of a list of these Voters that is being used for these said petitions... Why dont we go as far as really putting our foot down and call for prosocution or perhapse politely ask them to leave this state for good or face prosocution? 
What has happened here is far more insulting and unconstitutional than any other ban could have been! They say we can have our guns but cannon buy new magazines nor may we transfer any such magazine along with the gun if we want to sell ""pretty pointless to buy a gun you cannot shoot?"". Any magazine that may be taken apart ""baseplate models means just about every magazine out there"" are now restricted and thus you cannot get replacments, and once the companies adjust to these laws you cannot take apart to clean it. 
Please, this is a call to any more law savey people than myself!!! Compose a document and petition calling for very harsh criminal punishment for these people who have stripped us of the second most important part of being an American and so many jobs not only in Colorado but across the Country!"

This gun shoots great and is in good overall shape it is missing half of the rear sight blade.  Common issue with Taurus's pt99.  You can get one from Taurus but works fine and is easy to shoot without it.  The price is $375 and probably not going any lower.  There are almost $100 worth of mags with it.  It is a double action/single action with manual thumb safety and a five inch barrel.  It has adjustable rear sights and fixed front sight.  It has packmayer grips on it.  The safety is ambidextrous and the mag lever can be switched for left hand shooter it is set up for righty currently.  Good overall gun shoots as good as a beretta at half the price."
