Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome.

It is a 6+1 capacity, it is in near mint condition, very little wear or signs of use internally or externally and I have taken it out shooting to make sure it works and seems to feed and shoot fine from the small selection of ammo I put through it which was about 80 rounds or so. As much as I dont want to part with it for sentimental reasons, finances are tough and I dont particularly enjoy loading the magazine on the gun as with all Luger type pistols. These are becoming more and more scarce, particularly the .380 ACP models so the price I'm listing is as low as I can go and as low as I'm willing to take, so if you offer anything less I will pass up on it. I'm honestly more interested in cash, but I will only entertain the offer of trade with a small list of things. I will outright trade it for a Uberti Schofield revolver in .45 Colt or .38 Special if it has a 6 inch barrel or less, a Ruger Mini-14 with a 580 or higher serial range and would prefer it be a non tactical model, a Ruger SP101 in .327 Federal Magnum or .32 H&R Magnum with a 3 inch barrel, a Rossi Rio Grande in .410 or a Henry .410 Lever Action, and lastly a Saiga .410 that has been unmodified preferably. I do not have an owners manual or box for the Baby Luger, but I can provide additional pictures if needed. If you have any questions please feel free to text or call Chris at 601-918-6318. I will respond as soon as possible and it is faster than communication via email. If this post is still up then it has not been sold. As mentioned, the only trades I am interested in are the ones listed above so anything else will be off the table."
