Full disclosure I've had a couple problems with them. First, I had a hollow point fail to feed with one of them. I asked TT about it and they were very helpful. They sent me two new springs, one for each mag. I replaced them and loaded them up to let the spring set before going to the range. Went to the range and had one of the followers get stuck down in the mag. So, now I don't trust these for carry, and don't need them for the range, so I'd like to get some money back. I'd like to get $45 shipped anywhere in the US for both of them. I will also include all 4 springs that I have now. If you don't think thats fair, shoot me an offer.

I am including 2 spare magazines (3 total) and about 300 rounds of 5.56, half of the ammo is green tip and the other half is brass range ammo. The rifle itself operates flawlessly. Never a failure to feed or stove pipe. The only thing worth mentioning is that there is a spot on the tip of the barrel where it was sat on the inside of a soft carrying case while the barrel was still hot so it left an area of melted case lining imprint on the outside of the barrel. Its nothing that affects operation of the rifle and it is only cosmetic. Since the case was black, it's not super noticeable but I have no idea how to get it off without sanding it or something.* Private party sale* Must show valid AZ identification and sign a bill of sale* Cash only* Will not ship"

I only used it for a single 30-round mag to see how it functioned. Flawless of course... and a lot faster that I expected. I absolutely loved this trigger but decided to get a 2-stage model for my precision rifle. I currently have the 3.5lb springs installed on it but you can swap them out for the 4.5lb ones if you’re wanting a super crisp battle trigger. The cheapest price online is currently $240, which is the standard price point for several of Geissele’s Trigger. $245 is what I paid.My price is $200 CASH. Receipt will be included and they come with a lifetime warranty. Barely shows any signs of wear. NO TRADES! Haha just kidding, I’ll take 1,000 rounds of Target 9mm factory load FMJ. But that’s it, not interesting in ANYTHING ELSE. No Monarch or TulAmmo. If you’re interested, please text me atREDACTEDI have a video I can send of how fast it is."

Long story short, I ordered this rifle earlier this year and have since lost interest in it. It was delayed on order from the factory for whatever reason and during that time I built myself a 6.5 Creedmoor rifle that basically fills the same role as this rifle. Therefore, I have no real reason to keep this one around and I have become much more interested in finding a old school revolver. I am open to cash offers or interested in trades (+/-$) for older double action .44 magnum revolvers, i.e, Smith & Wesson, Dan Wesson, etc..Please let me know if you're interseted. I am not in much of a hurry to sell - that is, unless I find a revolver (as mentioned above) on here or at a local gun shop.$1200/obo"

Twice by Larry to check action of the complete make over.Here is my beautiful Factory new Rock Island 1911A1 70 series Nickle in 38 super. It has received a 1911 upgrade package. The upgrades consist of the following. Trigger job to 3.25 pounds, action smoothing, fitted new black beaver tail grip safety, thumb safety, slide stop, trigger, mainspring housing, barrel bushing, recoil plug and a custom set of pachmayr laminated black wood grips. Also installed a green fiber optic front sight. The contrast in color makes this an amazing looking and very user friendly handgun. This gun is a pleasure to shoot. Comes with 1- 10rd mag, box and all the paper work. All new in the box. More has been done. That is just the highlights of the build.The total build was over $1400 in all the receipts. The action of this pistol is smooth and the trigger light to the touch. Needs final buff and coating set to be yours. Or run it as is either way it is gorgeous. Larry knows how picky I am and spared nothing to make sure it is perfect. It will come with factory barrel only. I do not sell my spec’d barrels. It has been fitted and adjusted to the pistol. Just got it back. LOVE THIS GUN! But I don’t need it after building and shooting my STI 38 Super. It will come with the factory ugly slabs and a custom pair also.I am a huge fan of Big Bore Lever actions in 45-70 but only in Stainless steel and any long range rifle with optics in FDE or Camo.Will trade for:"
