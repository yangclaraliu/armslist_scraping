Stevens .22 Rifle with a 26"" Octagon shaped barrel that was released around 1873.  It's a single fire, single load variation.  The gun is in great condition as the pictures show, a small gouge on the stock on the left side but other than that the stock is flawless with original finish.  Steel shows almost zero rusting, it actually has a nice shine to it still.  A slight discoloration which looks like it might be starting to rust near the hammer but i bet it would polish right off.  The gun works amazingly, fires, and really does still have the crack shot quality.  I was consistently hitting 3"" targets from 100meters and im not even a great marksman.  Overall a great antique gun that has been taken care of for all its years.

However it would be nice from your side if YOU and others worked with the rules of this site, one of them is meeting in a safe place which I always leave it up to the person purchasing from me where they feel safe meeting me and when Im buying some thing I ask the seller what is a good place and if I don't feel safe there I will suggest another safe place or a sub station...Which I would like to think is a safe place, considering all the cops they have there and everything....Also I always bring someone with me for every transaction and make sure the area is well lit and encourage everyone else to do so! I respond to every email that is sent to me and respond very nicely till someone gets rude with me or continues to email me and call me after I've asked them not too.

Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in."

The .50 ae is stainless and the black one is a 44 magnum. I have the original box and paperwork for the 50 and have one box of ammo and some casings if you want to reload them. I do not have the original box for the black one but the condition is great condition and have a little ammo for the ammo as well . I have 5 mags for the 44 and 3 for the 50 ae.  I am asking good money for these because I paid max price to get them and they are both the original ones that were made in Israel. These guns are becoming hard to get get and steady climbing in value and not the over night value that the ar15s picked up in the last 2 months..Buying these and keeping them in good shape only assures you that the money you have in them will always be returned any time you want to sell them and if you wait awhile then profiting could be in the cards for you as well.  I ask that the scam artists stay away and im not taking cash offers either. Please tell me what you would trade or tell me you want to buy them for my asking price. Please dont email me to tell me you would never pay that and Im nuts. keep it to yourself. thanks for looking

This is NOT AirSoft or Clone. It is 100% original purchased from MAGPUL. 

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

IT WAS PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM MAGPUL. 

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

Parkerized/Matte Finish. These are listed as an 7+1 gun, but I reworked the spring just a bit and made it fit 8 in the tube. So, that means 8+1. Have not seen another one that will hold 8+1. Internals have been polished up a bit and seem to engage smoother and function flawlessly.

Has a Gen2 Blackhawk/Knoxx Adjustable Stock and Forend, Meprolight MH3 Night Sight Bead, and a set of Weaver mounts to mount a red-dot. Includes original stock and revised pistol grip.

I have about $550 in this shotgun, so I'm looking to get most of it back. I bought it BRAND NEW and it has been fired ONE TIME to test functionality after custom work. I have racked about 100 rounds through it with NO hiccups.

Prior to shipping, all BCM® upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy.  As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.





M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

What we have here is a 2010 Mini 14 factory made tactical with the factory short 16.12"" barrel length. This has a factory issued Ruger ATI folding and telescopic stock (complete with Ruger logos) that has been recently refinished to desert sand camo color. The rifle also has a Sight Mark Ultra Shot Pro Reflex Sight with quick release and new batteries, Sight Mark 3x ""slide to the side"" magnifier with quick release, UTG Leapers LS279 green laser with 1000 meter visibility, high end tactical flashlight (cant remember name without looking), Folding Forward Grip, one 30rd Promag steel mag (new), barrel stabilizer, two 20 round Ruger brand mags (one new, one lightly used), a UTG Deluxe Covert Homeland Security Case, polished trigger group, nice sling (not pictured) and 60 rounds of 5.56 Winchester ammo. The rifle has been fired very little and is very clean inside and out. I have not had time to reset the sights since I refinished the stock but it doesnt take long to do at the range. I will sell for $1400 cash or would consider taking a AR-15 or AK-47 in on trade with cash or even if its really worth it. This is not an inflated price for this weapon. It would have cost this much to build this rifle before the price hike. If you want to offer a trade, please use pre-price hike pricing in your offer. Im not going to take an $800 Carbon 15 as an even swap just because someone sold one for $1400 a month ago. Obama hike pricing on this rifle would be over $2000 from what Ive seen online that is even close to being comparable in this build. There are over $700 in add-ons on this weapon not counting the well over $800 (price after tax) Mini 14 Tactical itself before everything went through the roof. I have priced it more than fair when compared to the price gougers out there. On a side note, this rifle accepts 5.56 and .223 ammo.  I bought the rifle at a gun shop so the records are in my name. I will need the buyer to sign a bill of sale that I have written up at time of purchase. It just says that you can legally buy a firearm and are not a convicted felon."

Millions of rounds have been reloaded with this classic. It's the perfect tool for anyone who wants to try reloading, occasional loaders or anyone who wants to keep it simple. It pays for itself in no time. Accuracy exceeds most tools as it sizes only the case neck.

You will not find a nicer set than this, this is new and has never been used. Would like to trade for a Lee Loader for a 30-06 or another reloading package for a .30-06. Bottom line you want to reload .222 .223 and I want to reload 30-06. So lets help each other out."

It does not matter blue, nickle or stainless but I do want a non transfer bar type. I have a 90% smith a wesson cheifs model 36-1 nickle plated with a 3 inch barrel to trade with. I have looked up the value on the smith and I do understand that for most clones that the smith is more valuable but my loss is your gain. The smith also has a grip enhancer attached which can be removed by taking the grips off. Now if your revolver is a upgrade I am willing to pay the differance or come up with some type of sollution with cash or possibly other items or ammo. I am not looking for a safe queen either as I will be using for plinking and the occasional SASS weekend shoot.

When you look at the prices on the holders keep in mind that I bought these years ago when silver was $11.00/oz. Around the same time a SKS could be had for under $200. These are not scrap coins, you cannot/will not get them for just the scrap value. Most of these coins are collector grade. If you want to buy all of these it will be $300 cash firm. They are nice!"

This accommodates 5.56mm ammunition without developing higher pressures encountered when firing 5.56mm ammo in a .223 chamber with shorter ""Leade"" (both calibers can be used safely). Rifling is 1 in 9"" twist for optimum performance with most lighter bullet weight varmint cartridges, and the barrel is fluted to increase cooling and reduce weight. The Varminter Upper's shell ejection path has been modified to drop all your brass in the same place as a convenience for the reloader. A vented forend with bipod/sling stud installed, free-floats the barrel from the barrel nut forward and B.M.A.S. Mini-Risers add 1/2"" to scope height for correct sight picture and comfortable cheek weld. This Upper is sold complete with Bolt, Bolt Carrier and Charging Handle to ensure positive lockup between bolt and barrel extension.

Looking for a H&K Tactical USP, Elite, Expert
This is a nice Colt, professionally machined frame and slide to fit extremely tight.  adjustable sights, Crimson lasergrips, stainless compensator, stainless match barrel, full length stainless guide rod, adjustable trigger.  The gun is not perfect but has been 100% reliable, and very accurate.  It does have its minor Blemishes which takes the frustration away from putting the first nick or scratch in your new $1400-$1800 1911.  I'm not saying this is at that value but I do know what it takes to build a good 1911 that will put food on the table and also save your ass when the going gets tough.   This is true steel, not the cheap mass produced 1911's that are currently sold for the 500-800 range.
I do not want cash, just a H&K usp tactical.  any other offer will be not thought upon too hard."

What I have is a completely ready to go shooters package. The rifle is a norinco Mak 90 ak47. I'm gonna put a value around 2k for the whole rig (hard case not included)

Understand that if you put a $600(Pre panic) value in the base rifle I have $1,128.00 (I just added up invoices). That being said if you have a quality ar-15 I am looking for a close to straight trade (I am negotiable).

So no your bushmaster, dpms, delton etc is not what I am looking for in a straight trade. And if you have a PSA it will need extras. Pre panic or post panic values won't matter both rifles have gone up in value. My rifle is worth a 1k before the panic, stock psa is 800 so know that before you offer. 

The rifle is outfitted with the following parts, 

Ar 15 6 position stock adapter 
Magpul Moe stock 
Hogue pistol grip 
Krebs custom safety selector 
Krebs custom peep sight 
Solar tactical magwel adapter (makes for very fast and way mag changes)

Magpul angled for grip 
And spikes tactical Dynacomp 

8- 30rd mags 
1- 5 rnd mag 
1600 rds of 7.62x39

It will come with all the original furniture pictured, nothing permenent was done, everything can be take off to revert it back to its original state. 

I don't need to get rid of this I just want to see what's out there trades are listed below.
