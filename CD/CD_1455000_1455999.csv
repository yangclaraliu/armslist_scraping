My loss, your gain.  

Almost new condition, very lightly used. 
INCLUDES: 
a pocket pal shoot thru holster.  ($70 dollars)
2 standard Mags, ($25 each if you can find them)
1 Extended Mag (9 or 10 shots) ($35, if you can find them)
Pocket carry Clip ($20?)
I think I have an ankle holster for it too... let me know if you want that.  

This is the 380ACP that started it  all, about the easiest gun to conceal out there. 

The P3AT is a DA only, micro-compact 380... Surprisingly accurate, considering its size.  It's snappy, but not as bad as a PPK, and a helluva lot lighter, smaller and more reliable.   The short recoil design makes it MUCH more pleasant to shoot than a PPK.  It's not as pretty as a Walther PPK, but that's not its job. 

If you're looking for a 380 Automatic Colt Pistol, this is one you should consider.  380 A.C.P is also known as 9mm short or 9mm Kurz (german for short) and with the new ammo, it's a potent self defense round.  

Cash on the barrel head.  I have several hundred rounds of ammo (HP and taget) for this if you'd like to buy separately... I deleted it from this ad, because I'm trying to keep the price down.  

Might consider trades, (Maybe a side-by-side, over&under, 22LR/22WMR revolver, reloading goodies, competition stuff, antiques, black powder revolver, sks or ak?)

Local sales only, No out of state.

Protector series manufacturing

We use absolutely no castings, MIM (Metal Injection Molding) or forgings on any component that goes into a MasterPiece Arms Protector Series Pistol. Castings, MIM’s and Forgings are used by many firearms manufacturers to reduce cost and to ease the manufacturing process – which both come with a price. Cast, MIM and/or Forged parts are not as strong; typically have porosity and inclusions in the metal, and are much more prone to failure than parts produced from a high tensile strength alloy such as 4140 or 416 Stainless Steel. The fit, form and function of a forged, MIM or cast part is always a compromise, because the tolerance capability of these alternate processes is no comparison to producing parts from solid steel using high tech, super accurate, CNC Lathes, CNC Machining Centers, CNC Swiss Turns and CNC Grinders. Also, the feel and performance of a fully machined firearm using state of the art CNC technology cannot be compromised.

Why build this series of firearms?
Protector series manufacturing

Yes, why should MasterPiece Arms dive into the crowded 380 ACP market with its introduction of the Protector Series Sub Compact Pistols?

The answer lies in the history of MasterPiece Arms and a strong company philosophy to excel in market niches where our capabilities can fill the absence of a strong participant be it in terms of quality, pricing or in this case, both.

MasterPiece Arms changed ownership in August of 2008. Since then, we have grown the company considerably, added seven new models to our MPA Mac Line of Semi-Auto Submachine Pistols and Carbines, and enhanced our manufacturing capabilities to produce almost all of the parts used in our product line within our own facility. We have over 32 CNC machines in our facility, as well as CNC Inspection Equipment (DCC Coordinate Measuring Machines), CNC Swiss Turns, CNC Yag Laser Engravers, Parkerizing and Black Oxide metal treatment processes, heat treating (gas and electric) plus millions of dollars in specialized cutting tools, gages, fixtures, and support equipment.
Protector series manufacturing

Prior to 2008 and the acquisition of MasterPiece Arms, the manufacturing facility was (and still is) one of the few World Class Machining Facilities in the Southeastern United States. Our quality system, which frames the method in which we manage our manufacturing facility and produce our components, is one of the most stringent and demanding systems used in metalworking today. Our company is TS16949/ISO9002 Certified, which represents less that 1% of the manufacturing facilities in the USA.

So how does all of this steer MPA into this new firearms market segment?

The answer lies in several things; a hole in the market, an older yet improved design, and our manufacturing expertise derived from years of high precision manufacturing of high precision aerospace, automotive and medical parts as well as for firearms for MPA and others.
Protector series manufacturing

In the subcompact 380 ACP market there are quite a few options available in the polymer frame or what some call “throw away” designed firearms. These receivers are mass produced by injection molding machines, have cast or sometimes machined upper slides, and not to sound overly simplistic, have the workmanship of an expensive toy. These guns are functional, lightweight and quite reliable, but just don’t have the feel and no-fail reliability of a firearm that comes from fully machined, precision, solid steel stock.

Your next group is the super high priced ($795 - $1195) all metal 380’s. There are 2 or 3 main players in this market segment with very good reputations. The majority of their parts are machined, hand fitted and have the feel, finish and overall impression of a finely crafted firearm. These guns are not cheaply built and they are not cheaply priced. In fact, the guns work well, look beautiful, carry a hefty price tag and can be difficult to find in stock.

At this point we introduce the MPA Protector Series. We bring our manufacturing expertise and capabilities to this high end market segment that deserves a finely crafted, precision oriented firearm that has the expense in the design and not in your pocket. Which brings us to another answer for “why build this series of firearms?” Because good things that come in small packages don’t have to be expensive.
Protector series manufacturing

What about the design of the gun itself? Yes our design obviously resembles current and past participants in this market, as do many others. We didn’t invent this type of gun although the previous owner of MPA spent over a year with the initial design and development of our Protector Series firearms. As with our Macs, we have just followed his lead and enhanced those designs. We made the guns safer and more consistent to shoot, and produced everything on “State of the Art” CNC machinery in our own facility. We don’t out source anything except the polymer grips and the springs. If we make it then we control the quality 100%.

It is important to understand our pricing objective. The level of margin (profit) realized by our high quality, higher priced competitors are admirable. It appears they chose to make a limited number of guns per year and let the quality and their name sell the price. At MPA, we would rather use our manufacturing expertise in reducing cycle times, material cost, scrap and extreme levels of operational efficiency to deliver a super premium product at a moderate price which in turn gives more people the availability and affordability necessary to purchase this weapon for personal protection.
Protector series manufacturing

When buying a personal protection firearm you have many choices. But until now you really didn’t have the choice of a classically beautiful firearm that was constructed with the best materials available and has a price that is affordable to all. We believe that we have filled a void in the market and we hope you the consumer will take advantage of it. We look forward to your purchase."

This scope adds a lot of fun, and a new dimension to pistol shooting at the range.  With this scope mounted and sighted-in we were able to shoot the tops off of 2-liter bottles at 100 yards :).    

Of course the original iron sights are still in place too, but the scope is a long eye relief scope perfect for this pistol. It really is fun :). 

A bill of sale will be required for this transaction.  I will require your drivers license for ID."

""LMT (Lewis Machine and Tool)  manufactures and assembles our Barreled Uppers, utilizing the same stringent guidelines to meet or exceed current Military Specifications. Our receivers are Hard Coat Black Anodized as per Mil-Spec. Using Wilson Arms Match Grade and Mike Rock Premium barrel blanks. Blanks are sent to a current Military Contractor with 23 years of experience in the manufacturing of barrels, upper receivers, as well as numerous other components. 
Once a barrel blank has reached the contractor it is rifled utilizing the ""Button Broach"" technique and forwarded to be ""Stress Relieved"". These procedures have been implemented to ensure that the most stringent specifications and guidelines are being met. The same meticulous care is given throughout the 5.56 NATO Chambering and Crowning processes to promote the finest accuracy and reliability. The barrels are then finished with a Magnesium Phosphate Coating adhering to Mil-Spec guidelines to prevent rust and corrosion. The highest measures of quality control are implemented to ensure no variance from barrel to barrel, or lot to lot.

It has both the standard wood stock, and the ATI stock. The ATI stock comes made for the Mini 14, so I had to take a dremel to widen the magazine well to accommodate the Mini 30 mags, as everybody with a Mini 30 has to. It could use a bit of sanding but it works just fine. It has side, bottom, and top rails.

Also has an already mounted Accu-Strut. It also has a 4x scope and a detachable flash suppressor. Has two 10-round mags and a 5-round mag. I also have 60 rounds of Winchester 7.62 and about 160 rounds of Golden Tiger 7.62. The Mini has no problem eating up steel-cased ammo including Tula. Also has 2 7.62x39 Tipton snap caps to practice cycling. Basically, it's got all the accessories.

I got the rifle from my dad up in New York because he refused to abide by the new communist laws up there and register it, so he gave it to me. I already owned a Mini 30 because we got them together, but I don't need two, so I figured I'd sell his.

I'm looking for an AR, or an AK, but I'd prefer an AR because I already have a 7.62 rifle (my other Mini 30). Springfield M1A variants or other 3.08/7.62NATO semi autos. Could also involve cash. I'm not opposed to handguns and cash as well, particularly FN's or Berettas. I would prefer a trade over a straight sell because I'd just turn around and use the money to buy one of the aforementioned items.

This scope kit is specifically designed to fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

Leave the power set on 2x or 3x in the field and you’re ready for close-in, fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For long shots at smaller targets, turn the power ring up to the full 6X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is a great combination of a lightweight mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

his non-expanding, deep-penetrating bullet has a lead core enclosed by a strong metal jacket. It provides smooth, reliable feeding in all types of semiautomatic handguns. All PMC cartridges must pass through rigorous inspection at an electronic powder check station. This station accurately measures the propellant charge in each round. If the propellant in any cartridge varies by just two tenths of one grain, the system stops and that cartridge is discarded.

Product Information
 Hornady is known for making Accurate, Deadly, Dependable bullets. Z-Max bullets are no exception. These bullets have been specifically designed for delivering devastating expansion and explosive results specifically for zombie elimination. The polymer tip enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion while raising the ballistic coefficient. Hornady’s swaging process creates precise formation of the bullet core around the tip of the bullet, creating a build-up of energy which contributes to its phenomenal performance. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles.

The release of this bullet gives reloaders the chance to load up their own zombie specific ammunition in their favorite caliber and get loaded up. You never know when the impending zombie apocalypse will begin, so make sure you’re prepared with enough Z-Max bullets to fill up extra magazines and bugout bags. This is not loaded ammunition.

Locks up tight and is quite accurate. Will reliably hit a small target at 100 yards in the hands of a capable shooter.

From Vigilance Rifles:
408 Cheytac. The Holy Grail of rifle cartridges, especially when being shot by the VR1 rifles. Quick follow up shots and easy impact 

reading from the low recoil of the VR1 Rifles is one of the key advantages of stepping down to a 408 Cheytac cartridge from the much 

bigger 416 Barrett or 50 BMG rifles. Not to mention VR1 rifles only weigh 18 lb. which means you can actually take it some where. It is 

the cartridge that I designed the VR1 rifles to shoot, all other calibers that we offer just happen to fit in the VR1 Rifles.

Rocky Mountain Bullets has developed real 420 gn. RBBT bullets for the 408 Cheytac, it certainly has taken the 408 Cheytac to a new 

level in performance. With the new bullets shooters are able to achieve long periods of sustained fire before accuracy deteriorates due 

to fouling, compared to shooting solid monolithics.

Distinctive from all others the VR1 is the only Semi-Auto Autoloader on the market chambered in the 408 Cheytac or 505 Gibbs. It is also 

available in 338 Lapua. The 408 Cheytac cartridge is a highbred, with confirmed kills out to 1 mile from trained hands. The VR1 holds 

five cartridges in 408 Cheytac - 505 Gibbs and 338 Lapua. The 338 Lapua is NATO and ammo is in military armaments, RAUFUS-AP-API 

are available, the cartridge proves well out to 1500 yards. VR1 shoots 1 MOA accuracy with 338 Lapua or 408 Cheytac in trained hands. 

The VR1 is not your typical M16 type conversion sniper rifle. We take great pride in the fact we completely manufacture it from the 

ground up. Our true 2-stage trigger with oil-lite bearings for a consistent reliable trigger pull. There are four sizes of bi pods and a 

mono pod available for different shooting requirements they change out in seconds. Our sling is attached to the internal frame of the 

rifle so an accidental dropping of the rifle due to sling pull is eliminated. The sling design also enables it to double as a turnacate. The 

Mill-Spec scope rail is mounted with (TORX-FHCS) this precision aligns the scope with the barrel eliminating bullet shift at different 

distances. Our safety is ambidextrous push type ( Fail Proof) with easy visual identification. We use a rotary screw bolt system that 

screws the bolt shut; this feature virtually eliminates the required force for opening and shutting the bolt. This is one of the key 

reasons that we are the only manufacturer able to make the 408 Cheytac cartridges shoot flawlessly in a Semi-Auto Autoloader. Rotary 

lock rifles usually use a spring loaded ejector, which can cause jams with high rate fire, the VR1 uses a Rotary screw bolt and fixed 

ejector for sure ejection and no jams. It is unusual to find a large caliber Semi-Auto Autoloader rifle that shoots as accurately and 

reliably as the VR1.

BENEFITS - A Long-range PRECISION SNIPER RIFLE (PSR) with quick follow up shots due to low recoil of Semi-Auto operation and Auto 

loading. Quick detachable magazines for instant load selection and increased firepower. Robust sturdy design that easily assembles 

and breaks down with no tools in under a minute with no loss of bullet impact. Easily concealable, no assembly being longer than 33 

inches. Variable caliber interchangeable barrels. A gas forward design allowing for longer periods before cleaning due to gases not 

entering the receiver area. Our list is long and all the innovations in this new rifle certainly cannot be described on a concise white 

paper. The technology and engineering in this rifle are instantly noticeable.

Features:
Designed and developed to be light and mobile and inspired by several of the finest autoloading rifles in the world, we have taken the 

best features and incorporated them into a larger than life autoloading rifle.

Chambered in four exciting large calibers, the 338 Lapua, 375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac and 505 Gibbs. The 338 Lapua for NATO, 375 and 

408 Cheytac for long range engagement and the legendary 505 Gibbs made famous by Earnest Hemingway for unbeatable knockdown 

Power.

With five shots in the quick detachable magazine you’re sure to have plenty of firepower for the largest or most dangerous game.

Reliability of the VR1 is due to the gas port being optimally located to the chamber. The gases are cleaner and hotter up front and result 

in more reliable cycling and less fowling, the best autoloading rifles in the world use this system.

Our upper receiver is made from 17-4 PH Stainless Steel and certified Heat Treatment for high-pressure operation with such large 

calibers. The upper receiver-barrel locks securely into a lightweight hard-anodized lower receiver. The rifle uses a three-lugged rotary 

screw bolt for sure lockup, and a fixed ejector for high rate fire.

Using a 11/4 Bull Barrel for extreme accuracy and incorporating a proven Titanium Muzzle Brake for taming the Beast, makes the VR1 

easy to shoot in any of our four calibers. The VR1 Rifles come standard with our exclusive M1A style Glass Filled Nylon Stocks for all 

weather conditions and come standard with Coyote M1A CHEEKPAD. Optionally High Comb Stocks machined from (RUTPLY) premium 

wood are available in several colors.

Our exclusive Pendulum Two Stage Trigger (PTST) at the heart of the gun supplies crisp reliable trigger pull. First stage is 2-½ lb and 

second stage releases at 3-½ lb respectively, the predictability of the trigger improves shooter accuracy and confidence. Incorporated 

within the trigger system is a heavy engagement (FAIL PROOF) traditional push safety.


Shipping/handling for this rifle will be $75 due to size and weight. Insurance will be added, unless you request it not to be, and will cost 

1.75% of the price of the gun to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price in this auction reflects a 5% discount

This rifle has the less common and more desirable mid-length gas system. Mid-length gas systems run cooler, shoot softer, and cycle smoother with lower gas pressures due to a longer gas tube (compared to standard M4 carbine length gas systems). Especially good for using with a Slidefire Stock.

The run on assault rifles and AR style rifles has calmed down since Pesident Obama and the Senate finally realized that their push for a ban on assault rifles was going to far and not popular with the majority of the US population. As a result people are realizing that they are not going to get inflated prices for their AR's as they have over the last few months. 

This AR 15 that I am selling is reasonably priced to sell and a great buy with the many extras that are included. I could have gone much further fitting this AR with sights and a scope or a red dot sight but I will leave that up to the buyer who can choose from the many styles of optics that are out there on the market.
