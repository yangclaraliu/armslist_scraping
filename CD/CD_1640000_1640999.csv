It is an incredibly accurate and reliable rifle, with sub-MOA accuracy right out of the box. It utilizes a short stroke piston system which drives a rod back to operate the rotating bolt, giving it extreme reliability in sustained fire and running much, much cleaner than traditional gas impingement AR rifles.

These are very difficult to come by. I am an individual and have the rifle in hand, ready to meet face to face or have it shipped to your FFL.

As featured in Bourne Legacy (although the breakdown bolt sniper rifle was mis-represented as a Semi-auto in the movie) 

Am anal about maintenance and cleaning of all my weapons. Have taken it shooting no more than a half dozen times (can confirm the manufacturer's statement in that it's VERY ACCURATE AND REPEATABLE ZERO SHIFT) - mostly sighting for the scope with different 100-200 yards and different ammo (didn't have a place to shoot rifles for the longest time - outdoor range nearby in West Virginia was closed most of the time due to ownership change). It's a 1/2 MOA shooter - if local in Northern VA, can meet a mutually agreeable local range for an accuracy test-drive to prove it's as good as advertised. 

All ""extra"" Options purchased and avail as part of this sale include: 
- Height Adjustable Cheek Rest 
- Thread Protector 
- Large Bolt Handle (1"" Stainless steel diameter) 
- Extended Bipod Pin (Two location bipod pin for standard and suppressed shooting) 
- Both Tactical Backpack & Tactical Briefcase (typically only sold with one or the other) 
- Muzzle Brake 
- Additional 2 Magazines (3 total) 
- 2 Cover Caps for cleaning and Storage 
- 20 MOA Scope Mount vs. the 0 MOA default included 

Have a Round Count / Maintenance Book for the rifle - will happily include. 

Asking $4,000 for the rifle and all options for quick sale (Nightforce scope seen in pictures link below is not included). 

Not sure how to include Pics. Will include link to pictures instead (hopefully that will work?):

Will be happy to ship to your FFL as long as they're okay receiving from an individual. Shipping and insurance (recommended) will be additional. 

Reason for sale: My weapons inventory is such that I reached a QTY limit, to buy something, I have to sell something - that's the deal I made with Wifey and myself and it's been working pretty well. This is a long range backpack precision rifle I just don't see me being able to use as often as my other toys and it will likely sell quickly and free up some funds for other projects I'm investing in.

193,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1640193,For Sale:  NIB COLT DELT ELITE 10MM STAINLESS NEWER MODEL  MINT!,"Allen Park, Detroit, Michigan","$ 1,500","Listed On: Saturday, May 18, 2013",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,no type,no type,Pistol,"PICTURES SHOWN BELOW ARE ACTUAL FIREARM BEING SOLD.

I picked this gun up from my FFL dealer on 05/09/2013 exactly 9 days ago.  I brought it home and field stripped it and lubbed it up with Frog Lube (the best!). This is the newer version of Colt's Delta Elite 10mm Brand New in Box, Never fired! Not the model from the 1980's.  The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new or shown in the pictures below.

You know having one of these is on your bucket list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well they are only going to get harder to find brand new!

Some have asked how to tell the difference between the old version and the new.  Well first the texture of the grips is the first giveaway, 2nd the amount of the trigger that is exposed is greater on the newer version.  I am sure there are other ways to tell, these are the 2 that I am aware of.

At this point since I am just listing it, I do not want to ship out of state right now and go through the hassle so local FTF transaction only and I will only sell to a person with a purchase permit or CPL and I will show you my ID to prove I am the rightful owner and I will make copies of your id for my records to cover my butt in case this gun falls into the wrong hands.  In other words don't think you are going to pull one over on me, I am by the book!

Price is $1500 FIRM  Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less.  I will not respond to these offers at all!!!
Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price.  I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com.  Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold. Almost every single one sold for almost exactly $1500 or very close so I know this is what I can get.  It would cost me probably $20 for gunauction's sellers fees, but it would cost the buyer who almost always pays for the sellers FFL to handle the paperwork & ship it out which includes my FFL's fee and shipping which the price varies between $40 and $60 depending if you get insurance.  Then you have to pay about $25 to $40 for your FFL to receive the gun and then if you use a credit card almost everyone charges 3% for that.  So all these people paying the $1500 on gunauction after all fees are auctually paying $1600 or more.  So that is how I got my price.  No shipping and waiting and hoping it doesn't get damaged, you can fully inspect prior to your purchase, and you can take it home with you immediately.  I know I could get a much faster sale to just list it, but I am just trying to help out my local fellow shooters.

I do not need to sell, but looking to get a different 10mm, one I can actually shoot without feeling guilty and not have a safe queen.  Obviously I prefer a straight green cash money sale!!!!  Before I get a ton of calls wanting to trade me your Glock 29 or 20, let me clarify.  Not really interested in any glocks.  I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Kimber Eclipse, possible others. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow that shoots 335FPS or better, preferably a Barnett or Horton reverse limb...I really like the reverse limb styles, also possibly a excellent condition Desert Eagle or a High Quality Bolt Action Rifle especially the octagon Barrel types in Stainless such as A Browning A-Bolt White Gold Medallion with the octagon barrel. Also may consider a excellent condition lever action, no junk, I will not own any type of off brands no matter how many upgrades you have added!
Really not looking for anything with scratches all except possibly the crossbow.  Hope this clarifies everything!

 I picked this gun up from my FFL dealer on 05/09/2013 exactly 9 days ago. I brought it home and field stripped it and lubbed it up with Frog Lube (the best!). This is the newer version of Colt's Delta Elite 10mm Brand New in Box, Never fired! Not the model from the 1980's. The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

 Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new or shown in the pictures below.

 You know having one of these is on your bucket list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well they are only going to get harder to find brand new!

 Some have asked how to tell the difference between the old version and the new. Well first the texture of the grips is the first giveaway, 2nd the amount of the trigger that is exposed is greater on the newer version. I am sure there are other ways to tell, these are the 2 that I am aware of.

 At this point since I am just listing it, I do not want to ship out of state right now and go through the hassle so local FTF transaction only and I will only sell to a person with a purchase permit or CPL and I will show you my ID to prove I am the rightful owner and I will make copies of your id for my records to cover my butt in case this gun falls into the wrong hands. In other words don't think you are going to pull one over on me, I am by the book!

 Price is $1500 FIRM Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less. I will not respond to these offers at all!!!
 Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price. I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com. Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold. Almost every single one sold for almost exactly $1500 or very close so I know this is what I can get. It would cost me probably $20 for gunauction's sellers fees, but it would cost the buyer who almost always pays for the sellers FFL to handle the paperwork & ship it out which includes my FFL's fee and shipping which the price varies between $40 and $60 depending if you get insurance. Then you have to pay about $25 to $40 for your FFL to receive the gun and then if you use a credit card almost everyone charges 3% for that. So all these people paying the $1500 on gunauction after all fees are auctually paying $1600 or more. So that is how I got my price. No shipping and waiting and hoping it doesn't get damaged, you can fully inspect prior to your purchase, and you can take it home with you immediately. I know I could get a much faster sale to just list it, but I am just trying to help out my local fellow shooters.

 I do not need to sell, but looking to get a different 10mm, one I can actually shoot without feeling guilty and not have a safe queen. Obviously I prefer a straight green cash money sale!!!! Before I get a ton of calls wanting to trade me your Glock 29 or 20, let me clarify. Not really interested in any glocks. I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Kimber Eclipse, possible others. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow that shoots 335FPS or better, preferably a Barnett or Horton reverse limb...I really like the reverse limb styles, also possibly a excellent condition Desert Eagle or a High Quality Bolt Action Rifle especially the octagon Barrel types in Stainless such as A Browning A-Bolt White Gold Medallion with the octagon barrel. Also may consider a excellent condition lever action, no junk, I will not own any type of off brands no matter how many upgrades you have added!
 Really not looking for anything with scratches all except possibly the crossbow. Hope this clarifies everything!

353,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1640353,For Sale:  !!!!!NIB COLT DELTA ELITE 10MM!!!!!,"Allen Park, Detroit, Michigan","$ 1,500","Listed On: Saturday, May 18, 2013",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,no type,no type,Pistol,"PICTURES SHOWN BELOW ARE ACTUAL FIREARM BEING SOLD.

 I picked this gun up from my FFL dealer on 05/09/2013 exactly 9 days ago. I brought it home and field stripped it and lubbed it up with Frog Lube (the best!). This is the newer version of Colt's Delta Elite 10mm Brand New in Box, Never fired! Not the model from the 1980's. The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

 Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new or shown in the pictures below.

 You know having one of these is on your bucket list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well they are only going to get harder to find brand new!

 Some have asked how to tell the difference between the old version and the new. Well first the texture of the grips is the first giveaway, 2nd the amount of the trigger that is exposed is greater on the newer version. I am sure there are other ways to tell, these are the 2 that I am aware of.

 At this point since I am just listing it, I do not want to ship out of state right now and go through the hassle so local FTF transaction only and I will only sell to a person with a purchase permit or CPL and I will show you my ID to prove I am the rightful owner and I will make copies of your id for my records to cover my butt in case this gun falls into the wrong hands. In other words don't think you are going to pull one over on me, I am by the book!

 Price is $1500 FIRM Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less. I will not respond to these offers at all!!!
 Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price. I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com. Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold. Almost every single one sold for almost exactly $1500 or very close so I know this is what I can get. It would cost me probably $20 for gunauction's sellers fees, but it would cost the buyer who almost always pays for the sellers FFL to handle the paperwork & ship it out which includes my FFL's fee and shipping which the price varies between $40 and $60 depending if you get insurance. Then you have to pay about $25 to $40 for your FFL to receive the gun and then if you use a credit card almost everyone charges 3% for that. So all these people paying the $1500 on gunauction after all fees are auctually paying $1600 or more. So that is how I got my price. No shipping and waiting and hoping it doesn't get damaged, you can fully inspect prior to your purchase, and you can take it home with you immediately. I know I could get a much faster sale to just list it, but I am just trying to help out my local fellow shooters.

 I do not need to sell, but looking to get a different 10mm, one I can actually shoot without feeling guilty and not have a safe queen. Obviously I prefer a straight green cash money sale!!!! Before I get a ton of calls wanting to trade me your Glock 29 or 20, let me clarify. Not really interested in any glocks. I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Kimber Eclipse, possible others. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow that shoots 335FPS or better, preferably a Barnett or Horton reverse limb...I really like the reverse limb styles, also possibly a excellent condition Desert Eagle or a High Quality Bolt Action Rifle especially the octagon Barrel types in Stainless such as A Browning A-Bolt White Gold Medallion with the octagon barrel. Also may consider a excellent condition lever action, no junk, I will not own any type of off brands no matter how many upgrades you have added!
 Really not looking for anything with scratches all except possibly the crossbow. Hope this clarifies everything!

ARES-15 MCR (Mission Configurable Rifle) 

ARES Defense is proud to introduce the ARES-15 MCR; our newest platform for professional shooters who demand performance and mission flexibility from their weapons! 

Key features include reliable mid-length gas-piston operation, a (3 second) quick-change barrel, extreme-duty breech bolt, vented high performance barrel extension, and dual-feed operation with installed belt-feed module. 

The entire weapon field strips in seconds with a cartridge as the only tool necessary.  

ARES-15 MCR Details 

Caliber: 5.56x45mm NATO 

Barrel: The MCR & Shrike 5.56 Quick-Change barrels are turned and chambered on precision MAZAK CNC turning centers from high quality 4140 and 4150V barrel blanks. Muzzle threads are cut to ½ x 28 TPI to accept most common muzzle devices and silencer mounts. Each high-strength and vented proprietary barrel extension is then carefully assembled to a barrel and torqued to exact specifications, and each barrel assembly is then individually checked to ensure proper head spacing. Once they are cleaned and inspected, the chambers and bores are hard-chrome lined for durability and corrosion resistance by an outside plating company that specializes in processing military rifle and machine gun barrels. Upon return to our facility, each barrel is subjected to additional quality control measures before being completed with a rich dark manganese phosphate finish prior to installation of the gas block. Gas blocks are secured with twin 2/0 taper pins and barrels are then fitted with a crush washer and A2 flash hider. All MCR and Shrike 5.56 barrels are fully interchangeable. 

Upper: The MCR and Shrike 5.56 upper receiver bodies are precision machined from 7075-T651 billet and are Type III, Class II hard coat anodized black in accordance with MIL-Spec MIL-A-8625 for maximum durability and corrosion resistance. 

Bolt: The premium bolts are precision machined from a proprietary aerospace alloy and heat treated to exacting specifications. The proprietary 6-lug design provides more shear strength than traditional AR type bolts, and also features tangential radii at the tips and root of each lug to minimize the stresses that cause premature failures in the “square-cut” legacy design. The MCR/Shrike 5.56 bolt design was developed for sustained fire applications and is considered overbuilt by most rifle standards, providing a level of safety that is absent in most other rifle designs. 

Barrel Extension: The specially engineered barrel extensions are at the heart of the quick-change barrel design and are precision machined from a proprietary aerospace alloy and heat treated to exacting specifications. The proprietary design provides more shear strength than traditional AR type barrel extensions, and also features radii at the tips and root of each lug to minimize the stresses that cause premature failures in “square-cut” legacy barrel extensions. The MCR/Shrike 5.56 barrel extension was developed for sustained fire applications and features a special “blowout” relief in the event of a catastrophic bore obstruction, providing a level of safety that is absent in most other weapon designs. 

Bolt Carrier: Each high-performance MCR bolt carrier is precision machined from aerospace materials and heat treated to exact specifications. The increased mass of the MCR carrier and increased dwell section of the bolt cam slot ensure a longer lockup time prior to extracting the cartridge case. This robust component was developed for sustained fire applications and features a shrouded firing pin area to protect the firing pin head from potential transverse loading by the hammer."

Nikon M-223 BDC (2-8 x 32mm) 
CAA Collapsible Buttstock
CAA Pistol Grip
MAGPUL rail covers
Trigger Job (NOT a target trigger, 2 stage, fairly clean break, no over travel)

The XCR-L is a great rifle.  It's modular in that you can swap out barrels within a certain caliber range.  It's piston driven utilizing what amounts to an AK gas system.  The bolt also shows it's AK heritage.  So it's ubber reliable, and runs cleaner and cooler than an AR.  The non-reciprocating charging handle is on the left of the rifle, similar to an G3, so you can cycle the bolt without breaking your cheek weld.  Yet the rifle sports a monorail setup, with a floated barrel, and ergonomics similar to an AR, but improved.  The bolt release is behind the magazine well, which is much faster than an AR's, and the safety selector switch sports a 45 degree throw from safe to semi.  This particular rifle shoots right at 1 moa for me.  The Nikon M-223 is a great match for the XCR, it's resettable turrets are fast and has proven serviceable out to 400 yards, it's included in the sale.   

Looking to extend my range, 5.56mm/.223 just isn't much good beyond 400 yards.  So I'd consider a trade for a PWS in .308.  Definitely not interested in any gimmicks, or having my time wasted.  If you're interested, or have any questions shoot me an email, and I'll get back to you.  

I'm not a dealer.  Any transaction will be conducted in accordance with Colorado Law, whether I agree with those laws or not.  So up until 1 Jul that means a face to face exchange, where I can verify your identity, or I can ship to an FFL of your choice at your cost."

I have 205 rounds of .380 ammo that I am interested in selling. I would like to recover most of the money that I have put into them. The Fiocchi cost me $20 a box (plus tax), and even though they are going for almost $30 a box right now I don't think that is fair.  The Blazer cost me $29.50 a box (plus tax), and their price has increased dramatically as well.  I need money, and I no longer own a .380.

I have;
3.6 boxes Fiocchi (brass) 95 gr FMJ (180 rounds)
1/2 Box of Blazer (aircraft grade aluminum casing, nice and light) 95 gr TMJ (25 rounds)

I have around $90 tied up in this ammunition.  You and I both know that the price has increased dramatically since then. Other posters on here are trying to take absolute advantage of the ammo shortage and and are asking absolutely ridiculous prices. I'm willing to let this whole lot go for $80.  Please text me at REDACTED to discuss where you would like to meet.  The closer to Saint Charles the better, I'm already losing money on this deal and I don't think you'll find a better one!

So im wondering if anyone has checked out any of the local shops and gunsmiths and had any luck in improving the trigger.

They do include the dust covers already attached the each magazine in the packaging. 

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. 

A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. Made in U.S.A.

They do include the dust covers already attached the each magazine in the packaging. 

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. 

A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. Made in U.S.A.

It is done by the very famous James Dietz that has done so many military prints, and well known around the world for the quality of his prints.

This one was never introduced to sell to the general public, they was commissioned for and by the CIA only.

The print depicts the CIA's SAD division during the first few days of the invasion of Afghanistan.

This is a very low print number, it is 154 of only 911 made to commemorate 911.


MORE INFORMATION ON THIS PRINT;

In the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks, the President of the United States ordered the Director of Central Intelligence to immediately launch operations against al-Qa’ida and its Taliban supporters in Afghanistan and to collect intelligence to help pave the way for US military operations. Within 15 days of the attacks in the United States, the first team of CIA officers was on the ground and operating in Afghanistan to make contacts with opposition groups in the prelude to Operation Enduring Freedom. Under CIA leadership, multiple paramilitary teams composed of extremely resourceful and courageous people worked alongside every key opposition tribal group around the country, usually in isolation far behind enemy lines and away from ground reinforcements.

Cast of a Few, Courage of a Nation was unveiled on 17 April 2008 to commemorate these early operations and the later combined efforts of US intelligence and military forces, Afghan allies, and coalition partners in Afghanistan. The painting depicts a CIA-owned, Soviet-built Mi-17 helicopter conducting a night resupply mission of food, equipment, operational funds, and ammunition to a team in Afghanistan. The scene, repeated hundreds of times in Afghanistan, conveys a sense of the perils and physical difficulty faced by small groups of paramilitary officers working in the hostile environment. The work resonated strongly for the veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom who were present at the unveiling. They all said Dietz’s painting has masterfully captured their own personal moments in the experience.

Unseen but implied is the full range of activity that goes into such missions, not only in Afghanistan, but in places many miles distant. Each landing would have included contingency planning and intelligence collection done months before; planning and coordination of the specific mission; rapid acquisition of equipment involved in the delivery; and the assembly and delivery of goods from main bases oceans away. People engaged in these efforts, but not seen in the painting, would have included operational planners, intelligence analysts, logisticians, security officers, indigenous allies, and US military components.

Unlike most Romanian rifles in this country, it was built in Romania, and as such, is of higher quality than WASRs, or others built by Century. It's one unique feature that most people notice is that the charging handle, rather than coming strait out of the bolt carrier at a 90 degree angle, it is bent upward at an angle to facilitate charging the rifle with a folding stock. 

This particular one has the original ""dragunov"" style stock and hand guards that are laminated wood (which is was originally imported with), a synthetic thumbhole stock (after market) and a set of traditional black synthetic furniture that it currently sits in.

Finally, this also comes with roughly 600 rounds of Russian surplus 5.45 (steel cased/cored, lacquered). Since I've owned it, I've shot 200 or so rounds through it- functions wonderfully, as it should. Only reason I want to get rid of it, is that I've decided to go a different direction. 

5.45, if you're not aware, is fairly plentiful at various sources, and is extraordinarily cheap to shoot (roughly half of what .223 is per round, even cheaper today seeing as .223 is going for 50 cents a round at best). 

I only want to travel locally, IE, no more than 20 minutes away. I won't part it out, but  considering what I'm asking for it, you're going to come out ahead."

Never Fired!,"Allen Park, Detroit, Michigan","$ 1,500","Listed On: Sunday, May 19, 2013",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,no type,no type,Pistol,"PICTURES SHOWN BELOW ARE ACTUAL FIREARM BEING SOLD.

I picked this gun up from my FFL dealer on 05/09/2013 exactly 9 days ago. I brought it home and field stripped it and lubbed it up with Frog Lube (the best!)and into the humidity controlled safe she stays. This is the newer version of Colt's Delta Elite 10mm Brand New in Box, Never fired! Not the model from the 1980's. The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new or shown in the pictures below.

You know having one of these is on your bucket list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well they are only going to get harder to find brand new!

Some have asked how to tell the difference between the old version and the new. Well first the texture of the grips is the first giveaway, 2nd the amount of the trigger that is exposed is greater on the newer version. I am sure there are other ways to tell, these are the 2 that I am aware of.

At this point since I am just listing it, I do not want to ship out of state right now and go through the hassle so local FTF transaction only and I will only sell to a person with a purchase permit or CPL and I will show you my ID to prove I am the rightful owner and I will make copies of your id for my records to cover my butt in case this gun falls into the wrong hands. In other words don't think you are going to pull one over on me, I am by the book!

Price is $1500 FIRM Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less. I will not respond to these offers at all!!!
Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price. I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com. Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold. Almost every single one sold for almost exactly $1500 or very close so I know this is what I can get. It would cost me probably $20 for gunauction's sellers fees, but it would cost the buyer who almost always pays for the sellers FFL to handle the paperwork & ship it out which includes my FFL's fee and shipping which the price varies between $40 and $60 depending if you get insurance. Then you have to pay about $25 to $40 for your FFL to receive the gun and then if you use a credit card almost everyone charges 3% for that. So all these people paying the $1500 on gunauction after all fees are auctually paying $1600 or more. So that is how I got my price. No shipping and waiting and hoping it doesn't get damaged, you can fully inspect prior to your purchase, and you can take it home with you immediately. I know I could get a much faster sale to just list it, but I am just trying to help out my local fellow shooters.

I do not need to sell, but looking to get a different 10mm, one I can actually shoot without feeling guilty and not have a safe queen. Obviously I prefer a straight green cash money sale!!!! Before I get a ton of calls wanting to trade me your Glock 29 or 20, let me clarify. Not really interested in any glocks. I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Kimber Eclipse, possible others. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow that shoots 335FPS or better, preferably a Barnett or Horton reverse limb...I really like the reverse limb styles, also possibly a excellent condition Desert Eagle or a High Quality Bolt Action Rifle especially the octagon Barrel types in Stainless such as A Browning A-Bolt White Gold Medallion with the octagon barrel. Also may consider a excellent condition lever action, no junk, I will not own any type of off brands no matter how many upgrades you have added!

I picked this gun up from my FFL dealer on 05/09/2013 exactly 9 days ago. I brought it home and field stripped it and lubbed it up with Frog Lube (the best!). This is the newer version of Colt's Delta Elite 10mm Brand New in Box, Never fired! Not the model from the 1980's. The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new or shown in the pictures below.

You know having one of these is on your bucket list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well they are only going to get harder to find brand new!

Some have asked how to tell the difference between the old version and the new. Well first the texture of the grips is the first giveaway, 2nd the amount of the trigger that is exposed is greater on the newer version. I am sure there are other ways to tell, these are the 2 that I am aware of.

At this point since I am just listing it, I do not want to ship out of state right now and go through the hassle so local FTF transaction only and I will only sell to a person with a purchase permit or CPL and I will show you my ID to prove I am the rightful owner and I will make copies of your id for my records to cover my butt in case this gun falls into the wrong hands. In other words don't think you are going to pull one over on me, I am by the book!

Price is $1500 FIRM Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less. I will not respond to these offers at all!!!
Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price. I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com. Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold. Almost every single one sold for almost exactly $1500 or very close so I know this is what I can get. It would cost me probably $20 for gunauction's sellers fees, but it would cost the buyer who almost always pays for the sellers FFL to handle the paperwork & ship it out which includes my FFL's fee and shipping which the price varies between $40 and $60 depending if you get insurance. Then you have to pay about $25 to $40 for your FFL to receive the gun and then if you use a credit card almost everyone charges 3% for that. So all these people paying the $1500 on gunauction after all fees are auctually paying $1600 or more. So that is how I got my price. No shipping and waiting and hoping it doesn't get damaged, you can fully inspect prior to your purchase, and you can take it home with you immediately. I know I could get a much faster sale to just list it, but I am just trying to help out my local fellow shooters.

I do not need to sell, but looking to get a different 10mm, one I can actually shoot without feeling guilty and not have a safe queen. Obviously I prefer a straight green cash money sale!!!! Before I get a ton of calls wanting to trade me your Glock 29 or 20, let me clarify. Not really interested in any glocks. I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Kimber Eclipse, possible others. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow that shoots 335FPS or better, preferably a Barnett or Horton reverse limb...I really like the reverse limb styles, also possibly a excellent condition Desert Eagle or a High Quality Bolt Action Rifle especially the octagon Barrel types in Stainless such as A Browning A-Bolt White Gold Medallion with the octagon barrel. Also may consider a excellent condition lever action, no junk, I will not own any type of off brands no matter how many upgrades you have added!

The right side of the barrel is marked ""S.&W. 357 Magnum"". The Trade Mark logo and the 4-line “Marcas Registradas” address are on the right side of the frame. The frame, under the yoke, is marked ""AAF5860 / M / Mod. 686"". The yoke is marked ""B20 / S / 18623"". The left side of the grip frame is marked ""1 / 2 / B20 / S / 18623"". The right grip frame is marked ""V / B / 07530"". 
This revolver is mounted with an orange insert ramp front sight and a windage and elevation adjustable rear sight. The grips are target style checkered wood grips. The bottom edges show some wear and thinning. The right panel shows some chipping at the bottom and wear to the checkering from the case. There is some discoloration from handling and from the case. The grips rate in about Very Good overall condition.   The bore is bright with a bit of fouling and the rifling is sharp. There is no pitting or erosion.     This revolver retains about 85% of its metal finish. The contact surfaces show rubbing from handling, and storage in the case. This is typical with all the stainless S&W's. This revolver was cleaned heavily at some time, explaining the lack of lead rings on the front of the cylinder and also some of the dulling. What is great about stainless is that it can always be polished or brushed back to whatever shine you desire. The Screw heads are a bit worn. The markings are crisp. Overall, this revolver rates in about Very Good - Fine condition.     The action functions correctly, both single and double action. We did not fire this revolver.   This revolver comes in a S&W wood box. The lid has deteriorated, flaking velvet dust over the gun when the gun is in the case. The box is sound, though scratched. The cleaning swab is retained. This is not the correct box insert for this gun. The insert is for a gun without a full under lug. 

The Smith & Wesson 686 is possibly the best double action revolver ever made. This one is in great condition, features the red ramp insert on the front sight, and has an under lug barrel, which makes it a very handsome as well as robust revolver. Chambered in the hard-hitting .357 caliber, it will also fire .38 special rounds which offer less blast and flash, and which can be loaded down. Dependable, accurate, trouble free – this revolver will make its new owner very happy!."

I picked this gun up from my FFL dealer on 05/09/2013 exactly 9 days ago. I brought it home and field stripped it and lubbed it up with Frog Lube (the best!). This is the newer version of Colt's Delta Elite 10mm Brand New in Box, Never fired! Not the model from the 1980's. The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new or shown in the pictures below.

You know having one of these is on your bucket list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well they are only going to get harder to find brand new!

Some have asked how to tell the difference between the old version and the new. Well first the texture of the grips is the first giveaway, 2nd the amount of the trigger that is exposed is greater on the newer version. I am sure there are other ways to tell, these are the 2 that I am aware of.

At this point since I am just listing it, I do not want to ship out of state right now and go through the hassle so local FTF transaction only and I will only sell to a person with a purchase permit or CPL and I will show you my ID to prove I am the rightful owner and I will make copies of your id for my records to cover my butt in case this gun falls into the wrong hands. In other words don't think you are going to pull one over on me, I am by the book!

Price is $1500 FIRM Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less. I will not respond to these offers at all!!!
Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price. I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com. Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold. Almost every single one sold for almost exactly $1500 or very close so I know this is what I can get. It would cost me probably $20 for gunauction's sellers fees, but it would cost the buyer who almost always pays for the sellers FFL to handle the paperwork & ship it out which includes my FFL's fee and shipping which the price varies between $40 and $60 depending if you get insurance. Then you have to pay about $25 to $40 for your FFL to receive the gun and then if you use a credit card almost everyone charges 3% for that. So all these people paying the $1500 on gunauction after all fees are auctually paying $1600 or more. So that is how I got my price. No shipping and waiting and hoping it doesn't get damaged, you can fully inspect prior to your purchase, and you can take it home with you immediately. I know I could get a much faster sale to just list it, but I am just trying to help out my local fellow shooters.

I do not need to sell, but looking to get a different 10mm, one I can actually shoot without feeling guilty and not have a safe queen. Obviously I prefer a straight green cash money sale!!!! Before I get a ton of calls wanting to trade me your Glock 29 or 20, let me clarify. Not really interested in any glocks. I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Kimber Eclipse, possible others. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow that shoots 335FPS or better, preferably a Barnett or Horton reverse limb...I really like the reverse limb styles, also possibly a excellent condition Desert Eagle or a High Quality Bolt Action Rifle especially the octagon Barrel types in Stainless such as A Browning A-Bolt White Gold Medallion with the octagon barrel. Also may consider a excellent condition lever action, no junk, I will not own any type of off brands no matter how many upgrades you have added!
Really not looking for anything with scratches all except possibly the crossbow. Hope this clarifies everything!
