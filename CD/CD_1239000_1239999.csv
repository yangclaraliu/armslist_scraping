This is the infamous, now collectible, 42% Makers Mark  bottle. In an interview a couple of weeks ago, a chairman announced the company would start ""watering down"" Makers Mark from the traditional 45% (90 proof) to 42% (85 proof). Within a week they changed their minds from the tremendous outcry. Very few bottles were released of the 42% before they started back with the 45%.

It is less than one month old, and has only fired 2-3 boxes of .223 in an indoor range for function testing and sighting in. 

Specs: caliber .223/5.56 NATO, 16"" barrel, 1x9 twist, A2 birdcage flash hider, Forged 7075 T6 upper and lower receivers,  A3 Flattop upper receiver, 6-position collapsible stock. 

This is NOT the cheap DPMS Sportical that Wal-Mart sells. This rifle has a Mil-spec A2 front sight base, M4 feed ramps machined in the upper receiver, a brass deflector, forward assist assembly, and dust cover - all features not found in the cheaper Wal-Mart model. 

Comes with two (2) unused 30-round factory magazines, strap, original box and owner's manual, and chamber lock. I have also added a Magpul flip-up MBUS rear sight, which will be included in the sale.

Just got in some brand new black Tapco Intrafuse Gen II polymer 30 round mags for sale. Very sturdy, feed reliably, and wont dent or rust. Tapco provides a lifetime warranty for all of their magazines.

Tapco AK47 mags: $20 each, these fit like a glove in WASR's, and work great in Yugos, Russian, Chinese and others. Only AK I have come across that these don't fit are Serbian. I like these better than my surplus combloc mags, I cannot believe how sturdy these things are. I will also offer quantity discounts on these, ask for details.

Gen II Tapco AR15 mags: $20 each. From the manufacturer:

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine.  It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine.  First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel.  Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds.  Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine.  Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

I am not interested in guns and am selling guns that were given to me after my father's death. I am using the money to pay for my college tuition. This gun was kept in a leather case and needs to be cleaned. I may clean it before I send it to you. The bore looks good and the body of the gun looks good, but needs a thorough cleaning. I understand that this gun is over 40 years old. There is some surface issues on the top part of the gun. The dealer I brought it to said it should come off with a cleaning as it is just a superficial issue. If you want to explain how I should clean it I can clean it for you. The dealer said it is in good condition if I were to clean it it may be in excellent condition. I took it to the range with my brother in law and it fires well. My price is negotiable however I think it is a really nice gun. So the highest legitimate offer will get the gun.

It has original box with hand written serial info, inside packing, papers.  I took it to the gun store to help verify facts.  There is some slight carbon inside the barrel at the chamber.  Store said it is likely from the test fire at factory.  It could be easily cleaned but I do not want to alter the gun at all.  They said the gun was impecable.  Said even if it had been fired it would be at 98%, but again, said that the carbon was probably from factory test fire.  I rechecked with my father and he assures me it has never been removed from packaging until I took pictures.  

Serial number is N57####, so it should be dated somewhere 1978-1980 production.  4"" barrel. If you are reading this, you know these guns are getting harder and harder to find and especially one with box, papers and factory new.  He is only looking to SELL, sorry, no trades."

This is the real thing not an aftermarket reproduction. The barrel is stamped 45-75 Sharps after some research I found that the 45-75 sharps is the same as the 45-70. The serial number puts this gun in the 1864 to 65 range. I have researched this gun in books and contacted Dr. Labowski who is the authority on the sharps Rifle and he said with the barrel stamped as 45-75 sharps it was probably converted at the factory in the 1870’s. The gun has had some work done to it I think in the 1960 judging by some of the materials used. I think someone did not know that the 45-75 sharps is the same as the 45-70 and had the barrel set back and possibly refinished. I am asking $1200.00 for this gun open to offers.
