I purchased this pistol about two weeks ago, and intended it to be for training and taking classes. I did however purchase anothe pistol at the same time, and no longer have a need for this one. This is the Lipsey's special edition. The frame is grey from the factory, and the slide is cerakoted to mathcn. It has a very clean look and also looks darker than the pictures show depending on the light. I have cleaned, and dry fired this pistol, but I have not actually shot it, so it currently sits a zero rounds. This pistol will also come with some extras! It will come with an Inforce APLC weapon mounted light which has been mounted, but is also unused ($115) Vickers grip plus tool ($20) and also a black point tactical holster $(70). I used this holster lightly for a few months with my other Glock 19 which I no longer have, so I am including it. I am asking $660 firm for all of this! I believe that is a very good deal! These all gray models are going for about $560-570 right now so for the pistol, the light, and the holster, and grip tool, and original box with all accesories. Plus you will save on taxes and shipping.If interested please email the listing. I will NOT sell to you without a valid ID, CPL, and or purchase permit.

This is achieved by means of weighted wads that you can insert in the buttstock. The result is a shotgun that will truly feel like an extension of the body--your body.Micro Core Recoil PadThe Micro Core recoil pad is designed to do two primary things.

From Arsenals Web Site:  Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.  Arsenal's Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal's hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.  Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal's meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.  Summary: SAM7R-51 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, Arsenal, Inc.'s US made hammer forged and machined trigger that features a wider trigger grip for more comfort on the shooter's finger and a Bulgarian Warsaw Pact length buttstock, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

Light surface rust over the whole gun. I do see the number 180 stamped on the right side of the gun and the number 119 stamped on the left side in the frame under the cylinder.

First owner, only put under 100 rounds through it (I sent it pretty early on for the upgrade program.) I'm lacking a good semi-auto rifle so I'm looking to fill the slot, so I'm listing it here. Comes with two 15-round magazines, some ammo and a Concealment Express kydex holster with the utiliclip, linked below. Feel free to ask me any questions! Looking for anything semi-auto rifle/carbine/PDW sized that's not an AR. Just not an AR fan, but I'm down for nearly anything else. I got some more stuff to toss in and can work out some cash to make up some value if needed.

Manufacturer's Description: Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever.

The gun features an MSE AQC-1C and Magpul MS4 Dual QD Sling I paid over $800 for the optic in 2015 and recently purchased the $60 sling.
The only slightest defect on the entire rifle is the external threads of the buffer tube. When installing the QD endplate, some of the threads were marred. It does not affect the buffer tube that threads into the receiver, and could be easily replaced for $40.$1,300 w/o optic. $1,800 w/ optic."

Never one malfunction. Its a OPAP so it has the 1.5mm receiver, and the heavy duty trunion. The furniture on this is a good color (Not too blonde) and has the Zastavia crest on the stock. Trigger is really good. Overall fit and finish on this one is prob a 7 out of 10. Ive seen nicer OPAP's but odds are if your buying a OPAP (Or a AK for that matter) you could care less about looks.  It does have a small piece at the front sight base hosuing thats damaged but doesnt affect operation at all. It was like that when I got it and I coudnt exchange it cause they were drying up. Rifle hits a 8"" steel plate at 100 yrds all day. If your a PA resident you MUST have a valid PA drivers license AND a LTCF for a face to face. NO EXCEPTIONS. If you have a valid PA license and no LTCF then we will transfer through FFL.
