I’ve fired less than 5 magazines through this.  Nice fun and handy gun but we just got an SBR AR so I’m willing to part with it. 

Easy to take down; uses common AR mags (factory one is included), top and bottom rails, a 9.2” barrel and only 3.42 pounds unloaded!  Would be awesome suppressed!

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

2HBCT= 2nd Heavy Brigade Combat Team
1CD = 1st Calvary Division
11-12 = DEC 2011

Also on 15 Decenber, exactly eight months to the day they cased their colors, Soldiers with the 2nd ""Black Jack"" Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division assembled again on Cooper Field and uncased their colors, marking one of the last units to leave Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn and allowing Soldiers to be home just in time for the holidays. The Brigade had operated primarily in the Northern Iraqi Joint Operations area.

Being home for the holidays came as a surprise to the Black Jack Soldiers. They didn't know until a couple of weeks ago that they would be back before the Christmas holiday, and they were very fortunate everything worked out.

Many Black Jack Soldiers agreed that being one of the last units to leave their footprint in Iraq made their numerous deployment rotations, loss of comrades and countless holidays away from loved ones well worth it."

This gun is PREFERRED OVER the 6920.

dont let the fact that 6720 is a lower number than 6920 confuse you.  Search google for ""6720 or 6920"" all day long, and see that those who own both or chose one of the other, prefer the 6720 4 out of 5 times!

I hate seeing these 6920's going for more than the 6720 just because of the panic, and people buying without knowing enough about the guns.  the 6720 MSRPs and sells in stores for more than the 6920--- its a little bit nicer.


email any questions.  looking to sell, i have it sitting at my FFL, havent even transferred it in to my name.  Wanted to keep it but expenses came in.

Milled receiver.
Flat bayonet.
Plus: 400 rounds FMJ ammo

All numbers match, incleuding receiver, bolt, action, magazine and stock.
Bore is in excellent condition.
Wood has my name carved in.
Comes with a 4x30 scope.
Original receiver cover is included, to keep it's C&R status so it doesnt need to be registered in NYS.
Also included a 5-round hunting magazine.

Shoots great; under 3 MOA at 100 yards which is pretty good for an SKS.

Owned it for ~10 years and never had any single jam, no matter what ammo it was fed.

Just to be clear: with the new law in effect, the value of the SKS is that unlike AK it does not need to be registered. As you know it, once you register something, you're on the hook, be it a car or a boat.
It shoots better than 99% of AKs even with iron sights (due to a longer barrel and short gas action alike SVD). Scoped, it shoots about 1.5x better over iron sights.

This SKS can be topped from an open receiver, round by round, or from strip-clips.
Eight old black steel strip-clips are included.


P. S. I did receive many angry emails about me gauging price.
 I'm not selling it to make a quick profit! 
Face it: these crazy prices are a new reality, folks; there is no way back.
If you listen carefully for what Brian Olson said on Talk1300, he's hinting of
leaving NYS... without his support and his stores gone, there's not much left.

NYS SAFE act is here for good, its not going to be repealed even if one million people show up on Feb-28 rally ... it's Albany real-politik what matters.

As for me, I'm selling this rifle to get more into target shooting."

Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

Vepr in 7.62x39 caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.

Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage."

The great thing about it is you can build or buy a different caliber upper and pin it on and go, most of the .22 AR's will not do this. The ONLY reason I want the 416 .22 is because I have the real deal Hk 416 and am looking for a matching .22. Please do not contact me if you are overpricing your rifle, we both know mine is worth more, I am willing to trade even just to have a matching pair.

I bought this around 1993 and believe it to be a pre 1989 based on research I have done.  I kept it new in the box for about 15 years and pulled it out to fire it just for fun and shot about 6-8 rounds through it.  It was awesome, nice clean kick but easy to hold your aim.  I have included a 20 round Mag polymer I believe and a brand new Metal Mag 30 round that I just bought.  This is not the trash SKS's you see everywhere, and it has rare parts like, cleaning kit in but stock, Chinese bayonet Geneva Convention approved and shoulder strap.  I am including a sealed tuna can of FMJ ammo 700 rounds, I bought that about 2 years ago at the Dixie Gun and Knife show.  I am asking $750 for the entire lot and will not break it up.  I may be able to find some stipper clips and possibly some more ammo for it.  This is a great price considering this is not a trashy modified, altered, piece of bulk crap. If your buying something for protection buy something reliable.  If you want a trashy $300 SKS please go buy it.  Then you can dump $40 into a mag, another $40 into a spare, and a few hundred into ammo, you still have a trashy SKS.  Here you have a nice quality one with all the bells and whistles, mags (one steel one polymer), and tons of ammo to shoot. 

You WILL have to meet me at local gun shop for $20-25 transfer due to the nature of assault rifle.  I will pay transfer.   I researched the ammo today and it is good stuff, not that wolf junk.  

Email me your phone number if your interested.  If you are not the purchaser do not contact me.  

Below I have added some info about the importer of this firearm I found online:
GLNIC: Was a company incorporated in Los Angeles, California in May of 1986. They were reportedly an import company owned exclusively by the PLA. Guangdon Lingnan Ind. Corp GLNIC LA CA is ""GLNIC Corporation of America"", a company based in California, but owned by the People's Liberation Army of China. GLNIC may stand for ""Guangdon Lingnan Ind. Corp."" or ""Guangdon Lingnan Import Company"". The letters ""CGA"" may be stamped on the trunnion ahead of the serial number on early-import GLNIC AK47S rifles, and it appears that CGA was the exporter for pre-1989 GLNIC-imported AK47S and SKS rifles (later rifles were exported by Norinco).

Featuring an integral 1913accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosionresistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the latest model to join thefamily of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. The SP-01 utilizesan extended beavertail to protect shooter s strong hand as well as allowingfor a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in keyareas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided bythe accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previousmodels and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. TheSP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The CZ75  SP-01 model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war onterrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handlingcharacteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field ofsport and target shooting.

Let me state upfront that I am not an expert on these guns but will tell you what I know as relates to their function and condition. I am taking their values from the Fjestad Blue Book which I have always found to be a solid source. I'd rate this Navy as 10% according to the book and have priced it a bit below that. There is no roll engraving scene left, and what I can see of the the address on the barrel top is ""Address Col SamL...""  The serial numbers I can see all match and the 25--- SN would place this gun's year of manufacture as 1865...the last year of the Civil War. The ""36 CAL"" is quite distinct on the side of the trigger guard. It functions well, with the exception that when the hammer is cocked, the cylinder does not always fall in place exactly as it should, needing a hand adjustment at times. The only part that I believe to be not original to the gun is the screw that holds the barrel wedge in place. While it is not museum piece, it is a very good and serviceable weapon of the Civil War period. I'll take your personal check in payment or any other conventional financial instrument.  Personal check would have to clear. Add $20 for shipping. I'll listen to any offer, if yoiu do not think I have evaluated it sufficiently well.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches."

840,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1017840,"For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 LR/T 4.5-14x50 Mildot, not illuminated, M1","Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama",$ 875,"Listed On: Thursday, February 7, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a used Leupold LR/T 4.5-14 x 50 Mil-Dot Scope with a set of Warne Maxima rings and butler creek flip up caps $875. The scope sells new online for $1199. There are no scratches on the lenses. Very very faint ring marks (no gouges). It was on my 700p that never really saw any field use, just some range time and a few hunting trips. I swapped scopes around and was going to put this on an AR15 but I decided I want something a little more compact.

I also have an extra unmounted Badger 20 moa 1 piece mount for a 700 short action that I will include for $100 more if you buy the scope. Not really interested in selling the base otherwise. 

The only trade I'd be interested in is a Nightforce nxs 2.5-10 x 32 or 2.5-10 x 24. 

I had this mounted to a Remington 700p with a Badger 20moa rail so it will fit that set up FYI

This is not the illuminated model. I do not have the box. This IS NOT a replica or a ""style"" scope. I know there are a lot of good fakes out there and I've almost been bitten by them myself before. So if you have any concern about the authenticity I urge you to look at the link below. Identifies the distinguishing characteristics of the Chinese fakes.

I urge you to look at it whether or not you buy my scope. I see a lot of fakes getting sold on ebay for unreasonably high prices and I can't help but think the the unsuspecting bidders are getting ripped off. 

I'd be willing to drive within reasonable distance of Birmingham to meet someone if they are purchasing the scope. I'm not going to drive 50 miles so you can ""kick the tires"" so-to-speak."

So I am not an expert on these handguns and took their valuation from the Fjestad Blue Book...my gun bible. On this particular handgun there is no roll engraving  left visible and the original finish is gone having turned dark and silvered, with some old pitting. All serial numbers that I can see match and the 1355-- SN would place its year of manufacture as 1863, smack in the middle of the Civil War. The only part of the address on the top of the barrel that I can read is ""Colt US New York America"".
