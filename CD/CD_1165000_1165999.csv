These are on the top of Obama’s ban list!  Professional modifications are as follows: 
Gas ports properly sized so that cheaper low-brass ammo can be used; Bolt and carrier ground and polished at contact/action points for smoother action and easier magazine installation; Fire control group replaced with US-Made G2 unit and moved forward; fire control group is also machined and polished for supreme fit and function; Trigger guard replaced with modified 5-rivet AKM unit; Pistol grip nut clearance machined into receiver and grip moved forward; The entire firearms is then coated with extremely corrosion resistant, mil-spec SSI phosphate parkerizing, which is then sprayed with Graphite Black CeraKote -  proven to be the Absolute BEST gun coating available! Most firearms have a single coating, but we integrate a Dual-Coverage System for long-term corrosion-proof usage and unmatched protection.
Premium features are as follows:
18.5” threaded barrel; US-Made 6-Position Mil-Spec Telescoping stock with rubber shoulder pad and rigid billet trunnion mount, Veriforce tactical pistol grip; US-Made aircraft aluminum, hard anodized handguard with extended top rail for iron and or other optics; Indexed SGM slotted breacher muzzle brake; modified G2 fire control group with shepherd’s hook retainer; Bolt hold-open latch; side-rail scope mount; Fitted and tested ProMag 10-round magazine; MFT Vertical foregrip (Rubberized) NOTE: red dot is not included, as it is for display/photo purposes only.
Also includes the following original Russian OEM items:
Owner’s manual; oil can; tool/cleaning kit; long cleaning rod.
If you're in the market for the ultimate defensive weapon, a competition shotgun, or just a high-quality scatter gun, get yours while they last. This is a solid and affective Russian shotgun, tweaked to perfection…and it will last for decades. NOTE: red dot is not included, as it is for display/photo purposes only.

I’m including a Safariland leather holster, 4 HKS speedloaders, 92 rds. Fiocchi 158 gr. .357 mag, bore snake, EWK barrel wrench, feeler gauge and assorted parts/springs. The external lugs of the barrel nut have been stripped, but I do have a new one. The cylinder gap is fine so I have not messed with replacing it. I haven’t had this revolver too long, but it is a tack driver in double action. Single action is obviously even more so. Bluing is in very good shape other the a cylinder drag line and right at the muzzle.

Will not sell for under $400. Buyer must show valid CO driver’s license/CHP and be 21+. 

Will only meet in Fort Collins, and will only meet with those in the immediate area. I do not have time for those driving from Denver or elsewhere to not show up."

Magpul is pleased to announce the latest addition to the PMAG family: the PMAG 30 M3. Like its predecessors, the PMAG 30 M3 is a lightweight 5.56 x 45 NATO / .223 Remington 30-round polymer magazine for the AR15/M16 platform, but with a number of new features which improve its durability, compatibility, and overall performance for the most demanding professional shooters. By combining the knowledge gained from years of PMAG production, extensive research and development of materials and manufacturing processes, and incorporating feedback from a broad range of end-users, the PMAG 30 M3 pushes the envelope of magazine performance one step further.

The PMAG 30 M3 features a corrosion-resistant stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower, pop-off Impact/Dust Cover that snaps onto the floorplate when not in use, and easy tool-less disassembly for cleaning and maintenance. Low-profile ribs and aggressive front and rear texture provide positive control of the magazine while helping ensure compatibility with common double and triple magazine pouches. The easy to disassemble standard flared floorplate provides drop protection and aids extraction from magazine pouches, but can be replaced by a PMAG Ranger Plate for improved handling, or the new M3 Slim-line floor plate to minimize bulk (not included). A paint pen dot matrix (click here for marking guide) has been added to the bottom panel of the magazine body for easy marking by the end user for magazine identification.

I am particularly interested in: m&p 15-22 mags, Ruger lc9, M&p shield, mosin nagant or other firearms.

These are actually pistols but I thought most people would be looking for them in the rifle section. These are newly made and not old stock thats been arround since the 60's. These were just made but only a certain amount have made it to the US. with this kind of firepower in such a small package they are surely to be banned. The front barrel is threaded with a thread cover on it.  *Better than CAI semi-auto AKS Draco

Due to recent legislation which is highly likely to become law soon in Colorado Magpul may be forced to leave the state or go out of business. What this means for the future of these fantastic magazines is unknown. Magpul being the Great company they are will do there best to get production up and running again as soon as possible (currently 1,000,000 Pmags on back order), but will it be before a possible mag ban comes down from the federal government....I sure hope so. Please write the politicians in Colorado and tell them NOT to do this.....

Update: Magpul will be moving there company, it is official. They are also doing something awesome, from now until the new law goes into effect the will be selling all the mags they are manufacturing to Colorado residents. 
But unfortunately between the fact that all there mags will be going to Colorado residents and them having to move there company it will be a long time before we start to see mags flow back into the market. So it is truly becoming a get em while you can situation.

Asking $300 for the gun with a 10 rd magazine. *edit* sale pending
Asking $60.00 each the BX-25 rd magazines and I have 6  *edit* 2 of them. *edit* sale pending

The high capacity ban passed the communist committee last night in the Colorado Senate. So effective July 1st these magazines will not be available to Colorado residents for purchase!"

This one is in very good mechanical condition with a shiney bore and good rifling.
The outer surfaces aren't perfect but better than average for this type.
There is only one magazine. The leather flap holster in the picture is included as well as 15 rounds of full metal jacket ammo. 

Companies such as Fiocchi, Sellior & Bellot, Prvi Partizan, and Brown bear are producing new 9x18mm ammo so it's nearly as available as most other handgun ammo. 

It's a really handy size. Some people use these for conceal-carry (with a different holster of course), home protection, as car-guns, or for plinking. I like it and am only selling because I need the money... so no trades.

Comes with the hard case, manual, everything that comes with it when you buy it as far as I know. If there was a spent casing in the box when it was new, that's gone, but beside that it has everything.

It also has a trigger shoe installed on it, the packaging that came in is also in the box along with the tiny allen wrench used to install/remove it. For those unfamiliar with the P-11 it has a bit of a heavy trigger pull (dual-action only) and a narrow stock trigger. Without the trigger shoe it can be a pain to shoot for very long at the range. The shoe is easy to remove or install as you please.

I have a used but not abused cheap nylon holster that I'll throw in if you want it. It has some rubbery-type grip dots on the outside for IWB carry. Nothing fancy, but it'll do the job.

In my non-professional opinion the gun shoots pretty well for its size. I'm happy to let interested buyers shoot a box or two of ammo (byo) at a local range."

The fire control group is a Tapco G2 trigger and the barrel is chrome lined and US made. The gun is thoroughly 922r compliant (with extra US parts above and beyond what it needs to be to be legal).

Vector no longer is producing HK clones and this weapon has been discontinued. Furthermore, due to assault weapon ban fears, all remaining on hand inventory has been sold out so there will be no more of these available unless someone (like me) decides to part with theirs. Pre ban scare craziness retail price on this weapon was $2,500. I have personally upgraded the gun with two extra 30 round magazines, a magazine coupler, HK single point sling and a complete clipped and pinned SEF Navy grip housing in addition to the original SUO lower. Comes with the original box, paperwork and documentation. Factory recommended break in period with the lubricating grease still in the gun is 200 rounds. The gun has only seen 100 rounds (per the factory it has not been cleaned out internally and should not be until the 200 round count is reached).

This is one of the best HK clone builds out there using all original HK full auto parts on a semi-auto shelf receiver with a semi fire control group. This gun is an ideal NFA host gun ready to receive a registered NFA full-auto trigger pack (where allowed by law).

Price is $3,000 firm cash only, no trades of any kind. Get it before Feinstein does as it is listed BY NAME in her gun ban bill. Must have valid WA drivers license and CPL or WAC (or I will be taking down your drivers license info. and requiring you complete a detailed bill of sale)."

Please note that this is the Duty edition, which includes an upgraded barrel made by Lothar-Walther in Germany. 

At the time of manufacturing in November, this upper sold for about $2400 with shipping.  Given the 6 to 8 month wait period required to buy one brand new, I am asking $2300.  For an additional $60, I will ship anywhere in the US where legal.

Introducing the S&W M&P15R upper in 5.45x39 caliber specifically designed to offset the rising cost of 5.56 ammo.

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a collectible caliber rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

Since their introduction nearly half a century ago, the Hämmerli model 208 series of target pistols have won more metals than any semi-automatic pistol in the world and still hold the World Record for 25 meter Standard pistols SET THREE DECADES AGO; so much for new alloys and CAD vs ""ole school"" craftsmanship! They represent the epitome of match target pistols; ""Elite of Elite"" capable of 5 shot contiguous group accuracy at 25 meters. Always in limited quanity, production/importation ceased a generation ago! I purchased this particular gun in the mid-1990s at the liquidation of a COLLECTOR'S inventory (firearm is COLLECTOR condition, not ""range condition!) at a major auction house and have never fired it (I have ANOTHER 208s that I shoot). This Model 208 has full anatomical stocks, WITH factory top rib scope mount (RARE) and is in NRA EXCELLENT overall condition. Ideal for any serious competitive shooter and/or collector seeking an appreciable HARD ASSET INVESTMENT in today's uncertain world. Of course, you can always buy a CD and get 6/10 of 1% interest per year, and then pay TAXES on it, and still will not be able to enjoy shooting the ""Elite of the Elite.""

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a rare rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

Took this out again today and shot 100 rounds through it. It definately likes the 70gr ammo more then the 53 gr surplus.

Selling my M+M/Colorado guns M10 AK74 in 5.45x39. It comes with 1 surplus Bulgarian magazine and a AR15 mag adapter (ASC mag is not included). Has the factory Hogue grip and railed forend.  The rifle functions fine with regular AK74 mags , and ASC/CProducts 545 AR mags lock up 100% in the adapter. I went through and cleaned up the trunion to allow the ASC mags to lock into place consistently.  Asking $700 with just the Bulgarian 5.45 mag, add $90 for the AR mag adapter.  

This rifle does not accept Tapco mags currently.  The mag catch needs to be trimmed slightly or the Tapco mags need to be fitted to the rifle. I use surplus mags and havent needed to trim the mag release.

Stock # MMH240402RT. Serial # 44xx n. One of about 80 Lugers we currently have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings – we also have hundreds of other guns, militaria, edged weapons, etc.), this is a German-Made (DWM) 1900 Swiss Luger, chambered for .30 Luger. We will now describe the gun, however if you need more details, please call our In-Store Luger Expert, Randy Thompson, @: 214-363-2767 during business hours. Made in Germany by DWM for the Swiss Military, the 1900 Swiss has a 4” tapered barrel. The pistol is DWM-marked on the toggle, and it has the Swiss Cross on the receiver. The pistol has the fat toggles, but it has a grip safety. Numbered in the commercial fashion, the pistol is all matching, except for the correct, wood-based magazine. The German “Crown N” proof appears on various parts of the gun, there are NO importers markings anywhere on the gun, however it is marked “GERMANY” on the right side of the receiver, indicating the gun was shipped to the USA for commercial sales. The pistol has holster wear in the usual placed – the sideplate and the tip of the barrel, and there is also mild freckling in both of those areas, otherwise the original finish rates about 90-95%, with at least 60% of the original straw remaining. The original checkered wooden ngrips show moderate wear, and rate 85-90%. The pistol has a really shiny bore with strong rifling, and trigger pull is smooth. This is a nice 1900 Swiss Luger that you will be glad to have in your collection.

Stock # MSH252709SP. Serial # K692xx. One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is one of several High Quality Colt Pythons we currently have for sale. After a bit of a dry spell, Jackson Armory is once again endeavoring to bring you the finest assortment of Colt “Snake Guns” (Pythons and Diamondbacks) available anywhere, this is a nice one! Finished in Colt’s “E-Nickel” (Electroless Nickel) the finish looks a bit like stainless steel, but it is much scarcer, and certainly is a desirable finish for the Collector. Made in 1981, the 4” barreled, .357 Magnum Python has factory fitted Pachmayr Presentation grips with gold-plated Colt medallions, the grips contrast nicely against the E-Nickel finish. The pistol has very faint turn marks on the cylinder, and it has NO finish or other issues, overall condition is 98% with a MINT bore and the normal slick-as-butter Python action. You don’t see a lot of guns with the E-Nickel finish, and this one is nice as they come! We do not have the box or any accessories for this gun. * All ITEMS ONLINE ARE SUBJECT TO PRIOR SALE IN OUR RETAIL STORE. * NO LAY-AWAYS ON ANY ITEM* Please do not send us an email regarding this item unless you have a sincere interest in purchasing it, rude and/or inappropriate comments will be reported to Gunbroker.

Looking for offers on my Taurus, model 608, .357 Magnum.  It has the 8 3/8"" ported barrel, 8 round cylinder and matt-stainless finish.  I bought it for deer season last September - but only put 16 rounds through it at the farm.  I have installed custom wood (oak I think) grips, but still have the original rubber ones - the rubber grips are too narrow for me.  I still have the box and all the paperwork.  

I also have about 80 - 38 special rounds ( Remington 130 gr. FMJ) and 300 - .357 magnum rounds (Remington 115 gr. JHP, 158 gr. SJSP and 125 gr. SJSP) can't remember the exact number of each type.

The revolver is not rare - but I did have to order it.  I could not find an 8"" stainless anywhere.  Keep the current cost/availability of ammo in mind when making an offer.  I am a reasonable guy - and will not respond to ridiculous offers - like $250 

Thank you for looking."

Needless to say, he didn't use it.  Fired literally two shots out of this gun at the range.  Never hunted with it. Shot it, cleaned it, and its been in a case since.  Less recoil and more beefy than my H & R Handi rifle in 30-06 and if you want to add a barrel there is no need to have it factory fit like the Handi.  If you are not familiar with the Rossi Wizard, you can purchase and shoot multiple different barrels for this reciever in calibers from all shotgun gauges, two muzzleloaders, .22, to other rifle and hangun rounds. One can transfer any barrel quickly and easily without tools (one screw on forend grip).  The only reason I don't keep it is I already have a Handi rifle in 30-06 with a muzzleloader barrel for it too.  Has both a weaver scope mount and adjustable red/green fiber optics sights.  I have the original reciept ($317.00 out the door new), owners manual, 2 keys to lock the the tranfer bar system, and the hammer extension new in a bag with allen wrench and screws.  All included. Still under factory warranty in my name."
