Its a 500cc 4 stroke. There is 32xx miles on it (they may go up this weekend if I ride it) This sled is near perfect. It has been garage kept and maintained meticulously. It has a Hauck Performance GHT-R-DONE exhaust kit and fuel injection programer. The kit alone cost $1200. It has a nearly new Ripsaw track. It has the Yamaha Racing package that changes the back of the tunnel and rear bumper among other tings. The clutch kit engages the clutch at about 4200rpm right in the perfect part of the power band. There is no rips in the seat, all plastics are good, The battery is even brand new 2 months ago. The only bad part about the sled is the gas cap has a chip out of it. It was like that when I got the sled. It doesn't affect the sled in any way shape or form. It also comes with a nice Yamaha canvas cover. This sled sounds great, rides amazing and the electric start and push button reverse make it almost perfect. The front shocks are adjustable and come with covers. The rear suspension is second to none. This sled is a fun sled for beginners and advanced riders. It handles great on the trails and since it is a 4 stroke it gets about 20+mpg depending on how hard you ride it.

I am interested in cash only, no trades. Price is firm. I am willing to travel a ""reasonable"" distance. I will NOT ship. I am not willing to separate products (i.e. ammo and mags) for sale, its a package deal. Buyer must be a Missouri resident of legal age to purchase, show Missouri drivers license, fill out bill of sale, and sign a statement that you are legally able to possess a firearm in the state of Missouri. 

Thank you for looking and if you have not done so, please write to your representatives and state your opposition to House Bill 545. Have a blessed day!"

Don't miss out on your chance to own THE BADDEST FREAKIN' AK47s YOU WILL EVER SEE. (I can guarentee you these will sell at the show next weekend) Both rifles are built out the same, only the camo pattern is slightly different.
Here are the specs;
-Hand picked in 2003
-BATTLE-GRADE BUILD OUT!!! 
-Crisp smooth trigger Jobs
- I personally Cerakoted every external and internal surface in a ARMOR BLACK, FLAT DARK EARTH, AND OD GREEN Tiger Stripe pattern. Including bolts, extractors, firing pins and all internal ""guts"" (triggers, hammers,  everything except springs.) Even the magazine followers, and bottom plates! 
-UTG PRO quad rail Cerekoted OD GREEN w/ OD GREEN rail covers
-T6 stocks Also Cerakoted Tiger Stripe
- OD GREEN Butt pads
-Hogue rubberized grips in OD GREEN
-Muzzle breaks (Tiger Stripped to match)
-Each one comes with 1 Tiger Stripe 30 round Steel magazine & 2 new black polymer tapco 30 round mags, and your choice of new Digi-camo tactical case or OD GREEN Hard case.
-They currently have TRITIUM FRONT & REAR SIGHTs,but I'll be taking those off unless you wanna add $150 (per rifle) to the price.
Both these rifles are SUPER accurate( for an AKs) and SUPER reliable, I can shoot 2-3"" groups at 100 yrds all day long, and I've shot hundreds of rounds through these things and I've never had one single problem out of them. Like I said these are my personal babies, I've taken IMMACULATE care of them, and if you get one of them, you'll be getting a show quality rifle, that is 100% good to go !!! These things will outlast us all, and I woundn't hesitate to take either of them into battle any day of the week!!!  The easiest way to reach me is via text REDACTED, shoot me a text, and I'll be glad to let you come by and take a look at them, but you better jump on it, cause I can promise you they won't last long!!!"

I know it may be a lot but some guys could talk about reloading all day long. I need some tips and starters on reloading 12 gauge.

Here's a little bit of info on what I plan to do when I start reloading 12. 
-I will only be reloading 2 3/4 shells only.
- I will reload some bird load shot to get used to reloading then I will move on only to 00 buck, shotgun slugs, 1 oz slugs I will mold from lead, and possibly some specialty rounds like Rhodesian jungle, 0000 buck ( if I can find it) and maybe a couple others 
- I am using a lee load all 2 
- I know that there will be specific data to use
- I know that some wads are too long

My questions are mainly about excessive chamber pressure or blowing up. What are tricks and tips you know to get a good load? 

Are there data 'recipes' I can find for 00 buck or specialty rounds like the ones listed?
What are the most common wads, powder and primers do you use? What should
I stray from when reloading?

I guess I need a little of an overall explanation to get a little more insight. I read forums and stuff but it's either too complicated to understand and just numbers and abbreviations or it's way too simple and doesn't cover what I need.

If you don't know what a .22TCM is you can google it or here is a quick summary of what it is.

.22 TCM is a 9mm casing with a .223 bullet that gives maximum muzzle velocity with minimum recoil and the power to zip right through steel plates. It throws a 40-grain projectile at around 2,100 fps.  Here's a quote from one of the reviewers:  “It did things to a watermelon that would put a .45 to shame.”

This is the third book in the Geoff Cooper Trilogy. 



From the Book:
The other brother stood outside the car firing his GSh-18 at Cooper and J.T. Cooper fired two .9mm rounds at him but hit the doorframe of the vehicle. The brother ducked as he continued firing. J.T. rolled from the left side of the shrub, landing on his shoulder. The Smith & Wesson 629 .44 Magnum was in his fists. He lined up the Red Ramp front sight with the White Outline rear sight as he squeezed the trigger. 

The .44 Magnum man-shredder left the barrel at 1250 Feet per Second (fps) with a muzzle energy of 729 foot pounds. The sound was unbelievable and a long orange flash of light came from the muzzle. The .44 Magnum bullet hit the open door on the Charger. The round began expanding and penetrated the metal door. 

Ishmael Koloff had been using the door for cover. The round penetrated and lodged into the seat cushion beside him. Vladimir Koloff roared the engine to life. Vladimir looked at Ishmael and screamed “войти! “ (English translation: Get in!). Ishmael continued shooting toward the shrubs."

See more Here:

http://www.examiner.com/article/wash-state-bill-would-make-almost-all-gun-owners-criminals

The latest attack on law-abiding gun owners comes in the form of a ban on so-called “assault weapons” and magazines that hold more than ten rounds. Senate Bill 5737, just introduced by state Senators Ed Murray (D-43) and Jeanne Kohl-Welles (D-36), would ban the sale of commonly owned semi-automatic firearms.  This bill would ban the manufacture, transfer, possession, purchase and sale of firearms arbitrarily defined as “assault weapons”, semi-automatic firearms commonly owned by law-abiding citizens for self-defense, based on mainly cosmetic features!



SB 5737 would also ban the possession of any semiautomatic firearm along with a magazine that holds more than ten rounds. A violation of these, and other provisions listed in the bill, is a class C felony.  Owners of these firearms could keep them IF they subjected themselves to annual in-home inspections by law enforcement and complied with stringent and impractical storage and transportation requirements."

Up for sale is my Arsenal AK47, like the title says its a original Saiga Arsenal. Gun is in excellent condition with a very low round count, if you know these guns we can disassemble it so you can check the trigger group, bolt, etc.. to see there is very minimal wear. Overall rifle shows new with no scratches or blemishes on it
Comes with: 
2 30rnd metal mag
2 30 rnd Tapco mag
1 10 rnd factory mag
Original factory stock (been replaced with a Tapco Tactical stock)
300 rnds of 7.62x39 ammo

Why buy a WASR or Century Arms copy AK for overpriced $$$ buy the real deal here not a put together kit gun!! Ammo value alone at todays prices is $300!!! and dont even talk about magazine prices!! 
I am asking $1500, FTF in Lutz/North Tampa. Please call david at REDACTED text preferred. If this ad is up the gun is still available. I will delete ad ASAP once sold
