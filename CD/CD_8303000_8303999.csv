Thanks!Please, be able to have an intelligent conversation about pricing, values, basic guns and ammo information and item descriptions. I try to list everything of importance in my ads and do not want to have a week long back and forth discussion because you cannot articulate an acceptable explanation of your items or questions about my items. If you refer to magazines as clips, cartridges as boolets or send photos of your guns with your finger on the trigger, I will assume we are off to a less than desirable start. Sorry if I sound rude, but I have bought and sold a fair amount from Armslist and the sheer amount of people that cannot seem to follow the golden four rules of firearms safety or use correct terminology is an ongoing issue.If you decide to purchase a handgun from me, I will take down your ID and CPL/PP info, I will fill out the pistol transfer forms as is required by law and I will write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. If you decide to buy a long gun from me, I will check your ID and write a bill of sale for myself and for you if you want it. The bill of sale will include identifying information for both parties and there will be a copy for me and a copy for you. This is only done as a measure of protection for both parties. This is something you should welcome in an honest transaction. The registration paperwork and bill of sale on handguns is not negotiable. I don't like the laws any more than the rest of you but I intend to follow them as well as maintain accurate records of the firearms I own and where they came from. If you read this and are still interested and have any questions, please let me know.If you want to test fire a gun that I am selling, that is perfectly acceptable in most cases. I am happy to meet with you at Chief Okemos Sportsman’s Club on a weekend with you as my guest or at a range of your choosing at your own expense.Thank you for looking!

This is an excellent Browning Auto-5 ‘Light Twelve’ shotgun, and was described to me when I bought it as UNFIRED since it left the factory. It has a 28-inch barrel and comes with Invector choke tubes. The gun has always been and still is in its original box. The Browning 'humpback' 12 gauge shotgun started the semi-automatic revolution, and this Light Twelve will surely appreciate in value. It's a gorgeous gun that will be a great addition to your collection, or take it out and hunt with it!
 
I am the second owner of this gun and have never fired it. 
This gun was in my dad’s safe and to the best of my knowledge was only taken out to show others and was never fired. My dad has been gone now for three years and I am selling some of his prized firearms. This will make a nice addition to your collection or be a classic hunting gun. My dad was very proud of it and showed it to friends and family at every opportunity. He loved Brownings and Weatherbys and had at least 20 or so in his safe. He shot a few of them but most were new and never shot… he just showed them proudly as a collector. I have kept several of these since his death from cancer, but now my wife and I have decided to downsize and the Auto-5 is one of those we are letting go.”
 
 
GREAT VALUE – Browning Light Twelves in this condition that have been fired are selling for well over $1,000. This unfired since it left the factory gun is a great value and priced for quick sale at just $850. Sorry, no trades.
 
SHIPPING – No shipping. Buyer must pick up the gun in Palm Harbor, FL.
 
PAYMENT – I only accept cash.
 
BUYER REQUIREMENTS – Buyer must provide a copy of a valid Florida Drivers License and must sign a Bill of Sale that I will provide.

As seen in the photos this gun has had some major work to it back in the day. Probably only one like it in the world. The gun has been professionally ported on both sides of the end of the barrel. Has had a trigger job done and has had a square trigger guard with finger grooves fabricated onto it. After all the fabricating/gunsmithing was finished it was sent off to have an armoloy finish put on it. This was a popular shooting method in the early 80s to have your support hand/finger on thissquare part of the gun. I have never seen a python done though!! Gun looks neat and is probably the only one you will ever see. Also has the sling ring on the bottom of the handle. I shot this gun last weekend and its a pleasure to shoot, we were very suprised as to the smoothness and accuracy. This gun is available for sale in our store in Midland. We can also ship to any Licensed FFL. Call or text 479-462-8336 for more info. Gun is $4500 cash or best offer. Again, where are you going to find another one like it???"

This rifle was sporterized at some point in its life; as such, the receiver is drilled and tapped. I began restoring it a while back, but eventually the project stagnated and now I need some extra cash. The rifle is nearly rebuilt, but needs a few very small parts readily available on eBay or from gun parts websites (front sight pin, barrel band retaining spring, front band bayonet lug screw). The stock is surplus and was picked up on eBay; needs some fitting (trigger guard / magazine, barrel band areas, handguard ring), and the rear sight needs to be staked down. Other than that, check your headspace and you should be good to go. Finish is overall good; no rust on the rifle, some patina in certain areas. Bore looks good. I replaced: 
- Stock- All stock hardware- Front sight- Rear sight- Bolt- Trigger guard / magazine assembly- Trigger
Pretty firm on the price; it's just the sum of what I have in it. I do have extra parts that will go with it (original shaved bolt from the sporter job, scope mount, etc). There is some kind of aftermarket trigger unit that I removed and replaced with a surplus trigger - looks to be similar to a Timney assembly. Yours with the rifle. I also have a cheap BSA scope that came on the rifle when I got it; will include it for $50. Feel free to shoot me an email if you have any questions."

If you prefer a red dot I can add that in place of the scope. I also have more magazines I can add to the package at a cost, all the way up to 40 round mags. Trade value 800.00. I get the bug to build an AR once in awhile and I don't keep them because I shoot bolt action long range only. I build them to satiisfy my urge then trade or sell them I am looking for a few items listed below. Thank You for looking."

Mod/IC.  I have shot a couple of boxes of shells through the gun, and it operates well but it is a well-used older gun. Appearance is fair. Much bluing loss. Wood is glossy and is much better than the metal. Good old tough field gun. Pictures tell the story and I am happy to send as many as you want. The price is right. I don't need it. Come get it. No lowballing. Thanks. No time-wasters pleaseTEXT ONLY please NO calls. Thanks REDACTED"

It has a 0 marked bolt head, which means it has plenty of life left in it. Fairly accurate rifle, shoots 2in groups with craptacular Wolf .303 steel case. As this is an FTR rifle, all parts match but some are force-matched. Insofar as I can tell, the barrel and receiver are both original but the furniture was probably replaced at RAF Fazakerly in the 50s as part of the FTR program, as was the magazine (which has been electropenciled to match the receiver by the armorers at Fazakerly).Comes with sling, blade style bayonet, and scope mount + 3-9x scope. The mount does not require drilling and tapping, it is an SK type that just clamps on to the charger bridge on the rifle and hooks into the rear sight pivot pin slot.Text REDACTED.
