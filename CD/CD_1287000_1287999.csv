getting some nasty email about gouging is not a pleasant experience. This ammunition is from GM and is 29.99 a box. after tax that's 31.67. All I am asking for is $35, that's 3.33 a more a box or 17cents a round.
I have 10 boxes, the limit at the store.
Did GM gouge me? I don't know, who cares, tell me where I can find any 9mm right now. I've been looking for weeks after running out my personal stash out at the range."

The K-frame revolvers are perfect for individuals with small hands, and a wide variety of aftermarket grips are available.

This is a 6-shot K-38 revolver with a 4"" barrel and is more accurate than you are.  I fired 18 rounds at the range today, putting them all in a quarter sized grouping at 30 feet.  Double-action is smooth and easy, but single action breaks like glass at under 3oz which is better than a target grade 1911.  This is an excellent shooter, light to carry, and built to last a lifetime.  No internal lock or MIM parts on this classic 70s vintage Masterpiece . . . Smith & Wesson hasn't made revolvers of this quality in a very long time.

I am the second owner.  First owner claimed under 100 rounds through it since purchased new, and has been in storage ever since.  It is in 97% condition, which means ""Like New"" with minor handling marks.  This revolver is all stainless steel, inside and out, and has the original checkered walnut grips.

I recently purchased this gun, thinking it would be perfect for me, but I picked up a Ruger Custom Shop Speed Six that same week and decided I like that a little better.  This would be a PERFECT first gun as it is incredibly easy to load, unload, and fire accurately.  This is a much better choice for the novice than a magnum or an automatic pistol.  Being a stainless steel Smith, it will easily handle +P ammunition, although it is recommended to use standard pressure ammo for practice.

I have $600 into this and would like to get that same amount back in cash, and price is pretty firm as I don't need to sell and wouldn't mind keeping it. 

Trades I would be interested in include Smith & Wesson Airweights (442 specifically, but would consider 642, 438, 638) or a steel framed Centennial.  I might also consider a Officer or Commander sized 1911 with ambi safety, a Smith or Glock 10mm, NAA PUG or Short + cash, LCR38 + cash, CA Lite + cash.  Possibly a SIG P239 + cash on my end.  That is pretty much all I'm interested in."

Customer Reviews:
Keep in mind that Del-Ton's products are very well made. Look at some of the reviews from forums found on the net.
David Hess: from Central Illinois I'm accustom to seeing blemishes or paint flaws on most gun parts lately, even slag left on welds. My DEL-TON lower was a work of machining art. Every surface was 100% smooth and all corners crisp or radius just as they should be. The finish was flawless and smooth as silk! Colts just a young horse in a pasture to me. Great job DEL-TON!!

Reviewer: Anonymous Person from Hudson, NH United States I purchased a Del-Ton stripper lower to complete the Del-Ton Disspator rifle kit I also purchased. I was very pleased with the fit and finish of the parts kit and the lower receiver. Everything went together without a hitch. The trigger surpassed my expectations. I will buy Del-Ton's products again for a future rifle. Thanks Del-Ton!

The barrel is hammer forged, chrome lined, and the original Yugoslavian barrel. Twist is 1 in 7, the gas system is adjustable, and the bayonet lug is there. The M95 has tritium night sights that still glow. The receiver and trigger guard are still unfinished and the rest of the rifle has the original blued finish. This rifle is 922r compliant with a high quality US made RSA adjustable two stage fire control group, US receiver, US made polymer hand guards, and US made flash hider. It comes with one Yugoslavian 30 round magazine, NOS 4-mag pouch, Yugo sling, and very good condition Yugo bayonet. I have about 500 flawless rounds through the rifle and it is very accurate.

He just isn't a shooter and had it for home protection but decided a 12 gauge would be a better home defense weapon, so he decided to sell it.  This is where I came into the picture.  Knowing that I am a ""shooter"" he approached me at work asking if I would be interested in purchasing the Ruger.  Being that my very 1st 9mm was the Ruger P-89 back in the very early 90's, the memories of that gun literally eating anything I fed it along with it's amazing accuracy, I couldn't refuse and snatched it up immediately!

Now reality has sunk in (this is where the wife comes into the picture) and I've come to realize that I have too many damn guns as it is (the wife filling in the memory blanks), and having another 9mm just doesn't fit in with what I need right now :-/

PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH as to the reliability/dependability of this particular firearm as I am sure that you will come away satisfied.  This was a Ruger series (YES all Ruger P-Series 9mm magazines are interchangeable) that was OVER engineered if anything.  It will eat ANY 9mm ammo you feed it, and will extract all day long without experiencing a single FTF/FTE.  It is both Double/Single Action w/ De-cocker (you can start out in DA and after the 1st round flies it puts you into SA mode).  This firearm comes with two 15 round magazines, manual, case, and gun lock (all original).  The gun is in LIKE NEW condition literally having less than 80 rounds ever fired through it (30 rounds were from me this past weekend).  Thank you for looking."

I loved your administrative approach and taxable justification regarding the sale amount of your pistol.  First of all, have u ever heard of depreciation of "" said item ( Post sale ) ?  I don't care how much u paid for it.  It's no longer worth that.  2nd of all, who the hell buys a pistol and then never fires it once ?  Also, we don't even know you, so what are we supposed to do....Go on faith that everything u say is the "" God's-honest truth ?""  Then you start busting out with percentages and taxations regarding ammo being included in the deal, and the cost of FFL BG checks breakdown and assessment.  It's a bunch of smoke and mirrors.  Yes, the "" Ruger LC9 "" is a decent pistol, but it's not an S/W, HK, Sig, Para-O, or definately not a Kimber.  But you have to get nasty and call me the Pistol price police.  You must be a little "" funny guy.""  Well guess what.....I'll continue to slam guys like you that feel like your pistol is the best, and that there are no flaws whatsoever on the pistol, and trust that you've never fired it.....Yeah RIGHT !!  I respect your tenacity, but I think it's rather pathetic that u have to lash out and call me the Pistol Pricing Police, or whatever moronic statement u made.  People who get pissed off about what I do in defending the reputation of gun enthusiasts, shooters, home defense afficionados, etc, are usually pissed because it interferes with their sale, and put a chink in your armor."

Has quick detach mount for removal and attachment with return to zero, buttons are located on the side for easy use of a magnifier.

This unit retails for $550 and is currently on backorder, so even if you could find it you would be paying $588.50

""T"" Aiming Point Calibrated To Eliminate Guesswork In Close-Range Targeting

The Brownells CQB T-Dot Sight is designed for combat and competition shooters who frequently address targets at close quarters. It corrects a common problem with combat-zeroed optics mounted on an AR-type rifle: the point of impact is significantly lower than the point of aim at close quarters distances. Built by EOTech exclusively for Brownells and based on the popular EOTech EXPS2, the CQB T-Dot eliminates the “guesstimating” when aiming at these targets. It retains the parent design’s 65 MOA circle illuminated reticle with two aiming points calibrated for 50-200 yards and 500 yards. The bottom of the T-Dot’s circle is left open, with a “T” indicating a precise aiming reference zeroed for about 7 yards. All aiming points are calibrated for 5.56mm NATO ammunition. Windage and elevation are adjustable in ½ MOA increments.   

The CQB T-Dot clamps directly to a MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail (only 2 ¾"" rail space required) with a built-in quick-detach throw-lever mount. A built-in riser enables lower one-third co-witness with A2-type iron sights. The reticle has 20 brightness settings selected using the control buttons on the left side and is powered by one CR-123 lithium battery (included), easily accessed through the side cap. Sealed, non-magnifying optics are fogproof, shatter-resistant, and anti-glare coated."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.

First, nowhere do I make any mention as to the quality of a Ruger versus any manufacturer, or particular model. So not sure how that plays into your accusation. Second, I did not initiate a conversation. You did by posting in reference to my listing. Like I already explained, the cost of any new purchase involves the item cost, tax, and background check. If you are not able to independently research Ruger's Homepage to see pricing, I would be more than happy to personally assist with your education.
I challenged you to provide us ""uneducated"" consumers with a place where any of us can purchase this pistol for the $329 price you quote. You failed to do so. I extend the challenge again. I'm not talking about the guy you know, that knows a guy. Give us confirmation. I can tell you that the two big local retailers - Shoot Straight and Shooter's World neither have them in stock, nor do they sell then for below MSRP.
And you are free to troll, and bully. But I take exception when you question my integrity as a veteran that I would mislead a buyer, myself being an owner of a nice assortment, as well as pretty well versed on a slew of weapons used by different militaries around the world from firsthand experience.  Yes, every manufacture test fires their weapon, so technically, fired once, but other than that nothing has been even chambered. And depreciation of sale may apply to a car taken off a lot - not to item where demand is greater than supply. A transaction on a cash register does not warrant a loss in value.
So if your desire is to pit gun owner against gun owner on this forum, I have already emailed you, and suggest we can have a robust conversation in person and see how much you wish to toe the line with your accusations and insults, and let the gun buyers and sellers go about their business.
Have a nice day!"
