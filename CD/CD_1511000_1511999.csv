“Bigger and badder” is the best way to describe the AR-536. Its 5x magnification makes it easier to find and engage targets out to 600 yards, while the larger 36mm objective delivers brighter, crisper images. The Ballistic/CQTM lighted reticle is ideal for tactical operations or friendly competition. Shooters can choose the high contrast black reticle, or select red or green depending upon the situation. Five different illumination set- tings make it easy to match any light condition.
Ruggedly built to withstand up recoil, abuse and weather, key features include multi-coated lenses, adjustable diopter, integrated lens covers and three Picatinny rail mounting points. Remove the bottom rail mount and it can be readily mounted to an AR carry handle. It is ready for the range right out of the box. One-Year Warranty.

I have posted the blurb from their site so you can see the specs and description. I can work out a deal if you are wanting to buy more than one. GRIP-POD Military Issue- GPS-02 The ""REAL DEAL"" Here - Tactical Bipod USA ------- BLACK IN COLOR
CLICK on this Link http://www.grippod.com/gsp-02-military
The GPS-02 Grip Pod Exceeds Military Drop Test Specifications.

The Grip Pod System™ (GPA™) is a revolutionary new vertical fore-grip integrated with a strong and stable bipod. The Grip Pod's legs deploy at the push of a button - instantly!

It offers a combination of advantages never before available in a single accessory.

We consider the Grip Pod™ to be an enhanced target acquisition system (ETAS).

Using the Grip Pod System™ an operator can go from a standing CQB position to a prone firing position, and have a stable bi-pod for aimed firing in place before hitting the ground.

Say goodbye to cumbersome bipods that have to be manually clipped on or folded into position.

The GPA™ is manufactured from aerospace materials to exceed military specifications for construction and finish. It mounts directly to Picatinny rail systems, and additional mounting options will be available soon.

The GPA™ is currently in worldwide use by many Military and Law Enforcement units including: US Navy Seals, US Army Special Forces, US Army, USMC, British Army, Canadian Army, FBI HRT, Secret Service, Federal / State / Local Law Enforcement, and several unmentionable government entities. The Grip Pod™ has been selected for use on US Army Designated Marksman rifles. Patents are pending.

* Increased Speed
* Greatly Increased Accuracy
* Increased Weapon Flexibility
* Stronger than Conventional Vertical Grips

* Retracted Bi-Pod Reduces Entanglement Factor
* This vertical fore-grip is widely known throughout the military and tactical communities of the world to enhance control, accuracy, and speed of long and short range shooting (to include Close Quarter Battle (CQB) target acquisition). This is true for soldiers utilizing all types of small arms (rifles, submachine guns, and light machine guns).

WARNING - Don't be fooled by Cheap Chinese Knockoff Grip Pods!

You must work for the government, because clarity and customer service are not your strengths.'  Whose email address is 'REDACTED'. Let me clarify for you; I listed this in the FT section.  NOT the FS section.  After about 20 emails with offers like 'ill give you $200 for your sks'. Or 'will you take $150 for the ammo'. One tends to get annoyed.  If I wanted to get ripped off that bad I could take this stuff to a gun show.  I am looking to TRADE not sell!

400 rounds of South African surplus brass cased ammo.  Non corrosive.

550 rounds of various steel cased ammo:  golden tiger, WPA classic, Tulammo, Brown Bear

I'm in no hurry to get rid of this stuff.  I WILL NOT SELL FOR CASH. If you ask it $0.75 PER ROUND.  Tired of LOWBALLERS offering me 20 cents a round.  

I would like to trade this pile of ammo for?  Looking for firearms mostly.

Stuff I can add to a trade

Norinco sks.  Numbers matching except for stock.

Norinco sks-m (takes AK47 mags) has original thumb hole stock.  In Good condition.  Functions flawlessly.  Numbers matching.

Norinco sks-m has original Monte Carlo stock.  This gun is in excellent condition.  Functions flawlessly.  I paid $900 for this gun most likely not for trade less you really wow me.

Yugo sks, numbers matching in great condition.  I stripped the Cosmo off of it a few months ago.

20 or so various AK 47 magazines.  30 and 40 round capacity.  Some metal some poly.  Some even hybrid metal/poly.

15 ar15 gi mags.  All anti tilt followers.  All in good condition

10 magpul p mags.  Brand new never opened.

Bersa thunder .380 with holster.  In good condition.  Minimal wear.  Wife's gun.

3 different SKS stocks: ATI side folder / 6 point adjustable, a black side folder, tapco intrafuse 6 point adjustable NIB.  I may consider cash offers on these.

Let me repeat: NO CASH OFFERS.  If you do offer cash it better be for a $&@! Load.  I'm done with LOWBALLERS that think their stuff is worth millions and my stuff is worth nothing.  I know what my items are worth.  Lets make a fair trade.

When it was taken out of the Cosmo the wood was so open I wouldn't want it to get wet or I worried it would swell and crack. I actually shoot my rifles so I had it done. I like to have guns I can shoot and if they have historic value or a story even better, I don't do wall hangers.

 So if you are interested this is a Yugo SKS, It has multiple carvings in the stock. I cant translate but I have had a collector of trench art take a look and I was told he thought it was used by someone in the Munje. I didn't fully understand everything but it seems it was some specific group know for being very brutal, and composed of mostly prisoners pledging to fight to become free. He said they also were know for disposability, I guess they didn't have a shortage of prisoners.
I know its not something thats worth a huge amount of money but the Yugo Blade SKS with the G-launcher stuff still on seems to becoming more and more rare, the cool history just adds.
 So if your interested make me an offer. I really could use cash right now but I always look at trades.

The gun only has about 50 rounds put through it and is in excellent condition.  I bought the gun as a reverse two-tone, but sent the slide into Sig Sauer to 'bead blast' the black coating off so I could have an all stainless gun.  I also bought a set of Hogue coco bolo wood grips (seen in the pictures) for about 85.00 to replace the rubber Hogue grips it came with  (I will include those grips as well).  The frame and slide are in 98% ++ condition.  The barrel used to be black, but as any Sig owner knows, the black comes off quick (even before you get the gun!), so I took some vinegar to the outside of the barrel to remove the remaining black.  There were some hard to reach places on the barrel that my fingers could not reach on the outside of the barrel, so I did dremmel a few areas lightly.  Close inspection will show this, but will not show when barrel is in the slide and does not effect functionality.  Overall, the gun is very nice, it's just a little heavy for me to use as a carry weapon.  If interested, I also have a new Galco shoulder holster/mag holster in black that I would sell with the gun for an additional 125.00.  The holster is the VHS (vertical) style and has only been worn once at home while adjusting it to my body.  For both the holster and gun, my asking price is 1000.00 OBO.  Or, 875.00 OBO for just the gun.  All original parts/accessories/case are included.  Includes two 8-round magazines.  ** LAST CHANCE EVERYONE **  I'VE SECOND GUESSED SELLING THIS AND WILL DECIDE TO KEEP IT AND MAKE SOME UPGRADES UNLESS SOMEONE WANTS IT SOON.  SEVERAL HAVE MADE SOME OFFERS (GOOD, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH), SO I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS LISTING AROUND UNTIL THURSDAY, 5/23/13.  AFTER THAT...IT'S GONE!!! :)"

533,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1511533,For Sale/Trade:  1 Day Only: NIB Bushmaster XM-15 AR-15 (not Carbon) with ammo & lots of extras,"Gander Mountain, Wausau, Wisconsin","$ 1,300","Listed On: Wednesday, April 24, 2013",Rifles,Bushmaster                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I'm from Milwaukee, but will be up in Wausau for work on Wednesday so was thinking someone might be interested in trades or buying some of my guns.  I'll be free after about 6 pm, but leaving to come back home within a few hours.  This is a one day only offer.

I have a Ruger 10/22 special edition tactical rifle, Bushmaster AR-15 (not a Carbon), Ruger LC9, and a Ruger P97 .45 cal.

This is the Bushmaster package:

I have a brand new all-metal Bushmaster XM 15 Optics Ready Carbine with 16"" chrome-lined A4-style barrel for sale. Not ""brand new with only 100 rounds through it"" but totally new. I've never even loaded it! This is a quality factory-built Bushmaster, and not a cheaper DPMS product, or a plastic Carbon 15, or someone's garage build, and a complete ready-to-use package for less than some are selling their used, base model rifle.

Gun comes with:
-Factory box (if you want it)
-2 metal 30-round Bushmaster magazines (comes with 1 in store)
-Empty chamber indicator flag
-Lock and key
-Sling
-2 rail risers in case you want to use a big scope
-Warranty
-Owner's manual
-and whatever extra paperwork/coupons/etc are included normally

It is factory built with the receiver-length picatinny rail, 6-position adjustable stock, A2 flash suppressor on a threaded barrel, bayonet lug, and sling swivels. And unlike most modern AR's, the calibers are stamped on the mag well so you know it accepts BOTH .223 AND 5.56 ammunition, whatever you can find to use - no guessing that the NATO rounds MIGHT go boom without your gun going BOOM!

Also included is:
-A brand new (in the unopened box) BSA 42 mm red-dot scope sight with built-on sun shade (not pictured – can include the UTG red dot in the picture if you prefer)
-100 rounds of new brass Independence 5.56 55 gr FMJ (perfect military round for this barrel)
-A brand new Tapco Intrafuse AR spanner wrench with a mil-spec castle wrench, receiver extension removal wrench, and A1/A2 flash suppressor wrench. It is manganese phosphate coated for durability, and has a lifetime warranty
-A brand new weather-resistant ammo box large enough for all the extras to fit in
-A brand new Midway USA padded tactical range bag with 4 velcro pockets to hold 30 round magazines, a middle velcro pocket, and a long zipper pocket.  It has handles and an adjustable strap on the back to carry by hand or over your shoulder.

With this complete AR 15 package you have everything you need, and can get it sighted in on the range and have some fun banging away without having to wait a couple months to find some clean ammo, or pay $1 a round.

The base model MSRP on the rifle is $1,391.48, and with this deal you avoid taxes, fees, and snoopy government agents.  I saw these at the last gun show going for around $1600 without any extras, so I'm listing it at $1500 (with ammo, red dot, wrench, bag, and ammo box included).  I will sell just the rifle, mags, and ammo for $1300."

The 24 inch octagonal barrel removes in about 10 seconds, and locks up tight again just as fast. Made in the year of our Lord 1911, this rifle was no safe queen. There are light to moderate handing marks on wood and steel, but she is still all there. The action works as designed, including the half cock safety. The bore has considerable shine and less than sharp rifling. It may clean to much better condition. The fairly clear stampings tell me this gun received good care after a day afield. The wood has some added finish, and it looks like some good figure might be hiding under those old layers."

	 Description 		


This unfired NIB rifle was never available as a catalog item. It was only available through the 1998 Shot Show as a special order item. Only 336 were produced in the 7mm Rem Mag caliber. As can be seen from the hang-tag, this is the pre-64 claw action. In addition to the beautiful Fajen blonde maple fiddleback stock accentuated with dark cut checkering, of note is the very unique knot below the cheekpiece. The finish over the knot is, of course, smooth as glass. There is a hairline on the gripcap..

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many shooters learn the basics of target shooting with this handy little carbine.

It can be used with both eyes open and the UNLIMITED eye relief feature allows it to be mounted any comfortable distance from the shooter’s eyes.  

Included in this kit is our popular 10/22 Picatinny rail mount which is easily to install on the Ruger pre-drilled and threaded receiver with the included machine screws.

The small scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

Costs (new and w/o taxes or shipping):
Gun - $650
Sight and gunsmith install - $75
2 extra mags - $86
Steel guide rod and springs - $35
Beretta skeleton Hammer - $40
PB Rosewood grips - $70
Hogue wrap-around grips - $20
Holster - $40

I have about $1100 in this when all is said and done. Price is $750 firm - in or around Richmond - and that is more than fair. I have another gun I have my sights on right now and need to sell quickly. Can include 9mm ammo for $0.40/rd if needed.

This gun is great, accurate and extremely reliable and durable. Just wanting something else a the moment. Trying to save some money by not going out and just buying something else. The 1st photo is stock and the other 2 are with the new Rosewood grips installed. I will gladly meet you at Colonial Shooting to shoot them."
