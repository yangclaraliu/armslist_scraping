This rifle consistently scores hits on 10 inch steel targets at 600 yards as I did two weeks ago up at Young’s Long Shot Range. 
Price of $575.00 includes the rifle, the scope, and 550 rounds of ammunition."

We all know CA has the strictest laws and what they are proposing is flat out ridiculous!
We all know the US and the internet is all completely out of AR Lower Receivers and back orders are 6-12 months long. Also, complete built new or used AR-15s are ridiculous in price so why not buy a lower and complete the rest when prices are normal.
The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for a month and a half now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check. This is also a real machined lower, not a polymer one.

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNING! 
Blank-Firing Theatrical and Starter Guns
THIS IS NOT A TOY! The carrying, handling, or brandishing in public of any model that resembles a real weapon may be in violation of the law, may create undue apprehension on the part of law enforcement officers or other persons, and could result in INJURY to the person handling the blank gun. 
This blank firing replica gun is intended to fire only 1 type of blank ammunition. The correct caliber of blank ammunition is stamped on the gun and included in the accompanying documentation. ONLY USE THE CORRECT BLANK AMMUNITION with this blank gun. Attempting to fire blank guns with the incorrect ammunition can cause serious injury.
Blank guns CANNOT fire real ammunition. DO NOT attempt to load or fire real ammunition. Attempting to fire real ammunition can cause serious injury. Attempting to alter this blank gun to accept real ammunition is illegal and will likely render it inoperable and/or unsafe for its intended use.
Always make sure you and those near you wear eye and hearing protection when firing.
When firing, always keep your arm fully extended.
NEVER point this blank gun at anyone, even as a joke.
Keep your hands, face, and any other part of the body away from the cylinder and top of the blank gun when firing. When a blank is fired, gas and debris are vented from the cylinder/slide. At arm's length, the vented material dissipates harmlessly. At close range, the venting can cause burns or serious injury.
Blank guns should be used ONLY in the home as scale displays or collector's items, or for theatrical or training purposes. They should always be used by or under the supervision of a responsible adult. They should NEVER be carried on the street, pointed at anyone, hidden on your person, or left in your car. DO NOT leave them where they are accessible to children.
Blank guns should be stored in a locked container separate from its ammunition. Do not let children play with blank guns. It is not a plaything, and could cause harm if used improperly.
To avoid mechanical failures, keep this blank gun clean and lightly lubricated. Always make sure it is unloaded before cleaning.
The manufacturer, distributor, or seller disclaims any and all responsibility for the improper use of this blank gun.
Retail customers warrant that shipments are made in compliance with state and local law. Customers assume full reasonability that they are in compliance of their state laws. Specific information regarding shipping restrictions is available on most official state websites or directly through offices of state secretaries or state legislatures.
It's up to YOU to know the laws in your state, county and city and to fully comply with them."

eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

I would like to sell locally but will respond to out of state request. please note that this will not go cheep. so no low ball offers will be responded to. MN DL and pp or pc will be requried."

IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNING! 
Blank-Firing Theatrical and Starter Guns
THIS IS NOT A TOY! The carrying, handling, or brandishing in public of any model that resembles a real weapon may be in violation of the law, may create undue apprehension on the part of law enforcement officers or other persons, and could result in INJURY to the person handling the blank gun. 
This blank firing replica gun is intended to fire only 1 type of blank ammunition. The correct caliber of blank ammunition is stamped on the gun and included in the accompanying documentation. ONLY USE THE CORRECT BLANK AMMUNITION with this blank gun. Attempting to fire blank guns with the incorrect ammunition can cause serious injury.
Blank guns CANNOT fire real ammunition. DO NOT attempt to load or fire real ammunition. Attempting to fire real ammunition can cause serious injury. Attempting to alter this blank gun to accept real ammunition is illegal and will likely render it inoperable and/or unsafe for its intended use.
Always make sure you and those near you wear eye and hearing protection when firing.
When firing, always keep your arm fully extended.
NEVER point this blank gun at anyone, even as a joke.
Keep your hands, face, and any other part of the body away from the cylinder and top of the blank gun when firing. When a blank is fired, gas and debris are vented from the cylinder/slide. At arm's length, the vented material dissipates harmlessly. At close range, the venting can cause burns or serious injury.
Blank guns should be used ONLY in the home as scale displays or collector's items, or for theatrical or training purposes. They should always be used by or under the supervision of a responsible adult. They should NEVER be carried on the street, pointed at anyone, hidden on your person, or left in your car. DO NOT leave them where they are accessible to children.
Blank guns should be stored in a locked container separate from its ammunition. Do not let children play with blank guns. It is not a plaything, and could cause harm if used improperly.
To avoid mechanical failures, keep this blank gun clean and lightly lubricated. Always make sure it is unloaded before cleaning.
The manufacturer, distributor, or seller disclaims any and all responsibility for the improper use of this blank gun.
Retail customers warrant that shipments are made in compliance with state and local law. Customers assume full reasonability that they are in compliance of their state laws. Specific information regarding shipping restrictions is available on most official state websites or directly through offices of state secretaries or state legislatures.
It's up to YOU to know the laws in your state, county and city and to fully comply with them."

cons:

The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights. The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.
The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. 
Comes with 22-round magazine. The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. 
The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. Tan finish.

Would not let me deactivate listing
This listing is for a NIB never fired S&W M&P 15-22. 

I purchased this for my son for his birthday present but ended up getting a different model 22 instead. This is a really nice AR Style 22 and gets excellent reviews on the web. I am not trying to gouge anyone on price, I am just trying to get out of it what I have in it. I would like to get it sold this week to save me a trip to the gun show Saturday. I am firm on the price. It also has the 25 round factory mag.

This needs to be a face to face transaction in the Dayton area.

I will require a bill of sale for this transaction along with a valid OH DL. This is non negotiable.

I will also throw in a brick of the .22lr Remington Thunderbolt's that are pictured (also hard to find right now) 

Please call 937-272-0564. No texts please. No Trades

The gun and 500 rounds of ammo will not last at this price!"
