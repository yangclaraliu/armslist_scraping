Comes with shoulder holster, holster shown, approximately 250 cartridges, 3 Mags, cleaning tools and ammo can.Price $1675 for everything.Roberts Defense (Review from truthaboutguns.com)The Roberts Defense Super Grade isn’t going to muscle its way into the market on looks alone. Not that there’s anything wrong with its appearance. The Super Grade’s satin stainless steel’s warm sheen gives the gun a subtle, business-like look. Paired with black cherry grips and classic 1911 cues, the Super Grade is a modern take on a timeless design. Which, of course, it is. Like a lot of high-end 1911s.Roberts Defense’s motto is “never compromise.” If hand-fitting means never having to say never mind, they’re living up to their creed. The Super Grade’s clearly benefitted from a lot of hands-on care and attention. The frame-to-slide fit is exceptional, with no hang-ups and no rattle. None. Racking the Super Grade’s slide isn’t like manipulating a greased lightning Cabot (what is?) but the 1911’s action is at least as smooth as a Wilson Combat custom.Like most 1911 guys, I worry about tight-fitting guns; a John Moses Browning meisterwerk with tiny tolerances can foretell future function failures. The barrel bushing was so tight on Robert’s blaster I couldn’t remove it without a bushing wrench. Like a town bicycle, it will loosen up over time. The grip safety is blended very well to the frame, but it isn’t as well-sorted as it is on a higher-priced custom gun – yes there are many – like an Ed Brown. With a price of “just” $1649.00 I’m willing to let it go.Roberts Defense fashioned the Super Grade Pro’s hammer and sear from D7 tool steel. According to diehlsteel.com, that’s a “high carbon high chromium die steel with added carbon and vanadium for abrasion resisting qualities. Useful for applications involving extreme abrasive wear.” Roberts says the metal maintains its shape and angles much better than other steels.The trigger feels like a gunsmith-tuned go pedal, though it’s got a lot of wiggle inside the frame. The trigger pull is as clean as an airline pilot’s kitchen and as sharp as Saville Row suit. It has the perfect amount of take-up leading to to a solid wall, followed by a crisp break. If your sights are moving when you fire the Super Grade, it’s all you.Perhaps this is a good time to mention that all Roberts Defense guns come with a transferable lifetime warranty. If your third-hand Roberts Defense has feeding problems or the sights come loose – perish the thought – you can send it in for free warranty work. As customers of high-end 1911s will attest, personal and prompt service is one of the major benefits of working with a small gunmaker; they’re willing to take responsibility for any and all issues and fix the problems fast.The first thing I look for in any gun I shoot: reliability. The Robert Defense Super Grade has it in spades. RF ran 250 rounds of Winchester White Box RF through the gun (“just warming it up, Wes”) sans problem. I fed it another 500 rounds. In addition to standard 230 gr. ball, I shot three popular self-defense rounds: Hornady TAP FPD 230 +P, Federal Hydrashok 230, and my personal favorite Federal HST 230 +P. All of these loads fed through the pistol without the slightest hiccup. There were no malfunctions whatsoever.The pistol is ridiculously accurate. It shot so well I had to compare it side-by-side with a Les Baer Thunder Ranch Special with a 1.5 inch guarantee (a gun that will be getting it’s own review sometime soon). The Les Baer was slightly more accurate, but that could be down to user familiarity (i.e. it’s my gun). Considering the Baer’s $800 premium over Roberts Defense, that’ll do.A lot of TTAG readers balk at paying a grand-and-a-half for a gun. Any gun – never mind a 1911. Especially when they can find perfectly serviceable 1911 for $800 to $1000. But the Roberts Defense Super Grade has “it”: the high-quality hand-fit feel and rock-solid performance buyers expect from guns that sell for $2k and up. The company is fast, friendly and passionate about their product, willing to stand behind their gun for as long as ye shall live. And beyond.The only potential problem: the Super Grade Pro’s extremely aggressive checkering and grips. As they say about strange sexual practices, if you don’t understand it, it’s not for you. But if you’re willing to suffer a bit of pain for a lot of gain – shooting a proverbial tack-driver – you can’t do any better at the price. And maybe even higher.Caliber:                .45 ACPBarrel Length:              5”Weight:                  36.8ozFinish:                 StainlessCapacity:                     8+1Price:            $1549 MSRPRatings (out of five stars):Style * * * * *If you’re looking for a custom 1911 that screams CUSTOM 1911, this isn’t it.

Please do not ask if this is AVAILBLE, it listed it is AVAILBLE. This may be the only one of these you will ever see.  This little revolver was build many years ago by R&D Conversion. Ken Howell / R&D did revolver conversions before they started building conversion cylinders that are so popular today.  I am not aware of any other gunsmith or company that has a Colt Pocket Police Conversion.  R&D converted this revolver to the specifications of the buyer and left the loading lever in place.  It has a loading gate but other than that appears to be a standard black powder revolver.  A Uberti reproduction was used as a base for the build.  The barrel was sleeved, and the revolver was converted to 32 S&W short cartridge complete with loading gate. The revolver was marked with R&D markings and refinished.  This truly a one of a kind find.

It appears to be wearing the Walther wood grips that are featured in the accessories section of the original owners manual. There are a couple blemishes to the pistol. Slight corrosion to the following areas: Front grip strap and the right front & edge. Possibly from long term box storage ???  The bore is bright and clean. It comes with it's original plastic box, owners manual, instruction sheet, and one Walther factory magazine. I will also include one full box (50 rds.) of Fiocchi 9x18 Ultra ammunition with this pistol.NOT 9x18 Makarov.

This one is a postwar gun (1948), marked .30 WCF (the old designation for .30-30); it is not factory drilled and tapped for a receiver mounted sight. Rifle has the flat front barrel band typical of this time period. There is a lot of finish wear on the rifle; lots of blueing wear all over the firearm, as well as some browning spots on the left side of the receiver. It looks like someone tried to clean it up at some point and left a pattern on the right side of the receiver; little hard to see in the pics but describing here for full disclosure. The wood has a few dings but nothing serious, the worst ding being on the forearm. She is definitely used - but full of character, and 100% mechanically sound. *** Rifle comes with all the .30-30 I have left (I believe approximately 60 rounds or so; I'll dig it all out and it's yours). Also has a leather wrap installed on the lever. ***"

I purchased this with the intent of maintaining an arsenal of 50 state legal semi-autos, but California and New York just aren't having it. Reciver has an aftermarket ambi mag release because the standard mag release is pretty far forward, a basic trigger job to take some of the creep out, and 2 sling swivels towards the rear. About 100 rounds through it, initially just to verify the trigger job worked. Includes the Fightlite bolt release unit (which doesn't ship with the reciever), as well as the special bolt carrier  unit, but it doesn't include the actual bolt head, cam pin, or firing pin, because FightLite are a bunch of cheap bastards. They usually go for $575 for the base model, $50 for the ambi release, $40 for the bolt release unit (seriously FightLite, what the hell?), and a favor from a gunsmith buddy for the trigger job. I'd be happy with $500 for the whole thing. NJ residents need a valid FOID, I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble."
