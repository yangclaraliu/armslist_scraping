It's had about 40 rounds through it. It has a bushnell illuminated redicle scope on top with flip up dust caps. I bought it for $200 back in the beggining of winter. The only problem with the gun is the loop piece to mount a sling or bipod on the front of the gun is broke from the bipod i had on it. But other then that this is a really nice deer rifle or just all around gun. Would sell for $480 with scope or $280 without the scope.

They are running for around $40 right now when you can find them. The holster is a right hand side Fobus made for the 19, so it clips in. No rounds are included. These are running well over $700 used, but even those are very rare. Don't believe me, check out other sites. This is a very nice gun, but I have 2 and I'm wanting to reduce my inventory and also get something smaller my kid can handle. I will need to see your CHL or a drivers license and for you to sign a bill of sale to protect you and me both. If you don't want the 3 extra mags, I will knock off a $100, so it will be $700.

The Executive Carry is essentially the Executive Elite modified for carry. It's the solution for those who prefer a smaller model 1911, but insist on complete reliability. The slide has been reduced to the minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. The frame has been modified with the innovative Ed Brown Bobtail® housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. The Bobtail® minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability. These problems are eliminated with the Ed Brown Commander Bobtail® configuration, which reflects the genius of John Browning with an innovative modern flair. The functional simplicity has yet to be matched. Unique with the Executive series pistols is the 25 LPI checkered frame and ""half checkered"" Bobtail®. This pattern is not too rough on the hands, but not too fine for a secure grip. The Executive Carry is truly at the top of it's field. Get promoted to an Executive Carry - it's a serious tool for the competent professional!

The Executive Carry features the following:

4.25"" Commander model slide, single stack commander Bobtail® frame. The John Browning traditional design innovatively modified for concealed carry, without significantly detracting from reliability or accuracy.
Weight: approximately 35 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.
Exclusive 25 LPI checkering on forestrap and Bobtail®.
Matte finished slide for low glare, with traditional ""square cut"" serrations on rear of slide only.
Fixed dovetail 3-dot night sights with high visibility white outlines."

WIKI INFO- The Remington Model 31 was a slide-action shotgun that competed with the Winchester Model 1912 for the American sporting arms market.[1] Produced from 1931 to 1949, it superseded the John Pedersen-designed Model 10 and Model 17 and was replaced by the less expensive Remington 870

While the Remington Model 17 enjoyed some success, a solid, 12-gauge featuring side-ejection was needed to compete with Winchester. C.C. Loomis sized up the Model 17 and adapted it for side ejection. The Model 31 was Remington's first side ejecting pump-action shotgun. Stocks were walnut with checkered walnut forend and later changed to a ribbed forend. The Model 31 was made in three gauges with 121,000 12-gauge models made and 75,000 16- and 20-gauge examples also produced. Despite being well received, sales still lagged far behind the Winchester. Remington went back to the drawing board and designed the Model 870; this shotgun matched the durability of the Model 12 at a significantly lower cost. Despite the overwhelming success of the 870, many shotgun connoisseurs consider the Model 31 to be the ne plus ultra of pump shotguns with its ""ball-bearing"" slide action"

If we as responsible firearm owners take a stand and stop paying these crazy prices on here, it will stop the non responsible firearm owners from going to dicks, gander mountain, and cabelas, with their family members to buy out all the ar15 and ammo just to put them on here for double. They would stop buying and then the ammo would come back down to normal pricing along with firearms. I dont care what you haters have to say , free country , we can do what we want , etc. Well so can we. if you just hold off for 6 months things will get back to normal, also if you continue to pay these crazy prices and when everything finally levels out and you see that no bans will be put in place your going to be stuck with an overpriced firearm that you will never be able to recoop your money out of. All im saying if  your sick of seeing this pricing then stop buying and these folks out here who want to cash in will go away. And the ones who are doing it you know who you are and im certainly hoping you have some form of morals and your not putting firearms into the wrong hands just to make a quick buck. And those of us who continue to sell and trade on here. Thank you for staying fair on the pricing and continue to do the right thing."

The digital controls allow you to activate or deactivate all of the features of the MO4-1 with an easy push of a button. In addition to its advanced features, the MO4-1 is equipped with a fast, 3x magnification objective lens with multi-coated, all-glass optics for clarity and distance. Included in this package is an additional 6x lens, making the total magnifiaction 6x.

I'm not original owner so no idea on ""round count"", but it's tight, looks new, and I'm picky. 2"" barrel, standard hammer. Revolver only, no case, etc. The photos are stock of the same model, only with another serial number, hence the FTF . $500 trade value. The list of candidates is long (Beretta 92FS, CZ75, Steyr M9A1, Sig SP2022, etc) so feel free to make suggestions, semi-autos or revolvers. I love revolvers as long as the barrel is less than 6"". No long guns, and I'm not a fan of Taurus or Bersa. Just my opinion. Also, FYI I'm also considering this instead of trading it: 

""Hello, I have an SP101 "".38spl only"" and would like a 357. The revolver was manufactured in 1991, so I'm not sure if the cylinder length had grown that early in production. What kind of money am I looking at for either parts and fitting a new cylinder or simply re-chambering the original? Also, would it be returned to me or require an FFL transfer? Thanks""

""We can re chamber the cylinder in your gun. You will be able to use federal 125 grain .357 mag rounds only, other than any 38 special loads of course. Other brand 357 ammunition may be too long, or some move forward during live fire and lock up the gun. The federal 125 mag works with no problem. We just need the cylinder and if you send us the cylinder, no FFL is needed, we can do the work and return the cylinder to you. Cost is $75.00 plus $9.95 return S&H. One week turn around time for that work. Thank you, Rick""

The Geco is made in Germany and was imported into the US in fairly limited quantities in the early 2000's. Sportsman's Guide and several other retailers sold them inexpensively then. However today they are nearly impossible to find. In my opinion the Geco is the highest quality, strongest and most interesting of all of these type pistols brought to US during the last 20 years. Many feel that the HK is a better pistol however I've owned both and unlike the Geco - the only steel part on the HK is the barrel as the entire frame is plastic.

This Geco is in original UNFIRED condition. Also included in this package is:

26.5 mm to .410/.45 Long Colt adapter that allows 2.5"" & 3"" .410 shotgun ammo or .45LC ammo to be safely fired.

26.5mm to 12 gauge adapter that allows the less expensive 12 gauge flares to be fired. This adapter cannot be used with regular 12 gauge shotgun shells and must never be attempted as the results would be catastrophic.

Original German flap holster that is weather resistant and has room to store the pistol, cleaning brush, 26.5mm ammo, .410 or.45 ammo & one or both adapters. Holster also has a shoulder carry strap attached.

26.5mm cleaning brush and nylon lanyard strap for pistol

(3) 5 round boxes 2.5"" .410 rifled slug ammo. (1) 25 round box of 3"" - 00 buck with 5 pellets per shell, & (1) 25 round box 3""  #7.5 shot (devastating close range defense load).

(2) 26.5mm white parachute illumination shells, (2) 26.5 mm Red Rain shells & (2) 26.5mm orange smoke shells.

(1) sealed 4 round package of Orion 12 gauge super red flares - expire July 2016

The last Geco I saw on Gunbroker was before Christmas and it sold for over $200 without accessories similar to what the HK's do when they come up for sale. So if you investigate and price everything included in this set - you'll see that my asking price is a bargain.

Price: $350 obo. Also this is a pickup item as shipping live flare shells is a hassle and it's costly. Also because this flare pistol becomes a real firearm when the .410 adapter is inserted you must be at least 21 to purchase."
