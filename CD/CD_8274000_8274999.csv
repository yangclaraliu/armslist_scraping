The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting."

Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market."

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market."

The pistol operates with a locked-breech, short recoil action (instead of blowback) that locks the action closed. Slide serrations enhance the shooter's ability to pull the slide back for loading and claearing the action. The DAO (Double Action Only) trigger allows the shooter to get shots off quickly without having to remember any safety switches during high-stress personal defense situations. The P290 RS also has restrike capabilities in the case a cartridge does not fire the shooter simply has to pull the trigger again. Textured and replaceable grip panels, and textured front and back straps provide a non-slip grip for enhanced fire control. The Sig Sauer P290 RS EDC Semi-Auto Pistol comes with contrast sights, dovetailed to the slide. The slim, trim P938 can be carried comfortably all-day—everyday, keeping it within reach for situations that call for rapid deployment of well-placed shots from a more than adequate cartridge for personal defense.  - Extremely reliable and concealable - Durable, lightweight polymer frame - Nitron coated stainless steel slide - Locked-breech, short recoil action - Double Action Only trigger - Replaceable grip panels - Restrike capable - Contrast sightsColor filled logo on slide and caliber indication on barrel with gold acrylic (see pictures).Has not been fired much and only has about 50 rounds through it since new, has been very well maintained and treated.Includes:- Sig Sauer Case- Sig Sauer Paddle Holster- Sig Sauer Replaceable Grip Panels in black, pink and flat dark earth (FDE)- Sig Sauer 30mm Gun Lock- Sig Sauer Maintenance Tools for P290RS- Sig Sauer 6+1 Round Magazine- ProMag 10+1 Round Magazine"

It has certainly never been fired since being in my possession over the last 20 years, only carefully wiped down and kept as a safe queen. It is that nice. The bluing easily rates at 100-99+% with the bore appearing factory sharp with no visible wear. The muzzle shows no type of wear at all and the adjustable sights appear to have never been adjusted. The beautiful factory grips do not have so much as a single ding or worn checkering with absolutely no ""boogering"" of the grip screws. Even it's factory pouch is in shape with no tearing or discoloration to the leather. Gun was kept in a conditioned safe and kept cleaned and oiled at all times.

Originally designed as a means for persons with limited mobility to operate and fire the AR-15 pistol, the custom adaptation of the Stabilizing Brace to the UZI PRO SB takes the application of large frame pistol control and stabilization to a new level. With the IWI brace's unique sidefolding feature, the UZI PRO SB can be fired with or without the brace extended depending on the shooters need. With the brace in the folded position, storage space required in your safe or range bag is minimized. In all other respects, the UZI PRO UPP9SB is identical to the UPP9S, a modernized Micro UZI semi-auto pistol based on the world famous UZI sub-machinegun, variations of which have sold in excess of 2,000,000 units worldwide. The new blow-back operated 9mm UZI PRO incorporates advanced polymers in the lower section of the receiver resulting in lighter weight and relocation of the magazine release to a more practical and traditional pistol based location. Unlike earlier UZI models, the charging handle has been moved from the top of the pistol to the left side of the receiver. This allows the addition of a full length Picatinny rail to the top of the pistol, permitting the use of any optical device that utilizes a Picatinny rail clamp mount. An additional Picatinny rail is incorporated in the polymer lower that allows the use of lights and/or lasers to be mounted directly under the barrel. Extremely reliable and accurate, the UZI PRO pistol incorporates three safety mechanisms: Manual thumb safety Grip safety that must be fully depressed before cocking or firing Firing pin block Each UZI PRO pistol is supplied with two magazines, one 20 round and one 25 round in states where these magazine capacities are permitted. A 32 round magazine is also available where permitted. Fully adjustable front and rear sights are standard.Restricted Not available in CA or MA.
