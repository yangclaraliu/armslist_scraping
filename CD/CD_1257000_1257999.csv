It has been enhanced with several $$$ added features. Springfield built this gun on a Springfield Series 70 frame and slide.

It has been Enhanced with a Wilson Combat (match) threaded barrel. It shows an attached screw on compensator (also takes a suppressor or just a knurled thread protector) and a Wilson fitted bushing & link. Has S.S. Mag well, Target grips, Wilson Extended takedown and ambidextrous safety and an extended mag release button. Also has the Wilson two piece solid guide rod with spring and reverse rod holder.

This gun with the enhanced trigger group including combat hammer, has as nice of a trigger pull on it, as guns costing twice as much as I'm asking. I believe the series 70 frame and slide has something to do with that as well.

Slide and frame fit like a glove, and move as smooth as glass together, with no play or hesitation at all, and makes the gun much more accurate than I am as a shooter. I would consider the overall finish as 98%+.

If you are looking for an easy shooting (reduced recoil when using the  compensator) .45 for pleasure, tactical use, or to possibly get into a little competition without a lot of investment, then this is the 1911 for you.

I already have (5) other .45's so I decided to sell this little treasure to someone that can do it justice."

This item is new, we are a licensed gun shop and we received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public.

NOREEN BAD NEWS .300 WIN MAG !!!!

Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot.

This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action.

The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system.

The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus."

The Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua ULR (Ultra long Range) Rifle

This rifle is modeled after the AR platform however the take down pins are farther apart than the AR-10 and AR-15 rifles causing the rifle to not accept an interchangeable upper like the AR-15 and AR-10 platform. This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed.

The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine.

The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform."

NOREEN BAD NEWS .300 WIN MAG !!!!

Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot.

This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action.

The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system."

I'd like a carbine that isn't commercial and is in decent shape and hasn't been bubba'd, but other than that I'm not too picky. For the price I don't expect museum grade pieces, but I'd like a decent shooter with a solid bore and as little pitting as possible. Although cheaper is better, depending on how nice it is, I could be flexible on the price and have stuff I could possibly toss in (magazines, for instance).

I use this rifle for hunting coyote sometimes, but mostly use it for varmit (Despite what Obama says about people using AR's for hunting), It has earned such nickname's as the ""Black Death"" and ""Nail Driver"" amongst my friends. The accuracy is second to none, it is almost boring to shoot because I can hold a dime size group at 100 yards all day with it. So unless you're using it to shoot 2-3"" targets at 150-200 yards it's boring at the range lol. 

I am a U.S. Marine so needless to say the weapon has been well taken care of. It is in peak condition mechanically, but shows signs of use. As I said, I have not bought it to sit in a safe and collect dust, I bought it to be a deadly accurate weapon system, and that it is. If you're looking for a unfired weapon or a weapon to sit in a safe and collect dust then please move on because this is not what you're looking for. However, if you're looking for a field tested and true'd weapon, that has this U.S. Marine's approval; this is it. 

Now to the price... When the weapon hit the market the MSRP was $2750 for the bare rifle. That means no optics and no bipod. 

Add on's include:
-Magpul PRS Stock $300 (if you can find one) 
-UTG MilDot Scope with Red/Green lit reticle $150 (High dollar scopes are for scout snipers, and gear queers that hope it will make them shoot better. Yeah, I said it... If you doubt me, then put your money where your mouth is. I will out shoot you all day with this $150 scope vs. your $2000 glass that doesn't help your shot placement.)
-Magpul Quarter Turn Iron Sights (For targets <50 yards) 
-UTG Bipod, Tactical Charging Handle (less tactical, more practicle to get around the optics), and a Tactical Mag release (Again, Less tactical, more practical)

I also have a ton of G.I. Mags and 5.56 Ammo that can be negotiated for. Please feel free to contact me with questions and/or offers."

Up for auction is the only FD308 prototype that will be made available for sale: SN#PT2. The barrel on this rifle has approx 2,000 rounds. Only 3 final prototypes have been manufactured of the FD308 prior to entering production. This auction presents you the opportunity for an extraordinary purchase not only because it is arguably the highest quality 308 auto-loading rifle in the world, but also that it comes with F&D's exclusive Unlimited Lifetime Warranty, offered by no other rifle-maker. SN#PT2 represents the absolute pinnacle of auto-loading firearms design and manufacturing exactness. SN2 performs at sub 1/2 MOA accuracy, with a statistical average of .3 MOA using match factory ammo. The FD308 boasts a much higher level quality design and manufacturing processes than all competitors including LWRC, Larue, POF, LMT, GAP, etc...

Unlimited Warranty
F&D's prototype model unlimited warranty is an ultimate end-user guarantee that offers the rifle owner a number of advantages over any traditional warranty, such as: free lifetime upgrades to revised & updated components, no term-limit, free replacement of all components from wear & tear (excluding barrel bore/chamber). Free lifetime replacement of all components due to unintentional & non-negligent damage. Essentially it's a rifle for life.

    Bolt-on barrel/rail configuration for quick and repeatable barrel swaps and inspection; maintains higher rigidity than barrel-nut designs, and consolidates the absolute lowest and most compact rail-height available to any piston system. The F&D barrel interface maintains 8200lbs of rigid axial force against the upper receiver, compared to 6700lbs with barrel nuts utilized across the industry. Other ""quick-change"" barrel systems maintain little to no axial force against the upper receiver (LMT). Axial barrel retaining force is one of the most significant structural contributors to accuracy and consistency of AR style rifles.

Thats most likely all I am looking for. Maybe a Crossbow 350FPS or better plus cash.

I don't expect this to last long since they are sold out everywhere. I saw just the 9mm shellplate for $125 on Gunbroker yesterday (ridiculous)! I am not looking to double my money or anything but I am well over $1300 into this, with powder and bullets still left at least $1700.

Make me an offer and if its not what I have into it, then don't bother.

I am offering a complete AR Package. This package has basically everything you could want/need and is turn-key ready to go (as you will read).

Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.

Throughout the world today, Colt’s reliability, performance, and accuracy provide our Armed Forces the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt’s new LE6920MP-B shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel. With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip (with storage compartment), MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine.

Includes: (1) NIB, never fired Colt LE6920MP-B with 16"" 1:7 twist barrel, (1) 30rd magazine, cleaning kit, sling, and manual.

Accessories Included: 400 rounds of ammunition, (2) additional 30rd magazines, (1) Vortex Diamondback 3-9x40 Dead-hold BDC scope, Butler Creek flip-open caps, Burris R.E.P.R quick detach mount, 2-piece quad rail for the Colt AR, rail covers, rail mount fore end grip with storage, and a tactical gun case. All items are brand new except the case but it’s in perfect, like new condition.

The scope has been pre sighted on my personal AR using a bore sighter at 100yards. The scope will need minor final sighting on the Colt with live ammo but should be within a couple inches. The included 100 rounds of match ammo should help you with this. Ammo is hard to get at a reasonable price right now. I figured bore sighting should help you conserve your ammo so you can use it for a better purpose.

The Burris mount allows the rear flip up sight to remain in place, and the front sight is not visible at 3 or 9 power. I included a picture of that. If you want to drop the scope there are two latches to remove the scope/base in seconds without tools. It includes both smooth and picatinny rail ring tops and the Burris forever warranty.

Included is a quad rail for mounting lights or what ever accessories you desire.... The 2-piece rail is sized for the Colt AR. I included (3) rail covers and a fore end grip –all new in their packages.

I'm asking for $1,600.00 Price is firm and am not looking for trades and i can ship to anywhere so Far you have FFL No FTF Thanks for looking"

Thats most likely all I am looking for.  Maybe a Crossbow 350FPS or better plus cash.

I don't expect this to last long since they are sold out everywhere.  I saw just the 9mm shellplate for $125 on Gunbroker yesterday (ridiculous)!  I am not looking to double my money or anything but I am well over $1300 into this, with powder and bullets still left at least $1700.

Up for auction is the mr556a1, A direct descendent of the HK416. The MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.

It has an 18 1/2"" long barrel, holds 6+1, has a quad rail on front end for anything you can think of to hang on this from optics to lighting to your garage door opener if you want.  You can adjust the type of loads you shoot by the patented spring allocation system.  Has a collapsable stock (you can put any AR type stock on it because of the Devastator kit). Right now it's set up to shoot normal to medium loads.  If you put all (4) springs in it will be set up for heavy loads (1600 fps or greater).  This is one bad ass gun and not for the weak of heart.  The pictures shown have some lights, lasers and optics on it, but those are not included.  The lights can be negotiated if interested, but the EOTech base has damage and is not for sale at this time."

This isnt a cheap set up for a .22 and its a very very hard to find one since the mags will be banned within months and probably so will the rifle unless you already own it. Makes shooting fun again when you can leave the range with 500 rounds of ammo shot for 50 bucks ?

If the mags are banned they arent going PERIOD I can try and find a 10 round to add in those are cheap online but I will not ship to states with size limiations PERIOD and I have google so dont lie to me I will check
Your funds have to clear my bank account first so if you paypal (which I prefer the funds have to hit my account ususally within 3 days and I will ship within 24 hours of the funds in my account.

A Lee Classic Loader for 30-06 and a pound of powder, Lee safety scale, bullet puller, and any other reloading equipment I have.
Bolt is very smooth and easy to work on this rifle you would think this .30 OC 6 (7.62×63mm for the metric readers) was a semi-automatic in the right hands. Making for quick accurate shots even at running game. The receiver is made of machined 4140 steel alloy for rigid strength lending to accuracy. Headspace is set with a barrel nut for quick tight headspace setting. And for the ones who like perfection you can easily set the headspace to whatever specification you want. The barrel nut also is easily removed with an easy to get tool, so that you can change out barrels. There are currently several barrels for sale for savage rifles online that are said to be able to fit this rifle. I see a .270 barrel and a 300 mag barrel both at .99 cents on ebay right now. Also there are barrels made specifically for the Marlin available also.

The synthetic stock has steel pillars to maintain a consistent stock/action interface, checkering on grip and fore end with sling studs. Adjustable trigger can easily be set by about anyone with simple tools from hair trigger to next to almost impossible to pull trigger(who would want that I don't know but it is possible). This rifle has a great trigger system very smooth and easy to use for accurate shots. Specially in the heat of the moment it's natural so you can get the kill. 

Has cocking indicator on the bolt so you know when it is cocked and ready to fire. Has grove in the rail to prevent binding and smooth up feeding. Safety is Nickle a common place where sweaty fingers make for rusty parts. The nickle will not rust from the salt from your fingers from lots of use.

This gun is capable of sub .75"" accuracy and has room to grow where it could be a sub .25"" with the right mods. One thing that could be done easily would be to float the barrel and bed the action or could get an upgraded much more expensive high high end stock that was already modified that way. Personally I would do the work myself if I were to keep the rifle. The rifle at this point is all original and has had very few rounds put threw it. This rifle is in excellent shape and is very clean almost mint shape. Bottom line is this is alot of rifle for the money I have had rifles that costed $2,000 that this rifle would best."

I've put 43 rounds through it and it will come with the 7 I have left.

EDIT: I put the manufacturer as S&W, due to the fact that it's a clone and the real manufacturer is not listed as an option on Armslist. It was made by INA and imported by FIE.

Here's the bad: The finish has flaked in one small area around the grip. One grip has a small crack in it. It has been glued together and is solid. One sideplate screw was stripped and I had to drill just the head off to access the inner workings. The sideplate is mounted securely and I've not had a single problem with it.

670,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1257670,For Sale:  Hornady Lock N Load AP Progressive Reloading Press with lots of EXTRAS! 2 months old!!!,"Taylor, Detroit, Michigan",$ 100,"Listed On: Thursday, March 14, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I received this press for christmas this year.  Without having a mentor to teach me, youtube was working but not good enough.  I guess reloading is just not for me.  Now if I had a father, friend, uncle etc to teach me the ins and outs a lot of money can be saved here.
I have decided that I need repairs to the house more than this press so it and all the dies, shell plates, scale, etc are for sale together only. Will not separate!

The Hornady Lock-N-Load A.P. Progressive Press was purchased in Dundee on 12/15/2012
I loaded exactly 1000 rounds of 9mm very slowly while watching videos and trying to teach myself.  I think I did pretty good for no instruction. Then I loaded 100 rounds of 45ACP.  Thats it exactally!  None of the other dies or crimping dies or shell plates etc were ever used.

Whats included:
Hornady 9th Edition Handbook of Cartridge Reloading
Individual manuals for the following calibers: .38 Special, .357 Magnum, .45ACP,       9mm Luger, 10mm/.40 S&W, .44 Magnum

Hornady .45ACP #546555 3 piece Die Set  (used 100 rounds)

Hornady Shellplates - Each of these plates fit many more different calibers, too many to list. Reference Hornady's Shellplate Sheet for a complete list.
Hornady Shellplate #45  (.45ACP & 45 Winchester Magnum)

Extra Lock-N-Load Die Bushings 
I purchased a 2-pack and a 10 pack plus the few that came with it.
These are what make the Lock-N-Load unique.  You can get your dies all set up for loading and with just a quick turn take those dies out and put in dies for a different caliber in minutes.

I also have a reaming case prep tool (never used)

Optional: I have many different gun powders, bullets, etc.

I have Hornady 10mm, 44MAG bullets for reloading

I have Berrys 45ACP, .40 S&W, .38or.357mag, and 9mm

I have 4= 100 bullet Winchester bags of 9mm for reloading
I have 4= 100 bullet Winchester bags of .38/.357mag for reloading
I have 2= 100 bullet Winchester bags of .380 Auto for reloading

I am sure I am forgetting some things.  

Trades:
Colt Delta Elite 10mm in new condition, Bi-tone Springfield XDS plus cash 
Thats most likely all I am looking for.  Maybe a Crossbow 350FPS or better plus cash.

I don't expect this to last long since they are sold out everywhere.  I saw just the 9mm shellplate for $125 on Gunbroker yesterday (ridiculous)!  I am not looking to double my money or anything but I am well over $1300 into this, with powder and bullets still left at least $1700.

Make me an offer and if its not what I have into it, then don't bother.

This revolver has one of the best trigger pulls of any I've tried due to Ruger's patented cam-system, which results in a non-stacking trigger pull.  I really don't want to sell it, but the wife prefers the Glock instead.  

This listing comes with everything you'd get when buying it new....box, case, instructions, everything.  Also included is one speed loader.  I paid $475 after tax new less than a year ago.  I'm looking for $380.  I am pretty firm on price, as I am not desperate to sell and I know what these are worth.  You MUST provide ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  I prefer buyers with TN handgun permit, but not absolutely necessary.  No felons or shady characters, period.

789,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1257789,For Sale:  Hornady Lock N Load Progressive Press Reloading,"Taylor, Detroit, Michigan",$ 2,"Listed On: Thursday, March 14, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I received this press for christmas this year.  Without having a mentor to teach me, youtube was working but not good enough.  I guess reloading is just not for me.  Now if I had a father, friend, uncle etc to teach me the ins and outs a lot of money can be saved here.
I have decided that I need repairs to the house more than this press so it and all the dies, shell plates, scale, etc are for sale together only. Will not separate!

The Hornady Lock-N-Load A.P. Progressive Press was purchased in Dundee on 12/15/2012
I loaded exactly 1000 rounds of 9mm very slowly while watching videos and trying to teach myself.  I think I did pretty good for no instruction. Then I loaded 100 rounds of 45ACP.  Thats it exactally!  None of the other dies or crimping dies or shell plates etc were ever used.

Whats included:
-Hornady 9th Edition Handbook of Cartridge Reloading
-Individual manuals for the following calibers: .38 Special, .357 Magnum, .45ACP,         9mm Luger, 10mm/.40 S&W, .44 Magnum
-Hornady .45ACP #546555 3 piece Die Set  (used 100 rounds)
-Hornady 10mm/.40S&W #546533 3 piece Die Set  (Brand New)
-Hornady 9mm Luger #546515 3 piece Die Set  (used 1000 rounds)
-Hornady .44 Mag/.44 Special #546548 3 piece Die Set  (Brand New)
-Hornady .38 Special/.357 Magnum #546527 3 piece Die Set  (Brand New)
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for .45ACP (used 100 rounds)
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for 10mm/.40S&W (Brand New)
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for  9mm  (used approximately 600 rounds)
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for ..38 Special/.357 Magnum (Brand New)
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for .44 Special/.44 Magnum (Brand New)
-Hornady Shellplates - Each of these plates fit many more different calibers, too many to list. Reference Hornady's Shellplate Sheet for a complete list.
Hornady Shellplate #45  (.45ACP & 45 Winchester Magnum)
 #8   (9mm Luger, 30 Luger, 38 Super)
 #30   (.44 Special, .44 Remington Magnum, .445 Supermag)
 #1   (25-06, 30.06, 270 Winchester, 7mm-08, 308 Winchester)
 #6   (.357 Magnum, 7.62x39)
 #10   (10mm, .40 S & W)
-Frankford Arsenal Quick-N-EZ Case Tumbler (used twice to clean to batches of brass)
  media in Tumbler is still good plus whats left in the cantainer of Corn Media I bought.
-Black Media Sifting tray
-Hornady Lock-N-Load #050108 Bench Scale
-RCBS Green Primer Flip Tray
-Cabela's 6"" Electronic Calipers
-Lyman Inertia Bullet Puller
-Extra Lock-N-Load Die Bushings 
I purchased a 2-pack and a 10 pack plus the few that came with it.
These are what make the Lock-N-Load unique.  You can get your dies all set up for loading and with just a quick turn take those dies out and put in dies for a different caliber in minutes.
I also have a reaming case prep tool (never used)

Optional: I have many different gun powders, bullets, etc.
I have Hornady 10mm, 44MAG bullets for reloading
I have Berrys 45ACP, .40 S&W, .38or.357mag, and 9mm
I have 4= 100 bullet Winchester bags of 9mm for reloading
I have 4= 100 bullet Winchester bags of .38/.357mag for reloading
I have 2= 100 bullet Winchester bags of .380 Auto for reloading
I am sure I am forgetting some things.  

Trades:
Colt Delta Elite 10mm in new condition, Bi-tone Springfield XDS plus cash 
Thats most likely all I am looking for.  Maybe a Crossbow 350FPS or better plus cash.

I don't expect this to last long since they are sold out everywhere.  I am not looking to double my money or anything but I am well over $1300 into this, with powder and bullets still left at least $1700.

Make me an offer and if its not what I have into it, then don't bother.

The EMAG remains 100% compatible with the AR15/M16 platform, its unique geometry is optimized for use in not only the AR-15 and Colt M16 but also for foreign-made weapons such as the British SA-80 (L85A1/A2, L86A1/A2, L22A1, L98A1/A2), HK 416, M27 IAR. The Emag will also have improved fit in out of spec AR-15s with tight magwells, and has an improved drop free design. These are packaged in military issue packaging, with NSN identification numbering on the back of the package.

EMAG features the same pop-off Impact/Dust Cover as the original PMAG GEN M2 (no longer available, The MOE replacement ships without dust covers)  to prevent dirt and debris intrusion and protect the feedlips from potential impact damage during transit and storage. When not in use, the Impact/Dust Cover can be stored on the magazine's floorplate to prevent possible loss.

For easy and accurate identification of loaded round count via the large, dual-sided MagLevel windows, the stainless steel magazine spring is coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color. Numerical indicators are added to the body to identify 5, 15, and 25 loaded rounds.

Sabre Defense is no longer in business due to some ATF troubles, something to do with some employees walking away with some of the machinegun parts they made for the military. Sabre Defense was known to have made higher end ARs, you can google sabre defense for some reviews.

This rifle also comes with an Aimpoint red dot scope, it is a genuine, made in Sweden Aimpoint, but it is an older model. Still bright and works fine.

Also included are 3 30 round magazines, and 120 rounds of ammo.

Not really interested in trades at this time, but it never does hurt to ask, it would likely need to be something of lesser value with some cash added, as I need to get about $600-$700 worth of my wife off my ass for some other recent purchases I'm in the dog house for, LOL!
