These are few and rarely found in good condition. This one is good enough it can actually be fired but of course this is a valuable collector piece and is respectfully retired. The timing is good, springs are still strong, teeth on the cylinder are in great shape, etc.. As you can see, the nickle plating on the cylinder is mostly gone but for maybe 20%. The rest of the gun retains I'd say around 90% of the nickel finish and definitely shows it’s age but is obviously all original. Overall this is a great piece for the collection. The grips are in great shape as well. I tried to get some good pictures here and of course feel free to ask questions. Being an antique, this does not require an FFL. Value is $400.

Also is a Victor D/S action .22 revolver and it's also in great condition and shoots fine. The frame is finished in Titanium Dura Coat and it comes with a holster, 80 rounds of ammo and a hard case. The Victor with accessories is valued at $200.

I'll pay cash and/or trade for a suitable shotgun to use at the trap range. My first choice is a 12gauge over/under but will consider others. 
I also have several types of ammo that I'm willing to barter with as well, and I do mean at normal store prices, not inflated, low-life, scumbag, scalper prices.

The Champion functions flawlessly eating all my reloads without issues, SWC,RN, JHP all work great. This gun is used by my wife as her personal protection piece and she is wanting a revolver now... This gun is cerakoted in graphite black 100%.
Round count is unknown as we picked it up used, we have put in new recoil spring, fire pin stop and plunger spring, this gun is very accurate and pleasant to shoot. It conceals very well for a CCW. Included with the gun if the original box and paperwork, gun and 2 mags. for the right trade I can add a IWB holster made by Nightingale gun leather.

Since SA stopped making these guns their value increases each year, please no low ball offers. I know what this gun is worth on the open market so please don't insult me.
If I had to place a value on this gun I would estimate it on the low side at $700, trade value $750-$800. All these offers of $500 or trade offers for $500 guns is getting insulting.

I don't need the money so if I cant find the right trade I will keep this 1911. I would like to find a nice Snub Revolver though.

This rifle features a 24"" fluted barrel and uses standard AR magazines.  

WHAT'S INCLUDED:

Everything that came with the rifle (box, 10-round magazine, manual, etc.) and also includes:

1.  New NIKON P223 - 3-9x40 AR scope - calibrated for 5.56/.223 rounds.  Uses finger adjustable knobs.  Has a BDC 600 recticle.
2.  Two additional 30-round AR magazines.
3.  Adjustable/removable Bi-pod
4.  Adjustable Cheek Riser Pad
5.  Black Tactical Carrying Case with various pockets.

RIFLE INFO & REASON FOR SELLING:  I had originally purchased this model rifle a year ago and have become so impressed with its handling and accuracy, then I purchased a 2nd one (this one up for sale).  This rifle does NOT have the cheap Barska scope that Mossberg provides (if you ordered that particular version).  Rather, I had a separate Nikon P223 x-9x40 AR scope installed with dead-on BDC 600 recticle accuracy.  My reason for now wanting to sell my 2nd MVP custom model is that purchasing a second unit was an obsessive compulsive move on my part.  Now, several months later, my better judgement has taken over.  Rifle is NEW - has not been fired and am selling it for $150 less than what I paid for everything listed.

PRICE:  $750 Cash.  And PLEASE - no trades, checks, or money orders considered.  If you want this shipped to an FFL dealer, will be glad to do so, but you must pay for all shipping charges.

BEST METHOD OF CONTACT:  I reside in Fuquay Varina, which is 30 minutes south of Raleigh off of highway 401S.  You can respond to this add, but for immediate answers to questions, etc., please feel free to call me on my mobile, which is REDACTED any time between 9 AM and 10 PM EST.

This AR comes with everything that came in the box along with some extras which include a quad rail, a fore grip, a rubber form fitting pistol grip, an extra pmag, and 2 boxes of ammo. The accessories are made by UTG which is a reputable manufacturer. You get everything you see in the picture. I understand prices are going down and prior to all of this commotion this AR sold for around $1049 +tax. I feel my price is fair in comparison with all of the similar Bushmaster AR's on armslist.com. There are some of the same Bushmaster models posted on armslist in upwards of $1300 without all the extras. This is a great deal considering whomever buys it will get all of the extras as well as save on the actual cost of the AR itself. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. I am not trying to make money off anyone. My receipt reflects I paid $1099+tax for a total of $1197.91 for the AR alone w/o the extras. This is the model that Academy is selling for $1099 + tax.

These are few and rarely found in good condition. This one is in very usable condition but of course this is a collector piece and is respectfully retired. The timing is good, springs are still strong, fins on the cylinder are in great shape, etc.. As you can see, the nickle plating on the cylinder is mostly gone but for maybe 20%. The rest of the gun retains I'd say around 90% of the nickel finish and definitely shows it’s age and is obviously all original. Overall this is a great piece for the collection. The grips are in great shape as well. I can send more pictures to anyone interested and of course feel free to ask questions.

 Also is a Victor D/S action .22 revolver and it's also in great condition and shoots fine. The frame is refinished in Titanium Dura Coat and it comes with a concealable holster and ammuinition.

 I hate to part with these but I'm in the market for a trap gun. I'd like to trade these for a suitable shotgun to use at the trap range. I'd prefer a 12g over/under but will consider others. I can add cash if needed for a fair trade but I'm not looking for anything real high end. No shorties."

The PT22 is a .22LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine. The PT22 is often viewed as a Taurus copy of the Beretta 21 Bobcat due to having a similar ""tip up"" barrel. In fact this small pistol is very different in design and function from the Beretta. The PT22 is a cast steel frame and slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. The ""tip up"" barrel is useful in that the first round may be chambered directly into the barrel, and the operator does not have to ""pull back"" or ""rack"" the slide. Retracting the slide is difficult due to the heavy spring required in this blow-back action. The grip feel of the PT22 is ""fat"", and fills a normal-sized hand. This width may make the PT22 difficult for some smaller handed people to hold comfortably. The Taurus PT22 is able to fire most .22LR cartridges, including CCI Stingers.
Ultra light and extremely compact, Taurus small frame semi-automatic pistols offer security and reliability you can count on.  It utilizes low profile fixed sights and is made in the USA. In addition, the Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key.

The hoarding is causing these price gougers and scumbags to try charging double, triple even 5 times what the stores are charging.

cabelas has a limit on ammo and they run out fast, but they are still only selling it for 5 CENTS a round...anyone charging more is a dirtbag like that pedophile in NH that sells on here too.

All that the hoarding is going to do is put money in the pocket of lowlifes who would screw their mother for a buck, AND it tells the ammo manufacturers yeah, the idios will pay $100 a brick of 500 22s so lets raise prices.....my brother has a shop , the .380 ammo was wholesale to him at $18 a box, he sold it $22 a box, now the price wholesale to him is $39 a box....why? because they saw people buying it on ebay and on here for $50 and $75 a box, they are in it to make money, you keep driving the price up and its going to stay up, and the bitch of it is the hoarders aren't even shooters!! they just like to hoard or brag they have 20,000 rounds of 22s at home...so do I , but we shoot it everyday.

With banks closed on Saturday and todays high-tech 3D printers, I think it was likely a scam involving counterfeit paper and you wouldn't know until Monday when the bank told you. BE CAREFUL.

The PT22 is a .22LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine. The PT22 is often viewed as a Taurus copy of the Beretta 21 Bobcat due to having a similar ""tip up"" barrel. In fact this small pistol is very different in design and function from the Beretta. The PT22 is a cast steel frame and slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. The ""tip up"" barrel is useful in that the first round may be chambered directly into the barrel, and the operator does not have to ""pull back"" or ""rack"" the slide. Retracting the slide is difficult due to the heavy spring required in this blow-back action. The grip feel of the PT22 is ""fat"", and fills a normal-sized hand. This width may make the PT22 difficult for some smaller handed people to hold comfortably. The Taurus PT22 is able to fire most .22LR cartridges, including CCI Stingers.
Ultra light and extremely compact, Taurus small frame semi-automatic pistols offer security and reliability you can count on. It utilizes low profile fixed sights and is made in the USA. In addition, the Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key.

Look at the link above for info on the amazing shotgun. 

The Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility, and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. Utilizing the proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments. The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech system which reduces recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less on average; that's more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest-shooting, most reliable shotgun ever."
