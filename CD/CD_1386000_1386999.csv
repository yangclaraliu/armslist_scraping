I am asking a fair price of $900. I am not looking to trade for anything but I might entertain a trade plus cash.  I am not asking a crazy price so if you offer a trade just remember what your gun is really worth."

It came out of Colt's Custom Shop in 1978 and was in JPL's glass case marked ""Personally Owned Firearm - Not For Sale."" That sticker is still affixed to the well-worn original Colt Box. Of course, since it was marked not for sale I had to try to buy it. It took the trade of two other fine handguns and a cash hand of poker to walk out the door with it. I will be glad to provide a sworn letter to the buyer with the complete story if desired. It has sat in my safe now for 28 years. In that span of time I've owned a total of four different Pythons, a couple of Trooper Mk IIIs and a couple of Detective Specials, and as fine a revolvers as they all are, none come close to the action on this one. And no matter what angle or lighting is used, the camera simply cannot capture the incredible deep beauty that was Colt's Royal Blue at that time. There are many more pictures available; just email for them.

I'm old now, and I am simply not ever going to take this gun out and shoot it. I suppose there are still some fine unfired Pythons out there, but probably few like this one. How to say this in the most polite possible way: I'll be using the funds to enhance my granddaughter's college account, so please don't waste my time and yours with low ball offers or trades, I am not interested and they will be ignored. I figure I will probably need to list this revolver on Gunbroker to get its value but I decided to try Armslist locally first. If you're looking at Armslist from outside Colorado, yes, I will ship this gun from my dealer to yours at extra cost. Thanks for taking the time to read this listing."

This is a newly purchased Marlin 917 .17hmr. I am the original owner of this gun and purchased it about 3 weeks ago BNIB from a local dealer. I love this rifle. The classic look and feel is far superior in my book to any of the models with a plastic or laminate stock. The fit and finish is great and the accuracy is amazing. When I purchased this rifle, I walked into the store with a bulldog case, and that is how it has been stored and transported since day one. No rust, scuffs, scratches, dings, or other damage. The scope is a 3-9x marlin branded scope. The round count is between 115 and 125. My only complaint is that the factory mags do leave something to be desired...this is a very common Albeit one of the only complaints most people have about this rifle.

This is a great safe as a main safe, or a master bedroom closet safe for docs and CCW/bedside guns.

Yes, you can get a larger safe for this money or cheaper. However, with safes, you really get what you pay for. This is a quality safe at a reasonable price.

I have several boxes of quality brass cased ammo available. Everything from PMC, Remington, and PPU. I have a ton of reloaded ammo as well. Heck...if you have a gun that isn't picky about ammo, I also have some steel cased Tul-ammo for sale. I am not a dealer, I just have some extra ammo that I could part with. With everything going on, I realize that these prices are expensive, but if I don't sell one round....I could care less. This ammo shortage has been going on way longer than I thought. In the back of my mind I fear that finding ammo might not get any easier. Just look at how hard it is to find .22!

Ideally, would be: Gen 3, have night sights, Ghost 3.5 trigger job, and have 5 magazines.  Like I said, ideally!  What have ya got, what do you want?

I've got cash to make a deal or could trade musical equipment (guitars, tube amps, processors, etc).  Have valid FOID, will do dual receipts for both records, and will wait the 3 days after we finalize price and make commitment to purchase, etc, all the good deal stuff!

I know some folks are getting big money on arms now but in reality Cabelas had 3 Gen 3 Glock 23's in stock at 550 so I think a mod'd one with extra mags for that same amount is a fair starting point but let's talk and find something we both feel comfortable with and make a deal!

Thank you!"

AR-15 Hammer and Trigger Pin Dimensions: 
Some Colt® AR type rifles have been manufactured with hammer and trigger pins and holes which are approximately .176"" in diameter. These are referrend to as ""large pin"" Colts. This was done to eliminate the chances of someone putting M16 fire control parts into an AR receiver. This is not found in all Colt models, just some.
All other AR type rifle manufacturers have stayed with the .156"" diameter hammer and trigger pins and holes, or ""small pin"" which is the same spec used in all military M16 rifles.
Measure your pins or the holes in your lower receiver to determine if you have a ""small"" or ""large"" hole Colt® AR"

The box is excellent with a few wear marks on the edges, no paperwork came with the gun and no accessories. The light colored walnut checkered grips are also excellent. The only thing I can say against the gun is a little discoloration on the bright hammer flats and a very little lead fouling in the throat of the barrel which should clean out with the proper solvent. I don't think this was used or handled much over its' nearly forty year history. Great gun, smooth as any Python should be, fine looking box, nice old collectable and they are getting scarce."

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

New for 2010, the Model 92A1 and 96A1 represent Beretta’s evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol. Combining the best elements of the 92FS and the 90-Two,these pistols feature:
A. High capacity magazines: 15 rounds in 9mm.  Completely interchangeable with other 92 family magazines.
B. Removable front sight: Allows the user to easily replace a damaged sight or replace it with an accessory sight.
 C. Accessory rail: The frame of the A1’s have an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D. Internal recoil buffer: Increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver.
E. Captive recoil spring assembly: The single-piece design simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss.
F. Rounded trigger guard: Updated styling to conform with current pistol gripping practices.

92 FS. A LEGENDARY FIREARMS. 
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.

I have for sale a Savage TRR-SR Bolt Action 22...

FIRST THING TO NOTE! This DOES NOT have the Boyd's Tacticool on it in these pictures. It's on my FV-SR Currently... This one is currently wearing the factory stock from my FV-SR.

I would PREFER to sell it like it is in these pictures... But the Tacticool is available at extra cost if you REALLY want it... However Boyds has them in stock and it'll be cheaper to buy this from me and buy the Tacticool yourself than if I have to swap it back on and sell that way.

This thing is a SWEET shooter... And is threaded for Suppressor use.

Cheapest I've seen this with the Tacticool is $529... Plus you're paying transfer fees on it once it gets to your FFL... And that's only if you can actually find it in stock. These Savage ""Tactical"" versions are hard to find last I looked.

I'd like $325 for this one the way it sits.

$475 with the Factory Tacticool Stock.

Thanks for looking!"

The Ultimate Force Magnifiers.
As the #1 riflescope innovators in the world, we've worked diligently with law enforcement and military experts nationwide to design, test and prove the finest family of tactical shooting instruments in the industry.
Each model in this line uses the basic precepts of every riflescope we build – unfailing reliability and optical precision – and takes them a step further with application-specific features, such as tactical turrets for rapid adjustment, blacked-out finish for optimum concealment and new reticles for CQB or long range shooting.
We've also equipped these scopes with Ultra Wide Band Coating to boost brightness at dusk and dawn, plus argon purging for absolute reliability whatever the conditions.
This year we're proud to introduce the ultimate in versatility, our 3.5–21x 50mm, as well as the 1–6.5x 24mm, featuring true 1x power for lightning-fast target acquisition.
When the stakes are at their highest, whatever your tactical need, trust your shot to Bushnell.®

Bipod with attachments. Threaded Barrel with thread protector and muzzle/flash hider. I am including 50 rounds of the only ammo to have ever been shot through this rifle. 168 gr Match BTHP. This rifle will shoot 1/2 inch groups at 400 yards. I shoot it out to 800 yards and like to hear the gongs ring over and over. Use the Mildot's and its easy. I have put about 100 rounds through this rifle and she has been in my safe for 2 years now. Shot it at the NRA Center 1000 yard range last year while Elk Hunting down there. That was fun..Mil Dots work well! She needs a home and someone to shoot this fine rifle, it makes No sense to lock it up and forget this rifle. Its all packed in a Pelican Hard Case and it will need to come with it as it is cut for this rifle. It has place for a suppressor, which I must keep..SORRY! It is so quiet when shot suppressed..but that is another story. It comes with 2-10 round mags, the ammo, the bipod, the scope system, the pelican Hard case documents and booklet on the scope and rifle, and my recipe for the ammo it loves. I'll send that inside in an envelope. Duplicate the load and you will have a steady diet of ammo it loves. The whole package is HEAVY..so dont faint when you see a shipping of $100.00 or so. I'll get Fed Ex to ship it 2nd day Air to you. Here is your chance to get the whole thing in one package all ready to shoot. Its all set up and zeroed..just add you and go shoot! This rifle is a TAC driver to say the least. Need more intel or pics let me know. Im gonna put a NO BS price on it, so if you want it use the buy it now. Dealer price on this rifle right now is $1786.00 retail is $2394.00. The scope was right at $494.00 or so when I bought it my cost. Peleican case was $249.00, Bipod $50.00 and so on. The extra mag was 88.00, the match ammo, well its my gift to you. But ammo is not cheep any more. 50 rounds of 168 Gr Match BTHP. Not a mark on the rifle or scope..Its been protected in the hard case. Look at the pics and you will see what I mean. I personally have over $2700.00 in this system which would retail for well over $3000.00 if you were to have to buy all the pieces. All I ask is take care of her, she has been a great friend"

767,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1386767,Want To Buy:  1911 Government Frame with premium features,"Eastside, Seattle, Washington",$ 700,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 10, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am looking to buy a complete 1911 government FRAME (receiver, lower, etc) with the following features. This project is an effort to get my girlfriend into shooting and needs to be executed accordingly, so please excuse my sounding picky. If in doubt, please send me pictures--worst I can do is say no!

I will consider both series 70 and 80 frames.

Features I need, i.e. do not want to pay a gunsmith to have put in:
Beavertail grip safety with appropriately shaped hammer
High grip cut below trigger guard (either a round style like the Colt Enhanced or DE1911 frame, or a straight cut like the Caspian Basic or new Ithaca frame)

Features I really want and would pay extra for:
Checkered frontstrap (not serrated or anything else, checkered only)
Single side extended thumb safety, or an ambi safety that does not require ambi cut on grips

Features that are nice but not essential:
3-hole match trigger
Checkered mainspring housing
Higher profile mag release

The frame and parts should be in decent condition (no rust or pitting, finish wear is ok) and reasonably well fitted (original factory is fine) and in working order, with the exception of the slide stop and grips. Your frame does NOT need to have either of those parts or a slide. I will of course consider guns that have them, but I won't pay much extra.

Budget is flexible and completely depends on what is offered, but is approximately in the $300 to $700 range. Interested in anything nationwide, local would just be a plus. I will pay for shipping to my FFL.

I also have for trade a Kahr PM9 with a black slide and accessories, and a scoped Remington 541T.

Check out this Ithaca frame for a good example of the key features I want."

This sks has a very nice shiny bore. It has been properly cleaned everytime after the range. The scope is a Ultralux, and is on a risen dust cover, so when you have a scope mounted you can still shoot through the iron sights. Very accurate. Stock has a few minor scrapes. Very little recoil. Also comes with original wood handguard, and original dust cover (as shown). It is a great rifle, but I just don't shoot it very often, and thought id see what else is out there
