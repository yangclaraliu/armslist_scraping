What I'm not looking for is bolt action .22's, single shot anything or muzzleloaders/black powder, bolt action shotguns, and double barrels. I would prefer no revolvers but not completely out of the question.

I'm in Newport News near Ft. Eustis and can meet somewhere around that area within a couple miles.  Not going to south side of tunnel.  

Prime ideas would be any style Glock or XD., sig mosquito, ruger sr22, walther p22, m&p, moss 500 pistol grip with a shorter barrel in 12 ga.  would also like the .22lr rifles that are magazine fed and semi auto.  (No bolt 22's or tube fed's).
These are just some of the ideas.  Please, when messaging me, include the make, model, and caliber along with your fair asking price.  Text is good between 9am and 11pm or email anytime.  If you have a lorcin or something like that, they sell at the gun shows new all the time for $149 so please don't contact me with a used one for that price or higher.  It's a waste of time."

All steel. Steel frame, steel slide, steel barrel, steel trigger, steel 15-round magazine, steel magazine baseplate, steel freakin sights. OK - so the grips are plastic.

I bought it used, and replaced the recoil spring, hammer spring, and firing pin spring with new Wolff springs. I have the originals - which were fine, but what the heck - if you want them.

I also installed a recoil buffer (polymer thingie on the recoil guide rod, so, okay, the buffer ain't steel, either). 

Works fine - safety is good (can be carried hammer-down and on-safe, OR cocked-and-locked). 

Bore and internals are good to very good - it has been carried a lot, but shot not as much. There is considerable holster / locker / trunk wear on the grips, frame ,... heck, pretty much the outside.

Offered with one 15-round mag. I can add one or two more mags, and 9mm (European milsurp) ammo, for a package deal at additional $. How much ammo? How much you want (I will be competitive with current prices - but I ain't giving it away). No, I will not sell any ammo separately.

The only reason I am selling is because I now have an HK and no longer use the FNX.

It is simply a little nub on the back of the gun that protrudes when cocked.

It has the 7.25"" barrel and muzzle brake for extreme accuracy.  

It has good bluing with less than expected defects, factory grips (left side has a chip near safety that has been glued as shown in the photo.  I don't think any material is missing).  Hard to see and new factory grips on S&W site are $65.00 if you want to be super uptight about it.

This is an awesome collectable target competition pistol and comes with one factory 10 round mag.

Calls only as no one serious texts business.

May trade for Remington 700 Mountain Stainless 30-06 or .308 or 5-r .308 otherwise cash please

This is a great CCW .45ACP. It's been fired 150 times at the range, and I just have too many guns. Taurus is affordable, and goes bang every time! Lifetime warranty fully transferable to any owner.  This gun comes with box, keys, manual, warranty card, receipt, 2 10 rd mags, speedloader, a 12 rd mag from the 24/7 series, that has a collar to match up to this gun. Also has an in the waist band CC holster. 10 rds of .45 is more than you get with most .45's that are designed for CCW. This gun as an amazing trigger pull, it's less than 2lbs. and the re-set is 1/4 of the way after you release. I paid $374 plus tax, I know Fleet Farm clearanced them down to $349.99 when they sold them out to make room for the new line. Im asking $280.00 and am including an extra 10 rd mag, a 12 rd mag, a IWB Holster, and have added a hogue grip. I'll also include 1 box of ammo to the buyer. 

You'll love how small this thing is and it's pretty darn fun to shoot, but I cant shoot all my guns as I have too many, so I gotta start weeding some out.

Leopold VX-3 6.5-20x40mm EFR Target scope Specs:
Xtended Twilight Lens System
Now your hunt can reach further into the twilight than ever before possible, with our exclusive new Xtended Twilight Lens System™. It goes a step further than even the Index Matched Lens System®, using Leupold’s® index matched glass with wavelength specific lens coatings designed to optimize the transmission of low-light wavelengths. When most scope manufacturers quote percentage of light transmission, they usually mean at 550 nm, the green wavelength where the human eye is most sensitive. The challenge is that in twilight conditions, green light disappears and blue/violet light takes over. Your eye is already handicapped when it comes to seeing the blue/violet spectrum, and if your scope is cutting too much of it out, soon you won’t be seeing anything. The Xtended Twilight Lens System places extra emphasis on matching coatings to glass indices to achieve the best possible transmission of the blue/violet spectrum, without sacrificing the color balanced light transmission across the visual spectrum of the Index Matched Lens System. When we combine that with superior computer-generated optical design, lead-free lenses of unsurpassed clarity and quality, and 100 years of manufacturing excellence, you have a scope that gives you the details of low-light scenes in greater definition and luminance than any other scope in the world..
DiamondCoat 2
Exterior lens surfaces are treated with DiamondCoat 2™, an ion-assist lens coating, for higher light transmission and the greatest level of abrasion resistance we’ve ever offered. DiamondCoat already exceeds military standards for hardness and durability. DiamondCoat 2 offers unsurpassed durability and will prove its worth in the wildest places on earth. DiamondCoat 2 has the additional advantage of assisting in light transmission, for greater brightness, clarity and contrast.
2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing
While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.
Lead Free
Leupold optics offer better optical clarity as a result of lead-free glass lenses. In addition to its superior optics, the lenses are produced with none of the environmentally damaging by-products common to standard glass production. A small step, but one in the right direction.
Generous Eyebox
The generous eyebox makes it faster and easier to get your eye behind the riflescope and achieve a full, clear sight picture. Setting up for longer shots you'll appreciate the flexibility it affords, and in close up big game or dangerous game situations the quick target acquisition will be the difference maker. At high power, the longer eye relief and more generous eyebox gives you incredible head position latitude and an improved sight pictue that fills the eyepiece completely - putting you in better position to make the shot of a lifetime.
Blackened Lens Edges
Blackened lens edges reduce unwanted glare and diffusion through the lens edges to provide better resolution, improved contrast and superior optical performance.

CDS (Custom Dial System)
Leupold CDS™ models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers.Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged.How the CDS™ System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads.Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account:
BAS (Ballistic Aiming System)
Leupold’s® Ballistics Aiming System™ is comprised of five specialized reticles – Boone and Crockett® Big Game, Varmint Hunter’s, LR Duplex, LRV Duplex, and the new SA.B.R. reticles – which take into account the variables crucial to accurate, long-range shooting. A special ballistics indicator ring allows users to customize their power settings for their cartridge’s ballistics, then saves that setting for easy reference in a hunting situation. With multiple aiming points for longer ranges and varying wind speeds, and infinite power selector settings to match your rifle’s ballistics, the Ballistics Aiming System can help you master the art of accurate, long-range shooting. It has proved so successful in helping hunters learn how to shoot accurately at long range, we’ve expanded your BAS options with additional reticles offering many of the same benefits as the original reticles. We’ve also made them available in more riflescopes than ever. With practice, the Ballistics Aiming System will teach you how to gauge the distance to your target, where to place your reticle for that distance, and even how to compensate for wind deflection. With the Ballistics Aiming System and some practice, you’ll consistently make shots you wouldn’t have attempted in the past.Accurate, long-range shooting is probably one of the most difficult hunting skills to master. For many hunters, it remains a combination of hard-won experience, intuition, and a little luck. Together, the reticles of the Ballistics Aiming System give the hunter very useful tools for successful hunts with clean and efficient harvests. By practicing with the Ballistics Aiming System, all hunters can add science to the art of long-range shooting, and master this important skill.One System, Five Unique ReticlesThe Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and the Varmint Hunter’s reticle use the same principles to help you hone your long-range shooting skills, though each has been tailored to meet the needs of big game or varmint hunters. With practice, using each will become a natural part of your shooting. Unlike other range estimating reticles, the calculations made here are incredibly simple, and take the guesswork out of long-range shooting.Each reticle provides a series of aiming points. The first aiming point, the intersection of the Duplex® reticle, is to be used at 200 yards with most common cartridges, and 300 yards with several flatter shooting, longer-range loads. The Boone and Crockett Big Game reticle and Varmint Hunter’s reticle also provides you with two different power selector ring settings, indicated by large and small triangles on the power selector. These allow you to select the hold points best suited to the cartridge you are using. In some cases, the smaller triangle setting can be used with your slower, heavier bullet load, and the large triangle setting with your faster loads in the same rifle. The new SA.B.R. reticle also features holdover points and a power selector matched to different load settings for muzzleloaders and shotguns. The LR Duplex and LRV Duplex reticles are designed to be used only at the maximum magnification settings.For example, a 30-06 with a 180gr spitzer bullet and 2700 fps muzzle velocity would use the smaller triangle setting. In the same rifle, a 150gr spitzer bullet with 3000 fps muzzle velocity would use the larger triangle. We have designated three sets of cartridges to be used with the large and small triangle settings, and sight-in distances of either 200 or 300 yards, described as Group A (large triangle, 200 yard zero), Group B (large triangle, 300 yard zero), or Group C (small triangle, 200 yard zero). Verify the aiming points by shooting at the actual distances at which the hold points in the reticle are intended to work. With the LR Duplex and LRV Duplex reticles a shooter can tailor the reticle to his or her load by varying the magnifications, thus altering the subtensions. With all four reticles, remember: pratice, practice, practice!
MST (Motion Sensor Technology)
An important feature of select Illuminated reticle models is the Leupold-exclusive Motion Sensor Technology (MST). A single touch of the button or twist of the dial activates the illumination, offering several different intensity settings (depending on model) including a high/low indicator (FireDot reticles only). The reticle will automatically switch to “stand-by mode” after five minutes of inactivity, then reactivate whenever the rifle is moved. This eliminates the need for excess movement reaching for buttons, while extending battery life (powered by a readily available CR-2032 coin cell battery..

Locked marked Tower, Crown, and GR (King George III). 15"" Flintstock, As pictured, rare with stand, had the double crown (assume its a government issued pistol, not sure what the other two markings are that have been placed, see pics. OBO

One of the conclusions from battle experiences during the Seven Years War was the necessity of a pattern of pistol specifically for the Light Dragoon Regiments of the British Army. Introduced in the 1760s, the Light Dragoon pistol graced of holsters of the brave troopers of the 16th and 17th Light Dragoons along with American mounted units loyal to the crown. The latter included the King's American Dragoons, Tarleton's famous British Legion, along with the Hussars and Light Dragoons of the Queen's Rangers. Both the British Legion and the Queen's Rangers skirmished with the France's Lauzun Legion of Hussars during the Yorktown Campaign.

This pattern (commonly referred to as the Elliot pattern) of flintlock pistol has a 9-inch 62 calbre barrel made with tempered seamless modern steel (type:BS970 no.080M40) with a threaded breech plug. As the pictures attest, this is a beautiful pistol. Note the curve of the pistol grip/butt. This shape became popular in both the French and British armies in the 1760s. If it is not shaped this way it is not a Light Dragoon pistol."

Im asking $750 because I bought it brand new just under a year ago and I used to shoot it just about every other weekend at the range, and killed two deer (2 for 2) last season.

The action is smooth, and the gun operates identically to the newer mossbergs. This shotgun shoots great and the rubber pad on the buttstock makes it fairly comfortable to shoot for a 12 gauge.

Has a small blemish on the side of the stock, that could be sanded and stained to be invisible. Also has a very small light scratch on the receiver. Otherwise, it's in very good shape for its age.

The most common statement that is made by owners of this gun, is that it is the most comfortable .380 they have ever held or fired. Taken from a review of this pistol, "" the MS380 has great ergonomics and functions flawlessly. With some dismay I admit that the Beretta-like look of this gun makes my Glocks seem downright homely by comparison. This ATI is sleek, it’s a heckuva lot easier to shoot accurately than my Glock 36, and it operates at 100%, right out of the box.""

I have a gen 3 glock 19 with night sights tru glow Brite-sights TFO's on it in the box with the 2 mags (15rnd) and all original stuff when new. Asking $550 cash need to sell asap. Will sell with the tlr-3 for $650. REDACTED I bought this gun new and have less than 200 rounds through it. Not one mark or blemish on the gun or mags. 
Ok apparently the first line of this posting is invisible. 
THE PRICE IS $500 FOR THE GUN IN THE BOX WITH 2 MAGS (15rnd)
THE PRICE FOR THE GUN AND TLR-3 $600, that would be how it is pictured. 
And do not call me saying you have $400 or $450 cash for the gun and light, if you are on budget buy a high point, I have one I will sell you. 
Here's how I got to my price, a gun store by work has hands down the best prices on glocks period. A brand new gen 3 glock 19 is $524.99 plus tax, that is with glocks stock crappy sights. He has a few used glock 19 gen for $445 plus tax, that is with stock sights. So for those of you playing the game, that brings you to $475. No if you can find front and rear night sights and have the rear pressed in and sighted for $25 that's the way you should go. 

Prices I paid. 
Glock 19 gen 3 $557.00 with tax
Try-Glo Brite-Site tritium fiber optic (tfo) front/rear sights $95.00 shipped, installation was $40

Asking $600 for the gun as it is, or $750 with both scopes. MIGHT trade for a Glock 9mm or .40, or a Smith & Wesson M&P 9mm or .40. Call or txt me at 334-207-268four anytime. I prefer calls or txts as I do not check my email regularly. Thanks!"

There are a few of these floating around, but not many. They made 210,000 Winchester model 77's in the 1950's and 60's, which is quite a few.. But only 10 percent of those were tube-fed...that's 21,000. This is one of those Tube-fed models. I saw one sell on GunBroker last week for $455.00.
This one is in very good condition...very good, and it functions perfect and has every modern feature. They stopped making the Model 77 in the 1960's.
It is grooved for mounting a scope. (same size groove that is on the Ruger 10/22 and all .22 rifles). It has fully adjustable iron sites also. The bolt is on the left side, which is one of the tell-tale model 77 characteristics. It functions flawless and looks great. It will shoot cheap bulk ammo as fast as you can pull the trigger without a hiccup. This is a collector's gun BUT, it is ready to be an everyday shooter also. It looks and feels better than a Ruger. It is a Winchester, back when they were the best. It's not overly heavy and it lacks nothing that a brand new .22 rifle has. You don't feel like your holding an old outdated gun. Model number is 160694    $350.00 for the rifle. OR  I will install, to this rifle, a brand new in the box 40mm Simmons scope if someone has a Walther P22 (excellent condition and trouble free) or GSG-522 (also trouble free) that they want to trade me."
