My glock is almost new, I got it new earlier this month and have only put 150 rounds through it.  Comes with the box and warranty paperwork, and FIVE mags, two 9 round mags , one with a flat base and one with an extended pinky grip, and three 15 round glock 22 mags.  For the right trade I can also include 60 rounds of .40 and a leather holster.

As the title says Im wanting to trade it towards a motorcycle.
Im primarily interested in a Suzuki sv650 or a Ninja, but I would consider just about any good running sportbike 500cc's or bigger or an 800cc and up cruiser.  No junk or projects, and nothing older than mid 90's preferably, I've spent way to much time, money, and hassle messing with the older bikes.  I can add up $1200 cash for the right bike.  Not interested in dirt bikes or four wheelers or anything like that, street bikes only please.
Id love to keep the glock too though, so if you have a good running motorcycle for the cash price let me know.
I'm only wanting to trade towards a motorcycle, not really wanting to sell it.

I have well over 700$ in the accessories and case & would like to sell / trade it all as a package deal. Cash is king if buying outright ill take 2,350$ OBO, if were trading I think 2,500$ is fair trade value. I will also include 100 rounds of .45 acp Winchester ammunition. This rifle is brand new and has never been fired. It has been a trophy in my case since the day I got it and loaded it for war. Act fast these are very rare in our area and there is a 90 day wait for direct order from Kriss. The pictures attached are from it's current state minus the extra 200 lumen light I stuck on the Felix's extra weaver rail on its custom mount, back to the day it was first purchased. If you would like to see more pictures please don't hesitate to ask!!"

Luminox' self-powered illumination (LLT) allows one to view time at-a-glance, no matter what the light level, even in complete darkness -- up to 25 years of complete darkness, in fact. Being able to read time effortlessly under any and all circumstances fills a need for various military and law enforcement groups, which is why the U.S. Navy SEAL Procurement officers came to us asking us to create dive watches for them for night missions. It is also why U.S. Air Force pilots flying the F-117 Nighthawk™ Stealth Jets approached us. These are only two of many groups of ""heroes"" that truly understand and appreciate the inherent benefit of wearing a Luminox timepiece. As for the rest of the population: When was the last time you had to fumble for a light switch or a button on your watch in the dead of night? Wear a Luminox for a week and you won't want to miss it."

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

At the end of the 1982 Israel-Lebanon War arose an understanding that the modern battlefield had changed. One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts. The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics.Cash Only.."

Tomcat Description: 

The Beretta 3032 Tomcat builds on a long line of compact pocket pistols for self defense manufactured by Beretta. 

This blowback-operated pistol is designed with a double-action/single-action (DA/SA) trigger mechanism.

It is fitted with a frame-mounted manual safety, which also acts as a slide stop when engaged.

The Beretta 3032 Tomcat is a self defense pistol designed for concealed carry. The barrel can be released to pivot on a pin under the muzzle ('tip-up' barrel). 

This feature allows a round to be inserted into the chamber directly without manipulation of the slide. 

The chamber can also be easily inspected to verify whether a round is present by using the tip-up barrel. 

The pistol lacks an extractor, relying upon the expanding gasses to force the spent casing rearward.

4X Magnifier Description(not eotech): The 4X magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with holographic sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. This magnifier is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the included twist to side mount, the magnifier gives the user something never before possible – the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice-versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification. The included mount for the magnifier is the twist to side mount, which allows for quick attachment and detachment. The mount fits any MIL-Std Picatinny Rail.

The gun only had about half a box of federal FMJ fired through it since I've had it. 45acp is getting too expensive for me to shoot so this gun has been a safe queen. The gun had been at the SACS longer than it has been in my possession. There was a loooong waiting period for custom work because of demand. It has never been carried and there is a little wear on the rail due to me putting on a very tight X300.

I got it turned 180 degrees to take it off, but couldn't move it beyond that. Arsenal has some notoriously difficult to remove muzzle brakes according to what I found online and I can't get it off in my apartment without a vice or heat gun or something. Maybe someone with a bit more muscle and a garage can get it off if they want, just an FYI. Doesn't affect function of the firearm in any way."

Please do not message me asking about selling them at spot value. Yes, I know what the spot price is. Yes, I know what their silver weight/melt value is. No, I will not sell them for that. I am selling these as gift ideas and as a cool and interesting item for collectors and not as an investment item. Believe it or not similar items by weight sell on sites like eBay for more than this everyday. Besides, if you are wanting to invest in silver, do 10oz bars, not grams.

The first of its kind, and the only rifle you need to master the infinite number of extreme scenarios you'll face in the worlds of law enforcement and personal defense. Our new Bushmaster ACR redefines the term ""modular"" with the extraordinary ability to change calibers, barrel lengths and stock configurations in minutes – without the use of tools. Truly the most versatile and adaptive rifle ever conceived, it was born of a collaborative effort between Bushmaster, Magpul® and Remington® to create the ultimate military combat weapons system. We're proud to unveil the evolution you see here – built specifically for our law-enforcement and commercial markets. It's tested and proven reliable in the most brutal conditions on earth, truly ambidextrous and the uncompromising choice when you demand a rifle as mission-adaptable as you are. The Bushmaster ACR.

Recent ballistic denim covered gel testing of the 9 x 19mm. This round passed through 11 inches of bare gelatin leaving a wound channel greater than 5 inches with 7 fragments.

It came from WTO with two test targets, one .564"" group and one .382"" group @100 yards. Below you can see a list of all of the items included in this build along with the smith work performed. In addition to what work Clayton performed, I had the bolt fluted by Long Rifles Inc. in and the guys at Black-T two tone coated the bolt in black and earth brown. It has some wear on the rail where my scope was mounted, wear on the bolt coating (underneath) from hand cycling and some brass rash near the action (all very minor). It is shown pictured with a Tab sling, MK2 stock pack, and 9-13"" Harris bi-pod (swivel, notched legs, with pod-lock) Kryloned OD green. They are not included with the sale but can be for an additional cost.
