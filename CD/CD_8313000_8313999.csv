The barrel is the GI profile, 1:7 twist, and nitrided for corrosion resistance and lifespan. Gas block is a standard F height A2 front sight block. The handguard is a UTG pro 9.7"" quad rail. It's the clamp style that presses down on the barrel nut and handguard cap instead of just sitting in place. The bolt carrier assembly is fully nitrided. The charging handle is the Strike Industries ARCH, not the $10 one that every AR has on it.The lower is an Aero Precision, which has a nylon tipped screw to tension the upper against the lower. This lets you set how much play there is between the two receivers. The lower parts are all standard milspec except for the trigger and the stock. The trigger is one of the PSA polished triggers and as such as no take up or slack, and resets positively. The stock is a M4 style, but has a QD sling mount on either side so you don't have to use the sling loop on the bottom. Buffer tube is a 6-position mil-spec, buffer and buffer tube are standard carbine parts, and the buffer tube is new with less than 100 rounds through it. On the lower I also have a Magpul BAD lever on the bolt release, allowing you to drop the bolt with your trigger finger.The rifle also has rail covers, a QD sling mount on the rail, and a Magpul MS4 (I believe) OD Green adjustable sling.Included with the rifle are 10 USGI magazines, three of which have Magpul Ranger Plates on them, a Plano 42"" hard case, and a 350 lumen weapon light with high, low, and strobe settings as well as a lockout.Pictured on the rifle are a Streamlight HLX weapon light and a Vortex Crossfire red dot sight. The HLX is a programmable 1,000 lumen, 27,000 candela weapon light that takes either 2 CR123s, or 1 18650 rechargeable. The Vortex Crossfire RDS is a micro pattern red dot sight with 11 brightness settings and a 7,000 hour battery life on setting 7. I'll include the HLX on the rifle for $700 total, the Crossfire for $750, or both for $850.It's been a good rifle, I just need the money much more than the rifle right now. Contact me through text at (573) 644-3203. I'd be happy to tell you more about the gun or send additional pictures on request. Have a great day and stay safe."

This classic weapon features the original and super-durable milled receiver. Chambered for the 7.62x39mm, it has a 16-3/8"" chrome-lined barrel with threaded muzzle. Condition is excellent and I'd grade the overall condition at about 98%. There are couple of light handling marks but no rust or any pitting. The stocks show very minor wear with just a couple of small handling impressions. The wood has never been sanded or refinished. The serial numbered parts are all properly matching. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. Upon disassembly I did note a small amount of corrosion to the tip of the gas piston which will not affect function of the weapon. It comes with the original/excellent condition bayonet & scabbard, two original Poly marked 30-round chrome follower mags, a Poly marked 5-shot mag, the original sling, oil bottle, cleaning kit (in butt trap), and the original Kengs/Legend owner's manual. Of the highest quality and imported for only a short time (1988-1989), the Poly-Tech Legend is among the most desirable of all the AK variants.I CAN BE REACHED DIRECTLY VIA     raiderb22@mail.com"

I have a top and bottom ghillie base from tactical concealment. this isnt the giant green jute monster from cabelas, this is real kit. Not new but id say at 99% of new. its a little dusty as it has been worn in JRTC a few times but never had an actual ghillie wash, was kept as a backup/ new guy roll. The top is an original cobra, half sleeve and no hood, backing is wide grid and multicam base. no rips or tears at all, has some jute and 550 loops, basically ready for indig veg. originally 122.20 from the site. The pants are the Armadillo Light Duty Chaps, wide grid and coyote backing. All clips are good, no rips or tears in the mesh, same as top with jute and 550 loops. original price is 167.70. I also have a ghillie boonie, made at the school house, pretty dusty been used but in great and serviceable shape. tail is a little long but do what you want with it. The kit is great for hot weather and with use of any kind of chest rig. I can send actual pictures of the kit upon request. almost 300 from the shop, im asking 250 obo or trade for other hood rat stuff. shoot me a text anytime. 315-87seven-43one1. name is neil.....thanksi cant post the link to the site but its at tactical concealment ""dot"" com"
