It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower. We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 5rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

Never used.  With all three covers!  Each MD-20 drum now comes with a smoke rear cover installed and also includes a spare clear and black cover. 

What sets the MD-20 apart from others?

Tried and proven design with real time use!

Unequaled reliability and durability!

Less friction from moving parts and feedlips!

At 2 lbs, the MD-20 is close to 6 ounces lighter than the imitator. And even though our drum is much lighter it is still stronger because it's weight was added for strength while the imitator's weight was added for low cost, ease of manufacturing.

Design Simplicity, 3 moving & 15 total parts!

Easier to load the MD-20 from the top than it is to use the imitator's load assist.

Locks into gun tight with virtually no movement!

The MD-20's rear cover is recessed in the drum body protecting it's locking points and better reinforcing both cover and body. 

Our smoke cover is usable in much lower light conditions than the imitator.

The MD-20 is the best because it was built because we personally wanted it for ourselves, not just to have another item to sale to the masses...

The MD-20, Saiga-12 drum mag is made of only the best materials available. It loads 2 3/4inch shells and has a simple design with very few moving parts for the utmost in reliability, durability, and ease of maintenance. Our drum is made entirely in the USA! The MD-20 can be stored loaded!

Brass casing, 115 gr., new ammo.  $225 for 500 rounds.  No sales less than 500 rounds, it's too much of a hassle to deal with, sorry.
Firm on price, quantity and no trades. All inquiries to negotiate terms will be ignored - I'd rather just keep it and shoot it myself than haggle around about anything. Sorry ... but believe it or not, I don't mind having this ammo sitting around even if I do trip over it every once in a while. I am selling some of my ammo stock so I can buy reloading supplies and still keep the peace at home. I'm not desperate for cash or room in my gun case, and I'm not into negotiating for fun. I'm selling these at an inflated price compared to 6 months ago, and I will be buying reloading supplies at inflated prices so my karma all works out.
Shipping to areas without crazy laws is not a problem.
1000 rounds available at this time.

This is a very rare variant of an extremely hard to come by pistol. In 1979, Wayne Daniel manufactured a semi auto only version and somehow (miraculously, I still don't know how he pulled it off) was able to get the BATFE to approve it as a Title 1 firearm i.e. a 'Regular' gun. The open bolt semi auto M10 pistol manufactured by RPB were initially made using surplus SMG parts bought from Military Armaments Corporation when they went out of buisness in 1978. The period of manufacture was short lived however as in 1982 - the BATFE reversed its decision on approving the open bolt semi auto guns when it was found that they were easily converted to full auto. Effective June 21st 1982, any new M10's made as open bolt pistols were to be considered Title 2 firearms (i.e. machine guns).... These were produced for less than 3 years and can never be made again. In case you don't believe that there is any way this can be legal please read the following text of the ATF decision rule 82-2 which banned any more of these from being made but (luckily for you) allowed the ones already in circulation to be grandfathered. This is sold as a unique collectible pistol, you are responsible for complying with all state and federal laws (i.e. don't do anything illegal with it, to it, around it. Don't think illegal thoughts, don't contemplate any hypothetical, don't ask any SHTF questions, and don't discuss anything nefarious even as a joke...)

Info from site:
The SP-223 lower is made of 7075T6 billet, and is type III hard anodized black with Teflon coating. Our lower has features like no other lower on the market. Some key differences of the SP lower are the oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, large front grip, and a nice beveled mag well opening. The oversized, built in trigger guard allows the use of a thick winter glove. The magazine release area has been designed to allow quick and easy access to the release button from any position. Also, the mag well is wider and elongated in the front for a sure grip as well as having a large beveled opening for fast, smooth mag changes. An upper receiver tensioning screw is located under the grip, and it also includes a captive detent spring to retain the rear takedown pin.
The Gen 2 Lower features an ambidextrous bolt release (Pre-installed)
