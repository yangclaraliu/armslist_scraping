 I've put exactly 160rds flawless rounds through it. Sights are DEAD ON and it is a very accurate shooter.
 Included will be a bayonet, and 540 assorted rounds consisted of 140rds of WPA 124G HP, 80rds of WPA 124G FMJ, 20rds of Wolf 123G FMJ, 60rds of TulAmmo 122G FMJ, and 240rds of TulAmmo 124G FMJ.

 I am taking a MASSIVE loss of $ here, but its OK. I just want another bike. I paid 8.50/20rds of ammo, which makes the value of the ammo alone $230 not including the tax I paid.
    I'm asking $1000 for everything in the pics, which I feel at the current ""free market"" frenzy, this is a very reasonable deal!
 I really can't accept any less. I'm already losing a pretty substantial amount.

This is the one I shoot the least, so...

This is an FN Herstal PBR in 308 caliber, with the 22"" medium bull barrel.
In case you're not familiar, this rifle is based on the Pre-64 Winchester model 70 action, which is generally held by real shooters to be one of the finest rifle bolt actions ever made. It's rock-solid and designed to outlast me, you, and your kids. :)

The stock is a Hogue fully overmolded with a solid aluminum bedding block/pillar system, free floating the barrel.

The scope is a cheap NCStar, but it's VERY high powered (10-40x!) and worked fine the day I tried it out.

It includes a Harris-type bipod (not sure of brand, may be a Harris, not sure) and a really nice padded tactical (shock) sling.

The metal has been Duracoated in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) inside and out to protect from the elements, should you decide to hunt in foul weather.

This is an extremely rare rifle. There is exactly 1 one for sale on gunbroker, and none that I can find here on Armslist, if that tells you anything.

I've only had it to the range once (got it in trade a while back), but it shot just over 1 MOA with cheap steel case FMJ ammo at 200 yards in a nasty gusting crosswind. All the reviews and range reports I've found say that it's easily sub-MOA with decent ammo. I have no reason to doubt it.

The previous owner told me he had some bolt work done to it, so it's supposed to be slicker than stock. I don't have anything to compare it to, but the action is very smooth.

The trigger is adjustable. I'm not sure how it's set at the moment, but my ""finger scale"" says it feels like around 3.5 lbs with very little travel, so I'm happy.

I'm not really looking to trade, since that would defeat the purpose of ""getting rid of a few guns"", but you're welcome to offer if you have something you think I might like."

I purchased this last month for my now ex-girlfriend to use, and, well, she's my ex-girlfriend now. I have spent a LOT of money on this rig. Everything is brand new, and was purchased within the last month. What you get is:

Bushmaster ORC AR-15 w/Original Box
Low Profile Red Dot Sights
Pro Low-Profile Bipod 
Forward Grip (Needs a bolt)
Original Bushmaster Aluminum 30 Round Magazine
Aluminum (Not plastic) Quad Rail
(2) Thermold Polymer 20 Round Magazines
Pillared Plano Hard Shell Case
Aluminum (Not plastic) 45 Degree Back Up Iron Sights

Original Handguard is also included. It has some mars from being removed.

I have A LOT OF MONEY into this rig, and I should have thought twice before spending this kinda money on the chick. My new girl is scared to death of rifles, so no go, there. My loss, your gain, I guess.

I don't have any ammo for it (I already sold it), but I can steer you in the right direction to get hold of some for a decent price. Another thing you should move quickly on, as the legislation will also greatly affect how we can get ammo in the future. I think it's time we all moved to New Hampshire...

The rifle has never been fired. The rifle will need to be sighted as it's never left the gun safe at my old man's house since I got it. Sighting it is quick and easy to do.

I'd love to keep it, but rent is overdue, and I need the cash.

Make me an offer. I am not looking to price gouge. And I am flexible on the price, but don't insult me with or waste both of our time with lowball offers.

Serious buyers ONLY. Cash ONLY. No trades. No deliveries. 

No sales to those that are not eligible.

This sale is to be made in accordance with all local and state laws.

Email me and I will get back to you very quickly (best time to get me is between 10AM and 12 Midnight)"

***New Gun Legislation In Rhode Island***

New gun legislation is on the way in RI...

The governor is announcing the new legislation on Tuesday morning of this week... In clear violation of our Second Amendment rights.

The time to buy is now.

I purchased this last month for my now ex-girlfriend to use, and, well, she's my ex-girlfriend now. I have spent a LOT of money on this rig. Everything is brand new, and was purchased within the last month. What you get is:

Bushmaster ORC AR-15 w/Original Box
Low Profile Red Dot Sights
Pro Low-Profile Bipod 
Forward Grip (Needs a bolt)
Original Bushmaster Aluminum 30 Round Magazine
Aluminum (Not plastic) Quad Rail
(2) Thermold Polymer 20 Round Magazines
Pillared Plano Hard Shell Case
Aluminum (Not plastic) 45 Degree Back Up Iron Sights

Original Handguard is also included. It has some mars from being removed.

I have A LOT OF MONEY into this rig, and I should have thought twice before spending this kinda money on the chick. My new girl is scared to death of rifles, so no go, there. My loss, your gain, I guess.

I don't have any ammo for it (I already sold it), but I can steer you in the right direction to get hold of some for a decent price. Another thing you should move quickly on, as the legislation will also greatly affect how we can get ammo in the future. I think it's time we all moved to New Hampshire...

The rifle has never been fired. The rifle will need to be sighted as it's never left the gun safe at my old man's house since I got it. Sighting it is quick and easy to do.

I'd love to keep it, but rent is overdue, and I need the cash.

Make me an offer. I am not looking to price gouge. And I am flexible on the price, but don't insult me with or waste both of our time with lowball offers.

Serious buyers ONLY. Cash ONLY. No trades. No deliveries. 

No sales to those that are not eligible.

This sale is to be made in accordance with all local and state laws.

It has about 600 rounds through it, about half of which was tulla-ammo (steel case) and it has had ZERO malfunctions. The reliability of this gun has been top notch, but I would like to sell it so I can build an AR-15. It is mostly stock, all I have changed on it is the recoil spring which I changed out at about 400 rounds to a Wilson Combat 18.5# spring (because Hilton Yam of 10-8 Performance did this to his SW1911TA and had zero problems; btw I changed the spring before any reliability issues came up).

I have carried this gun on occasion so there is slight holster wear, and there is slight wear on the bottom of the rail where I attach my light (not included).

Included in the sale is:
200 rounds of Remington 45ACP,
110 rounds of loose ammo (almost all Federal brand, kept in a cool dry location for up to 1 year),
2 original magazines,
3 Kimber magazines,
20 rounds of Winchester PDX Defender (purchased a couple weeks ago),

Bravo Concealment double magazine holder,
Bladetech double magazine holder,
Wilson Combat spring replacement kit (minus the recoil spring which is in the gun),

Wilson Combat extended slide release.

Shockwave Exploding Rifle Targets are designed to be safe, legal, fun, and affordable!

Safe: Shockwave Targets are non-flammable, non-hazardous, non-toxic, and are very stable. The only way to detonate our targets is by a .223 or higher caliber rifle round (rounds exceeding 2,200 fps).

Legal: Our product has been approved for civilian use in the United States.  For more information on the legal use of exploding targets in your area, please contact your local government agency.

Fun: The LOUD, CHEST-THUMPING BLAST that our targets produce is comparable to a stick of dynamite! It is hard to put the AWESOMENESS of our product into words - you just need to try one to find out for yourself!

Affordable: Shockwave Targets retail at most sporting good stores at reasonable prices….and you may also find them at discounted prices or bundled with other products."

This rifle has had only 90 rds shot thru it.
