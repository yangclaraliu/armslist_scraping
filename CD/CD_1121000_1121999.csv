The vertical foregrip provides you with a rock solid hold on your rifle. Integrated into the foregrip is a laser sight on one side, and a dual-intensity tactical light on the other.

The instinctive activation switches are ambidextrous, letting operators select the light or the laser individually, or both simultaneously. Laser and light functions are programmable, so operators can also select from three illumination modes: independent momentary, strobe, or constant-on. The master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either side. Additional future components can integrate into the robust platform.

The MVF-515 fits rifles equipped with quad rails. It also fits many rifles with single rails, although we would suggest you borrow an MVF-515 from a friend to test on your single rail-equipped rifle before ordering to be sure it will fit.

 Favorite This is a Colt AR 15 SP1. According to the five digit serial number  it appears the rifle was manufactured in 1968. This rifle is flat sided/slick sided (no forward assist).

On Monday, the Colorado House of Representatives passed House Bills 1224, 1226, 1228, and 1229, all of which would severely encroach on the rights of Colorado gun owners if signed into law. These bills have were rammed through their respective committees over the past few days in a veritable blitzkrieg to get them passed before gun owners could respond. All four will soon be heard by the senate.

 I urge you to contact your state senator as soon as possible and ask them to vote ‚Äúno‚Äù on all of these bills. If you‚Äôre not sure who your local legislators are, you can find them here: http://votesmart.org/. You can also find your legislators‚Äô contact information at http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLI...y?openFrameset for the House and http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLI...n?openframeset for the Senate. In addition to succinctly voicing your opinions on the bills, it may be helpful to remind your legislators that you will be keeping their actions in mind during the 2014 election.

 I would also encourage you to attend town hall meetings over the weekend. Such meetings are public forums where you can voice your opinions about issues affecting Colorado and your local community. We are trying to concentrate on the Senate townhalls, since the bills will be heard by the senate soon, but it would be great if you could let House members know how you feel. Also, if any of you are able to bring a video camera, we‚Äôd love to capture the meetings on film.

 Please call your local city council or Republican Party or do a Google search to find town hall meetings going on in your area. I‚Äôve provided the times and locations of a few local meetings that will be going on soon:

Wassenaar Arrangement Semiautomatic Rifles (WASR)

WASR-10 and variants
The WASR-10 is a post-ban version of the AKM rifle in 7.62x39mm caliber. Factory-original rifles only support single-stack, low-capacity magazines (ten rounds), but are frequently modified by Century Arms to accept double-stack, regular-capacity magazines (thirty rounds or more). Pistol grip and thumbhole stocks are both commonly found.

GP WASR-10
After the sunset of the assault weapons ban, importers were able to legally equip WASR-10s with compensators, bayonet lugs, and folding stocks, thus making the GP WASR-10 (with GP standing for general purpose)."

So I finally decided to get rid of my upper receiver group for my AR-15 with the interest of building a new one as a hobby. I purchased this Upper as part of a complete AR-15 from another private party. It has 90 rounds through the barrel. It is painted; the paint-job isn't bad in my opinion, but I bought it that way and I really like it. It's a light coat and could easily be painted over.

719,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1121719,For Sale:  WARNING!!! Code 3 Tactical Beware!!!,"""from Dayton"", Ohio, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 20, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Some nice fella ""from Dayton"" gave out some friendly advice against buying from these ""price gougers on here"". He told a lovely story about buying a nice big bucket of 22lr for the low, low, low (did I say LOW??) price of $80 bucks. Got it in 12 days! My word, that sounds great!

And by ""great"", maybe more like too good to be true. I went to the website, and found 500 rd bricks of 22lr IN STOCK!!!!! For $23.99. They even have a coupon code posted on their home page that gives you $1.50 off each box of ammo you order over $10. Wow, how unnecessarily friendly of them!!! It makes me want to frantically order a bunch more ammo. This is Shangrila!! They are selling Magtech MagSafe ammo for $14.99 ($13.49 after coupon code). Cool! I'll take 1000 rounds of that. Hey, let's go for big air-- .223 ammo. Hornady Steel cased match grade ammo, 50 rd boxes for 23.05. Wow, after my coupon code, that works out to 43 cents per round! And shipping prices seem pretty well in line with normal. 

If you look closely, you will note that they state that ""store inventory level is not updated to this website."" Hmmm. But they let me order it as if it WERE in stock. I clicked for details:

""What do we stock?
Unlike most internet dealers, we have a real store in a real building with a real inventory.  This is not a hobby business. We encourage you to visit us at our Madison, Wisconsin location. Before you visit another retailer's website, we encourage you to find out if they actually have a real location that you can visit, not just a basement or home office with no inventory.  We are an authorized dealer or distributor for all of the gear we sell!""

(So, you have an actual retail store in a state far away. That makes you sound super legit. You're not doing business out of some basement, selling items you don't even have in stock...)

""As stated in our shipping policy, our website does not list stock status. Although we stock the most popularly ordered items, it is impossible to stock the tens of thousands of items we offer. If your purchase is time sensitive and are concerned if you'll get your order in time, we encourage you to click the customer service button and we can let you know if the gear you need is in stock and if not, approximately how long it will take to get.""

(The customer service button states that live chat is not available at this time. But don't worry, just leave a message...)

So, you will gladly sell us absolutely anything, in any quantity, for shockingly low prices, as if people weren't buying ammunition in quantities 10x the pre-panic rate? Even though you do not have the items we are buying in stock. Even though most items you offer you freely admit you do not ever stock, at your super-legit, real store. Even though you have no idea when the actual suppliers of the ammo I'm ordering will be able to deliver it to me, if at all, at the ridiculously low prices you are advertising? Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Maybe I'm just jaded.

So, whatever, it's worth a shot, right? I can just place an order, and if it's taking too long, like a month, let's say, I can just cancel my order, right? Wrong:

""You can cancel your order for any reason with 24-hours notice. Occasionally we might have some items shipped direct from the manufacturer. Once we place an order with a manufacturer depending on the manufacturer we might not be able to cancel your order. If your order was a special order item we do reserve the right to charge a restocking fee of 10% of your order total, not including shipping. To cancel your order simply send us an email to REDACTED with your request. Your order will be canceled and refunded in full within 24-hours.""

May I suggest that maybe, just maybe, they don't have their super-legit-super-duper-realer-than-real store stocked to the rafters with 22lr at $22.49 per 500. It's a possibility, right? So, in the terribly unlikely event that they don't have you covered for your ammo, they will of course do the right thing for you and place the order with the manufacturer of the ammo. In that case, they simply ""can't"" cancel your order. Even if it takes months? No way...

Way. Google it. Or better yet, check the BBB website. They give this company an ""F"" rating. I wonder how many people, in the current climate where it is normal for companies to be 2-4 weeks behind getting orders shipped, are waiting patiently for their orders to arrive?"

The magazine spring is very strong still and since I have owned it I have only put less than 10 rounds through it, it shoots like a dream, however I have no real need for a .30-06 caliber rifle. The bore is very strong, near new condition. The one thing that has been replaced as far as I know is the stock which appears to be a 1970s era Remington 700 series stock to sporterize the rifle for sporting/hunting usage. Don't miss out on this rifle, it's a sweet shooter for a good deal!

I've owned it for over 20 years and fired exactly 92 rounds through it. It comes with two magazines, the leather holster, two set of grips (OEM brown plastic and Pierce rubber) and an optional two 50-rd boxes of FMJ ammo. When I purchased it I paid extra the distributor for special hand select. With only very slight bluing wear at the muzzle and safety, I estimate this gun to be 98%.

This is a rare pistol as it has a fixed rear sight. Only a small amount were imported before importation was cut off. Only pistols with a very cheap, low quality adjustable rear sights were allowed to be imported afterward. This one is the real deal. The bore is chrome lined an excellent and the inside of the slide and frame shows little to no wear. The letter code shows this pistol was made in 1960.

From the web: East Germany
The Ernst Thaelman factory in Suhl, Thueringen made what are considered by some to be the finest pre-fall-of-the-Berlin Wall Makarovs. The finish is nice, the fit and machining is of quality you'd expect from a German shop, and they shoot like a dream. Almost all that came into this country had already seen service, so their quality varies by how they were treated by the person who carried them. Nonetheless, most have more holster wear than bore wear. They occasionally still pop up at dealers and at gun shows.

If you check Gunbroker.com right now, you'll find one just like mine already with one bid at $550 before shipping, not to mention the dealer fees for NICS after you get it here. So the price is firm at $495 for the pistol alone or $545 with the two boxes of ammo. But..	I will entertain trades up or down so let me know what you have. No offense intended, but no response means no interest. And I can send larger pics if desired. Thanks for looking."

I am only renting ""trigger time"" for a chance to shoot this beautiful piece of history.

I have available ""for rent"" a Semi-Auto Only version of the Browning M1919a4 air-cooled light machine gun of WWII fame.  Originally built in the USA for WWII, this particular gun was lend-leased to Israel after the war, where it was converted from the original .30-06 chambering to 7.62 NATO.  In Israel  it saw heavy use in combat (judging by barrel erosion) during their several wars.  Eventually, it was ""demilled"" and returned to the USA as parts, and it was eventually rebuilt on a dedicated semi-auto only, BATFE approved reciever.  I now own this fine piece of American engineering, and have conversion barrels to allow the gun to fire not only the original .30-06 and Israeli 7.62 NATO, but also 8mm mauser ammunition.  I also have a home-built tripod on which to mount the gun, as well as a hand-built pine ""transit chest"" and a full complement of original accessories.  And now I am giving YOU the chance to use it to send some lead downrange.

For just $100.00 I will bring this M1919a4 to the shooting range for you to get your very own chance to fire this beautiful war-horse.  Your $100 gets you:

-Trigger time on this rare firearm, which comes in its own handmade ""transit chest""
-Basic safety and operation instruction
-Tripod and firearm setup, to include headspacing the firearm
-Target stand rental, complete with one ""Tom Ridge"" style bad-guy target
-Enough time to thoroughly enjoy yourself shooting without being rushed.

In addition to simply getting the chance to shoot, I will give you instruction in basic firearm safety, as well as the operation and function of the M1919a4.  I currently hold a valid US Military ""Range Safety Officer"" certificate, and I am also a trained ""First Responder"" as well as being certified in First Aid and CPR.

This gun fires from either disintegrating metal links or cloth belts.  I have ammunition pre-linked in both links and 100-round cloth belts at the current market rate of 40 cents per round. (Do a quick Google search for rifle ammo, and you'll quickly see that this price is quite a bargain). 

I WILL let you shoot your own ammo (up to 400 rounds) if you like after you have purchased at least 100 rounds of my ammunition (Gun can digest 30-06, 7.62 NATO / .308 Win, and 8x57 / 8mm Mauser).  I do however have some reasonable restrictions on the type of ammo I'll allow to be fired through this gun, and I reserve the right to reject any renter-provided ammo at my discretion.  For informational purposes, I have no problem with factory boxed ammo and NATO surplus or other quality surplus military ammunition (corrosive ammo is OK too!).  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES will reloaded ammunition be fired through this gun, NO EXCEPTIONS.  Due to time and logistical constraints, customer supplied ammo cannot be linked/belted on scene, but will be ""traded"" round-for-round with pre-belted/linked ammo that I supply.

Just know this:  if you are planning on buying ""just"" 50 or 100 rounds, think again.  This is the most addictive gun I've ever shot, and after you squeeze off the first couple of rounds it almost seems wrong to not just dump the entire belt in rapid-succession.  The original machine-gun version had a fairly slow rate of fire, so it is not hard to approximate that rate with a reasonably fast semi-auto trigger pull.  Once you get a taste, you WILL want more.

Ladies?  Kids?  No problem!  Since the M1919a4 fires from a tripod, there is ZERO felt recoil - just a little vibration coming through the pistol grip as the gun ""walks around"" on its tripod.  If the shooter can handle the vibration of a cell phone or an XBox controller, then they'll be able to handle shooting this firearm. Unfortunately, I do not have a Transit & Elevation / T&E mechanism available so long-range shots are not really the name of the game here.  But the gun is still plenty shootable in it's current ""free aim"" mode on the tripod.

The details:
Contact me via email, and include your contact phone number.  From there we will set up a date/time/location.  I am happy to come to lawful shooting locations in the greater Sierra Vista/Hereford/Bisbee area.  Other locations are not out of the question, but mileage WILL be charged for longer distances.  Any lawful shooting area is fine by me- private range, public land, or organized shooting range (if allowed by range rules).  Just keep in mind:  if going to a public range, this baby WILL attract ALOT of attention.    So much attention in fact, that you may find it quite distracting and may take away from your experience.  But then again some people dig that, so to each his own.  I am available daily in the mid- late-afternoon.  48 hours notice required, and no appointments available on February 26, nor March 1-4.  Need more than ""just an afternoon"" or looking to set up target shooting session with your friends? I can arrange a full range day, but I will not be available for such range days until later in March.

In addition to the gun accessories necessary for operation (transit chest, tool rolls, spare barrels, ammo, tripod), I have a small collection of WWII accessories that I will bring for free if interested (including an original WWII vintage US military helmet and/or reproduction WWII Nazi Helmet).

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!!!  For just $100 more, I can also bring along an early WWII production Springfield Armory M1 Garand Rifle (restored), a late WWII production Winchester M1 Carbine (original good condition), and a Springfield Armory (tm) reproduction of an early WWII M1911a1 pistol, ALL of which you will have the chance to shoot.  For the true WWII aficionado, this could be your once-in-a-lifetime chance to shoot nearly every major US martial arm of the WWII era ALL IN ONE SITTING.  I'll bring the guns, their related accessories, and one magazine of ammo each (with the option to purchase more if desired*).  All you have to do is show up and enjoy!

*Supplied ammo prices are slightly higher for these guns due to current market forces.

Fine print:
I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
No gang members / gang attire.
Anyone convicted of any felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is prohibited from possessing firearms/ammo, and is thus ineligible for this offer.
Payment due at the beginning of the range session.  The $100 rental fees are non-refundable.  You will only be billed out for the ammo you shoot (i.e., I will not charge you for a full belt if you only shoot some of it... you'll only pay for what goes ""bang"").
All empty brass fired from my guns becomes my property... if you supply your own ammo, your empty brass WILL NOT be returned to you.

What are you waiting for?  Jump on this offer TODAY and get your chance to fire the iconic American firearms of WWII.

I was trying to buy a NOS SKS to turn into a range/hunting rifle - detachable mags, Tapco stock, etc. and I approached my uncle, who has, what I now know is a C&R license.

I asked him if he could get me an SKS at a decent price and he said he'd give it a shot. A few days later he called me back and said he had one for me for $300. 

After I got home and opened the box, those of you familiar with the C&R license can imagine my surprise. I ended up with a rifle that has seen active duty.

This rifle was made at Factory 26 with matching serials of 239XXX, placing its production at 1956 -- the first year of the Chinese SKS. It has the appropriate stock and blade bayonet and shows signs of active duty use. As best as I can tell, it is still in working order. The bolt and trigger mechanisms still function, but I have not shot it.

It has been sitting in the box it came in for a month. I've gone back and forth, but given its history, I can't bring myself to break this gun down and make it ""tacticool.""

It is still coated in cosmoline and comes in the box with a manual for a Yugo (?). I paid $300 for this rifle and $300 is what I'm looking for. It may be worth more than that, but I'd rather it end up with someone who really respects this rifle for what it is. If you intend to disassemble it, fine, but please don't let me know about it. Unfortunately, I do not have any ammo for it.

It's going for $300 cash or a NOS SKS that won't wrack my conscious when I start popping rivets.

I can be reached through Armslist or by call/text at REDACTED.  My name is Justin and I'll meet you anywhere in the metro Nashville area. I've been a CCW holder since 2005."
