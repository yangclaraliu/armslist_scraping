Thanks! 

A beautiful un-banned Arsenal Bulgaria with milled receiver and placed in Russian Red stained wood with Bayonet lug and Bayonet. Bulgarian made and imported. The last of the old style 45 degree gas blocks of original AK47 type. The stock is a US made as well as enough parts to make it 922R compliant. The butt stock is a two tang type however and the SA-93 is single tang so the only flaw if there is one. Perfect working condition and just normal handling marks. Hardly shot with perfect chrome lining. I will include two Euro type magazines and 100 rounds of Golden tiger. 

Yes, the drum mag in the pictures can also be obtained with it as well as the Slab side. All negotiable. 

Kalishnikov himself proclaimed these Bulgarians to be the best.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model Smith & Wesson500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. What sets it apart from the 92FS is: Distinctive military style markings: on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols.

Excellent deal for $550
Berreta Info: 

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

Other PX4 Accessories 3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. 

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction).

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

FN’s new FNX 45 is a DA/SA design with the usual long first shot trigger pull followed by a very nice single action trigger. The ambidextrous thumb safety serves as both a de-cocker as well as a manual safety like the 1911. The pistol can be carried in what we 1911 shooters call condition 1. When depressing the safety the shooter has to make sure they don’t depress it to hard or they will de-cock the pistol."

HK P30 $949
M730903-A5



A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

P30 and P30S models available in 9 mm and .40 S&W.
Key Features:

Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates
MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories

This is the hard to find Hi-Capacity Bersa 380. Its basic design is that of a Walther PPK, a proven German pistol with strikingly handsome looks. Going beyond the PPK, It features an amazing 15+1 capacity, Satin Nickel Finish,a factory Hogue-like rubber grip instead of the plastic ones on most 7-shot Pistols. It has twice the capacity of most 380's which solves the problem of insuficient capacity, multiple bad guys, etc, or being forced to pack an extra magazine with you."

Berreta Info: 

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

Other PX4 Accessories 3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. 

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

Something like that at least. If you look them up there are not very many options so you wil see it right away. They are rated very good and built the same way for being a cheap safe. I bought it for double what Im offering it for. It has an electronic pad to get in with for added security and quicker to get in and out of. You can replace the battery from the outside so you never have to worry about that. The electronic pad has been proven much better in keeping people out as the combination locka over time have become figured out by pros and can be picked. Anyway weaee moving and I was attempting to try to sell it since I am ready to get a much bigger one because ive grown out of this one and it just so happens to be im moving so its a perfect excuse to buy another one  . I listed it without a picture a couple of days ago but didnt list a picture so now I took a couple of pictures  . Here is the gold part about this. I need this out TODAY! !! Yes this is it.

Great carry gun! Chiappa Rhino 20DS only $839
Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

All numbers matching, with period correct sling, soft leather case lined with mohair I believe, bore snake, copper bore brush, and 69 rounds of Prvi Partizan 139 gr. Soft point ammo. Would be a dandy hunting round. I have quite a bit once fired brass as well, also PPU, 55 to be exact.

Anyone who knows Swede Mausers know they are quality, accurate, and beautiful pieces of historical arms collections. This one is no different. Minimal recoi, blast, and accuracy make them a pleasure to own and fire.

My price and trades are firm. If it doesn't sell at my price, I will keep it gladly. Text preferred, for questions or pictures. I work days, so ill be more apt to respond to inquiries during the day, and send pics in the evening. Local pickup, cash only. Thank you for looking."

The Regent R350CR is a compact variant of the 1911 with a four-inch barrel. It is equipped with a rail, beavertail grip safety, ambidextrous extended thumb safety, commander-style hammer and skeleton trigger. Shipped with a 7-round magazine and Hogue® grips already installed, the Regent R350CR retails in the neighborhood of a reasonable $600.

Quality is not left to chance—the slide of the Regent is manufactured from CNC machined bar stock with a low-cut ejection port, the frame is steel investment cast, and the barrel is hammer forged stainless steel—all manufactured to ISO 9001 and NATO AQAP 120 quality standards.

Accessorizing the R350CR handgun can be as simple as adding almost any aftermarket part made for M1911-style pistols, giving you the ability to customize your sidearm to fit your style.

A while ago, I bought this with the intent of mounting it on one of my .223/5.56 rifles but as things tend to go sometimes, I traded that one for one in 308 caliber.  Anyway, I thought I'd put it this up for sale and buy one that will work on my 308.

The unit is absolutely brand new, never mounted, never adjusted in any way.  Original Pelican Case, dust cover, lens pen and paperwork. The unit was purchased new from Outpost Armory.

MSRP on these units is over $1,500; usual retail prices are in the $1,300 range (plus tax of course); I’m asking $1,100 which will definitely save you a decent amount of $$$ compared to buying from a dealer!

Would much prefer to do this face to face to avoid shipping it…willing to meet anywhere in the Middle Tennessee area and I make fairly frequent trips to Knoxville so meeting there or in-between is usually not a problem!

Tanks for looking!

The unit looks exactly like the one pictured in the link below but if you want pictures of my unit I'll be happy to send them by text. Just to be clear; this model is the TA11H which carries an MSRP of $1,531

Not interested in any trades at this time, sorry.

Top quality flintlock was bought for a museum display that never happened. Has been in storage for over a year and never shot.
This is not a kit gun or some thing turned on an assembly line, it is all custom.
According to the original paper work the gun was created by D. Prudden (stamped in the barrel) . The gun has a Jim Cambers lock and a octagonal to round, Getz Barrel.  This gun is a representation of the early 1700's long hunter or militia gun. As as smooth bore it will give you lots of success hunting large game as well as fowl. I will consider a partial trade for a M1 garand or carbine or possible a colt pistol. I will be glad to ship and it should cost no more than $50.00 s/h/i to get it to you in the USA.

By taking you out of your comfort zone and exposing you to being tired, hungry, and disoriented, your group will need to adapt and overcome your situation and environment to thrive.

The GASP Basic (GASP-B) course is a pre-requisite for follow on training, and will provide our team the opportunity to assess group and individual strengths and weaknesses. This is not a firearms training course. Airsoft type firearms will be provided for familiarization purposes only.

Preferably new, or like new. (I own other Saiga rifles, and sometimes they don't work correctly. I would preferred that at least one round have been fired to make sure the rifle cycles properly).

I live in New York, so it cannot be modified or converted at all.

Ideally it should come with the factory 10 round magazine. In New York we are not allowed magazines larger than 10 rounds so I do not need any other magazine, (cannot even accept it).

I am not desperate, am patient, willing to wait for the right deal, will not overpay, and definitely not paying any crazy price. I will go with the lowest offered. If you want to move your rifle, and a willing to let go for a very good buy, then I am potentially your buyer.

Reasonably, and rationally, sending money to a stranger through this site is perilous to say the least. I prefer if at all possible that the transaction occur through an FFL dealer so that I know for sure that I'm sending money in a rifle is actually coming. If an FFL dealer is not available, I prefer that somehow we make arrangements so that I know for sure my monies are not being pilfered.

I have a FFL dealer on my end ready to go.

If you have ammunition, that would be helpful, but not mandatory.

This is a brand new gun. 

The is one of the best tactical rifle values on the market today. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level carbine features a 16"" light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with a Picatinny Rail, and heat-dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications, while the Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter. 30 + 1 capacity.
