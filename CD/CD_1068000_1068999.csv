This is a NIB Windham Weaponry AR-15 SRC model: R16M4FTT. It comes with the factory hard case, one 30rd factory mag, sling, owner's manual, and 2013 catalog. I just received this yesterday and paid the current market price for one of these fine guns, so I'm not ""gouging"" any more than I have been gouged. If you don't know Windham, do some research. They are one of the best AR type rifles you can buy. Certainly much better than DPMS, Del-Ton, Spikes, and Bushmaster. They have a lifetime factory warranty that goes with the rifle, not the owner. In other words you could be the 10th owner and you still have a lifetime warranty from Windham, same as if you bought it new. This one is the flat top optics ready model with no front sight post to get in the way of your optics. After watching his majesty, lord-god Obama's speech the other night, I'm now really worried. Add to that the crap going on in our own State of Colorado and I'm pretty well convinced that you will not be able to buy an AR for much longer.

The price is $1,550 firm. Which is about what it cost me after all shipping, credit card, and FFL fees. A limited number of extra mags are available: Windham factory mags or P-mags for $45 each. I will also sell some ammo with it, if needed. The good stuff, not that Russian steel case crap. Don't shoot that filthy ammo in an AR. It's ok to use in AKs though."

The pistol also comes with a Sig Sauer branded plastic custom fit holster. The one thing it does not have is the laser sight. But I have the box and the book. So your pretty much getting a gun the same way you would from an actual dealer."

I am looking to buy an SKS that accepts the AK mag. I am not looking for a homemade hack job. If you have an M and it is available for sale or trade at an APPROPRIATE price let me know. If you are looking to retire on the price don't bother. The sun has set on over inflated prices and no one is buying them anymore. I want this rifle for convenience of mag swaps from my AK to an SKS-M not because I don't have 3 regular SKS models already.

I am willing to trade a full bubba Norinco SKS OR a full factory Norinco SKS towards your SKS-M with cash and/or accessories. I have several mags and thousands of rounds of ammo I could throw in for the right rifle. Let me know what you have and your price. If you are open to a trade I will make you an items offer based upon what your asking price is. Know what you want BEFORE you email me so we don't have to play any games and send some pics as well so I know what I am considering for purchase. Otherwise it's just words on a screen. I am interested hence this ad creation. 

I want a face to face exchange only. No shipping items. I will drive to you as long as it's worth the time. I will have my VT photo ID to prove age and residence so know beforehand there are no legal complications with this exchange on my end. I will require a bill of sale for my records.

If you email and when I reply you stop responding then please save yourself the hassle and don't bother emailing at all if you're not serious. I am ready to buy NOW so you be ready to actually sell.


Thanks for looking."

It has the original Willy's stamp on the firewall under the hood. This jeep is in excellent condition, mechanically sound, runs and drives GREAT!! Absolutely nothing wrong with this jeep mechanically or cosmetically. I did a mechanical overhaul on this jeep so it has all of the new regular stuff it would need, brakes, brake lines, fuel lines, spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, alternator, solenoid, ect, ect. 4 wheel drive (must lock front wheels to engage 4 wheel drive), 3 speed, low and high gears, transfer case, can NOT get stuck in this thing!! It has the military tires so that the enemy can NOT tell which way you are going if they try to follow your tracks, wheels are left hand threads. The front windshield folds down. Jeep is is equipped with an ammo can as a glove box, cb radio with speaker, military police siren, blackout light. I have many miscellaneous extra parts to go with it. It has a gas can mount on the side and I have extra gas cans to go with it.

 I can not guarantee that this jeep was in the Korean War but it was built at the end of the war, also the military cut it in half for shipping purposes and welded it back together. I also have roll bar, canvas top and doors for it (not shown in pictures). I did this jeep as a U.S. Army military police scenario, it is lots and lots of fun. I am in not hurry at all to sell it and am more interested in someone taking good care of this jeep as I have. If you are trying to make a profit off of me and this jeep than please don't waste my time. I want somebody to appreciate it as much as I have. When I got insurance on this jeep, they told me it was worth $8,000 in it's worst condition and $16,600 in it's best condition. I would guess that it falls somewhere in the middle but I have it insured for $8,000. Like I said, I am in no hurry at all to sell it so if you are interested please make me an offer. I am willing to do a cash sale or a trade and cash sale or just a straight trade if the price is right. E-mail me your offers, you never know you just might have something I can't live without. I live in Oklahoma so the jeep will need to be hauled back on a trailer."

The extra-power lock mechanism uses a premium chrome-silicon spring to avert auto-collapse failure and maintains strength by resisting spring relaxation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes wobble* for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear

Grendel was a hot manufacturer of mostly high capacity weapons in the early 90's. 
When the first assault weapon ban came, Grendel silently faded away.  They were resurrected 4-5 years later as KelTec, same owner, at same Florida location.  Today, KelTec is the third largest manufacturer of handguns in the USA.  If this Grendel resembles a KelTec you've seen that is why.  The slide, frame and firing mechanisms are made of high strength steel, with high-impact strength polymer material for the grip, mag well, trigger, trigger guard and magazines.  

This is a lot of firepower in a very small package.  The .380 cartridge is no slouch and many feel that it's about top of the line for a truly concealable pistol.  This P12 is much smaller and lighter than compact high capacity 9mm's and .40's handguns.  Gun comes all original; in the factory plastic case, manual, parts list and 2 magazines.  Manual is 14 pages, very thorough on; features, operation, disassembly, parts and cleaning. 

Magazines holds 11 rounds, with one in the chamber (P12 = 11+1).  
Design of this pistol allows it to be carried safely with a chambered round.  Fire mechanism is double-action with a low inertia safety hammer system for safe carry, thus not requiring an external safety.

Package includes:
PF9 in like new condition, exactly 200 flawless rounds down the pipe to break her in and locked her up in the padded car safe as a BUG. The gun was originally Tan slide and Black Grip. I bought the green grip and switched it out before the break in so the black one is new.

Stainless steel guide rod plus the original

Hogue Handell Jr. grip sleeve. This is a very light and snappy gun. I read that the sleeve helps stop misfires due to limp grip and never had a single misfire so maybe it works   

Uncle Mikes Ankle Holster. Fits great, looks like new, never used it. Got it with my G26 which was a bit to heavy and bulky for it, so I kept it in my truck with this gun.

Small frame sticky holster from here: http://stickyholsters.com/ for IWB carry. Again, like new, seems like it would work great but never used it.

One box (50 rds) Magtech 9mm FMJ

One 7rd Mag with pinky extender

extra set of pins, original box, trigger lock.

Gun only includes:

The PF9, one magazine, box, stainless steel guide rod and original guide rod. You can decide between black grip or Green grip (I will switch them for you).

Only trade interest would be for a used gen 3 g26 in good condition plus some cash on my part.

                               92 FS. A LEGENDARY FIREARMS

The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. 
                                         INOX version.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may easily ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. The grip frame is flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control. 
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm. This INOX is presented with 2 - 15rd mags. Additional factory mags available as in stocd,

               BERETTA U.S.A. RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY STATISTICS

• The average reliability of all M9 pistols tested at Beretta U.S.A. is 17,500 rounds without a stoppage. 
• During one test of twelve pistols fired at Beretta U.S.A. before Army supervision, Beretta-made M9 pistols shot 168,000 rounds without a single malfunction. 
• The Beretta 9mm pistol was the most reliable of all pistols tested in the 1984 competition which resulted in the award of the M9 contract to Beretta.

• The average durability of M9 frames is over 30,000 rounds. The average durability of M9 locking blocks is 22,000 rounds. 

   This awesome sidearm comes in the original box with the outer sleeve as well. Is presented exactly as it was when purchased new. It has had one clip downrange just to make sure that it is functioning perfectly which it is. It has been cleaned to as new condition after test firing. There is not one single mar or scratch on this side arm anywhere. Looks and operates as brand new. All paper work included in presentation case. Additional factory mags are available for $60 ea as long as they are in my inventory.

US Military endorsed reliability in an extremely handsome package. This is the firearm that you will not hesitate to feel confident in protecting you and your loved ones. 
    The blued model is relatively easy to find.....the INOX is not. I have provided you with an honest presentation of this exemplary firearm....not having overstated it's condition nor value....it will not remain listed long. I am not entertaining trades at this time.
