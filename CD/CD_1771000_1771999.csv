Colt Marine Pistol
More than 100 years ago, the Colt 1911 was chosen as the official sidearm for America’s Armed Forces. Today, a Colt 1911 is once again proudly serving at the side of our country’s military. After a rigorous selection process, the United States Marine Corps selected the Colt Rail Gun as their Close Quarters Battle Pistol. This marks the first time since the end of World War II that a Colt 1911 is being shipped to the United States Government.

To honor the brave men and women of this important staple of America’s military might, the Colt Marine Pistol will be made available in limited quantities through the Colt Custom Shop. What makes the Marine Colt stand out is its Desert Tan Cerakoted Stainless Steel Receiver and Slide, Novak® 3 Dot Night Sights and Flat, Serrated Mainspring Housing with Lanyard Loop. The pistol also features an Enhanced Hammer, Colt Tactical Ambidextrous Safety Lock, and a 5” National Match® Barrel.

The Colt Custom Shop performs hand fitting of critical mating parts and each firearm is test fired by the Custom Shop and supplied with the actual test target.

You are looking at a new 10.5"" LMT Basic Upper. The $450 listed above is for the base upper and LMT hand guards only, no BCG or charging handle, but I got options for you, I will get to that. I bought this from Rainier Arms a while ago for $525, never got around to my SBR/NFA project build. The upper has never been fired, with the exception of the gas system check at the factory. It's really nice and 100% ready for your SBR or pistol build.

LMT upper receiver: Flap top, T Marked, M4 feed ramps. 10.5"" barrel marked MP 5.56 NATO 1/7 CB. Im sure your tracking on that, but if not it is chrome lined.

Again $450 is for the stripped upper with LMT Factory hand guards. Here are some options: I have a BCM Mod 4 charging handle as new, and 3 as new BCG choices I can throw in. I have a Fail Zero complete BCG I could add with it, to say it's nice is an understatement. I have a mid grade BCG, chrome lined, MPI inspected bolt, and a plain jane Mil Spec BCG. I could also throw in the Magpul hand guards, fore grip, and MBUS, as well as the Bushnell TRS red dot on the 0.83 block that makes a full co-witness. We can negotiate any or all of that into cash, trade or both.

TRADES! I would prefer to trade this item. I really want another pistol. I love Glocks, would consider full or partial trade for any model except 22, as I have two of them. I love HK USP's and the FN pistols as well. Let me know what you got. Would also consider the right shotgun as a full or partial trade, 12 gage pump only. Thanks, any questions let me know."

 All metal components are blued steel. Wood pistol grip stock and forearm.

Black plastic butt plate with the Keystone Arms emblem in the middle. Length of pull is 14”. The condition I would put at Good-fair. All parts are there and seems to be in working order, the blueing is worn and the stock has some nicks and scratches, along with the butt plate is cracked and a peice missing. The only information I could find on the gun I will put below. I am asking $150.00 and I am not stuck on that due to the fact I have nothing to compare it to in the market place I may be way high or someone might be getting one heck of a deal. Any and all input would help. The pictures are to represent the gun they are not of the gun its self. What I have is the same exact gun just had problems getting pictures of it. I will send pictures upon request.

According to my research, Keystone Ejector shotguns were made by Crescent Fire Arms Company of Norwich,CT (1892 to 1932) for and were sold by the E.K. Tryon Jr and Company of Philadelphia,PA. The other Keystone guns, just plain Keystone and Keystone Arms Co were made by the W.H. Davenport Arms Co and the W.H. Davenport Arms Co and Hunter arms Company respectively

This ammo is renowned for it's accuracy and consistency. Several years ago it was imported but the small supplies dried up quickly. It is very hard to find any of this for sale anywhere and when it does hit the market, it is expensive and goes fast.

Get on the net and do your research - This stuff is match grade ball ammo (on a level with Lake City match, M118, Lapua or Federal Gold Medal), non-magnetic, brass cased, boxer primed and reloadable. It is non-corrosive and the projectiles are 146 grain, so it is fabulous ""light ball""....a bit lower recoil than your other match stuff.
And other match ammo is going for up to two bucks a pop, so this is a deal!!
(Hey! Other cheaper ball ammo is going for close to a buck a round making this even a better deal!)

The HP stickers have fallen off the outside of the battle packs but I cut one open for the pics and the buyer can cut the other open to be sure of the contents.

Better grab this quickly. The case I sold lasted for only a couple days!

$200 per battlepack cash. (cheaper than any other match ammo I have seen here or elsewhere!)

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

 Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

 The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
 The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

The standard by which all contemporary sidearms are measured, The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured.

These come from the factory with a pistol grip, a 23"" barrell with an aggressive breacher end, an etched American Flag on the receiver, and the extended mag tube which holds 8 in the tube (1 in the chamber for 9 shot capacity). This Mossy has been upgraded with a Promag M4 AR styled 6 position collapsible stock, dual side saddle shell holders (holds 6 extra shells) and a receiver mounted weaver/picatinny rail for mounting your choice of scopes/optics. Includes the original box and papers, the original pistol grip as well as the upgrade stock. This is a very versatile gun because of the 23"" barrel (unlike most tactical shotguns which have 18 or 20"" barrels) it will accommodate the extended magazine tube. Plus it is long enough to shoot a fairly tight pattern for skeet or bird hunting but short enough for being compact (with the pistol grip installed or the M4 stock collapsed to a compact position) for use in tactical situations or home defense. FTF cash transactions only please.

It comes with one Colt mag (which apparently is super hard to find) and 1 IAI mag. It currently has a Houge grip on it, the original (which is in excellent shape) comes with it. As you can see in pictures, I've got the original box and paperwork that came with it, and the receipt from a gunsmith that did a 3.25lb trigger job on it. It is one of the most accurate pistols I have ever shot, and personally I find the odd looks I get for pulling out this monster at the range entertaining.
