It's a 7+1 capacity.  That's 1 more then the ruger/taurus/diamondback/kel-tec/hellcat style pocket pistols.This is a variant to the Walther PPK pistols. James Bond style. It breaks down and functions just like a PPK/Makarov.  Quick and easy to brake down and clean. This ones made in Turkey and imported by Firearms Center of Victoria Texas. Its small and could be used as a concealed carry pistol but large enough to be comfortable in you hand and accurate. The PPK design features a fixed barrel, meaning the barrel stays attached to the frame when the slide is removed. This ads to the accuracy of the gun. Most pocket pistols or even alot of full size pistol barrels flop around when the slide is open. That means when you fire the gun the barrel could tilt upward while the bullet is leaving the gun. This gun is in very nice condition. Blue slide with a brownish color frame. Comes with a nice leather belt holster. Like I say perfect concealed carry gun. Reliable and accurate so you can carry it and not have to worry if its going to work when you need it. It features a safety/decocker that allows you to keep a round in the chamber with out having to worry. I buy sell and trade, so let me know what you have.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Just trying to trim down a little. 

It's surprising this statement is necessary but I guess it is……I had this pistol sold recently but the deal fell through at the last minute because the buyer didn't know the law or I was being set up.  Regardless, my time was wasted.  It’s ok to not know.  I’d just suggest educating yourself one way or another before trying to buy a weapon.  
~ If you transact a private party sell across state lines and are caught & convicted- it is a felony. According to the law- private party transactions should only happen inside the state for which you live.  Secondly, if you get the buyer to come off the price- it's not always smart to suggest they drive an hour to meet you (that part is OP ED). 

Bottom line is, this is a fantastic weapon.  I love the GLOCK 30.  In my opinion, in an urban combat situation where concealment, high capacity & functionality is required- there's not a better pistol available at this price point.  If you've ever owned a GLOCK, you know they function clean or dirty/ wet or dry and with pretty much any kind of ammo.  Also- there's a TON of accessories.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

The gun has probably had 1000 rounds of .40 S&W through it and no more than 300 rounds of 357 SIG.

Here's the rundown:
SigPro 2340 w/ Sig original box and cleaning kit
Sig Rails, not Picatinny

Fobus Paddle Holster

117 rounds of 357 SIG
120 rounds of 40 S&W

I'm asking $800 for all of it. Considering that these mags are $40 each brand new, the conversion barrels are $170 new, the cost and scarcity of 357 SIG ammo right now and the fact that it's an off the books transaction, I think it's a fair price. I'll consider offers as well of course. 

I will only sell to individuals with a current and valid CCW Permit OR I will sell to you if you will allow me to call local law enforcement with your driver's license info so that I can make sure it's legal for me to sell to you.

Made in Germany

12 GAUGE / 3-inch 

Crafted from stainless steel and select walnut, this custom shotgun has exquisite
fit and finish. It's from a limited production run of only ten made.  It has a single-digit
serial number, 20-inch barrels, 3-inch chambers and a gorgeous Grade 2 wood stock set
with engravings. 

It's slim, nimble, and an absolute pleasure to handle. It's visual impact is just what
you'd expect it to be from polished stainless steel. 

German-made quality throughout. Don't confuse this one with what passes as ""Coach  Guns"" 
these days.  This one has the precise fitting and an Old World quality associated with guns of
the past - with some added benefits from the modern age.

The classic Coach Gun is one of the most effective and history-proven personal defense weapons
ever designed. Also, it should be one of the very last types of firearm to ever be included in 
any new anti-gun legislation. This one should last several lifetimes of serious use due to superior
craftsmanship, and the material from which it is made.

This is a very hot round and it isnt cheap. It has a YHM phantom muzzle break and its a flat top m4 style.


The 6.5mm Grendel design goal was to create an effective 200-800 yard AR-15 magazine length loaded cartridge for the AR-15 platform that surpassed the performance of the native 5.56 NATO / 223 Remington cartridge. Constrained by the length of the 5.56 mm NATO round, the Grendel designers decided to use a shorter, larger diameter case for higher powder volume while allowing space for long, streamlined, high ballistic coefficient (BC) bullets. Firing factory loaded ammunition loaded with bullets ranging from 90 to 129 grains (5.8–8.4 g), its muzzle velocity ranges from 2,500 ft/s (760 m/s) with 129- and 130-grain (8.4 g) bullets to 2,900 ft/s (880 m/s) with 90 gr (5.8 g) bullets (similar in velocity to a 5.56 mm 77-grain (5.0 g) round)."

Per the MFG instructions I used a dremel on the CMMG magazine to get it to fit in my mag well, but then my magazine catch on my AR didn't catch so I had to epoxy a cut piece of credit card to get it to catch.

I belive the serial number dates this pistol to 1976.  Only a bit of honest wear on this gun, silvering on the high points and some holster wear.  A used gun but maintained very, very well, perhaps 80% of the blueing remaining if not more.  Set up for target shooting but some swear you can shoot hardball on these sames springs; I don't though and if you shoot hardball the best way to treat the gun is to buy a set of full strength springs-- runs about $25.00."

Manufactured in 1980. This has been sitting in the safe for years with only a few rounds through it.
 The Browning BDA 380 pistol was introduced in 1980 or so as a compact and lightweight pistol for police and civilian use. The gun was manufactured in Italy under contract from FN Herstal (Belgium) and marketed as FN model 140DA (in Europe) or Browning BDA 380 (in USA). Some sources said that BDA 380 is a copy of Beretta 84, but close inspection shows some differences (i.e. Beretta 84 has frame mounted safety while BDA 380 has slide mounted safety). The manufacture of the BDA 380 was ceased circa 1997. It was adopted by Belgian police.

The BDA 380 is a blowback operated, double action semi automatic pistol. It has aluminium alloy frame and steel slide. Ambidextrous slide mounted safety switch disconnects the trigger from the hammer when engaged. The pistol featured low profile fixed sightst and was available in either polished steel or blued finish, with wooden grip panels."

The Noreen 300 WIN MAG weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 300 WIN MAG disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA.

The PT22 is a .22LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine. The PT22 is often viewed as a Taurus copy of the Beretta 21 Bobcat due to having a similar ""tip up"" barrel. In fact this small pistol is very different in design and function from the Beretta. The PT22 is a cast steel frame and slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. The ""tip up"" barrel is useful in that the first round may be chambered directly into the barrel, and the operator does not have to ""pull back"" or ""rack"" the slide."
