This pistol is like-new and unfired, and includes its original hard case as well as cleaning tools and an extra magazine.   Superior Reliability “The 92FS is a double/single-action semi-auto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. Match-Grade Accuracy out of the Box ”Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class. Packed with Useful Tactical Features “This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the 92FS the choice of military and police professionals all over the world, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection.” -Beretta"

Two reasons:  I did a home stippling job and trigger guard undercut which I know is not everyones preference, it doesnt look terrible but in no means was a professional job.....second is that the barrel serial number does not match the rest of the gun since the original barrel was sold and it had an aftermarket threaded barrel.  Eventually I realized the OEM barrel shot just as good, sold the aftermarket barrel and I purchased a new take off GEN 4 19 barrel to put back in the gun.........$440 cash FIRM, no trades, must pickup in Orlando, FL by Universal Studios area and have a Valid DL to complete bill of sale, CWP as well preferred."

This one was made in 1989 so is Pre-Assault Weapons Ban of 1994. There is somewhat of a cult following on these as they are the original West Hurley made guns and not the currect Kahr Arms guns. The Kahr Arms versions have the address as Worchester, Ma. This rifle is in 85% condition. Has some surface rust that should clean up easily into a 90% gun. The stock has some discoloration near the butt. It is normal for the stocks to be different colors. I'm not sure if that is because they used originals or not. Everything is tight and solid. You can get factory mags for these or modify the mag release hole on originals. This one has an original Military issue Seymour Products 30 round mag that has been modified. It snaps in tight and doesn't wobble or wiggle. The bore and barrel are excellent. The pics show this. Mirror bright. I have not shot this (as I am a dealer and don't get to fire every gun that comes through my shop personally). I would assume it functions as it should, as everything is tight and functions as it should. Bolt hold open works, bolt cycles freely. Dry fires fine. I see these going for $1,500-$2,500 on auctions and other sites. I am pricing this one to sell. MUST BE LEGAL TO OWN IN YOUR AREA, MAG TOO, OR I CAN KEEP THE MAG!$1,250.00 plus actual shipping . I NEVER charge more than it costs ME to ship! The first ""I'll take it"" posted here and followed up with an IMMEDIATE email to me at REDACTED gets it.

This is an actual bonafide battlefield pickup. ALL numbers match including the dustcover. This came out of an old collection. This rifle is 100% correct and 100% original! Every screw is still staked in place. The MUM is fully intact. The MONOPOD is there. The original leather SLING (it's a type 38 and you can just see parts of the Japanese writing on it) is there and still very pliable. The DUSTCOVER is there and matches the bolt and front band! The barrels on these rifles are chrome plated so the barrel and bore shine like a mirror! There are a few dings and dents on the stock as would be expected on an original issued rifle. But it is solid and in great shape. The BAYONET is an early hooked quillion model. Made by Kokura/Tokyo Arsenal. It is serial numbered (bayonets were numbered but NOT to the rifle). The scabbard is the correct early ball tipped version. The bayonet is coated in grease. As I'm sure you all know, all matching rifles with dust covers, monopods and slings, ESPECIALLY matching numbers rifles, have become very scarce. The prices have skyrocketed as ""Grandpa's"" rifle that was found in the attic is a thing of the past and these have become extremely collectable! Thus the prices have skyrocketed. I believe this is a $1,200-$1,500 set on Gunbroker or other auction sites. I saw one of these EXACT slings go for $255 on Ebay the other night!$1,100.00 plus actual shipping for the entire grouping (Rifle, Bayonet). I NEVER charge more than it costs ME to ship!
