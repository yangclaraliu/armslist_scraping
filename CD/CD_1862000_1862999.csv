I have a Norinco SKS with a collapsible stock, fore grip, and supposedly a 30 round magazine that I can fit 35 rounds in. The gun shoots 7.62 ammo and is actually very fun shoot. It has more stopping power then .223 but still easy for anyone to shoot. My girlfriend shoots with me all the time and loves it. The SKS has a rail on top if you wanted to put a scope or red dot on it. I know some people like to do it but I never had a problem with the stock sights. 

I'm looking to sell this but I also wouldn't be opposed to a trade for a handgun or different rifle. There is nothing wrong with the gun, but just like everyone else who owns guns does, I like to trade and get different stuff after a while. I have put approximately 200-300rds through the gun, and the guy I purchased from said he put about the same. 

Let me know what you have.

Thanks for looking

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes are available for this handy little carbine. Compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver to maintain proper eye relief.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the shorter mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief. We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes and when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 2x or 3x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, turn the power ring up to the full 6X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test different scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is a great combination of a mini-scope and mounting system for your Ruger 10/22. 

This mini-scope package is also an ideal application for your Ruger 10/22 Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled.

(10 at DeZavala), San Antonio, Texas",$ 250,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 9, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am only down here for another few days visiting our Daughter and then headed back to Minnesota, but I have two (2) battlepacks of Hirtenberger .308 with me (brought it down for a sale that fell through) so I figured I might as well see if anyone in San Antonio might need this fine light match ammo.

Each battlepack is 200 rounds (10 boxes of 20 rounds each) - one battlepack is sealed and I opened the other for the pics. Green lacquered primers are Boxer, non-corrosive and relaodable. The date on the headstamp is 82. This ammo was made in Austria and is really GOOD STUFF!

Do your research - this stuff hasn't been available for years and has match grade 146 grain bullets, very consistent match grade brass and is very accurate and consistent.
With the scarce long range special purpose M118 and the National Match ammo going for $1.50 to $1.75 a round (and up!!), my price of $250.00 cash per battlepack puts this at $1.25 per round....about the same as a lot of the cheap Wolf ball you see for sale, but much MUCH better ammo here. There is a lot of surplus M80 ball, some nice, some dirty, lots of cheap wolf and corrosive stuff out there but the funny thing is that mine is cheaper than any of it and it's probably the best quality for sale!

Again, do your research (Google Hirtenberger) and then look around to see if you can find this anywhere else....if you do it will either be more money or the ad you are looking at is 12 years old and the ammo is long-gone!.

Just $250.00 cash per 200 round battlepack - these both will go fast.

Thanks for looking."

This is not a century built AK, this is a Hungarian imported AK with all matching numbers. Top notch quality.

The fore grip is a Mission first tactical with an internal compartment for batteries, etc. (it can still be put back to original format for the purists out there). And a tapco SAW pistol grip. 
I've fired exactly 120 rounds through it for a function test and cleaned/lubed it afterwards. Surprisingly accurate for a short barreled AK. This would be a great start for someone wanting to SBR it, as the barrel extension/muzzle break is removed after a factory spot weld is taken off.

I have a Norinco SKS with a collapsible stock, fore grip, and supposedly a 30 round magazine that I can fit 35 rounds in. The gun shoots 7.62 ammo and is actually very fun shoot. It has more stopping power then .223 but still easy for anyone to shoot. My girlfriend shoots with me all the time and loves it. The SKS has a rail on top if you wanted to put a scope or red dot on it. I know some people like to do it but I never had a problem with the stock sights. 

I'm looking to sell this but I also wouldn't be opposed to a trade for a handgun or different rifle. There is nothing wrong with the gun, but just like everyone else who owns guns does, I like to trade and get different stuff after a while. I have put approximately 200-300rds through the gun, and the guy I purchased from said he put about the same. 

Let me know what you have.

Thanks for looking

Compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles. The eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of many full size scopes, but because of their short length they have to be mounted further back on the receiver to maintain proper eye relief. 

We have a Picatinny rail top mount for the Ruger 10/22 rifle that mounts further back on the receiver to accommodate mini-scopes in obtaining a full field of view. This four power scope, with it’s Range Finder reticle, can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope kit is an economical and functional accessory for Ruger 10/22 rifles and especially for the Ruger Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled and stored.

I also have PLENTY more pictures, don't hesitate to ask

Hello! Here's what I have:

Triple Serial W. German P228- Date Code: 1990
Original cardboard box with small corner ding (not from me, from previous owner) and test target
3x13 round factory mags
2x15 round mec gar mags
1x18 round mec gar mag
Galco stow n go holster
Nightingale leather OWB holster (I believe it is Raven V)
Hogue rubber grips (not finger groove ones, plain)
Original solid (no lanyard loop grips) grips
New ""P228, M11A1"" grips (with lanyard loop)

I am open to offers, both cash offers and trade. I REALLY want an HK P2000SK, OR USPc 9mm, but I will entertain other offers (no USPc .40/45) Prefer 9mm only.

If I had to rate the gun I would say it is roughly ~90% condition. Holster wear on typical high points on slide. Minor wear on trigger guard and magwell, (very un-noticeable). I will show what I'm talking about in pictures. For being 23 years old, It's in great condition.

The date code on the gun is 1990, and I am the second owner (as far as I know). I have shot less than 500 rounds through it, with only (1) one light primer strike with 147g Fiocci ammo. (I think this was a fluke with the ammo).

Anyways, I love the gun and don't want to get rid of it, however it doesn't fit my hand  ""just perfect"", is too heavy for me for ccw. Ever since my first HK something keeps calling me back...I love sig to death but when it's not right it's not right. It has been my carry gun for 3-4 months.

Again, DO NOT HESITATE to offer, and I am willing to work with you within reason. Thanks for looking!!

Location: Currently in Muncie but I am willing to meet as far North as Ft. Wayne, and as far South as Gander Mountain off 82nd in Indy.

This deal is well below what I paid for these rounds in the store. This is a great assortment of target ammo and protection ammo. It comes in two large metal ammunition cans. 

I will not break this package up and my price is firm. It is more than a fair price. My loss is your gain. 

Thanks for looking. I will meet off of I25 and Santa Fe. 


I also have 9mm and 7.62x39 ammunition available. I will potentially make a deal if you buy more than one package"

Less than a tank of fuel through it. Was always a Stihl guy, decided to give Husqvarna a try. Decided to stick with Stihl. The fuel in the tank currently is still what the dealer put in it when I bought it a few weeks ago. 

This a pro-grade saw with magnesium crankcase. It is 60cc displacement, with 4.3 horsepower. It is set up for 3/8"" pitch, .050 gauge chain. This is not a cheap saw with a plastic crankcase like the Husqvarna 400-series saws (445, 450, 455, 460, etc.) It is also much lighter and more powerful than the equivalent-sized 400 series saw (the 460).

Has an 18"" pro-grade bar with replaceable sprocket nose. You get the chainsaw as pictured, 2 extra chains, manual, and scrench. All three chains are Stihl chains. Also has an outer felling spike installed. Nearly $800 invested. 

Asking $500 obo.

About 1929, J. Stevens Arms Co. changed from using the Riverside Arms Co. to Springfield Arms Co. name for their lower priced line. About 1930, they added a lower priced gun using the G.S. Lewis action called the Springfield No. 311 with a plain uncheckered stock. The G.S. Lewis action used coil-spring driven strickers, and the rear pin in the action sits higher than the forward pin. In 1937, J. Stevens Arms Co. began phasing in a new action with hammers that rotate around an axle. These actions were marked 5000 and 5100.

This is the same rifle as the PSA 16"" M4 Premium Carbine. It was purchased as a separate flat top upper assembly and a separate lower receiver and parts kit. I assembled it myself. The lower receiver is marked ""multi"" and can fire both 5.56 Nato and .223 Rem ammo. It comes with a Rock River Arms chrome bolt carrier group.  This rifle has 200 rounds through it (170 rounds of .223 with 40 rounds being steel cased ammo, and 30 rounds of XM855 5.56x45 62 grain ammo.) without a single malfunction of any sort. It comes with 430 rounds of ammo (390 rounds of Federal XM855 5.56x45mm 62 grain FMJ ball ammo in the ammo can, 1 box of Winchester Ranger 60 grain .223, and 1 box of Herter's 55 grain steel cased .223) along with 6 magazines (3 steel magazines with gray magpul followers, 2 steel magazines with green followers, and one Gen2 PMAG). This rifle comes with an A2 rear sight with dual aperture for both close range and longer range shooting. The rifle will come in a US PeaceKeeper nylon zip case with 4 pouches for magazines and a zip-shut pocket for other necessities while you are at the range.

There was a spot on the ejection port side (right side) where tool marks were left while installing the roll pin while assembling the trigger guard. The spot was touched up with an off brand (not birchwood casey) gun bluing by a buddy of mine....but it is still able to be seen. I've attempted to show the spot in the last picture. It could be touched up with some aluminum black for a better match with the rest of the finish. In no way does this compromise the safety or function of the firearm. Other than that, this rifle is in fantastic shape with very few other handling marks (one on the opposite side of the trigger guard, and one by the bolt catch from my ring). More pictures are available if you are interested.

I have over $1,600 into this package. That said, I don't expect anybody to pay what I paid for it since prices were still inflated. $925 firm cash price. I am not looking to travel a great distance for this sale, but with that said I go to the IL QC's 5 days a week for work. Would also travel as far east as Rockford...possibly DeKalb if you are from a suburb where this firearm is legal to own. I would consider selling to an Iowa or Wisconsin resident if you are willing to cover ffl costs on your end of things and shipping. The only trades I'm looking for are a Ruger 10/22 model 1168 or 1102 in good shape, a ""budget"" 1911 preferably in 9mm but would consider 45 or perhaps even a 22 l.r. (i.e. $500 Rock Island Armory 1911 Tactical 9mm, Remington, Citadel, Girsan, American Classic....no Taurus) with a skeletonized trigger and hammer, Springfield Armory XDS in 9mm, Springfield Armory XDm 3.8 compact in 9mm, or a Glock 19 Gen 3, perhaps a S&W M&P 15-22 with the balance to be covered in cash. Looking for a single firearm plus cash trade or outright sale. All State and Federal laws apply (24 hour wait or 72 hours if a handgun is part of the trade, valid FOID card, record of transfer, ffl transfer for non-residents, etc)."

If you aren't familiar with this gun, that's ok.  I wasn't either until a few weeks ago.  Saw one for sale at Fisherman's and after doing a little research I had to have it.  Only getting rid of it because I've bought too many guns over the last few months and my bank account is starting to not appreciate that.   Check out Youtube  or Google and you will find more info on the gun.

This is a very unique ""AR-ish"" style rifle that breaks down to just over 17 inches by unscrewing the barrel.  The removal takes about 10 seconds.  It is extremely light and very backpack-friendly.  If you're in the market for a Keltec Sub2000 (I have one of those for sale too) this is a great alternative with some distinct advantages.

-Uses any Glock 9mm mags, including 33-rounders, 17, 15, or even little subcompact 10-rounders.  The Keltec can't do that.
-Can be converted to .40 or .45 with kits from TNW
-Pistol Grip and adjustable buttstock are standard AR parts so can be easily changed to what you want.
-Picatinny rail on top for mounting whatever optics you want.  Contrary  to other reviews, mine did not come with the cheap NCStar scope.
-Picatinny bottom rail for foregrip, light, etc
-Reversible ejection port for lefties!
-Ambidextrous single-point sling attachments

Includes:
Gun
One 15-round aftermarket magazine
Box and paperwork

**I have 2 factory Glock 33-round mags available for $50 each**

I'm not looking to profit here, just break even.  I paid $699+$10 background fee for it just a few weeks ago at Fisherman's Marine in Tigard.  Please let me know if you have any specific questions about the gun, I'll be glad to answer.

will sell lot of ammo for $220 or trade for magazines for my 45's listed, or the .40 listed.. or a gun

Here is a list of things I am interested in trading depending on what is out there. 

Maverick bullpup shotgun.  18 inch barrel, only 28"" overall length!  5+1 capacity and the perfect size to deploy in small areas while still maintaining a full size barrel.  It is well used but still in perfect working order.  the bullpup frame will accommodate any mossberg 500 style reciever

Ruger mark 2 bolt action rifle.  This includes one 10  round magazine ( These magazines are widely available and cheap if you want more)  The iron sights are dead on to any distance you can hold an effective sight picture, but a small rimfire scope will be included anyway.

Rossi ""princess"" pocket sized stainless 7 shot 22lr revolver.  Beautiful bore, as accurate as a small pocket sized revolver could ever be.  A nice purse gun , varmint gun, or backup for any situation that requires small calibre
. 
Very nice all stainless taurus pt-100.  This is a very very nice pistol  as far as .40 calibres are concerned.  Many people do not know or understand that these pistols are made on the exact same machinery in the exact same plant in Brazil where baretta manufactured the 92 and 96, but taurus improved the design of the safety, added a rail, and priced it right.  Anybody who calls these a ""nockoff"" is completely uneducated about the history of these guns.  You cannot jam these things, magazines are widely available (even 20 round extended mags), and I love this gun,  Just putting out there to see whats available.  This gun also comes with 9mm threaded barrel which functions perfectly, and frame saver recoil spring system.  The extras alone retailed for $400

Taurus model 845 - This .45 has been well kept, and is modeled after Taurus' OSS tactical model still in use by central american special forces. This version is hammer fired and very accurate. 12+1 capacity makes it a full sized tool of self preservation.

Taurus pt 145 Millennium pro 45 A.C.P.

The Millennium PRO"" features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry. This gun is in good condition with one small finish wear spot.  one mag."

Here are some of the important things: 

* Manufactured in 1982. This means it's got the more desirable 22 inch barrel and 18 rd. tube. Later models had the mag cut to 15 in the late 80's, and the barrel was chopped three inches in 2000-ish to match it.

* ~85% finish left on the barrel and furniture. No rust, but a few small dings in the stock from 30 years of existence and a little big of finish wear on the receiver edges. Definitely not a safe queen, but miles ahead of a truck or hunting gun. 

* Brass mag tube. Early mag tubes were steel, and caused rust issues. 

*  Fixed leaf sights: make anything inside of 50 yards your bitch, but a little bit of holding and tweaking of your POA will be required to nail that squirrel at 350 feet on a moonless night. 

* Strong, clear rifling. This gun has been used, but never been neglected. No rust or gross stuff. 

I'm asking $145 or an interesting trade. I'm pretty open as to what an interesting trade is. I prefer face to face deals and I'll drive a reasonable distance from my home in near-Westside Cleveland to do the deal, and can ship UPS to any C&R holder or FFL dealer you wanna work with. Buyer pays all transfer and shipping fees. I don't charge for boxing or time.

This scope kit is specifically designed to fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

The RANGE FINDER reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is an excellent mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.
