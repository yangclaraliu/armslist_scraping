These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

These are both top of the line American Made guitars.  I am hard pressed to decide which I would want to trade but I guess will trade whichever one that somebody is interested in and keep the other one.  I only want to trade ONE of them. 

The first is a Martin Custom Shop model.  It is an acoustic electric.  Based upon the Martin GPCPA1 but custom built to my specifications in the Martin Custom Shop.  Some of the upgrades include Adirondack Spruce top as opposed to Sitka Spruce, Golden Era forward shifted scalloped bracing, J45 style pickguard.  Beautiful select Rosewood back and sides.   This guitar was ordered in 2011 and the serial number dates it as a 2011 model but it wasn't actually finished and delivered until 2012.  Beautiful acoustic electric cutaway.  Retail on this custom build Martin was well over $5,000.00.  I have the factory build sheet and pricing.

The second is a nearly new 2012 D18.  Martin completely re-designed the D18 for the 2012 model and they are just fantastic guitars and sure to become known as one of the best that Martin has ever made.  Sitka Spruce top, Mahogany back and sides, tortoise colored bindings.  Performance style necks and forward shifted and scalloped golden era bracing.  This guitar had a suggested retail of $2899.00.  Discount music stores sell them for about $2200.00. 

Both guitars come with the factory Martin cases.  I will also include the Oasis humidifier that I keep in each case."

NOVESKE NSR 11 HANDGUARD For Sale or Trade

DETAILS:
--11"" Length, Hard Coat Anodized Aluminum 
--Ultra Light and Robust Design 
--1913 Continuous Top Rail 
--New Innovative Keymod Modular Direct Attachment System 
--Steel Barrel Nut 

Includes: 
--Handguard 
--Barrel Nut 
--Mounting Screws 
--T25 Wrench 
--Instructions 

Not included: 
--1 1/16"" Crowfoot Wrench 
--Medium Strength Thread Locker 

HANDGUARD WEIGHT:6.7oz. 
BARREL NUT WEIGHT:3.1 oz. 

Available in Black only 

Made in USA 

The NSR handguard was designed with the goal of being the lightest and smallest free floating forend option to the M16 family of weapons. The width of the NSR handguard before accessories have been installed is only 1.48"" The NSR handguard is available for sale as standard equipment on our rifles and upper assemblies, as well as a separate component for sale to the public. Available in 7"", 9"", 11"", 13.5"", and 16.7"" lengths. 

The KeyMod inter-locking rail system is a collaboration between Vltor Weapon Systems and Noveske Rifleworks. Separately, both companies were in development of their own systems, but later realizing that both systems were similar, a standardization of the KeyMod system came to be. 

The KeyMod system offers a mounting platform for a variety of (future) accessories and components. The days of the Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) are numbered. The future of the direct mountable accessory is here and now. The KeyMod self-contained components/mounting hardware index and V-block onto the platform, achieving a secured and accurate hold to the system, while separate lugs take the recoil force off the fasteners. The pass through attachment method eliminates the need for loose screws and backing plates that can easily be lost, or difficult to install. Another advantage of the KeyMod system over the 1913 system is the direct attach eliminates the need for the 1913 system as a ""middle Man"" thereby reducing weight and accessory off-set from the center of the handguard.

I seriously doubt I have fired even a full box of ammo through this pistol.  It's been tucked in a little secret place in my headboard for the last several years.  Circumstances force me to sell this fantastic firearm.  Comes with 2 original 9 round mags and both have the Pierce pinky extension on them.

For all the stopping power this little package packs, it is reasonably mild on recoil.  I can't find where the little plastic brush is that came with it that nobody uses anyway, but it comes in the original box in like new condition.  If you want to step up in power with the ultimately reliable Glock but don't want a huge pistol, this .357 Sig Glock 33 is your answer.  Will meet face to face in Evansville.  Strongly prefer buyer to have LTCH but require buyer to have proper ID.  Not interested in trades at this time.  Thanks for looking!!"

This pistol was a very limited edition from TALO in late 2010 through early 2011. The run was never completed and only a few of these pistols were made. This one has factory Metrolight night sights and a Glock grip plug installed. I had the Glock Armorer install a 3.5 lb trigger kit including the connector and all 3 springs over the weekend. Its actually a little less then 3lbs I think. I have a couple of other Glocks done exactly the same way and this one has the lightest trigger. The factory trigger parts are included. This gun also includes 2 hi-cap mags, the box and all factory accessories. 

These EXO Glocks are extremely hard to find especially brand new. The chance of you walking into a gun dealer and them having one are almost impossible. The last few Glock EXO's that sold on Gunbroker went for around $700. And that's without the extras that are on this one. Im asking $775 or best offer. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or offers. Im not interested in any trades at this time and low ballers can go on to the next listing. Thanks for looking & GOD Bless."

My Bushy's have NEVER jammed, stove-piped, or even hiccuped and I'll swear that on a stack!

Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the quality. 

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. This has the 26-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.

KEY FEATURES:

26"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel
Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver
Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells"

Real Bushmasters... not fakes or knock-offs (yes... the Chinese do make them) or the ones made by the new company that bought Bushmaster. Uppers and Lowers match up nice and tight with no slop whatsoever. BCG has great ""staking"" and cocks the hammer with the bolt, not the firing pin like some ARs. BCG has the THICK lower end about 1"" (one inch) almost like a Full-Auto carrier and is nice and heavy. Compared it to the S&W and it had better staking and a little bit more weight to it. These rifles are ready to rock... pick an upper and head out- Or take both???

And for all you haters out there that say, ""mines better than a BushMaster, or lighter, or faster, or whatever.... "" if you're comparing your rifle to a Bushmaster then obviously Bushmaster is the standard that other rifles must measure up to and I've never seen Bushy in a Wal-Mart- S&W, DPMS...= yes, Bushy... =No (Colt is the TOP of the line, not the standard- if it was, no one could afford an AR... just saying)... My Bushy's have NEVER jammed, stove-piped, or even hiccuped and I'll swear that on a stack! Of coarse I only run steel-case ammo because brass through an Assault rifle will get you killed and I have the casings to prove it (from my AK not my Bushy's) (the 40 rounds of Brass was a gift)

****Cash Price is Firm... Don't even ask**** I have over $1000 in Mags, Ammo, Optics, Stocks, ect..**** This is a pretty large package of stuff- I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but it WILL come with the rifles. These are the only AR's and .223s I have so you will get everything I have associated with an AR****"

Product Information

The Ruger BX-25 Magazine was designed from the ground up, in-house at the Ruger factory, for flawless function and reliability in any Ruger 10/22 rifle or carbine. A rugged polymer body and follower make the magazine capable of handling prolonged use and almost any environmental condition. The steel magazine feed lips are engineered to withstand thousands of rounds without significant wear, drastically reducing ammunition feeding-related malfunctions and solving a problem that has plagued increased-capacity 10/22 magazines since their inception. The BX-25 magazine's 25-round capacity and excellent functional reliability are certain to make any trip to the range more enjoyable, with greater time spent shooting and less dedicated to clearing malfunctions and reloading.

Everyone knows this is the best magazine for the Ruger 10/22 don’t settle for aftermarket when you can buy OEM. 

I have a few available at $60.00 each.

Over the years, we have made many subtle improvements to the design, based in part on the many suggestions we receive from our customers. The result is an extremely high quality gun that's Convenient, Reliable, and very Effective. We stand behind it and back it up with our lifetime warranty.

The USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard hitting
.45 ACP cartridge. Extensive use of the same polymers used on HK's line of
military and police arms ensures light weight and durability. And the
highest grade of weapons steel is used in the cold hammer forged target
barrel, and  bolt mechanism. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a
comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. Hard points located on the
top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails
easy.

Product Information

The Ruger BX-25 Magazine was designed from the ground up, in-house at the Ruger factory, for flawless function and reliability in any Ruger 10/22 rifle or carbine. A rugged polymer body and follower make the magazine capable of handling prolonged use and almost any environmental condition. The steel magazine feed lips are engineered to withstand thousands of rounds without significant wear, drastically reducing ammunition feeding-related malfunctions and solving a problem that has plagued increased-capacity 10/22 magazines since their inception. The BX-25 magazine's 25-round capacity and excellent functional reliability are certain to make any trip to the range more enjoyable, with greater time spent shooting and less dedicated to clearing malfunctions and reloading.

Everyone knows this is the best magazine for the Ruger 10/22 don’t settle for aftermarket when you can buy OEM. 

I have a few available at $75.00 each or all 3 for $200
