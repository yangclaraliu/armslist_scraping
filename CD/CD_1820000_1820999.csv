This is the IOM (Individual Officer's Model) a little over 4000 of these were made making it a very rare FiveSeven, perfect for any collector. Production of the IOM was stopped shortly after the FiveSeven hit the civilian market as FN upgraded to the newer USG model, I favor the IOM myself. This is the gun that gun control groups were up in arms about 10 years ago, the one you've heard all about. Claims were made its rounds were ""armor piercing"" by gun control groups. Shortly after this some types of ammunition were no longer imported (including the SS195 ammo that I am including 162 rounds of with the gun) 

I really am not sure how many rounds I have shot through it, I doubt it to be anything over a few hundred as I only shoot 10-20 rounds through it when I even take it out of the safe. It is is excellent condition. Is in original case, with 2x 10 round magazines, factory cleaning kit, all factory documentation, and one spent shell from the factory. Only thing missing from the case is the original lock it came with.

Including 370x SS197 blue tip horniday rounds and 162x SS195LF (lead free version of the SS192)

I have a Savage 110 in 7mm-08 Remington for sale. I hate to sell it but I just bought a new rifle and can't have both. At the beginning of deer season this rifle could easily sell for more than $350. 

It is a real pleasure to shoot and accurate as can be. It would be great for a first rifle but it still can take every species in North America out to 600 yards. The rifle is in very good shape and ready for deer, hog, elk, black bear, zombie bunnies, paper targets or whatever needs shooting. 

Includes 20 rounds of hunting ammo and a 3-9 x 40 scope zeroed 1"" high at 100 yards. Scope mounted firmly on one piece picatinny/weaver rail.

The 7mm-08 Remington is a very accurate round and currently available at most online retailers unlike more ""common"" rounds. It is a .308 cartridge necked down to take a 7mm projectile giving it excellent long range ballistics.

Product Information

The Lee Carbide 3-Die Set is a great set of reloading dies for any reloader looking for a set of dies that will produce accurate ammunition for many years. Lee dies are made to exacting tolerances helping to create accurate ammunition every time they are used. Each Carbide 3-Die Set comes packaged with a carbide sizing die with decapping unit, powder through expanding die (used for expanding and belling the case mouth while charging the case with powder) and bullet seating die. Each die set comes packaged with the appropriate shellholder, powder dipper, load data sheet and plastic storage container. One of the great features of carbide dies is that they do not require the cases to be lubricated prior to use like non-carbide dies.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truly unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

Stock is USGI and matches quite nicely. If you have any questions, give me an e-mail.

caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300
AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm magazines for a full 30 round
capacity, and has a 16 inch barrel.
Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide
extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming
chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to
accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™
flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX
III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories.
The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high
hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also
a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme
corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a
single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened
steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement
in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind
even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium
ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible
life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower
strength S7 more commonly used. 
Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with
Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a
Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by
MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are
not included.
The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides
an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition.

NO CASH AND CARRY!
Since there seems to be great confusion on this, here’s the deal: 
1) You must be at least 18 years of age.
2) We meet at the FFL of my choosing.
3) You bring a valid CA ID, and current vehicle registration.
4) You fill out the ATF FORM 4473 and Dealers Record Of Sale (DROS papers) including right thumb print.
5) You pay for the gun.
6) You leave without the gun, the FFL keeps it in his safe and you come back after 240 hours (10 days) to pick up the gun unless you are denied by the DOJ. 
7) You don’t get your money back if you are denied by the DOJ."

It has some minor finish wear on the top of the chamber, and the mags have some finish wear on the side from use, but are still functionally perfect. It comes with everything from the factory, papers, case, all three grips, two mags (pinky extended and a non pinky extended). For 425, you got the gun and everything it came with. 

Also in the pictures are two holsters. One is an In the Waistband holster by Dan Zlogonje up in Cleveland (beautiful custom holsters by the way. These are top notch). The other is a Blackhawk SERPA holster I have removed some of the bottom from awhile back to flush up with the gun. Fullsize M&Ps stick out a little from it. 

For 450 you get your choice of ONE of the holsters pictured 

For 475 you get both of them, whether you want to be low profile and concealed, or open carrying as is your legal right to do so in the great state of Ohio. 

Email me, I respond quickly as they go right to my iPhone. 


MOST IMPORTANTLY, I will request a bill of sale signed, and WILL require seeing an Ohio ID. Concealed Handgun Licensees will get priority, as that's proof you're for sure on the ""good guy list"". 

I WILL ONLY MEET LOCALLY, I don't want to drive an hour away, I apologize, but the deal is worth the drive, guys."

I've had the gun for a little over a year and have put a few bricks of 22lr through it over that time. I also pocket-carried it occasionally in a desantis pocket holster, although that was pretty rare. I consider myself to be pretty OCD about how I take care of my guns, so it was cleaned very thoroughly after every range session and when I carried it, and was then promptly put back in the safe in my bedroom closet. The gun has always functioned flawlessly and is in excellent condition. I'm also including 200 rounds of Remington Yellowjacket 22lr, 100rds of Remington Viper 22LR, and 50rds of federal spitfire 22lr. The Yellowjacket ammo was what I carried in it the few times I did carry because all my research last year pointed to that being the most powerful 22lr ammo out of a super-short barrel (cci stingers etc carry more energy out of longer barrels but not out of ones less than ~3"" or so based on everything I've read). I'm also including the desantis pocket holster I used the few times I did carry it since I don't have any need for it now. 

I haven't been following gun/ammo prices all that closely these days but I'm hoping to get $440 for all of it. Please feel free to send me an email if you have any questions or would like more pictures. Thanks!"
