Here I have 800 rounds of 40 S&W in 100 round packs, brass 165 grain FMJ Winchester, the gun show I was at last week there were around 15 dealers selling these same packs for 125.00 each and before lunch most were sold out.

In case anyone does not know or has not heard, the government has been buying 40 S&W by the millions as a stockpile for military and law enforcment and that is why it cannot be found too easily,there are many websites that will explain the whole story in detail including the government purchasing several smaller ammo companies and breaking them up,this is not a joke and it is not a story,it is all the truth and you should have no issue whatsoever spending a few hours reading several websites explaining it all. So if you have any idea on getting some 40 ammo then dont waste any time and get it while you can because when its gone its gone.

Shocks me to see all the really high prices on ammo and guns on armslist. I work at the gun show and know you can all do much better there. We do live in a Democracy and supply and demand still holds up a bit. I can tell you Ammo Can (company that sells and makes ammo) doesn't price gouge at all. They have been out of .223 and .22lr for months though. It cracks me up that some take high prices personally. Why? Just move on guys... Come to the gun show this weekend. 

I will only sell at the gun show:
I have four AR-15's.   Priced from $1199 to $1690
I have two AK-47's  $999 each. 
Tons of knives (autos and spring assisted)  $15 each

 SINCE I HAVE HAD NUMEROUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE “PRE-BAN” HERE IS A LITTLE INFORMATION I HOPE HELPS EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND BETTER

 The TEC-9 and, eventually, TEC-DC9 variants were listed among the 19 firearms banned by name in the USA by the now expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB).[1] This ban caused the cessation of their manufacture, and forced Intratec to introduce a newer model called the AB-10, a TEC-9 Mini without a threaded muzzle/barrel shroud and limited to a 10 round magazine instead of a 20 or 32 round magazine. However, it accepted the high capacity magazines of the pre-ban models.
 The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), or Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, was a subtitle of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a federal law in the United States that included a prohibition on the manufacture for civilian use of certain semi-automatic firearms, so called ""assault weapons"".[1] The 10-year ban was passed by Congress on September 13, 1994, and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton the same day. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban's enactment.
 In the former U.S. law, the legal term assault weapon included certain specific semi-automatic firearm models by name (e.g., Colt AR-15, TEC-9, non-select-fire AK-47s produced by three manufacturers, and Uzis) and other semi-automatic firearms because they possess a minimum set of cosmetic features from the following list of features below:
• Pistol Grip (Tec 9 has)
• For end Grip (Tec9 has)
• Flash Suppressor (Tec9 has)
• Grenade Launcher (does not have)
• Magazine that attached outside of the grip (Tec9 has)
• Folding stock (does not have)
• Bayonet Mount (does not have)
 During this ban, your weapon was legal with only 2(TWO) of the accessories. As you can see this PRE-BAN weapon has 4!!!!!

 II. The Tec-9 Is A Semi-Automatic Version Of A Military Submachinegun

The TEC-9 is a semi-automatic version of a military submachinegun. Although it has been marketed under various names -- the KG-9, the KG-99, the TEC-9, and the TEC-DC9 -- and by various companies owned and operated by the Garcia family, the basic design of the weapon has remained virtually unchanged. The company decided to manufacture the KG-9 because of the growing market for military style guns in the United States. The KG-9's manual described it as: 
Combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.The term ""assault pistol"" was coined by the firearms industry to describe the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.


A. The KG-9 Was Banned as a Machine Gun, and Renamed the KG-99

In 1982, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ruled that the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.

The company redesigned the KG-9's bolt to make conversion more difficult, and renamed the weapon the KG-99. Otherwise, the design remained essentially unchanged. Intratec confirmed that like its predecessor, the KG-99 could be fairly described as ""combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.""

Intratec U.S.A. (""Intratec"") manufactured a vertical foregrip for use with the KG-99, which it marketed as an ""Assault Grip."" Intratec used the term ""Assault Grip"" in marketing the foregrip, ""[b]ecause you basically hold the gun with two hands like you would as assault weapon, a military weapon.""

In November 1982, and again in March 1985, the ATF notified Intratec that it was unlawful to possess a KG-99 and an attachable foregrip, even though the pistol and the foregrip were disassembled. Although Intratec understood that they should not be selling the assault grip, he continued to sell it as an accessory for the KG-99, stamping on the order form that ""ATF has ruled that the KG-250 assault grip may not be attached legally to the KG-99 or the old model KG-9.""

B. Intratec Rename the KG-99 the TEC-9, and Continued to Sell the ""Assault Grip.""

Intratec renamed the KG-99 the TEC in August 1985. The TEC-9 was substantially identical to the KG-99, with just a few cosmetic changes. The company resumed marketing the assault grip without any warning, advertising that it ""Attaches to All TEC-9"" Intratec advertised the TEC-9 as a ""High-spirited"" weapon that is ""as tough as your toughest customer."" The company’s brochure emphasized the weapon’s ""paramilitary"" appeal, its ""Military blowback design,"" and its ""Combat-type"" sights. The brochure depicted a smoking target of a human being shot dozens of times through the head and the heart in what appears to be a fusillade of automatic weapons fire. In April 1987, Intratec was sued by the Estate of David Bengston in Connecticut state court. The complaint alleged that the decedent, a school custodian, was fatally shot in the head with a TEC-9M [""Mini""], and that Intratec ""knew or should have known that the TEC-9M gun was and is primarily suited for an/or used in criminal activity,"" and that it ""lacks legitimate use, such as sporting, law enforcement of self-protection."" In November 1987, Carlos Garcia formed Navegar in order to take the assets of the business back from his father and avoid Intratec’s liabilities. Navegar continued to manufacture and market the TEC-9, and continued to do business as Intratec. Intratec U.S.A. declared bankruptcy in 1989, with the Bengston and Alicki lawsuits as its only significant liabilities."

 SINCE I HAVE HAD NUMEROUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE “PRE-BAN” HERE IS A LITTLE INFORMATION I HOPE HELPS EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND BETTER

 The TEC-9 and, eventually, TEC-DC9 variants were listed among the 19 firearms banned by name in the USA by the now expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB).[1] This ban caused the cessation of their manufacture, and forced Intratec to introduce a newer model called the AB-10, a TEC-9 Mini without a threaded muzzle/barrel shroud and limited to a 10 round magazine instead of a 20 or 32 round magazine. However, it accepted the high capacity magazines of the pre-ban models.
 The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), or Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, was a subtitle of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a federal law in the United States that included a prohibition on the manufacture for civilian use of certain semi-automatic firearms, so called ""assault weapons"".[1] The 10-year ban was passed by Congress on September 13, 1994, and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton the same day. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban's enactment.
 In the former U.S. law, the legal term assault weapon included certain specific semi-automatic firearm models by name (e.g., Colt AR-15, TEC-9, non-select-fire AK-47s produced by three manufacturers, and Uzis) and other semi-automatic firearms because they possess a minimum set of cosmetic features from the following list of features below:
• Pistol Grip (Tec 9 has)
• For end Grip (Tec9 has)
• Flash Suppressor (Tec9 has)
• Grenade Launcher (does not have)
• Magazine that attached outside of the grip (Tec9 has)
• Folding stock (does not have)
• Bayonet Mount (does not have)
 During this ban, your weapon was legal with only 2(TWO) of the accessories. As you can see this PRE-BAN weapon has 4!!!!!

 II. The Tec-9 Is A Semi-Automatic Version Of A Military Submachinegun

The TEC-9 is a semi-automatic version of a military submachinegun. Although it has been marketed under various names -- the KG-9, the KG-99, the TEC-9, and the TEC-DC9 -- and by various companies owned and operated by the Garcia family, the basic design of the weapon has remained virtually unchanged. The company decided to manufacture the KG-9 because of the growing market for military style guns in the United States. The KG-9's manual described it as: 
Combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.The term ""assault pistol"" was coined by the firearms industry to describe the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.


A. The KG-9 Was Banned as a Machine Gun, and Renamed the KG-99

In 1982, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ruled that the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.

The company redesigned the KG-9's bolt to make conversion more difficult, and renamed the weapon the KG-99. Otherwise, the design remained essentially unchanged. Intratec confirmed that like its predecessor, the KG-99 could be fairly described as ""combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.""

Intratec U.S.A. (""Intratec"") manufactured a vertical foregrip for use with the KG-99, which it marketed as an ""Assault Grip."" Intratec used the term ""Assault Grip"" in marketing the foregrip, ""[b]ecause you basically hold the gun with two hands like you would as assault weapon, a military weapon.""

In November 1982, and again in March 1985, the ATF notified Intratec that it was unlawful to possess a KG-99 and an attachable foregrip, even though the pistol and the foregrip were disassembled. Although Intratec understood that they should not be selling the assault grip, he continued to sell it as an accessory for the KG-99, stamping on the order form that ""ATF has ruled that the KG-250 assault grip may not be attached legally to the KG-99 or the old model KG-9.""

B. Intratec Rename the KG-99 the TEC-9, and Continued to Sell the ""Assault Grip.""

Intratec renamed the KG-99 the TEC in August 1985. The TEC-9 was substantially identical to the KG-99, with just a few cosmetic changes. The company resumed marketing the assault grip without any warning, advertising that it ""Attaches to All TEC-9"" Intratec advertised the TEC-9 as a ""High-spirited"" weapon that is ""as tough as your toughest customer."" The company’s brochure emphasized the weapon’s ""paramilitary"" appeal, its ""Military blowback design,"" and its ""Combat-type"" sights. The brochure depicted a smoking target of a human being shot dozens of times through the head and the heart in what appears to be a fusillade of automatic weapons fire. In April 1987, Intratec was sued by the Estate of David Bengston in Connecticut state court. The complaint alleged that the decedent, a school custodian, was fatally shot in the head with a TEC-9M [""Mini""], and that Intratec ""knew or should have known that the TEC-9M gun was and is primarily suited for an/or used in criminal activity,"" and that it ""lacks legitimate use, such as sporting, law enforcement of self-protection."" In November 1987, Carlos Garcia formed Navegar in order to take the assets of the business back from his father and avoid Intratec’s liabilities. Navegar continued to manufacture and market the TEC-9, and continued to do business as Intratec. Intratec U.S.A. declared bankruptcy in 1989, with the Bengston and Alicki lawsuits as its only significant liabilities."

This is a very safe firearm with the decocker function that disengages the firing mechanism preventing accidental discharge even when fully charged ready to fire. The handgun is less than 2 months old. Purchased it at a Denver gun store for $1650 ($1780 total with tax) and selling for $1250 or $1550 with all the tactical accessories. The gun includes:
- Three (3) 15-rd polished, nickle plated magazines
- Four interchangeable backplates to fit ANY hand
- Threaded barrel for silencer or suppressor
- Night sights: 3-dot
- All paperwork, lock and tools, and canvas bag

I WILL NOT SELL THE TLR-4 or BURRIS SEPARATELY. If you just want the handgun, no problem. (I will get a refund on the TLR and Burris since I only purchased both of them within the past 2 weeks - I'm just offering it to you at $135+ savings. Like I said, they both are less than 2 weeks old.)

Comments: The Crosman 38T is an excellent replica of the S&W K-38 Combat Masterpiece. The model shown here is the .177 cal third variant (1976-1985) with a plastic rear sight and plastic cylinder. All of the Crosman 38 series of pistols have metal frames with two-piece plastic grips. The United States Air Force used the Crosman 38C and 38T for weapons training in the early 1960's to simulate the standard issue S&W K-38. The 38T can be fired in both single-action and double-action mode. The single-action trigger has a crisp break. This gun is capable of very good accuracy, especially in single-action mode, producing groups around 0.48"". The muzzle velocity (408 fps) is very good for a .177 cal CO2 pistol with a 6.0"" barrel. Loading pellets into the non-removable pellet cylinder is a bit cumbersome. The Crosman 38 series of CO2 pistols represents some of the best airguns Crosman, or anyone else, ever made and they are still prized by collectors.

It has a very heavy target barrel that I believe was a Douglas, but sadly I have misplaced the paperwork. It was built on a rare single-shot 98 Mauser action. This was not a rewelded commercial action, but a purpose built one that has never had a magazine and has three places where it connects to the floor plate through the stock. Standard 98 Mausers have two. It sits in a custom stock, but also comes with a partially finished stock as well. Attached to the front of the stock is a folding and extendable bipod. 

The scope sits on steel rings and is a 5-24x40 Tasco with dust covers. The trigger is an adjustable Mark-X trigger. As this is a single-shot target rifle, it has no safety, but you could install either a bolt shroud or a trigger that incorporates a safety. 

This rifle is HEAVY. It is in the neighborhood of 14lbs. It shoots like a 22lr with zero kick but obviously much further and flatter. 

When I got it I had the headspace checked and adjusted and in the process the holes that were drilled and tapped in the barrel were off-center. Instead of having the gunsmith turn down the barrel (potentially impacting accuracy) I had him install thread-in plugs which are visible. You could have the holes plugged, smoothed and polished into the barrel, thin and re-contour the barrel, or shoot it as is as I have done."

Lifetime Warranty. Battery free fiber optic & tritium. Only used 60 rounds with this sight on .223 rifle.  These are popular for turkey guns because the reticle is 6.5"" at 50yds so it shows up on target close to the size of the shot pattern. I like this better than Eotech because the triangle tip can be used at distances over 200+yds without covering the target. & is large for close range target acquisition.  I find this sight superior to Eotech because its always powered on, doesnt use batteries, less bulky, and the triangle is much better for shooting long distance. all aluminum housing, so its pretty much damage proof. I bought it new less than 6 months ago,  I no longer own the gun it was mounted to, so I have decided to sell it. I paid $600 after tax at dunn's sporting goods. $450 or best offer for sight/mount/& everything in the picture. I can add a set of Troy BUIS flip down backup sights for an additional $150.  the troy sights were mounted to the same rifle, but never sighted in & they co witness perfectly through the glass on the reflex."

Introduced in January 2012, this versatile spherical rifle propellant incorporates in its formula CFE, Copper Fouling Eraser. This ingredient, originally used in military propellant, greatly deters copper fouling. It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate. CFE 223 yields top velocities in many cartridges such as the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington/5.56mm NATO, 22-250 Remington and the 308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO, plus many, many more. Match, Varmint and AR shooters will love this one!

As most enthusiast know, the LE6940 has a monolithic upper receiver. This means the rail/handguard is one piece with the upper receiver.

Only reason I wouldn't put it at 100% is because the previous owner thought it would be an ""awesome"" idea and have the gun dura-coated and didn't let it dry before holstering it. Thus, the gun has a light scratch in the dura-coat on each side, also the genius forgot to take off the sites and coated them too.

I started making gas checks because of the near impossibility to find.  And when I did, the rising price of copper made it unfeasible to buy.  So I found out I could make my own at an affordable, albeit timely, process.  These particular gas checks are made from .014 Amerimax aluminum flashing.  This thickness is desired for .400 or larger shanks.  They provide a tight crimp when sized through my Lee push through sizer and do not require any lube or glue to stay on. You are placing an order for 1000 aluminum gas checks, but I will strive to include a few extra's to ensure any counting errors as well as possibility for less then perfect checks that may slip through my quality control.
