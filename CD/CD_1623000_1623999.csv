    The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.
    The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
    The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
    Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.
    The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
    The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.

Safety

The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters.
When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.
Construction

Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.

Product Information

The Lee Precision Carbide Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Carbide Factory Crimp Die features a carbide ring that sizes the cartridge while it is being crimped so every round will positively chamber freely with factory-like dependability. The adjusting screw quickly and easily sets the desired amount of crimp while a factory-like crimp is added to more firmly hold the bullet in place. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. A firm crimp is essential for dependable and accurate ammunition. Shellholder sold separately.

This AR comes with everything that came in the box along with some extras which include a quad rail, a fore grip, a rubber form fitting pistol grip, an extra pmag, and 2 boxes of ammo. The accessories are made by UTG which is a reputable manufacturer. You get everything you see in the picture. I understand prices are going down and prior to all of this commotion this AR sold for around $1049 +tax. I feel my price is fair in comparison with all of the similar Bushmaster AR's on armslist.com. There are some of the same Bushmaster models posted on armslist in upwards of $1300 without all the extras. This is a great deal considering whomever buys it will get all of the extras as well as save on the actual cost of the AR itself. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. I am not trying to make money off anyone. My receipt reflects I paid $1099+tax for a total of $1197.91 for the AR alone w/o the extras. This is the model that Academy is selling for $1099 + tax.

I am offering for sale a Finnish M39 SA SAKO YEAR 1941 from my private collection. A WWII surplus in an excellent condition. M39 is the Cadillac of Mosin Nagant family of ALL MATCHING NO LINE OUT. Again no cleaning of cosmo or stuck tang screw here. Purchased in October with three others, and cleaned, shot, took out once. 100% original blue, sharp shiny bore, with a little frost on the center, nothing to do with the accuracy but nice overall, matching bolt, butt plate. tang date 1904 and a war time stock in excellent + condition. On the hand guard there is a two and half inch cosmetic split but only on the surface not a damage on the under side. Normally, this happens once side band bolt is not torqued. Nice break on trigger and smooth action.

Should be able to group inch at 100Yards with .311 Bulgarian sliver tip circle 10 surplus ammo or better with custom reloads.


1968 M39 ""Asevarikko"" means ""The arms depot of Finnish Army""). The stamp ASEV 1 means just the depot (not a factory) where the rifles are assembled. Receivers, barrels and breech-bolts may all bear the different serial numbers. Parts of the bolt may also be stamped with variable numbers. They were assembled from the huge pile of spare parts, but - PLEASE NOTE! - they were assembled scrupulously: Too big or too small clearance of a headspace was not allowed. Actually, the allowances of bore, chamber and action dimensions were smaller than those of original rifles M-39 made for use of average riflemen, as these ""Sneak Rifles"" were made for sniping.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Flag |  Edit | Favorite Real Gunners Please... ONE Flag CAN make a Difference! And it takes less than 3 seconds to make a stand and say, ""No More!""

""No More"" $.50- $1.00 a round
""No More"" USED firearms at or above a NEW firearm's price
""No More"" Craigslist Items 

There is an ""Over-Priced"" radio button in the ""FLAG"" section... right over the ""Contact Seller"" option. Guys... lets get together and use the tools provided to us to stop all these rookies trying to sell a USED!! firearm for more than what it can be bought for NEW in a store! Or Ammunition at TRIPLE! the cost.

Use the ""Spam"" option for the Craigslist Items and ArmsList will keep them from posting anything else...

Armslist used to be a great place where good people got together and shared their passions for firearms... now it's a price-gouging, yard-sale (almost the new Craigslist) that makes absolutely no sense...

**EXAMPLE**: a USED Glock for $800???? That's a $300-$350 firearm- no matter what model and condition. There is nothing special about it... it's not a collectible (unless it's an 18 and good luck getting your hands on one of those); they made them by the hundreds of thousands- EVERY YEAR. Not to mention- THEY ARE TRYING TO BAN ASSAULT RIFLES... NOT PISTOLS??? Again... Get real!!

ArmsList has a threshold (certain number of ""flags"") that has to be reached before it will be removed, so please don't just sit there and b*tch about these guys- Do Something About Them and FLAG them OFF of here until they come to their senses and stop trying to take advantage of their fellow Gun Owner, Neighbor, Possibly a Soldier, and American Citizen. 

So like I wrote earlier... ONE Flag CAN make a Difference cause yours might be the one that crosses that threshold.. 

Stay Vigilant.. Hold the Line... and FIRE (flag) when you see a Predator's ad up.

We have the Technology... Use it.

Model: AR-180B

The AR-18 was designed at ArmaLite in California by Arthur Miller, George Sullivan, and Charles Dorchester in 1963 as an improved alternative to the AR-15 design, which had just been selected by the U.S. military as the M16. While the AR-18 was never adopted as the standard service rifle of any nation, its production licence was sold to companies in Japan and England, and it is said to have influenced many later weapons such as the British SA80,[1] the Singaporean SAR-80 and SR-88, the Austrian Steyr AUG, and the Heckler and Koch G36. It gained some notoriety through its use by the Provisional IRA, which allegedly christened it the ""Widowmaker"".

This rifle was also made popular in pop culture in the 1980's as being used by arnold swarchenegger in the first Terminator film, when he assaults the Police station.

This rifle is rare, and has a great design."
