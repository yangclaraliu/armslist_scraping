I purchased it new so I am the original owner and it has been well taken care of (only used it to mow my yard). I have followed the scheduled maintenance since I bought it new. I have only used Cub Cadet filters and FULL Synthetic Quaker State since the first oil change. Everything works very well and the engine still runs strong (it has never used any oil which is rare on a small engine). It has been a good solid mower for me I just decided to step up to a newer mower with a larger 60"" deck. It is a used mower so it has the normal wear and tear. However it is good condition and I have taken care of it. The hydrostats work well but I guess it is a tad slower than it was when new (to be expected). Still a speedy mower for sure. Here is the basic specs for the mower:

Cub Cadet Zero Turn (RZT) Mower 
22 HP Briggs & Stratton V-Twin Intek
50 inch mowing deck
331 hours (it has the digital read hour display)
Blades are 1 year old (Cub Cadet Blades)
Good Tires

You are obviously more than welcome to test drive it first, you can mow my entire yard if you want . Will take cash or trade for firearms. I'm pretty open for now on gun trades as long as they are quality firearms. I may consider a bow but would prefer guns or cash. 
$1000 value cash/trade (Firm). I think this is a very fair price and is much lower than anything I have seen. I have my CCH for any trades etc. Thank you for looking!"

This was when revolvers were made how they should be, and that is why these have held the test of time and usage.

1. Model 10-10. Has the box, paperwork, and original wax paper. Rare 4"" Heavy Barrel. This has hardly been used or fired. Has some wear and pitting from being stored incorrectly. Nothing terrible but it isn't a collector piece at this point. $275

2. S&W .38 Snubnose - This is unmarked as far as model, which should make it a pre model 10. Built like a tank, it has been carried a lot and shows it. It has real vintage stag grips and a wonderful trigger. $200

2. S&W .38 Snubnose - Another unmarked model. Original grips. Typical vintage Smith trigger that breaks beautifully. This looks to have been stored in a holster as it has the small pitting all over the exterior. I had wiped it down well, but it could be cleaned up more if desired. $200

I purchased it new so I am the original owner and it has been well taken care of (only used it to mow my yard). I have followed the scheduled maintenance since I bought it new. I have only used Cub Cadet filters and FULL Synthetic Quaker State since the first oil change. Everything works very well and the engine still runs strong (it has never used any oil which is rare on a small engine). It has been a good solid mower for me I just decided to step up to a newer mower with a larger 60"" deck. It is a used mower so it has the normal wear and tear. However it is good condition and I have taken care of it. The hydrostats work well but I guess it is a tad slower than it was when new (to be expected). Still a speedy mower for sure. Here is the basic specs for the mower:

Cub Cadet Zero Turn (RZT) Mower 
22 HP Briggs & Stratton V-Twin Intek
50 inch mowing deck
331 hours (it has the digital read hour display)
Blades are 1 year old (Cub Cadet Blades)
Good Tires

You are obviously more than welcome to test drive it first, you can mow my entire yard if you want . Will take cash or trade for firearms. I'm pretty open for now on gun trades as long as they are quality firearms. I may consider a bow but would prefer guns or cash. 
$1000 value cash/trade (Firm). I think this is a very fair price and is much lower than anything I have seen. I have my CCH for any trades etc. Thank you for looking!"

Bought new in 2008 and never had a problem with it.
Radar confirmed 52MPH, but only ONCE. ATV tires on pavement aren't very forgiving and I didn't want to prove that. The tires still have a few miles left in them, but if I was keeping it I'd budget for new ones within the next year. Normal wear & tear and the picture is the extent of my abusing it.
DAMAGE: The front left wheel and possibly whatever it connects to is significantly bent/dented. The kid's story is that they hit a ""hidden concrete block"". Makes sense, though I'm surprised that hitting anything hard enough to do that didn't result in any injuries. The tire still holds air and was even ridden like that a few times until I found-out and made them park it until fixed. I guess you can say it's operational but I don't recommend it, as like the tires  Pics are forthcoming and I'm sure I'm leaving out plenty, so feel free to fire away on the questions.

Payed $5200 for it new in 2008, so I think a value of $1500 is fair and somewhat flexible. I'm looking for a nice pistol or revolver, either by itself, multiple, or with cash to even things up. I'm near Charlotte and will be heading to Arizona soon."

HK45 COMPACT TACTICAL
The HK45 Compact Tactical builds on the tough, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator’s pistol. The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK’s American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the new pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit.

The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floorplate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences.

The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 CT is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 CT comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

An HK proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces effecting the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

An “O-ring” barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. And the threaded barrel on the HK45 CT is made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

The HK45 Compact Tactical uses all HK45 magazines, from 10-rounders to the smaller capacity 8-round magazine. A Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for mounting lights and accessories is molded into the polymer frame of the HK45 Compact Tactical.

The HK45 Compact Tactical is currently available with a “decock only” (V3) control lever mode found on its special operations counterpart or with a decock and manual safety (V1) control lever function. The HK45 CT can also be converted to a variety of other kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode.

The HK45 CT is currently being assembled at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Retail price for it originally was $400.00, and they now sell starting at $499.00.  I'm selling it for $340 firm, as it is only 3 months new, and it will be the buyer's responsibility to pick it up.  I have the original receipt and the warranty transfers with the safe to the new owner.  This is an outstanding, entry level gun safe that can unobtrusively fit in a closet or small storage space for concealment purposes, if desired.  I actually have it in a closet myself, which is why the photos I've included here are stock photos.  The safe itself is in pristine condition, as if it has just come out of the box.  All the original paperwork and the combination are included, of course.  Liberty Safe Co. has renamed this model the Revolution RV12, in the event you'd like to check it out on their website, www.libertysafe.com.  I've included a blurb here from the manufacturer to describe the safe for you:

Protect your valuables with Liberty's CENTURION SERIES safes! You'll find features on the Centurion safe that you won't find on other entry level brands.

Each is UL Listed for security and includes 30 minutes of fire protection. With five models to choose from, the Centurion series can fit just about in any space and provide general security and fire protection.

Made in the USA, the CENTURION SERIES comes with Liberty's unique engineering and specifications. We added an extra layer of fireboard in the ceiling and door to achieve 30 minutes of fire protection or 62,000 BTUs. All are UL Listed as Residential Security Containers (RSC) and come with Liberty's Lifetime warranty.

FIRE PROTECTION
30 minutes @ 1200°F.  2 layers in the ceiling, 1 in the walls, 2 in the door jambs and 2 in the door. Palusol heat-expanding seal included on all models, expanding up to 7 times it size in a fire at 212°F. Don't settle for inferior door seals used on cheaper safes.

The Platform
Built upon the same principles as Eugene Stoner's original design, Core 15 uses the basic receivers as the core of its AR-15 style rifles, and then expand upon that design by incorporating the many benefits of today's accessories into the rifles. Core 15 holds each and every receiver to exacting tolerances using state of the art machining processes. By exceeding military standards, Core 15 ensures the best fit possible and can offer a more reliable, smoother functioning, and more accurate weapon that will provide you with the peace of mind that you deserve. Whether a weekend shooter heading to the range for an afternoon of fun, or professional operator preparing for work, Core 15 Rifle Systems will provide you with the weapon to fit your individual needs.

The Additions
We took the Core-15 platform and added a Fostech Bumpstock, a drop in quad rail, an incredibly powerful green laser, and a 5 position fore-grip, to give you a top of the line, fully automatic (and 100% legal) firearm. The Fostech system allows you to select between semi and full auto with the pull of a tab. Check out this video of one of these babies in action here. We want to get these into your hands and have priced them to move. Please see below for a full price breakdown.

Built upon the same principles as Eugene Stoner's original design, Core 15 uses the basic receivers as the core of its AR-15 style rifles, and then expand upon that design by incorporating the many benefits of today's accessories into the rifles. Core 15 holds each and every receiver to exacting tolerances using state of the art machining processes. By exceeding military standards, Core 15 ensures the best fit possible and can offer a more reliable, smoother functioning, and more accurate weapon that will provide you with the peace of mind that you deserve. Whether a weekend shooter heading to the range for an afternoon of fun, or professional operator preparing for work, Core 15 Rifle Systems will provide you with the weapon to fit your individual needs.

The Additions
We took the Core-15 platform and added a Fostech Bumpstock, a drop in quad rail, an incredibly powerful green laser, and a 5 position fore-grip, to give you a top of the line, fully automatic (and 100% legal) firearm. The Fostech system allows you to select between semi and full auto with the pull of a tab. Check out this video of one of these babies in action here. We want to get these into your hands and have priced them to move. Please see below for a full price breakdown.

 Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights

12 gauge Remington 80 Wingmaster 

Package includes a very nice standard (2.75"" shells) Wingmaster receiver, express/tactical stock, Speedfeed tactical for-end, and 3 blued, fixed choke barrels-
30"" full choke bead barrel
28"" modified vent rib barrel
20"" cylinder bore bead barrel

Receiver in excellent condition, and action bars indicate very little use. Barrels have some small spots and scratches, bores are all perfect. Also available to the buyer will be an additional barrel -- a MINTY 20"" fully rifled, rifle sight barrel off an 870 express for $100. 

This set up will handle everything from itty-bitty birdies to clay targets to those awkward social situations when things go ""bump"" in the night. NOT interested in splitting up the package. At all. 

Open to partial trade for Ruger MK2 pistol.  That is only firearms trade need/interest I have. NO interest in non-firearm trades.

With the double or singale action and the de-cocker it is a very good CC weapon and the .380 with the hollow points can be pretty effective.

But why pay $20-30 MORE for their product if you don't even know it will work for you? You can own this one for far less. If, after trying it and finding out how well it works, you want a more expensive one, at least you'll be confident it's for you. BUT, I'm confident this one will work well if you like this style of carry.


This holster can be used ambidextrously and can accomodate an addtional magazine. Additionally, it incorporates an extra pocket where you can keep your ID, passport or cash. If you visit someplace where pickpockets or muggers are prevalent, this garment could be invaluable. Let the bad guy have your decoy wallet while your main documents and currency remain safe.

About 1 year old. Quite possibly the best carry gun made. Super thin and light. Low count, less then 100 rounds through the gun !!

Done a few things to the gun to improve it. A Kel-Tec is meant to be ""finished"" by the owner for the most part. All modifications are easily reversible but I doubt you'd want to.

**This gun shoots MUCH nicer than a stock factory gun.**

- Fluff and Buffed. Gun has been broken down and deburred. Slide rails and feed ramp smoothed. Hammer surface smoothed

- Trigger straightened, softened and shortened. Biggest complaint with this gun is the trigger shape from the factory can ""pinch"" larger fingers. 

The shorter trigger is MUCH more controllable and softer to shoot. A stock replacement trigger is about 2 bucks from Kel-Tec.

- Hogue grip installed and trimmed. Helps suck up the recoil and improve grip on this little beast.

- +1 extended magazine bottom not only adds a round but vastly improves the gun grip.

- Extra +1 magazine. Any defensive gun needs an extra mag. It also has the +1 extension

- Sights and hammer painted orange. For some reason the white sights and my eyes did not play nicely. Orange is MUCH easier to see and get on target with. Orange hammer means it is much easier to stage the trigger (along with the shortened trigger) for fast accurate shots. Both are ""painted"" with orange nail polish. It's the type that doesn't need remover. Just ""peels"" off with a toothpick if you don't dig orange. You will though.

- Shimmed rear site. Gun was accurate but this shooter always trended a touch low with it. You may be different. Shim is just a plastic spacer that you can remove if you shoot differently than I do. I'm no marksman.

- Deburred the grip. Has some ridges on it from the factory that can hurt your hands after awhile. An hour with an emery board really smoothed things out.

Also included:

Kel-Tec plastic case

Instruction booklets

Face To Face Cash Sale and Buyer Need to Sign Bill of Sale.

Willing to do a complete trade, or combo. Clear title in my name, will also entertain gun/cash offers. I would say $2400.00 for the value. I have the chain guard, and battery cover, and a new set of pipes for the bike. I haven't finished putting everything on because i wanted to get it out and ride it a little. I would love to keep it, but i bought a Shovelhead, and have a few other bikes, so this one goes first. If you want to talk about the bike, send me your number, and the best time to call. The bike needs new gas, and the carb cleaned, and a new battery."

Not the best marksman?  The long barrel taurus judge is best bet on a budget.  Notoriously known for being only useful as a snake gun, the Judge has been pushed aside as a  ""movie gun"".  Here's why this revolver is the hidden GEM of home defense:

-Chambered in both 410 ga AND 45 LC, the judge is versatile in non-lethal/less lethal and lethal situations. Any load smaller than 00 buck WILL NOT penetrate walls. You can make loads yourself easily anywhere from riot shells (plastic bbs), dragonfire (metal shavings/dust), to piranha shells (thumbtacks). I've considered staggering shells/rounds to expediate my EOF (escalation of force) 1= dragonfire, 2&3= less lethal shells, 4 &5= 45 LC.
-Long barrels=more energy and greater accuracy with less muzzle rise. 
-Being a SA/DA revolver, will fire as fast as you can squeeze the trigger. 
-IMHO I do not recommend this as a daily carry at all, but for me at least, this fits the bill perfectly for HD.

It is a ""RRA Mid-length A4 LAR-15"" to be exact. It is in awesome condition, only about 100 rounds through it, and cleaned after every range trip. These are very, very hard to find right now due to the gun craze, and most places that sell these are back-ordered for 3-12 months or more!
It has a 16"" barrel with a mid-length gas system, which gives better accuracy and lower recoil than the short-length gas systems. The barrel is chrome-moly and has a 1:9 twist. As you can see I am including a Red (or Green) Dot Sight that has 8 different reticle options. I am also including a flip-up MBUS (back up site) which is co-witnessed with the red-dot (meaning either or both could be used, they both point to my zero at 50 yards), its a really great setup for some closer-range tactical shooting. If you wanted to put a scope on it its pretty easy to do as well (Note: There is no scope included in this package). It has a 6 position adjustable stock. The accuracy is up to 1 MOA (meaning with a shooting rest, high quality ammo, and a good shooter, you can put 5 rounds within a 1"" circle at 100 yards).
I am also including the tactical sling (partially seen to the left of the stock) as well as 5 - 30 round polymer magazines, 4 of which have a handy window to see how much ammo is remaining. I will include these LOADED at 29 each (can fit 30 but its not very good for the mags and can cause problems) for 145 rounds! [NOTE: NOT SELLING ACCESSORIES/AMMO SEPARATE for this package] The ammo is 55 grain brass cased, not aluminum or steel cased garbage you see nowadays in the current craze. I am able to sell some additional ammunition for additional $.

This has everything you need to start tactical target shooting or even survive the zombie apocalypse!

List of everything included: Firearm, tactical sling, 5 LOADED magazines (29 x 5 = 145 rounds in magazines), red/green dot sight (Truglo, will include a back up battery too), back up sight, original RRA case.

I am NOT looking to trade, looking to sell only. Must be able to meet in Eau Claire, face to face, and have CASH. Will not ship. I can have additional pics and/or information on request. CCW a plus, Wisconsin ID a must."

Body has a 266k miles, though it appears as if it has less than 100k, very clean exterior. The engine has been replaced, when my mother had the truck built for her by a close friend, it has one of the original throttle body injected vortec 6cyl engines. To my knowledge the transmission was replaced then as well. My mother drove the car for about 2 years until her mother passed, and she inherited a van. I purchased the truck, and am now moving and cannot take it with me. The Price is negotiable, any trades will come off the agreed upon price, and please dont send pointless low-ball offers. 

I believe this is the engine, though I cant be 100% certain, though the engine is strong and starts immediately like it should:

The Vortec 4300 is essentially a GM 350cui small-block V8 with two cylinders omitted from the design. 90° V6 truck engine, replacing the Chevrolet 250 in light trucks and 200 cu in (3.3 L) and 229 cu in (3.75 L) 90-degree V6s in passenger cars.
