The gear includes a range holster, double mag holster, mag loader, a lock, and bore brush. As I said, this was my primary carry gun so there is a small amount of holster wear, but it is very minimal and only visible at the right angle of a light. I also had the barrel given a mild polish by a local gunsmith so it has more of a black chrome look to it as apposed to the original Melonite finish, this process did make the gun run smoother in my opinion and it also makes it look a little more unique. I'm looking for $500obo. No low ballers, I know what this gun is worth, and I know the availability in the current market.

You are buying on a very nice Bushmaster AR-15!   I have never seen a Bushmaster listed here on here that w Pre-2006 (made in Windham, Maine) - when they were the best damn AR-15 platform on the market, prior to selling out.  Many prefer this over Colt or other higher priced AR's.  This was prior to moving operations to New York - and prior to Walmart beating the quality down.

This is not the newer, cheaper $750 Walmart Bushmaster or the carbon/carbine version that others are trying to sell you for $1500. This is the sought after and more desirable weapon back when they built them tight and heavier in Windham, ME. If you are not familiar, do some research and you will quickly gain an appreciation for this weapon and why they are desirable! (Read ""HISTORY"" below).
It also reads 5.56mm-.223 on the lower, indicating you can shoot 5.56mm rounds out of this gun, unlike some of the newer uppers. 
Other notable details:
-  16"" barrel. 
-  Flat top, optics ready.
-  Larger charging handle.
-  Full float aluminum forearm Tri-rail system.
-  Aluminum tube with 6 position stock.
-  Conformed Grip. 
-  CMI recoil pad.
-  30 round C- Products USGI hi-cap High capacity magazine.
-  Dust Cover.
-  Forward Assist.
-  GG&G aluminum Sling mount.

BUSHMASTER HISTORY: In the beginning, Bushmaster Firearms International made their name as a well known maker of quality AR-15 type rifles owned by Richard Dyke. In 2006 he sold the company to Cerberus Capital Management, which in turn owned Freedom Group, which became Bushmaster's parent company that also owned other firearms manufacturer's including Remington and Marlin. Bushmaster production continued in Windham, Maine until March of 2011 when it was moved to Ilion, New York, to consolidate operations with other Freedom Group manufacturing. The facility in Windham was closed and the employees were laid off. (Source: http://www.grampasgunreviews.com/WindhamWeaponryMPC)

MARKINGS: ""B.F.I.  - Windham, ME, - U.S.A."" = Bushmaster Firearms International.

SERIAL AND DATING: After contracting Bushmaster, it was determined this serial number (L223620) indicates it was made in 2001.  Right in the heart of when these weapons were sought after and desired.
BARREL: 16 inch barrel with good bore and rifling. I *think* it is a 1/7 twist by other models I have viewed, but I could not find the stamp to tell you with certainty.

ACTION: Very smooth and crisp action. This was not test fired, however we did fire it with a snap cap and the trigger feels good and sounds like the hammer hit the snap cap appropriately. 

This is the best information we have on this unique piece. We encourage you to do your own research or ask any questions you have. We will do our best to answer with the information we were given. Please view all pics carefully to appreciate it's condition. 

TRADES:  I may trade for a 1975 Colt SP1, Sig Sauer 516 or 716, Sig 556 Or Norinco AK-47 (Not MAK-90 or NMH-90).  I have cash to even out the right trade.


IMPORTANT DETAILS:
I will only sell to a person legal to own this firearm and willing to show ID and sign a Bill of Sale.  Or we can take it to an FFL to do the transfer.

This gun is 100% new, unfired with correct factory matching serial numbered box. All is just as when shipped from Colt.Firearm purchased it directly from (SA) Specialized Armament. The rifle comes with the factory accessory pack with (2) 20 round magazines and all accessories from Colt in their unopened packages. This rifle also has the sought after Restricted LE Roll Marks. This Colt rifle is for the discriminating Colt collector or shooter. It's the “HB” that makes this rifle so very rare. ""M4 heavy Barrel"" based on the 14.5 inch SOCOM M4A1 barrel (R0921HB). The history on the special run of these Colt rifles: With the assault weapons ban over, Ken Elmore, owner of SA, was able to approach Colt with the idea of authenticating each of these rifles. Colt approved. For Colt to produce a ""Special Production"" weapon they require a minimum order of 300 units. This 6920HB is 1 of only 134 HB's that were ever made available for civilian purchase. There were 300 total HB’s made by Colt exclusively for SA for law enforcement however 134 of them were made available to civilians when the assault weapon ban expired in 2004. The LE 6920 HB is one of the most desirable Colt AR-15 type rifles ever produced. It has a full heavy barrel (no narrowing under the hand guards like the standard 6920) with cut outs for mounting a M203. As mentioned, this weapon is new/unfired and in the factory box with all accessories. There are not many collectors who know these Colt Special Production weapons exist and very few will ever have the opportunity to own a 6920 HB. You can also call Colt's 800 number and get verification from their customer service line that it is a FACTORY PRODUCED LE 6920HB.The Colt factory has ALL 300 Special Production AR-15's cataloged separately, which makes it a very collectible rifle."

It is the DOA sibling of the 3913.  These pistols are considered some of the finest concealed carry pistols ever made.  Very thin and exceptionally reliable, this pistol comes with factory 7-round magazine and an additional 8 round magazine with curved floorplate.  For the left handed shooters out there, the pistol will also come with a custom made Lobo Gun Leather IWB holster.  It does show wear on the stainless slide, frame, and sights.  Barrel looks great. 

In the time I have owned this pistol, it has been shot less than 800 times and I have never had a single malfunction, failure, or irregularity with it.  It regularly feeds empty casings.  It has had a spring-kit service replacement as of <200 round ago.  Grip is currently wrapped in A-grip material, giving it a great grip, even with sweaty hands.  

$450 cash for the entire package.

I will only sell to a Colorado resident who currently has a CCW license.

- color: Flat Dark Earth
- The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.
- Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

I personally haven't seen any .22LR for sale in a retail store in about 3 months. The only reason I have these is they were purchased a while ago.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .22lr ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. These are going FAST. Unfortunately, this is the last brick I have unspoken for at this point, and is likely the last brick I'll have available for a while.

I personally haven't seen any .22LR for sale in a retail store in about 3 months. The only reason I have these is they were purchased a while ago.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .22lr ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. These are going FAST. Unfortunately, this is the last brick I have unspoken for at this point, and is likely the last brick I'll have available for a while.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales.

Just purchased three months ago, never fired, kept in the box and plastic. This is the Colt with the flip up sight in the rear and heavy mil-spec barrel. It also has the upgraded stock. Includes 2 30-round Colt Magazines, cleaning kit, rail covers and manual in unopened accessory kit.

Colt M4 AR 15 new in box, unopened accesory pack, original box and plastic, never fired.
16.1"" M4 ""medium-Heavy contour"" barrel, with a chrome-lined bore and chamber and M4 feed ramp, as developed for military and law enforcement. Note: This is not the lighter barrel Colt uses on the LE6940 and other less expensive LE models. (The difference is most obvious when you look underneath the quad rails, or handguards, of each model. Although outwardly similar in photos, you will notice the less-expensive LE6940 has a thin, ""pencil-barrel"" contour hidden under proprietary rails! Not so with the SOCOM.. This beast is built like a sledgehammer, from one end to the other.)
M4 Match Grade Barrel is rifled with 1:7"" twist. This distinguishes it from most other AR-15 brands on the market, as most are rifled 1:9"" and can't stabilize longer, heavier, barrier-penetrating projectiles like the Colt M4 barrel.
Magnetic Particle Inspected Barrel and Bolt, with ""MP"" certification markings. These parts are Mil-Spec and manufactured to withstand the intense heat and pressure of even suppressed, full-auto fire.
Factory-installed Knight's Armament M4 Carbine RAS picatinny MIL-STD-1913 quad rail system, including the optional, locking rail cover panels. These very solid rails are ideal for quickly mounting any combination of flashlight, laser, front pistol grip, bipod or other accessories.
2 new metal Colt 30-round magazines
Matech BUIS (metal). This high quality, flip-up, adjustable, Back-Up Iron Sight features instant clickable, graduated elevation settings out to 600 meters. Not available on most flip-up sights.
Genuine M-16 type ""full auto"" bolt carrier group. Mil-Spec. This is not the structurally weaker, reduced bolt carrier found in some lesser brands of civilian AR-15 rifles.
Flat-Top, Mil-Spec Upper Receiver (not proprietary upper receiver dimensions, as offered on the LE6940 flat top.) Optics/Night-vision ready. (E.g., Although not included with this NIB Colt, an EOTech XPS3 would be an all-around superb choice for co-witnessing with the iron sights, and night-vision compatible.)
Ambidextrous safe/fire selector switch. Again, not found on most other AR-15 rifles.
Front and rear sling swivels. (G.I. Mil-Spec sling is also included in the accessory pouch.)
Bayonet Lug
H2 Buffer (dual tungstens, single steel) for reduced recoil and lightning fast follow-up shots
Mil-Spec ""A2"" features, including birdcage flash hider, adjustable pinned front sight and rear pistol grip
A Colt exclusive: Lower receiver is roll marked ""M4A1 Carbine"" directly under the Colt logos. A nod to its military heritage. Many AR-15 fans love this very unique lower receiver (and yes, I'm one of them.)
.223/5.56 caliber
Colt rail covers
Caliber-specific roll markings are also distinctly absent from the receiver of this SOCOM edition. (5.56 NATO only appears on the muzzle end of the M4 barrel). (Apparently the absence of the 5.56 NATO marking made it technically legal for export to certain locations that restrict NATO caliber weapons; so a number of these already rare, limited edition Colts are leaving the U.S. market.)
The photos below are of the actual rifle for sale. This is truly a top-of-the-line semi-automatic Colt AR15 carbine. Until just these last few years, there were no new production, genuine Colt AR rifles available to the general public (not since the 80's!) Beginning in 2009, as U.S. miltary M4 orders were expected to decline, a small quantity of genuine Colt M4A1 ARs started trickling into the civilian market. Since then, the demand has steadily increased and this limited edition SOCOM carbine represents the best of the latest Colt production. It weighs 7 lbs and is 32"" long with the buttstock in the collapsed position. It is equipped with a civilian-legal 16.1"" version of the M4 barrel, with its 1:7"" twist (RH 6-groove.) -- ideal for stabilizing a greater variety of 5.56x45mm NATO (and .223 Remington) loads, for superb accuracy. It is unfired, new in box, and includes the factory accessories and manual. The sealed pouch contains two Colt brand 30-round aluminum magazines (green follower), the Colt Safety and Instruction Manual, 4 Knight's Armament polymer quad rail covers (black) with metal locking tabs, Mil-Spec two-point sling (black), one bronze chamber brush, one bronze bore brush, and a segmented cleaning rod.

Although this configuration is descended from the military carbines used by elite forces under Special Operations Command (SOCOM), even sharing many of the same Mil-Spec parts, this Colt is generally civilian legal, at least for now, in the ""free"" states (not CA, NY, and some other states.) Before you bid, it is your responsibility to know your state and local laws regarding new production AR-15 semi-automatic rifles and detachable 30-round magazines. If you have questions, please don't wait until the last day. I will do my best to answer any questions you have about the auction.

Rifle is ready for immediate shipment to the winning bidder's FFL, upon receipt of full payment and a signed copy of the receiving FFL. I will accept discreet Paypal (add 3% to cover their fees). Insured UPS shipping is $55 to any legal location in the lower 48 states. Rifle, magazines and accessories will be packed correctly, and double-boxed before shipment to your FFL."

The original owner purchased this rifle in the early 60s to go hunting in Alaska.  He took it to a Colorado Springs gunsmith to have a muzzle brake installed, but there was some concerns about installing a muzzle brake on the original barrel of this rifle.  The gunsmith was also concerned that the original Winchester stock might not be strong enough to absorb the recoil of the new 338 caliber. 

It was finally decided to install a new 338 Winchester barrel on the original Winchester action, add a muzzle brake and fit it into a new Winchester synthetic stock. This is the current configuration, but the original stock and barrel are included in this sale if the buyer wants to restore the rifle back to original.

Leupold 2-7 Vari-X II scope and rings available for $200 extra – original mount will stay on the rifle with or without the scope.

522,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1332522,"For Sale:  Smith and Wesson M&P 9mm Full Size, package deal with LOTS of add-ons and mags!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","SouthEast, Tallahassee, Florida","$ 1,100","Listed On: Monday, March 25, 2013",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"I purchased this M&P last year In May of 2012. Still have all original paperwork and factory casing. It's sat in my safe the entire time and has a grand total of 3 trips to the range with only about 200 rounds through it. (frame has 200 rounds, barrel only has 98 through it). The trigger is fantastic with a great reset, and with all the modifications it is WAY more accurate than I am. I'm asking $1100, which is less than the total cost that I paid for everything at pre-panic prices.

***I'm not interested in any trades BUT I am looking for a Gen 4 Glock 19 - which I would accept as trade along with cash to make up the difference. (trade must be in similar/like condition as this one)***

I've made the following upgrades:

Barrel:
- Storm Lake threaded barrel w/ thread protector (only has 98 rounds on it). It's wicked accurate and took me forever to finally find one. 1/2x28 thread. I've also got a spare thread protector which is the factory M&P barrel thread protector. that I'll throw it.

Trigger work:
- Apex Tactical DCAEK
- Apex Tactical RAM
- Apex Tactical AEK trigger

The trigger is incredibly smooth, with a solidly clean break, no slop, and no creep and the perfect amount of travel. It is a mountainous improvement over the spongy stock trigger which to be frank, was terrible. The RAM kit provides a really nice tactile reset, which makes for extremely rapid follow-up shots. This trigger setup is phenomenal.

Upgraded extractor:
- Apex Tactical Failure Resistant Extractor. (the stock extractor is an MIM part so I upgraded to something tougher and reliable. It's got a larger surface area and practically eliminates any chances of FTE's.)

Night Sights:
- Truglo TFO's (dots green front, green back - w/ Trijicon tritium for night and fiber optics for low/day light) GREAT sights and VERY bright. These are brand new, purchased as of 1 month ago; so you still have 10 years to go on the tritium.

Magazines:
- 5 factory S&W 17 round magazines w/ 10-8 Performance base plates. I ditched the flimsy plastic base-plates and replaced them with quality 10-8 Performance machined base-plates, they've got cut-outs that make mag transitions very natural and quick, an improvement over the stock base-plates which can make mag rapid mag changes a little goofy because they are so rounded. They've also got dimples drilled into them which makes for an easy place to mark your mags for identification.

I've also had it stippled to enhance the grip; it's a GREAT addition as the stock M&P's are too smooth and feel like holding a bar of soap (to me anyways). The stippling is tastefully done and is aesthetically pleasing. I do not have the small or large backstraps. The backstrap that I use is the medium size and it fits my hand like a glove. You can purchase other backstraps for about $2.50 online anywhere. I do not have the factory box - threw it out since it's junk anyways. I DO have all the original paperwork and factory casing however.

This is a great handgun, and with the trigger work and barrel it's made for a rock-solid performer and it's accuracy exceeds my own pistol-shooting ability. It's an absolute blast to shoot and has functioned FLAWLESSLY on a wide variety of ammo - I avoid steel cased ammo, but I like to know my guns will eat anything (I hate picky guns)...so just to test for function I put a magazine worth of steel-cased ammo through and it went through it without a hitch, every round has otherwise been brass-cased from a variety of manufacturers and has functioned without a single problem.

I take extremely good care of my firearms, and for all intents and purposes this is a like-new pistol. No scratches, dings, wear etc. and the melonite coating looks fantastic. The ONLY reason that I am selling this is to pick up a Glock for concealed carry and to fund another project.


Here's the cost breakdown:

- Firearm (purchased 5/12) $550
- Barrel (purchased from MidwayUSA.com): $190
- Truglo TFO's: $90
- Apex DCAEK $97
- Apex RAM $25
- Apex AEK trigger $75
- 17rd. Magazines $40 x 3 = $120 (came with 2, these are the additional 3 I purchased)
- 10-8 base plates x5 @ 20 each $100
- Various s/h costs $50

Total: ~ $1300

Your price: $1100. (or traded for a Gen 4 Glock G19 + $400 cash)

I STRONGLY prefer to sell to a CHL holder. Be willing to sign a bill of sell and present your CHL. If you do not have a CHL I prefer we make the transaction through an FFL and I'll cover the cost.

Call or text Ryan @ REDACTED. Thanks gents!

The is an Volunteer Open Bolt 45acp in all its glory, all original, open bolt. Shit on those 1500.00 Mac 10's, 9's bullet hose pistols. This is serial numbered 0392. This makes it the right near the starting gate of the round open bolt Volunteer series. Through some studies of serial #'s I figure only a few thousand were made. Too, there were a lot of these guns that over the years have been lost,destroyed,broken, etc. After all, back in the 60's you could have one for less than 200.00 JUDGE FOR YOURSELF, AN EXTREMELY PRETTY GUN. ALSO LIKE THE EAGLE MK I&2, THESE CAN TAKE A FULL AUTO GREASEGUN BOLT WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT EXTRACTORS BREAKING Thank god the government never went after the above mentioned class's of guns. They did grab the Spitfire which was also produced as a semi open bolt gun and reclassified it as a SMG. This was due to the ease of conversion for one. This gun and the Spitfire SMG are identical guns both inside and out I also carry the largest parts collection for repair work I know of. I am one of the best gunsmith's on all the Eagle MK I,II, Volunteer Open Bolt semi's and Spitfire SMG's I know of. Anyway getting back to the gun, it has been shot but by its looks is in remarkable shape. Few handling scratches here and there but a well built shooter for the rest of it's life. Takes .45 M3A1 grease gun mags which are everywhere. Besides the M-16, the Grease gun mag was probably one of the most manufactured US military mags. Is this the gun for You? No? Well take the stock off and shoot it. YES!! YOU CAN LGALLY TAKE THE STOCK OFF AND STILL HAVE A RIFLE WITH AN OAL OF 27 1/4"" THIS GUN IS HISTORIC NOW AND WILL ONLY GAIN IN VALUE, SHOT OR NOT. Has not been made since the 60's which puts it at 50 years old or so. AND remember, Open Bolt Guns can no longer be produced and have not been for decades Thanks for looking I take cash, USPS MO's and Cc's+3.5%. Will only ship where legal so don't waste our time if you cannot own and bid.

Dont buy these inflated POS new in box weapons. Especially one made out of plastic like bushmaster carbon. These weapons go for half the cost at the store and that's too much anyway. Let these guys sit on their capitalist purchases made for greed and not need. The ban on assault weapons will not pass and if it does it will only pass in certain states not across the nation. I have been shooting for decades now and have seen numerous scares like this. They are absolutely ridiculous,  these people plan to make money off of you not help you or make a good deal. The chances that they took the new weapon and gutted it with their old one and are only selling you a new shell  with used guts is very high. Wait and be patient then in a few more months these guys will have 9 shitty ar-15's and nobody to sell them to and all the lies they told their wives and friends about how Intelligent of a financial decision will come to light."

This is a great gun at a great value.  It is in very very good shape.  This will be two guns in one and both barrels work perfectly.  It has not malfunctioned or jammed once since I bought it.  I baby everything I have and this gun is no exception.  I will NOT drop the price below 700.00 cash so please do not ask.  This price is more than fair compared to what most are asking for just a stock gun. I am even willing to meet at a gun range and let you shoot it beforehand if you would like.  See below for description.

I have a great condition Gen4 Glock 27 with the factory .40 barrel and a Lone Wolf (black, match grade, extended, and super accurate) 9mm conversion threaded barrel / thread protector, Trijicon HD sights in orange, (At least 10 years of tritium life left in them) All of the following are Glock brand mags: 3 G27 4th gen mags, 2 Pearce +1 extensions, 1 G23 mag, 1 22 round mag, Glockmeister dust plug, extended slide release, and Ghost 3.5 lb connector. The handle has been stippled. I also have the the matching box, fired rounds, and cleaning rod.  I have a .40 bore snake that I will throw in as well. The only thing it won't have is the back straps.  You can buy them very cheap and yes they will still fit over the stippling.  This gun has less than 500 rounds through the factory barrel and under 100 through the 9mm barrel.  I have a G19 so I am keeping the 9mm mags.  That will be all you will need to shoot the conversion barrel.  I will also throw in a Serpa holster.  One last thing, the innards of the receiver have been polished by a gunsmith.  The result is a very crisp, clean breaking trigger.

Just a heads up, there is one very small blemish on the back of the handle where the soldering iron accidentally touched the frame while being stippled.  I don't even notice it and it doesn't affect the functionality in any way, shape, or form.  You will be able to see it in the pictures of the sights below.  I am only selling this gun because I have too many and the .40 ammo is just too expensive to keep it.

See below for trades.  I am open to a lot of different items.  I have my used equipment valued at 700.00 cash for a sale.  I have over 1000.00 invested in this gun.  I hate to see it go but it's time to move on to something new. MUST SHOW GA DL AND HAVE CCW.  If you are not a CCW holder and want to buy this gun I am ok with going to a FFL holder and having them run a background check at your expense.  I am a CCW holder.  If you are looking for a trade my value will be in the 750.00-800.00 range.

I can text more pics upon request. 678 822 eight zero five zero. 

EQUIPMENT IS IN GOOD SHAPE. No junk please. I am open to anything trade-wise as long as it is in the same shape as mine.  Make me an offer I can't refuse and we will both leave happy."

The class lasts about 7 hours total, includes a written and range test, basic handgun safety, handgun cleaning, handgun knowledge, handgun marksmanship, and qualifies you to apply for a CCDW license in KY. Students should bring a modern functioning handgun with 50 rounds of factory new ammunition and appropriate cleaning supplies for the firearm. Don’t have a handgun, ammo, or supplies? No worries! Get in touch with me and we can work out the details. There is also a $60 fee divided between the state and local police that is normally paid 2-3 weeks after the completion of the course. A criminal background check will be done by the Kentucky State Police after the completion of the course. Due to high volume, it is currently taking up to 5 months after the class for the actual license to be issued by the Kentucky State Police. Feel free to contact me, and thanks for your consideration!"
