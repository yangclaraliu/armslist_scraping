It has the TARGET Action which is a VERY beefy single shot action. This gun is a Right Bolt Left Port Model. Oversized, tactical Bolt Knob as well. 

The TARGET action is equipped with the TARGET Accu-trigger. This trigger behaves like the standard accu-trigger but instead of adjusting for 1.5 lbs up to 6 pounds, it is adustable from 1.5 lbs DOWN to 6 ounces. It is super clean and light. No overtravel and zero creep but 100% safe due to the accu-trigger design. 

The action is an HS Precision Stock whcih fully floats the barrel and has an aluminum bedding block for the action. 

This is on of  Savage's Target Series Rifles, whcich is their top of the line and are known for the tack driving accuracy. 

The gun only has very minor cosmetic blemishes, email and I'll try to get them to show in pics.

The Price shown is for the gun only. 

 For an additional $675 (and free shipping on the package!) I will include the mounted Sightron SIII 6-24 x 50mm MilDot Reticle Scope that has been mounted on it since I got it. It is sighted in ready to. It is mounted with Leupold Rings and Bases and includes bikini style cover and sunshade. 

Thank You, and I travel periodically everywhere in South Texas (Austin, SA, Corpus, Laredo, Del Rio, Uvalde, Rio Valley, etc.) so a face to face deal in that area is very possible. 

Buyer pays actual shipping to your FFL if needed (Est. $30), shipping not included in price.

Thanks for Looking. I can take and email additional pictures but the gun is in great shape.

The slug in this round, just like any other foster slug, will cause an amazing wound cavity and catastrophic damage through as many layers iof denim and bone as any person would ever posses; the buckshot following the slug not only ensures everything around the target area is also severely damaged, but it also offers better coverage just in case of inaccuracy or duress while aiming. This was one of the first rounds besides buckshot to disappear when the scare started, and for the most part is has been very hard to find.

  The price for these rounds are $20 per box of 10, which is at cost for me, and is at pre scare prices for the majority of the places it was sold.  I do not want to take a loss on them and do not REALLY need to sell them since I still have my 12 gauge, But I do have a lot of them.  However, if someone wants to buy all 11 boxes that I have, I will cut it down to 16 a box saving you 44 dollars.

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, this pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

It is a late 1943 Remington 03A3. The barrel is a 4-44 Remington barrel. The rifle has green parkerizing with blued parts, all that have marks are marked with a small ""R"". The boremis great with little wear and no pitting and great rifling. The stock is stamped with an RRA (Red River Arsenal) and FJA and RA (Remington Arms) with cross cannons and wheel. Underneath is a Circle P and a Square P stamp indicating an arsenal visit. The stock is flawless (literally) EXCEPT a hairline crack in the top handguard (very thin, see picture). The crack is only 4 inches long and in the middle of the handguard, not at either end. Original cleaning kit tube with oiler and jag is in the buttstock as well. When I took the handguard off and there was sticky rifle grease underneath in the handguard and on the barrel. This is a near mint rifle. I have a original new handguard that matches as well that is perfect.

After 25 years of being accessorized, customized and re-imagined in countless movies, television shows and video games, the Desert Eagle® Pistol has emerged as a pop-culture icon. You can customize your Desert Eagle Pistol with a variety of impressive finishes to add your own distinctive twist to this timeless firearm. All models feature a full Picatinny rail on the barrel from the end of the chamber to right behind the front sight and standard ambidextrous safeties.

General Features

The Picatinny rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics. The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.

Safety

The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged. Construction

Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.

With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range.

The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package.The 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready.

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols.

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members
The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards.

Developed through direct feedback from Special Forces teams stationed around the world, the new Taurus 24/7 OSS is one of the most advanced firearms in the history of pistol making. Built to meet and/or exceed all requirements laid down by USSOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) for its new sidearm, this extreme duty pistol offers unprecedented reliability, durability, accuracy and ergonomic functionality. Capable of firing thousands of failure-free rounds in virtually any environment, whether it be jungle humidity and mud, desert heat and sand, or arctic cold and ice, we packed the 24/7 OSS with features that real-world professionals were asking for. Bad guys beware-here comes the 24/7 OSS.

The Taurus 24/7 OSS features Taurus' revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger system that fires normally from a smooth single action mode, yet, if a primer fails to ignite, it provides a life-saving second try at firing a faulty cartridge a feature no other pistol on the market offers. Also the ambidextrous decock lever provide ergonomic functionality for right or left hand. The aggressive checkered grip that allows a glue-like purchase on the gun, even with sweaty or bloody hands. Add the combat-necessary ambidextrous decock/safety levers that allow for 'cocked and locked' and/or Double Action carry, SA/DA indicator on the rear of the slide shows whether the pistol is in 'cocked' or 'decocked' mode, a reversible magazine release and the 24/7 OSS""'s versatility becomes immediately apparent.

From Zastava Arms website:
The Zastava EZ 40 is a modern weapon used as a service gun or a personal defense gun. Due to excellent design solutions, ergonomics, state-of-the art technology in production, this weapon stands out with its precision, accuracy and functionality. The design is a semi-automatic weapon, functioning on the short recoil of the barrel principle. Locking is achieved by vertical oscillation of the barrel, that comes into the hole on the slide. The pistol can function as a single action or double action gun, is fed from a double-stack detachable magazine and has ambidextrous controls - it can be operated with right or left hand. The design of the EZ 40 is such that the same controls have several functions. Loaded chamber indicator shows whether there is a cartridge in the chamber. Sights are square, with white dots and they facilitate aiming at low visibility conditions. 
The slide is made of high quality alloy steel. The frame is made of aluminium alloy. Handgrip covers are made of high impact polymer. Standard finish is phosphatizing and painting of aluminium parts, while the steel parts are blued. On the slide it has a connection for mounting of optical-electronic devices."

Less than 10 rounds fired through it.  This is the ""Slimline"" model of the Glock Sub-Compact.  Single stack mag for slimmer handle and more concealable design.  Check the specs out at the Glock website.  Comes with 2 clips, lock, bore brush, cleaning rod, manuals, case, etc. (all the stuff that comes factory with them). I'll throw in a box of 50 rounds.  I am a private seller so the asking price is all there is to it unless I have to ship.  We can discuss that if it comes up.  The slide release has some of the paint rubbed off. I would suggest getting an extended slide release anyway for less than $20.  That's the main reason I hardly fired the gun.  Mostly, my hands are too big for the slim design. The factory copper lube is still on the inside of the slide.  Make an offer if you want.  I'm pretty firm at $600 with the ammo but it never hurts to try.  The only trade I'd be interested in is a Sig P938."

Developed and completely handcrafted out of one solid piece of steel by the Master Edgar Budischowsky himself, the designer and manufacturer of the legendary Korriphila HSP-701.

The PP-10 was developed in 1990 as the succeeding model of the Korriphila. Only 20 pistols were ever made, 18 pieces in 10 mm Auto and only 2 in 9mm para. All are from the initial batch (zero series).
This model has the serial number 002. It is chambered in 9mm para. Similar to the HSP-701 the PP-10 works with the delay roller lock (Budischowsky-System), which reduces the recoil to a minimum.

The PP-10 comes in the original wooden presentation box with two magazines and a certificate of origin from Edgar Budischowsky. The pistol was only test-fired by Mr. Budischowsky

Description: Up for auction is a factory new in box KELTEC Sub2000 9mm. The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools."

I know because I bought 5 boxes on Saturday and another 5 boxes on Sunday, by Monday morning they were out of stock. Fortunately Cabela's limited purchases to 5 boxes per person per day. The first order arrived today and what do I see on Armslist...... $15 and $16 a box and I bet more will pop up soon. Folks, these were $6.99 per 20 count box. With shipping and tax each box came to little under $8.50. I bought these for my dad due to him not being able to find any at local stores. He doesn't do the ""internet thing"". Now he doesn't want them because they are steel case. Could I sell them here and make a big profit? You bet I could. Instead I'm just going to put the hollow points away and offer the remaining six boxes of 55 gr. fmj at my cost of $8.50. I have 3 boxes in hand and the other 3 should be here tomorrow or Thursday. If buying outright I'm limiting it to 1 box per person to discourage marking them up and relisting.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

This is a New Colt 6940 test fired from Valkyrie for function only. Included is a new in box Trijicon SRS01 SRS Sealed Reflex Sight w/LED & Colt Knob Mount. In a continually shifting world of firearms gadgetry, today's discriminating second amendment protector is finally offered an AR-15 style rifle that utilizes time proven technology of the Eugene Stoner/Colt belt-fed configuration. The Belt-fed, Semi-Automatic rifle (BSR – Mod 1) borrows from the original Stoner/Colt belt-fed design and utilizes modern technology to precisely machine the removable belt box and feed tray mechanism that converts a standard AR-15 style rifle into a belt-fed, semi-automatic support weapons platform. Coupled with the proven design concepts from the original Colt system, Valkyrie Armament LLC can now provide all riflemen and women with a weapons platform that can utilize a virtually unlimited ammunition supply. Maintaining 85% parts compatibility, modifications to the upper receiver and lower receiver in the form of cut outs and a bolt carrier drive system are the only design changes. The upper and lower is modified for the belt feed tray, which can be removed by opening the rifle by the rear take down pin and pushing the mag release, it simply pulls out of the mag well from the top, close the rifle and now you can use standard magazines.this is the offer you will ever get so please contact me if you are a serious buyer."
