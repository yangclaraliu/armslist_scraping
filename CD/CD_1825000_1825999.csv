I have an M91/30 Mosin Nagant with ATI Monte Carlo style stock. This rifle has not been modified drilled or tapped for a scope mount. I was intending on buying the type that mounts over the rear sight mount with a long eye relief scope. Hex type receiver with all matching serials, including the original stock. Bayonet does not match, comes with sling and soft padded rifle case.

Barrel was stripped and re-blued at home and turned out nicer than what it looked when purchased. Stock is okay with very little dings and could easily be stripped then re-done for a beautiful original rifle. Or you could keep the Monte Carlo stock, throw a scope mount on and go hunting!"

As legacies go, a man could do worse than being survived by the knife he designed. Such is the case with the late Colonel Rex Applegate who was one of this nations top authorities on close-quarters combat. The Applegate-Fairbairn Mini Covert stands with the Covert & Combat as lasting symbols of the Colonels dedication, expertise, and sense of purpose. 

It should come as no surprise that these knives are known internationally as best-of-class among folding tactical knives. They've rightfully earned a reputation for unmatched strength, durability and balance. More than that, tactical professionals have high regard for the high-carbon stainless steel blade. The glass-filled nylon handles. The Covert and Combat have the patented roto-lock system.

Selling a Serbu .50 BMG rifle, with a Super Sniper scope, and Serbu Bi-pod.

Only fired 30 rounds or so through it. this rifle is practically new. have more pics that I can send upon request.

$2,500 This is already going at a loss at this price. Offering 1,500 shipped or 1,400 is just plain retardation. Before asking me if I will take anything below my asking price, do some research, see if you can find this same rifle going for this low. after seeing what these rifles are worth, feel free to make a counter offer, but I will tell you right now if it is $1,000 less than what I am asking, you might want to spend your money on some meds or put it towards an extended stay in the looney bin

Only about 200-250 rounds down the barrel.  No complaints. Need the cash

4 magazines are directly from the Ruger factory (the one that came with the firearm and the 3 in the plastic bags and have the shipping label to prove it).  The two other magazines in the plastic boxes were ordered online and are also Ruger BX25 magazines.  The ones in the plastic bags have never even been out of the bags.  These magazines are still selling for $50+ each at gun shows.  Fantastic value!

I will also throw in some impossible to find 22LR ammo.  TWO boxes of Federal 36gr #325 bulk ammo (650 rounds total).  Saw these boxes selling for $45 each at a gun show last weekend.

The scope is a Nikon Prostaff 4x32 specifically made for the 22LR rimfire platform.  It has incredibly crisp crosshairs and best of all has a factory, LIFETIME transferable warranty.  Check out the reviews online, you will not find a better optic for your 10/22.  Comes with scope rings and has the scope sighted in ready for you to shoot.  

Have the original box for the gun and for the scope.  You may have all the original paperwork, locks, and everything that came with it from the factory.  Total I have about $700 + tax put in to this package. I'm the original owner of all of this.

You won't be disappointed.  
Will not separate the magazines until the gun is sold (unless you don't want the ammo, take off $30).  

Prefer TEXTS.  Call if you need to.

Training wise, he has been tracking dead birds, just starting to point and hold (he does get a little excited and bust them, but he is a pup), he is starting to understand whoa (it will come soon), and he has been shot over.  He comes anytime you call him, and knows sit.  I have not done anything in regards to heel, but he stays pretty close.  In regards to his range he is like most llews stays in the 40 yards range, i don't think he has ever even got out beyond 50 yards, so he will be a close worker.  He has been introduced to water, and loves retrieving tennis balls.  He is about 45 lbs now his sire was 55 dam about 45.

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12"" in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly, is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group, a Magpul MIAD pistol grip, and the new Magpul ACS stock. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The SPR comes with LWRCI's new Skirmish Sights. These sights can be raised using gross motor skills and without pressing any button. The sights lock in the up position and are lowered by pressing a button on their left sides. The sights are extremely low profile and stand less than ½"" tall when folded. All of the sharp edges have been smoothly radiused, nearly eliminating the possibility of snagging the folded sights or cutting the shooters hands when being deployed. The sights are constructed of 7075 aluminum, which is Type 3 hard coat anodized, and 4140 steel, that is treated with our Ni-corr surface conversion technology. 7075 aluminum is much harder and stronger than the 6000 series aluminum used in our competitor's sights. The bearings and detents are all industrial hard chromed. The sights are nearly impervious to corrosion. As an added benefit, all of the surfaces on the rear of the sights post and its protective wings are grooved at either 20 or 40 lines per inch to eliminate glare."

This is a 1963 Romanian AK-47 chambered in 7.62x39 built on a Century Arms receiver. It has a chrome lined US barrel. The rifle was recently stripped down to bare metal, parkerized, and painted for an authentic and durable military finish. The furniture was also lightly refinished to maintain some of the character. It has had about 200 rounds through it and functioned flawlessly every single time. It is fully 922r compliant.

With a High Wall Single Shot Sporting Rifle from Uberti, you can relive a time when rifle shooting was more than a pastime; it was a serious business. John Browning designed High Wall single shot rifles for Winchester at the end of the buffalo hunting era. These accurate Winchester rifles made a name for themselves in the golden age of target shooting. The loading lever on the 1885 High Wall opens or locks the rifle's falling-block action. The front sight of the High Wall Sporting Rifle model is dovetailed into the octagonal barrel and can be drifted for windage. Uberti 1885 High Wall single shot rifles include a break-down cleaning rod that fits in a compartment in the butt stock. Case-hardened frame and lever. Blued buttplate."

I Have a Great Condition Kel Tec PF9 9mm up for Sale. About 1 year old. Quite possibly the best carry gun made. Super thin and light. Low count, less then 100 rounds through the gun !!

 Done a few things to the gun to improve it. A Kel-Tec is meant to be ""finished"" by the owner for the most part. All modifications are easily reversible but I doubt you'd want to.

 **This gun shoots MUCH nicer than a stock factory gun.**

 - Fluff and Buffed. Gun has been broken down and deburred. Slide rails and feed ramp smoothed. Hammer surface smoothed

 - Trigger straightened, softened and shortened. Biggest complaint with this gun is the trigger shape from the factory can ""pinch"" larger fingers. 

 The shorter trigger is MUCH more controllable and softer to shoot. A stock replacement trigger is about 2 bucks from Kel-Tec.

 - Hogue grip installed and trimmed. Helps suck up the recoil and improve grip on this little beast.

 - +1 extended magazine bottom not only adds a round but vastly improves the gun grip.

 - Extra +1 magazine. Any defensive gun needs an extra mag. It also has the +1 extension

 - Sights and hammer painted orange. For some reason the white sights and my eyes did not play nicely. Orange is MUCH easier to see and get on target with. Orange hammer means it is much easier to stage the trigger (along with the shortened trigger) for fast accurate shots. Both are ""painted"" with orange nail polish. It's the type that doesn't need remover. Just ""peels"" off with a toothpick if you don't dig orange. You will though.

 - Shimmed rear site. Gun was accurate but this shooter always trended a touch low with it. You may be different. Shim is just a plastic spacer that you can remove if you shoot differently than I do. I'm no marksman.

 - Deburred the grip. Has some ridges on it from the factory that can hurt your hands after awhile. An hour with an emery board really smoothed things out.

 Also included:

 Kel-Tec plastic case

 Instruction booklets

 Face To Face Cash Sale and Buyer Needs to Sign a Bill of Sale. 
 With Valid State of Oklahoma DL or State ID required to prove of age.

 Need to be 18 Years Old to buy and own a firearm !!

I would sell without the CT Laserguard and holster that goes with the guard, as I can sell these seperate. Not wanting to sell the magazines or other stuff 1 by 1 though. Thanks.

$600 for Glock and original accessories, 33rd genuine Glock mag, 2-15rd genuine Glock mags, 2-mag sleeves, Glock +2 and +2 insert, Pierce +2, Pierce pinky extension, Glock single pistol range bag.

$725 w/CT LG-436 and Foxx holster for gen 3 and 4 G26 with CT"

I had these built last year and work has prevented me from taking the time to go and fire any of my new toys. The only round that has traveled through the barrel is the factory test round (which is in an envelope in the box). Both the Glock 21 (.45ACP) and Glock 22 (.40SW) are completely Cerakoted! This is the best weapon coating on the market. Heat and chip resistance are much higher than other finishes, and they look AWESOME as well. The uppers are coated in C-192 Black, and the lowers are coated in H-168 Zombie Green. The Zombie Green looks more like Monster Energy Green to me. It is not as dark and dull as most Zombie green weapons I have seen. Both handguns have the Pachmayr Tactical Grip Gloves and Protec Lasers installed. Personally I don't like the lasers, but they will come with the handguns. Sale comes with original cases, all paperwork, manuals, cleaning brush, slide locks, grip back-straps, and 2 clips (with loaders) for each handgun. $1600.00 OBO. CASH ONLY! NOT INTERESTED IN TRADES, SORRY.
