This rifle also includes the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.     MATERIALS & CONSTRUCTION  LOWER RECEIVER: Mil-Spec with Enhanced Flared Magazine Well and Rear Receiver QD Swivel Attachment Point.

CNC Warrior hasnt made these for several years now. https://www.cncwarrior.com/CNC-Warrior-M85-Carbine-p/26237.htmThese were hand picked and slightly modded from CNC warrior. They are a 5.56 AK that accepts AR style magazines. The only changes made to this rifle was the added TWS dogleg GEN 2 top cover and Midwest Industries rail system on the front. The fake suppressor is pinned to the rifle and cannot be removed unless you drill out the pin holding it in. This is a perfect rifle to turn into a SBR. The side of the receiver has some slight wear from a sling rubbing on it and a few scratches on the side. It performs like a AK should. One thing to note with these is that THEY ARE LOUD FIRE BREATHING DRAGONS! It will also dent casings from ejection so it is recommended to use steel cased rounds and not brass cased rounds if you reload. Rear back up site and red dot are included with the rifle. I will only sell locally and will need to see a Iowa carry permit or buyers permit before sale.

It is equipped with a sidefolding stock similar to the VEPR-12 shotguns from the factory, with a swappable cheekrest to aid in using optics if desired. This is the FM-AK47-21, a model released in the Spring of 2017. Molot imports were banned under US sanctions on Russia in June of 2017. Not very many of these rifles were imported as a result. It fires 7.62x39mm and, like all VEPRs, built upon the more durable RPK receivers (RPKs are the Russian LMG and feature 1.5x thicker receivers, reinforced bulged front trunnions, and heavier barrels). It has a 16.5"" barrel with the standard left-hand threading for AKs.Right now, Atlantic and K-Var both list this model on their websites for 1600 USD new. Atlantic is out of stock. As there will be no further imports, it is unlikely you will find a new rifle anywhere else for a better price (and if you do, you should consider purchasing it).This rifle is in very good condition. I purchased it only a week or so before the sanctions were put in place, so I have maintained it in as good a condition I can while testing the rifle. I estimate ~500 rounds have been fired in this rifle. I have swapped the handguards with a cheesegrater and metal VEPR rail, but retained the stock guards so that one can return it to stock configuration with little hassle. I have also put on a muzzle device. All these items can be found on AKOU's store if you wish further details. They are:Vepr FM M-Lok Rail (99.99)AKM/AK-74/Vepr-12 Length Cheese Grater Upper Handguard (39.99)BD2-AK47 Muzzle Brake (54.99)Included is the factory 5 round magazine, as well as 3 surplus Yugo magazines with bolt-hold-open followers and a Polish RADOM surplus magazine that matches the finish quite nicely. I have also kept the cleaning kit and the box the rifle came in. I am selling the rifle as I found I do not love AKs. They are fun rifles, but from a practical standpoint it is difficult to argue with a well-built AR. I'll perhaps have another some day, but a scarce and high quality AK like this VEPR deserves a home with someone who will truly appreciate it. Additional images are available upon request. I am willing to ship the rifle, but buyer must pay for shipping costs and only money orders will be accepted. In-person transactions will only be conducted with Nebraska residents with up-to-date ID and Purchasing or Concealed Carry Permits."

Why is Nightforce's most advanced riflescope called the BEAST? It's not about size, weight, or appearance. The Nightforce BEAST is called that because nothing like it has ever created before now. To solve problems with older models Nightforce used new technologies to create the BEAST. The goal was to include features that would have been pipe dreams to others. Nightforce's BEAST is the end product of that goal.
Nightforce is pleased to offer the BEAST to hunters worldwide. Creating the BEAST was a challenging, demanding, and overwhelming task. The only fitting name for this product is BEAST since it seems like a monster. BEAST stands for ""Best Example of Advanced Scope Technology."" Because that's what it is.
