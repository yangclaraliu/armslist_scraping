HK45 COMPACT TACTICAL
The HK45 Compact Tactical builds on the tough, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator’s pistol. The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK’s American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the new pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit.

The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floorplate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences.

The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 CT is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 CT comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

An HK proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces effecting the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

An “O-ring” barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. And the threaded barrel on the HK45 CT is made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

The HK45 Compact Tactical uses all HK45 magazines, from 10-rounders to the smaller capacity 8-round magazine. A Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for mounting lights and accessories is molded into the polymer frame of the HK45 Compact Tactical.

The HK45 Compact Tactical is currently available with a “decock only” (V3) control lever mode found on its special operations counterpart or with a decock and manual safety (V1) control lever function. The HK45 CT can also be converted to a variety of other kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode.

The HK45 CT is currently being assembled at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

I have gift cards from Home Depot and Lowes that will more than cover the (reasonable)purchase price of any of these firearms.  Problem is, you can't trade your guns for what you need there (grills, lawnmowers, flooring, etc.) and they don't sell firearms.  Please email me what you have and your asking price. Pictures are great, but not required.  I do ask that the firearms be in good, working condition.  Email me and we will go from there.  Thanks!  You can do it, they can help.  Never stop improving."

I am unsure of the round count but from the condition of the rifle, it looks to be no more than 500 rounds.

This Mini 14 was produced in 1981 based on the serial number, chambered in .223, has a stainless barrel and wood stock. I would say the condition of this gun is about 90-95%.

It comes with 4 mags, 1 mag doesn't work very well. I may include bipod if I get asking price but was aiming to keep it for my AR.

I'm not too familiar with the pricing of MINI 14's in the current market but will set price at $900/obo as I am seeing them on armslist and gunbroker for more."

I have decided to get out of the 1911 business and really have no need for this pistol any longer.

This pistol has had 200-300 rounds through it. It looks nearly new. It comes with all accessories just as if new: a SA plastic (tupperware) storage box, two 7 round SS magazines, manual, holster, mag holster, cleaning rod/brush, etc. 

The Springfield Armory TRP is a top of the line 45 with such features as a hand-fitted match barrel and bushing, ambidextrous & extended thumb safeties, fixed low profile combat rear/dovetail front- three dot tritium night sights, aluminum match grade trigger (4.5-5 lbs), checkered front strap, front and rear cocking serrations, full-length two piece SS guide rod, beaver-tail grip safety, wide mouth magazine well, the list goes on and on. 

I have owned, handled and competed with many different 1911's in my day. There is quite simply, no finer 1911 made today at this price point, than the Springfield Armory TRP. It is perfect right out of the box!

This will be hard to find on searches because they made so few of them in the mid 80's. It was the shotgun used in between the Wingmaster and the 870 which makes it pretty unique in that its essentially an 870 body with the Wingmasters internals. The gun has some scratches on the stock and very slight blueing wear between the pump arm and the receiver and I can send photos upon request.   This would make anyone an incredible skeet or bird gun, its just not what I am looking for right now.

Mainly looking to a good hunting rifle of just about any caliber. Not looking for anything specific but this shotgun is something I just don't need anymore. Will consider trades for handguns or other shotguns if it catches my eye.

Do not ask me how much cash I'll take because its not for sale.  and trades do not mean trading for cash, thats call selling so don't waste my time or yours.  And yes this gun is for trade in PA under my listings since I am traveling back there soon so its not some crazy scam I'm just testing the waters in both places.

Product Details:

In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

Bought it brand new, paid extra for the stainless and the scope, put maybe a dozen rounds through it, cleaned it and put it away.  It has been sitting in the case for a couple of years.  It is a beautiful gun, but I just don't have time to go shooting any more.  

i apologize for the crappy low-res cell phone pics.  That is the actual rifle for sale in the photos.  Comes with rifle, case, and sling.

He seemed nice enough and in the course of the small talk I failed to inspect this pistol as thoroughly as I would normally. I felt he was knowedgable enough to be believed on function and seemed sane at the time. I purchased the pistol and left.
 The pistol is fantastic. What was not was the .45 caliber bullet lodged halfway down the barrel. Not sure if he was an idiot or a homicidal lunatic. If I had not purchased that gun, some one else may have taken it straight to the range and loaded up a magazine and proceeded to blow the gun and themselves up. 
 We have all popped a squib load that lodged halfway...but to leave one in and SELL THE GUN is criminally negligent at best, psychotic at worst. 
 But it gets better.
 When I got the bullet out...it was never fired. Brand new bullet hadn't seen powder, case or primer. He just took a Speer jacketed hollow point and jammed it up the bore.

 I believe he fully intended to blow this gun up. And the new owner with it. 
Interpret as you will. But please tell your gun friends...
Check your gun purchases carefully before firing.
Keep emails and phone numbers of sellers to assist authorities of these 'booby trapped' guns.
Always get ID and bill of sale. 
I got the emails and license plate number for OSP and BATF so they will hopefully check on this potential psycho anti-gun terrorist.
