It sells for $359-389 at all reputable stores (Cabelas/Sportsmans/Scheels) and local shops and that's exactly what I paid for it. Plus the background fee.

Your responsibility to understand your legal rights to possess firearms. I paid $399 for this pistol plus $25 for the background at Cabelas. Yes that’s a little high. Plus the Tax. I'll sell it for $325 total which is a hit for me but I'm looking to get something different. It's in perfect condition. I’ve come down on the price and am firm on $325. You won't be disappointed.

870,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8039870,For Sale:  Ambush 300 Blackout,"West Chester, Cincinnati, Ohio","$ 1,100","Listed On: Thursday, March 1, 2018",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Only been fired a couple times. The occasional cleaning and tinkering with is all this amazing riffle only has done.Comes in a metal locking case, bolt lock, fully loaded magazine, box of ammo, and sights. Asking $1100 OBO Don't let the color fool you..retail value is $1795 brand new without extras.The Ambush 300 Blackout is a gas-impingement semi-auto in the standard M4 configuration, including its controls. The safety, magazine release and bolt catch are all located in the standard locations. It’s listed as multi-caliber as it fires both .300 AAC Blackout and .300 Whisper ammunition, and since everything but the barrel is the same as Daniel Defense’s 5.56 rifles, the barrel can be swapped for additional calibers. It features a 16-inch cold-hammer forged barrel with a salt-bath nitride finish with 1:8-inch twist rifling.It features a two-piece Picatinny rail along the top of the receiver with indexing marks for attaching optics in the same position every time, along with three, 2.5-inch Picatinny rail sections on the front of the modular float rail for mounting lights, lasers, bipods and other accessories. The rifle is available in Mossy Oak Break Up Infinity, Mossy Oak Blaze Pink, Realtree AP and standard black, and comes with a Magpul MOE buttstock, and what Ambush calls a “shotgun inspired modular hand grip.”The hand grip is a very nice touch, and even though it is made of plastic, it provides a little bit of the wood feel of a Remington 870 to the 300 Blackout, making it more comfortable to shoot, both from support and freehand positions. As I have never really liked how an AR’s forearm felt in my support hand when firing, but never considered it a major issue for an otherwise great platform, I kind of wish all ARs had this hand grip.Other features on the 300 Blackout include some inspired by the needs of Special Forces rather than hunters, such as a threaded barrel for attaching a suppressor, with a protector on the end, and a charging handle that is more easily accessible when using optics. The Mossy Oak finish on the test model was smooth and well applied, though the deflector quickly showed signs of the finish chipping once shooting began. The 300 Blackout breaks down just like any AR-15 rifle, and comes with a single five-round PMAG magazine, which makes sense as many states limit magazine capacity for hunting. However, the included PMAG had a very tight fit, causing problems with both insertion and removal. Luckily, standard 5.56x45 mm AR magazines also work, such as the TangoDown and standard metal magazines also used during testing.As for accuracy, the Ambush 300 Blackout was excellent with multiple consecutive five-shot groups measuring under an inch with three different loads. A large part of this was due to the excellent two-stage trigger that started with just a little bit of un-resisted take-up before breaking at just over 4 pounds.Manufacturer: Ambush Firearms; Ambushfirearms.comModel: 300 BlackoutCaliber: .300 AAC BlackoutFinish: Mossy Oak Break Up Infinity (Also available in Realtree AP, Mossy Oak Blaze Pink and black)Action: gas impingement semi-autoReceiver: 7075 Mil-Spec aluminumRifling: 1:8” RH twistBarrel: 16” Cold hammer forgedMagazine: five-round PMAGSights: none, Picatinny rail for opticsTrigger: two-stage Geissele Super Semi-automatic; 4.39 lbs.Stock: Magpul MOE ButtstockWeight: 6.9 lbs.Accessories: manual, hard plastic caseSuggested Retail Price: $1,759"

With factory ammo it shot 100 groups of .6 to .7.  I didn't get into testing a bunch of ammo or reloading for it because... Shortly after I came into some extra money and upgraded to a Savage 10FCP.  Since then the Predator has sat in the safe and it needs some attention.  It weighs 6.6 pounds so it would be a great hunting rifle but certainly is not slouch for long range target work.  I shot it once at 600 yards and was able to ring a 10"" gong 8/10 and the misses were probably my fault.  Overall I've put about 80 rounds through it.  This gun has a MSRP of $529 but I see them locally for $479.  Online the best price seems to be $439 but you'll have to pay a transfer fee of at least $20. I'd give it a good new home for $400.  FTF in or arround Harrisburg, selling to a concealed carry permit holder is prefered.  (The photo is stock.  Mine looks just the same.  I put a flash hider on it because I though it looked cool.  Also comes with the thread protector)"
