You don't see the 45 carbines in stores much like you do the 9mm.

This is also about $40 less than you can buy new for when you add tax, shipping/ffl fees. Even if you buy from Gunbroker or Buds you're going to be paying more for it so you're preachin to choir on gun values.

It's a Hi-Point yes, but watch Nutnfancy's reviews on youtube, read reviews online. This is a reliable 45acp carbine that does hold it's value and has a lifetime warranty. That's more than you can say for the JRC's. 

Bought this for my wife as a home defense gun with low recoil and a lot of knockdown power, but now she's getting to where she can handle a pistol pretty well. 

Also don't ask if it's still for sale, that's annoying."

 Lastly, I have a Yugo SKS also on a black synthetic folding stock with the grenade launcher, flip up sights and fold out bayonet. Good gun, functions as it should, a lot of fun to shoot. $425

 All three guns come as pictured. I am looking for cash only at the moment as I am funding another gun build. All three are clean and ready to shoot. May be willing to deal on price if you buy more than one, or I can throw in some ammo. Must be Ohio resident, allowed to own a gun, 21 for the tec9 and 18 for either of the long guns. CCW preferred as I have mine and I will ask for proof of residency. Sorry I am just trying to keep everything legal. Willing to meet within a reasonable distance, I am located right off 275 on the east side of Cincinnati. Call or text Kyle REDACTED"

 We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
 The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
 The permit is valid for 5 years
 We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
 Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.

 The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

Great carry gun 10 round & 17 round magazines

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

I am not desperate to trade this off, but would like to have a nice firearm instead of the sound system. Please feel free to message me with whatever you have, if i'm not interested, I will not ignore your message or leave you a hateful remark. Here is a link to the product description with a video as well as the Retail Price tag. I am willing to take a loss, and trade for firearms worth $750- $1000. I am a reasonable guy. Link below.

Included are all items from factory: factory hard black case, 2 mags (1 w/ and 1 w/o pinky extension), 1 interchangeable back strap, lock key, all factory paper work, and necessary field strip tools

Additional items to factory are 5"" barrel kit including barrel, sleeve, extension to match slide, and 3 front sight inserts to adjust for desired elevation.

Overall this gun is 95% as factory new.  I have fired some rounds through both barrels.  No malfunctions whatsoever even with lower powered sub sonic ammo.

 I bought this bike as my winter project and finished it last month. I have done 2 test rides to break in the new parts and it's ready for a new owner. I intended on doing a street legal dual sport, this classic bike hauls ass and will eat up the trails. I have invested over $1,950 in the build (have all receipts to prove) and am looking for a fair sale price, o.b.o. I am getting rid of it because I want an xr650 desert racer. I would rate this bike at a strong 90% condition with little effort to make it a perfect 100%. 
 Any questions please feel free to email me at REDACTED

These ak's retail for 2499.00 and are rare due to the limited number of new belgian parts to make them so they are only released in small batches as parts become available. this rifle doesnt come with mags due to the stupid new mag law. Im only asking 1650$ for it which is a steal for these models. i would consider parial trades for handguns and prefer 4th gen glocks in models 22,23,17,21. and would consider other well made semi auto handguns. i would also consider partial trades for lesser quality ak's such as romanian wasr's plush cash as the main reason i have to part with my sas is because of financial issues. price is firm i have 2,300$ into it so lowball offers will be ignored."

If you're not familiar with Windham, look them up. The folks that run Windham used to be Bushmaster. When the Bushmaster name was sold the old employees started Windham. The quality is on-par, if not better than Bushmaster and Windham has a LIFETIME warranty.
""We are so sure of the quality of our rifles that we back them up with the strongest Warranty in the industry - one that guarantees against all manufacturer's defects in material and workmanship for the Lifetime of the Firearm to the Purchaser. Additionally, this warranty is Transferable from the original Purchaser to subsequent buyers.""

I'm looking to trade for military pistols, any quality pistol, pump shotgun and some cash depending on the model? I'd be very interested in a Mosin and a Nagant revolver.  Or a Taurus ultralight revolver.
