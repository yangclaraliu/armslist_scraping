BUSHMASTER FIREARMS INTER ACR (Adaptive Combat Rifle) With ability to rapidly change calibers, barrel lengths and stock configurations, the Bushmaster ACR adapts to varied conditions like no rifle that has come before it. In minutes, without tools, it will go from 5.56mm to 6.8mm to 6.5mm by swapping the bolt head, barrel and magazine. With an exchange of stocks, barrels and accessories, it transforms from a close quarters weapon to a designated marksman platform. Simply put, the Bushmaster ACR is the highest evolution of modular rifle utility. This rifle is built specifically for law enforcement and tactical applications - with Bushmaster's unrivaled standards for durability and precision. They've nearly doubled barrel life and reduced maintenance with the addition of an innovative protective coating. This is also featured on action components for dramatically reduced wear and enhanced operation. For the ultimate blend of strength and reduced weight, they used rugged, high density composite for the hand guard, lower receiver and stock. The heart of the ACR is their gas piston operating system. It's torture tested and proven reliable in the most brutal conditions on the planet. From the magazine release and fire selector to the non reciprocating charging handle, ambidextrous controls optimize user effectiveness. Add Bushmaster's hallmark commitment to quality down to the slightest ingredient, and you have a platform that's a natural fit for any operator and every mission.

118,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1758118,For Sale:  RJ II,"Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada",$ 32,"Listed On: Thursday, June 13, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The smaller brother of the tactical RJ I $32.33

RJ Martin’s blade design and grind gives you the piercing power of a tanto with just enough curve to the belly for slicing aptitude as well. The tanto point is even stronger than comparable tantos because Kershaw makes the tip thicker and gives it a tough flat grind. The result is an über-strong tip that takes on the toughest piercing tasks with no fear. But the RJ II isn’t done yet.

This knife offers a full range of cutting edges. The plain edge is ever so slightly curved, giving the RJ II slicing capability—something not all tanto blades offer. In addition, the blade is partially serrated to make cutting through tough or fibrous materials a breeze. The blade is made of 8Cr13MoV stainless steel that’s tough, wear resistant, and takes a keen edge. For a distinctive look and enhanced performance, the blade is coated with titanium carbo-nitride.

The RJ II also features 3-D machined G-10 handle scales and a secure stainless-steel locking liner. It opens with one-handed ease thanks to the SpeedSafe assisted opening system. Access it with the built-in flipper or thumbstud. The pocketclip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry. Tactical looks and a multifunctional blade combine in the RJ II—also available in a larger size as the RJ I.

 Technical Specifications
•2-Step Serration
Serrations assist in cutting through particularly tough or fibrous material, such as rope or cord. The Kershaw 2-step serration is a more aggressive style of serration.

•Flipper
May be used on either manual or assisted opening knives. The “flipper” is a protrusion on the back of the blade that the user can pull back on, or flip, in order to move the blade easily out of the handle.

•SpeedSafe®
Assists you to open any SpeedSafe® knife quickly and easily with a manual push on the thumbstud or pull back on the flipper; built into many Kershaw best sellers.

•Liner Lock
Locks the blade open during use; one side of the knife’s steel “liner,” the steel plate to which the handle scales are attached, moves into position behind the blade to securely lock it open.

•Reversible
Pre-drilled holes in the handle enable the user to change either the tip position or the side on which the knife carries.

I have uploaded my build sheet with prices. Really just looking to recoup some of the money in it. I also didn't account for the extra mags or the flash hider since I had extras. 

The core of the rifle is a Spikes Tactical Upper and Lower receiver. It has Spikes LPK w/ Spikes Battle Trigger. The buffer tube assembly is also Spikes Milspec tube with ST-T2 buffer and stainless spring. The barrel is a mid length Daniel Defense Hammer Forged 16"" barrel. It has a nickel boron bolt carrier group with MPI bolt. The charging handle is a Spikes Tactical as well. It has Magpul furniture which includes the CTR mil spec stock, Handguard, and MBUS rear sight. It has a Ergo Grip pistol grip and Spikes billet trigger guard. I'm sure I missed something but the build sheet pretty much covers it all. 

Includes 2 new PMAGS w/ dust covers

Must have a FL DL and be willing to sign a Bill of Sale.

Price is $1,250 cash

This gun was manufactured in 1974.  Colt released the Combat Commander series pistol on an all steel frame, and while the first run coincided with the Series 70 Government model (5"" barrel), the Commanders of that time never received the Series 70 roll mark, hence the term ""pre 70's series"".  Commander sized 1911 pistols feature a full height frame, so they accept the same magazines and grip panels as a Government model.  However, the Commander size pistol has a 4"" barrel, making it better for concealed carry.

This gun is in great shape with the original bluing intact.  There is some holster wear.  Additional pictures are available upon request via text message.  This gun has been smoothed out and tuned by a trained gunsmith specializing in 1911 pistols.  The ejection port has been lowered and flared, and a Colt Gold Cup style trigger has been fitted and installed.  A full length guide rod has been installed as well.  Finally, a flat, checkered mainspring housing has been installed, though it is not shown in these pictures.  

The buyer will receive two magazines along with the original guide rod, recoil spring, spring plug, and mainspring housing.  I can reinstall any of these parts for the buyer prior to delivery.

I am asking $1000 for this gun.  The pre 70's series guns are highly sought after by collectors.

Sauer developed the model 38H from their earlier semi-automatic handguns. It was necessary to compete with companies such as Mauser and Walther in the commercial market. However, with the outbreak of the war, most pistols went to various German police agencies. These pistols were stamped by those agencies and some can still be found with the holster and additional magazine with which they were distributed. Sauer 38H pistols presented to Nazi officials often featured custom engraving, ivory grips, and often gold inlay as well. For example, in September 2004, the Rock Island Auction Company sold a Sauer 38H, serial number 363573, that belonged to Sepp Dietrich for $43,125.00.
The Sauer 38H was produced in three basic models. Generally, the slide of the first model says ""JP Sauer und Sohn"" on the left. The second version says only ""CAL 7.65"", and the third version omits the safety and the cocking/decocking lever. Towards the end of the war, weapons produced were simplified for quicker, cheaper production. For the 38H, this meant simpler markings, rough finish, and the elimination of features like the slide-mounted safety. So-called ""late-war"" models were still fully functional though. Final examples, produced until April 1945 when the factory was overrun by the Allies, feature mismatched serial numbers and poor fit and finish.
The spirit of the Sauer 38H lives on in the SIG Sauer P232 and its predecessor the P230, which also feature a fixed barrel, decocking lever, and similar internal design. As a testament to their fine design, many Sauer 38Hs are regularly used by owners to this day, albeit usually with replacement grips.

FEG SMC-918


From Gene Gangarosa's ""Complete Guide to Compact Handguns"", courtesy of Gregg Brewer:
K.B.I., Inc,of Harrisburg, PA, began importing this small Hungarian-made pistol in mid-1993, but its history dates back to the late 1950s. At about the same time FEG began making the Model PA-63 (see listing below), it also developed a smaller PPK-sized 9mm Makarov caliber pistol, called the RK-59. An excellent little pistol, similar to Poland's Model vz.63, it is highly regarded in military circles, serving the Hungarian military and police forces.

In 1991, Century imported about 3,000 RK-59s into the U.S. The small size of this gun makes it especially handy as a hideout gun, used mostly by high-ranking officials, pilots and various vehicle crews who occasionally need a pistol but are forced to work and fight in confined spaces. Handgun expert Leroy Thompson has argued that the RK-59 is perhaps the world's best military pistol, because it uses a fighting cartridge powerful enough to be taken seriously, yet is compact enough to carry comfortably on the person at all times.

A slightly improved version of the RK-59---the SMC-380---appeared in 1991. It's actually the same gun rechambered to the slightly less powerful, albeit better known, .380 ACP round. Its frame is still a lightweight alloy, but for commercial sales it is anodized black to match more closely the blued slide of the pistol. In its military version, the frame is left unfinished, as in the PA-63 described earlier.

The SMC-380 is of historical interest because it is the smallest gun ever imported legally into the U.S. since the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (according to which a gun cannot be imported if it is less than 4.0 inches in height). The SMC-380, which is barely 4.1 inches high, had to have a target-type left grip installed to meet the government's stringent importation criteria. The left target-style grip widened the pistol from 1.1 to 1.3 inches, but that was a small price to pay. A thinner, flatter left grip panel is also available on request.

Like the PMK-380, the SMC-380 is available only in .380 ACP caliber. Its alloy frame makes it smoother and two or three ounces lighter than the PPK. It also carries better in a pocket than the higher-priced German gun and it fits the average hand better. Its sights, while tiny, are easy to line up quickly, thanks to the comfortable curve of the backstrap. In testing an early SMC-380, the pistol proved quite accurate. One 25-foot offhand group placed five shots in a one-inch pattern, using Remington 88-grain jacketed hollowpoint, the second-best group at the same distance measured 1.1 inches across, using Samson 95-grain FMJ. Unfortunately, the pistol used required an extended breaking-in period of several hundred rounds before it fed consistently and reliably. Later, though, a second SMC-380 tested much better, with only one breaking-in jam. It's always a good idea to run at least 200 rounds (four boxes) of any particular brand of ammunition through any gun, without a single malfunction, before relying on that gun/ammunition combination for personal protection.

FEG SMC-918 

When K.B.I. observed the popularity of the SMC-380 in the U.S., it decided to import the 9mm Makarov version, the SMC-918. The Hungarians had made this model (with slight modifications) since the late 1950s, with importation beginning in late 1994.
The debate continues whether the 9mm Makarov or the .380 ACP is a better defense cartridge. Neither is particularly powerful, though some of the loadings---particularly the faster hollowpoints and exotic rounds (such as MagSafe)---have caused incapacitating wounds when fired in self-defense.
The SMC-918 we tested handled well. With its clean lines and rounded corners, this pistol carries comfortably in one's pocket and is light and handy. It also boasts good instinctive pointing, with a trigger pull that is noticeably smoother and lighter than that found in the SMC-380s tested. Despite the improved trigger pull, however, the SMC-918 proved slightly less accurate than the SMC-380. Whether this is a quirk of the 9mm Makarov cartridge or an inherent situation is difficult to tell. Regardless, the test pistol had no trouble feeding any ammunition tested, including Hornady's XTP hollowpoint. Recoil with SMC-918 was sharp, similar to firing a small .38-caliber revolver. The shape of its backstrap could be at fault. By rounding off much more than that of the Walther PPK, for instance, the Hungarian designers have created a gun that is smoother in contour but a bit more difficult to fire. Compact guns are, after all, an exercise in compromise.
The SMC-918 offers the 9mm Makarov cartridge in a package that is appreciably smaller and lighter than the Soviet-designed Makarov pistol or its derivatives. The SMC-918 is, in fact, the smallest pistol currently in production for the Makarov round. The price to pay is a gun that is easier to carry and slightly more difficult to shoot. Given its mission of self-defense, though, that's a compromise many buyers will surely find acceptable.

 In general, the FEG SMC offers a Walther PPK level of performance for much less the cost than a German-designed gun"

Serial Number just over 100000.

Dimensions: overall length of 6.75"" (3.75"" barrel) and height from bottom of Colt magazine to top of rear sight 4.5"" . Width of firearm is at a slim and concealable .75"". 

Weight: approximately 24 ounces 

Stocks: smooth pearl with metal rampant Colt Stallion embedded on each side. (No cracks) 

Condition is very good and bore is excellent. No box or holster. Excellent fit and finish with absolutely no rattle or looseness. One of the finest examples of craftsmanship of any Colt handgun I have owned. Nickel is all intact, is shiny, reflective and not peeling anywhere. The right side rear trigger housing has several small .125"" scratch striations which appear to be holster or ring contacts. Rollmarks and serial number are strong but the Rampant Pony has some fading of its details where it is thumbed/grabbed to charge and discharge the chamber (see photo. In addition there is some milky-fading (not shiny area) of the rear slide nickel that would be exposed outside of the normal holster area. (see photo) 

This 87 year old ""Safe Queen"" had been wiped and tucked away for a long, long while. It may have started life as an American Airline (precursor)airline pilot issued sidearm (circa 1930). Civilian pilots presumably had to carry a sidearm because they carried U.S. Postal Mail. There is no documentation to accompany or support this allegation but research does validate that another American Airway COLT Model 1908 Pocket Hammerless in nickel plating and in .380 ACP are within less than a 1000 units away from this serial number. See Sam Lisker's Colt Automatic Pistols website. 

This is the epitome of a concealed carry handgun and is essentially snag free. It has the magazine safety removal mechanism that prevents discharge without an inserted magazine. Magazine is marked CAL 380 COLT. There are three safety features: 1) Magazine disconnect 2) Hand-web safety (web of shooting hand must make contact with arch on pistol grip... 1911 precursor) 3) Strong side knurled thumb safety 

Pistol is clean and will not disappoint. Hopefully it will be awaiting a better fate than what the Political Leaders in the State of Texas have in store for it and all other semi-automatic firearms."

Sweden obtained a license to manufacture a variant of the design for domestic use as the Husqvarna m/1907 and began production in 1917 to meet both military needs and civilian demand. Husqvarna produced military pistols for Colombia when FN was unwilling to resume production in the 1930s. Sweden had manufactured 89,230 pistols when production ended in 1942.

The pistol m/1907 was taken out of storage and pressed into service in the 1980s as the bolts of the Lahti L-35 (then the official army pistol) pistols started cracking due to the use of a more powerful 9 mm P cartridge (9 mm m/39B, adopted as standard in the 1960s). This was an interim solution until deliveries of the new Glock 17 (pistol m/88) were complete."

Not the rarest of boxes but not too common and in great shape compared to others I have seen sold. Actual ground UPS as it is live ammo but combine with others, or the brass I have listed to save 

Vintage SuperSpeed 16gauge Full Box-1 #6---  $55
24 paper cartridges are inside, all correct to the box (I only checked top row as I am scared to remove more from the box as it is fragile) The box is in very good condition with no missing parts or damaged graphics. The inside flaps have one separated but the flap is present and in place. Must go UPS ground as loaded ammo so cost will depend on zipcode.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations  there is a Mini-14 meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.
This rifle has never been fired and has been in storage for over 2 years.  I own a Mini 30 and it is very easy to fire and care for, with excellent reliability.  It comes with 100 rounds of Brown Bear .223 ammo 62 grain Bimetal HP boat tailed bullet with lacquered steel case, non corrosive Berdan primers and two 5 round black Ruger magazines, and Ruger scope rings.  Cash only, face to face, no trades please.  I will need to see a copy of your driver's license or CCW permit.  Only a little more than 2 weeks before the gun ban for sales like this.

This stuff was delivered to my door yesterday, so its fresh and should function flawlessly.  I have several boxes of 50 rounds available.  Will trade for 22LR ammo, or sell for $60/50 rounds, $110/100 rounds, or $200/200 rounds, price not negotiable at this time.  I will not drive far but range from spanish fort to foley every week.

Bought this 2 months ago. Ive only put maybe 20 rounds through it, if that. Havent even adjusted the factory irons.

Why im selling:
I love the gun and its probably my favorite of the bunch, but .308 ammo is expensive (and given current events, rare) and I just dont shoot it often enough to justify keeping it locked in a safe.  I also have other expensive hobbies that can use some funding.  Im in no rush to sell and will be more than happy to keep the rifle.

The SU-16 series is notable for its compact, lightweight and simple design; and for being able to be broken down and folded into a compact configuration for transportation and storage. While the barrel, bolt-carrier and mechanism are steel, the SU-16's stock, receiver, and forend are manufactured of high-strength polymer plastic.
All variants of the SU-16 are chambered in 5.56×45mm, and are capable of using standard M16 STANAG compatible magazines (where not prohibited by state or local law). The SU-16 features a 1:9 in (230 mm) twist rifling. The SU-16 incorporates design features derived from several different weapons. It uses the locking bolt design of the M-16, and an operating system similar to that of the AK-47, in which a gas piston drives an operating rod, which is part of the bolt carrier and which rides on a spring contained in a gas tube mounted above the barrel. This design incorporates the operating rod and gas tube into the bolt carrier, allowing them to be removed easily for maintenance and cleaning. As with the AK-47, Armalite AR-18 and AR-180, and compared to the M-16, this design allows for the folding feature of the SU-16 and reduces the amount of propellant residue fouling that accumulates in the chamber and on the bolt carrier. The charging and bolt release handle is located on the right side and reciprocates with the weapon's bolt, allowing it to be used as a forward assist. All versions of the SU-16 incorporate a top-mounted Picatinny rail. In all versions except the short-barreled ""D"" model, the fore-end opens up to serve as an integrated folding bipod. The SU-16 breaks down into its collapsed configuration with the removal of a single pin, which can be pushed out with a round, and can be broken down for maintenance and cleaning without the use of tools. The bolt-carrier group and receiver constitute the only two assemblies of the weapon.
Despite this simplicity, one significant shortcoming in the design is that the chamber and breech of the barrel are not easily accessible from the rear, being blocked by the back of the upper receiver. This makes cleaning the chamber and the bore somewhat slower and more difficult compared to the AR-15, and prevents the bore from being easily inspected without the use of a small penlight or similar light source. A flexible bore-snake is a recommended cleaning accessory. When cleaning, particular care should be paid to the gas piston and operating spring, bolt face, chamber and barrel.[citation needed]
A further recommendation from some users is to replace the cotter-type pin used to secure the weapon in its open configuration—which is small, could be easily dropped or lost, and may be difficult to insert or remove under certain circumstances—with a larger hitch-type pin. Care must be used, however, as the OEM pin is a slightly smaller diameter than hitch-type pins commonly found in hardware stores
SU-16CA[edit]
The SU-16CA model incorporates most of the features of the C model, except for the true folding stock design, instead using the collapsible stock and trigger group design of the A model, which prevents the weapon from being fired when broken-down.[4] This change makes it legal for sale in jurisdictions with an ""assault weapon"" ban, such as California.[4]"

The following is a review of the Taurus PT 1911 AR from Gun Digest Magazine:

"" Now, if you love the 1911 platform, the PT-1911 AR is the gun for you. It’s big and solid, with an accessory rail forged right into the dust cover. And shoot! This gun is every bit as smooth and accurate as guns costing twice as much.

The PT-1911 AR provides all the performance of a custom gun in package that won’t break the bank.

The first thing I noticed right out of the box was the great trigger pull. Not too light, but very crisp.

The ambi safety is tough and the beavertail grip safety puts your hand right where it needs to be. The Novak sights are great and everything from the fit and finish to the checkering on the grip panels was outstanding.

Try as I might, I could not find anything to complain about as I looked at and fired this gun. The accuracy was all there. It functioned flawlessly with a smooth feel that said “custom gun” with every movement.

At that time it was one of the most futuristic designs on the market and incorporated little seen features such as lightweight polymer frame and a high-capacity double stack magazine. The model 17 also served as the first introduction to Glock's Safe Action Pistol concept. This revolutionary design featured 3 integral safety systems to ensure operator safety, but did not include an external, manual safety that might impede unpracticed or unfamiliar shooters. Since the 80s Glock has come a long way in improving and expanding on this design and they now have guns ranging from optimized competitive target shooting guns to concealed carry weapons. The Glock 19 is a compact model and is the most popular Glock model in production. It features a 4 inch hexagonally rifled barrel that increases weapon service life, decreases fouling, simplifies cleaning and improves muzzle velocity over a traditionally rifled barrel."

PWA Post Ban Lower Receiver- 
PWA is PacWest Arms. It was partially owned by Karl Lewis of LMT. When PWA ceased to exist the tooling went to Lewis of LMT. As far as I know LMT owns the rights to PWA and has turned out some of the PWA marked receivers since. The  receivers  are of pretty good quality and should be good enough for any build you would consider a similar high quality lower for.  PWA receivers are forged, and are fully coated with Nitrox and has no tooling marks or damage.  This receiver has been used less than 100 rounds, in excellent shape and is now attached with a good tight fit to an unused and new upper receiver made by DPMS Lo Pro with a match grade and crowned barrel, described below.  It has an adjustable stock and fully closed measures slightly over 30.5 inches.  
Product Information
 The DPMS Lo-Pro AR-15 Upper Receiver Assembly comes fully assembled and ready to install on any standard small pin, mil-spec lower receiver. The Lo-Pro Upper Receiver is constructed of 6066-T6 aircraft aluminum and is of the ""Slickside"" variety, with a sleek profile devoid of protrusions through the elimination of the conventional AR-15 forward assist, case deflector, and dust cover. The result is a clean, minimalist appearance that is both fully functional as well as lightweight. 
The Lo-Pro Upper is equipped with a 16"" Target-Crowned Bull Barrel, a true 5.56x45mm NATO chamber for use with either commercial or mil-spec ammunition, and employs the versatile 1 in 9"" rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. Additional features include heat resistant GlacierGuard polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle and complete bolt & carrier assembly. Aluminum parts are hard coat anodized to mil-spec, steel parts are manganese phosphate treated (parkerized) matte black. This upper receiver and match barrel is capable of MOA accuracy.
