*** I am willing to ship to you. But I will require payment ONLY by Western Union and the shipping cost would likely be too high for you to be interested, but you can ask if you want. I am thinking this is a better deal today for someone local. But, if you are willing to cover my required shipping costs, then I'm good with that also. I am required to ship either by Fed-Ex or UPS and it will be overnight delivery to you.

This is the complete package all you need for a great summertime EDC gun. Even though it is slightly heavier than the .38, it disappears in a pair of cargo shorts or jeans. With the big Houge Tamer grips, the Golden Saber carry ammo is mild, but the beast really turns loose with your standard .357s, although it's manageable. As with other .357s, you can fire .38s at the range as well.

Purchased the gun new for about $560, and I've fired maybe 50 rounds of 38/357 out of it. With the ammo, holster, strips and sights, I'd like to get $625 for the whole package. I'm not interested in breaking it up. May also take talk trade for Glock 26 and other subcompact semi-autos in 9mm.

318,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1805318,For Sale:   45 AUTO RIM STANDARD PRESSURE - 225 gr. Hard Cast Wadcutter @ 950 fps - 20 Round Box,"azusa, California, United States",$ 31,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 25, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=295

 This 225gr. full profile wad cutter, 45 auto rim, is the most deadly “standard pressure” load ever devised for the 45 auto rim cartridge. It utilizes the same bullet as our 45 colt ANTI-PERSONNEL ammunition (Item 3I) and because of popular request to have that bullet loaded into 45 auto rim ammo, here it is.

This bullet will penetrate around 28 inches in flesh and bone and makes a horrific permanent crush cavity because of its wad cutter profile. This load is the power/pressure level equivalent of  45 acp+P ammo and is safe to use in all modern 45 acp revolvers, including any/all (even pre war) 1917 model revolvers in normal operating condition.

Flash suppressed powders are used in this ammo so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire and this is a tactical advantage as roughly 95% of all civilian shootings in the U.S. happen in low light when the criminal element is at work.

The 225gr. wad cutter bullet is hard cast (not lead) and is properly lubed and will not substantially lead foul your barrel even after extensive shooting sessions, nor will the bullet fragment, smear or mushroom on impact with flesh and bone, thus insuring very straight and deep penetration with a consistent crush cavity throughout its path."

I bought this a few months ago, and put 50 rounds through it (20 - .357's  and  30 - 38's).  This Taurus has the 8-3/8"" ported barrel and an 8 - round cylinder with the satin stainless finish.  I replaced the factory rubber grips with wood ones........ they are wider and have nice deep finger groove for better control.  I do still have the rubber ones.

It works great, and still looks brand new, but I wish I bought a smaller 6"" -  6 round revolver.  

I am  wanting to trade for a Ruger GP100, stainless 5"" or 6"" barrel - in the same, or near same, condition.  I can send more pics if you are interested.

*Ruger GP100 MSRP = $759  and the Taurus 608 MSRP = $724 + $90 (for the wood  grips).............so I am looking for an even trade. (YES.. I know these both sell for less than MSRP.  I'm using this ""MSRP"" price for a comparison only).

I prefer to trade, but will now consider selling.  I paid $590 for the pistol and $97 'ish for the grips ($689 total)  I am not expecting to sell for that amount.
 I am going to be pretty FIRM on $600 for the pistol, soft case and the wood grips.

He claimed that they are flawless and have less than 50 rounds through them. He also claims that they function flawlessly, no FTF/FTE.
The JA 22 only fired about half the time and after two clips the extractor broke. I replaced it twice with the same results. I sent the slide to Jimenez and they replaced the extractor and it worked fine at the factory. The problem is with the pistol, someone has removed material where the extractor grabs the casing and the casings explode in this area. This gun is not safe to use when it fires.
At first this low life claimed that he didn’t know there was a problem. Later after I got the slide back and the extractor failed again he tried to justify lying by putting values on all of the “junk” he threw in with the sale.
The other two pistols work OK; they do not work flawlessly as he claimed.
Be aware of what you buy and don’t buy from this low life.

Barrel Length: 7 1/2"" This is an SAA barrel that has been replaced. 

Sights / Optics: The gun is mounted with a modified front blade (please see the pictures). The rear sight is interesting... The top strap is in the same configuration as an original gun, but has seen extensive work. It looks like the original trough was milled and an insert put in its place. It almost looks like an adjustable sight was once on this gun, and then replaced with a fixed insert... Please see the pictures. It's neat and it does not look to be a repair of any sort. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are Franzit imitation stag. The grips have shrunk considerably, affecting the fit. The grips otherwise just show marking and age discoloration. The grips rate in about Good overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Blue & Color Case Hardened 

Finish Originality: All metal parts apparently retain their original finish except where removed. 

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp and deep. There is no pitting or erosion in the bore. 

Overall Condition: This gun retains about 50% of its metal finish. The replaced barrel shows the majority of its original finish, drifting to a medium patina. There are nicks and dings on the barrel, which are likely tooling marks. The frame metal is very smooth, without pitting, though the case colors have primarily muted. The frame shows an older surface cleaning and some very light discoloration. The grip straps show no finish, but smooth metal and the back strap has been crudely checkered. Someone has also lightened the hammer. The Screw heads are very serviceable, though a bit worn. The markings are clear. Overall, this gun rates in about Very Good condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions quite well. The timing is good and the springs are strong. This should be a great shooter. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None"

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

I've shot another three hundred in the last two years. Not even broke in yet. I tell ya'. I like this pistola for what it is. Good balance, fast out of the leather. Easy to carry. Not one glitch with several different brands of ammo. In all honesty, I just don't care for the 9mm cartridge. I like my .45ACP...a lot. If I HAVE to shoot a thug I want to lift their ass off the ground and stop em'(him or her)with a couple of rounds and quick. I don't want to have to pump 17 rounds in em', re-ammo and hit em' again.

Bj's in sheboygan quoted me $20 to have it drilled and tapped. The bore is bright and with excellent rifling. Also has a new synthetic stock. I was going to duracoat the entire gun camo.

A few common concerns regarding the rifle: The lower can take on pretty much any upper and seems to have no issue or fitting required with 300 BLK or 7.62 x 39 uppers up to the thousands of rounds and counting according to other users. The buffer tube is not mil-spec, but a simple conversion kit would have no problem fitting. All AR-15 handguards should fit with no machining required.

Red-X Arms A3 Upper Receiver
Rainier Arms Select 14.5"" barrel
Rainier Arms XTC Compensator

Carbine length gas tube
UTG Free float tube handguards - mid length

Red-X Arms A3 upper is built from 7075-T6 Aluminum Forgings and hardcoated black anodizing with teflon coating.

Rainier Arms barrel is 14.5"" made of 416R Stainless with a matte stainless finish, has a 1:8 twist and M4 feed ramps and hole drilled for a carbine gas system.

Rainier Arms XTC compensator is 2.2 inches and is designed to reduce felt recoil and muzzle rise with a relatively low muzzle flash. As previously stated, has been permanently attached to bring the barrel length up to the legal 16"" minimum.

Rainier Arms low profile gas block was made .005 bigger to have a better fit on match grade barrels.

Gas tube is a gas tube,  what more do you want? Carbine length.

UTG Handguard is a mid-length to cover the gas block. Constructed with solid aircraft grade aluminum, has four standard picatinny rails with 20 slots.


I put this together at the beginning of the year just to have something to plink around with and decided to go another route with my build. It is a 14.5"" barrel with the XTC compensator blind pinned (work done by L&R Armory)  to bring the overall length above the legal 16"". I've shot probably 500 rounds through this and it shoots really well. To complete this, you would just need a bolt, charging handle and a built lower receiver. Please contact me for more pictures or any questions/offers. Thanks!"

At one point in its life, someone stored this incorrectly and the left side of the barrel, and above the grip area, there is freckling on the finish. Otherwise its in good shape.

Item Description

Up for sale is a “Like New” LWRCI M6A2 carbine with ACOG and more. This gun was bought new about 2 months ago. It has had 8 rounds shot through it to sight in the ACOG. The gun was then put in the safe and hasn’t been taken out until I took these pictures today. I am only selling this rifle to fund a bolt rifle that I am building. I have several other AR-15’s and I figured since I haven’t shot this one really, I’ll let it go. My loss is your gain. Get this package for an extremely low price.

The optic is an original Trijicon ACOG RCO-TA31M150. It has the red chevron and is calibrated for the 5.56 caliber. This is not some knock off brand or imitation. The ACOG is mounted on a LaRue Tactical QD mount that will also come with it. This allows you to remove the optic for cleaning or whatever and return it and still be zeroed. It also has a kill flash mounted on the front of the optic. It also has factory LWRC back up iron sights (BUIS).

The gun also has an Advanced Armament (AAC) Blackout flash hider that has the M.I.T.E.R. system on it made for the AAC SPR/M4 Suppressor . I have the AAC SPR/M4 suppressor that I will offer for sale if interested (not included in listed package price). It was used much more than the LWRCI rifle, I have had the suppressor for about 4 years and used it on several rifles. There is no problem with it, just some cosmetic wear from use. I am only offering it because I have other suppressors that don’t use the M.I.T.E.R system and I can use them on my other guns.

The gun comes also with a Viking Tactics padded QD sling.

Included in package:

• “LNIB” LWRCI M6A2 Carbine

• Trijicon ACOG TA31RCO-M150
