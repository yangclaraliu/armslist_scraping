SN 1250454 puts this gun production in late 1950. Some minor pitting on the receiver.. The magazine tube has lost some of its blueing from use. The action on this gun is smooth as silk. This weapon is slamfire capable per its original production. Furniture is in good shape with a nice patina from use with a few surface scratches. This isn't a top show quality gun but is an excellent working gun for real use. In my opinion the quality of construction and the condition of this gun is better than the pressed and stamped steel of today's new shotguns, I really wouldn't be selling it if I didn't need to.

Product Description:

NEBO PROTEC ELITE HP230 uses a highly efficient, recoil-proof LED to generate 230 lumens of blinding white light. Light of this magnitude is enough to dominate an aggressor's night adapted vision, ideal for military, law enforcement, and self-defense. The reflector lens tightly focuses the beam for long distance lighting while also producing enough light to support the user's peripheral vision. The HP230's batteries will produce 3 hours of continuous illumination. The compact body of the HP230 is constructed of aircraft grade anodized aluminum making it a lightweight, yet powerful light source. The HP230 is also O-ring and gasket sealed to be completely weatherproof. The HP230 features an ambidextrous On-Off switch to provide one-finger operation. This switch allows you to select 100% white light, 50% white light or defensive strobe.SpecificationsOutput - 230 lumensRuntime - 3 hours of continuous illuminationLength - 3.375""Width - 2.25""Height - 1.25"" Weight - 0.2625 lbs.Batteries - Two CR123A batteries (included) + allen + extra back plate and o-ring. -- One Allen screw broke when I overtightened the first time puting it on my AR, but the 1 held it in place perfectly and will work for you as well."

This is the shotgun that every Saiga 12 WANTS to be but cannot. Only 1000 have been shipped into the country as of yet--but being an AK at heart, most aftermarket accessories are still interchangeable.

The Vepr 12 was also designed with an auto gas regulator (unlike its little brother, the Saiga) meaning that you can reliably feed ANY 2 3/4 or 3 inch shells you can find without manual adjustment from birdshot to buckshot, low to high brass. Unlike the Saiga, the Vepr 12 was based on the RPK instead of the standard AK, which means that the receiver has a hinged dust cover, a thicker receiver, and a polymer rail on top. Also included in the design is an auto-bolt hold open and a magwell which allows for AR-15 style magazine changes instead of rock and lock.

Instead of explaining every new intricacy, watch this great video by the Military Arms Channel on youtube to get an idea of all of its features.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMfzN5LZc3o

I have added a Magpul rail to the lower handguard, as well as a vertical foregrip. Additionally, I have replaced the standard wooden stock with a sturdy clubfoot. The Vepr would come with two 10 round SGM magazines and 1 original Russian 5 round.

I've sent roughly 150 shells down the tube and I am QUITE fond of my deadly new toy. Please dont hesitate to send any questions that you may have. Im a firearms enthusiast and  am constantly buying/selling/trading so show me what you have in trade--gotta try em all!! Thanks for looking."

Can add a rear Sling Point for 15$ if you would like

So i have about 380$ invested in this, plus hours and hours of time piecing it together so i didn't have to pay the 500-600 pirce tag that all the gougers were selling for. My price is lower then anyone else on here, so if your looking to build an AR, this is what you need. Just pull the take-down pins, snap the upper on and latch in place and your ready to fire! 

All parts were properly installed, and all functions on the gun work as they should. Bolt catch easily snap back into position after pushing the button. Mag release works perfectly, and can bring a mag to show you if you would like. I have built all my AR's, as well as my dads, and a few friends. So i can assure you it was properly done with professional tools and extra care to not damage the lower itself. No scratches or anything. I REALLLLY do not want to sell this, but a car is more important.... I guess

I have six magazines for sell.  I willl sell any or all at $50 each.  That means you buy 2 price is $100 plus shipping.  You buy 3 the price is $150 plus shipping.  Get the picture, sorry just sold to many things and trying to weed out the 47%.

Payment  for shipped items will be paypal.  I will calculate shipping cost and bill for magazines and shipping through paypal invoice, once the money hits my account I will by next day.

Presently, New York State laws are very similar to the lapsed Federal Assault Weapons Ban, but do not have a sunset provision. According to the laws of the State of New York, a magazine with a capacity of more than 10 rounds manufactured after September 14, 1994 cannot be legally possessed by anyone other than a law enforcement officer. 

• The following states have already implemented capacity-based magazine bans: California – 10 rounds; Hawaii – 10 rounds; Maryland – 20 rounds; Massachusetts – 10 rounds; New Jersey – 15 rounds; New York – 10 rounds; Ohio – 30 rounds.

In case you were wondering about the paint, I have painted it similar to the weapons I used in overseas combat in iraq. I served as a medic for a scout/sniper reconplatoon the paint on the weapons serves two main purposes. 1) an all black weapon allows someone to use the black weapon slung across your body as a perfect measurement reference for range estimation. 2) basic camouflage purposes, a painted weapon blends better in the environment, essentially makes it harder for the enemy to acquire you in their optic as a potential target.

This holster uses belt loops at the front and rear to pull your handgun tight against your body for better concealment. The angle this holster positions your handgun allows faster drawing with full combat grip, more comfortable wearing, and much safer use.
A regular Small of the Back (SOB) holster places your gun over the base of the spine. A fall or hard blow with your gun in that position could cause serious spinal cord injury. Our holster is engineered for kidney carry to avoid that danger.
Made of waterproof foam for a comfortable carry and to protect gun from moisture. Lined on both sides with rugged Cordura® nylon for durability and a smooth, fast draw. Webbing inside the holster protects your gun’s sights and keeps holster partially open for easier re-holstering. Great for use while driving. Comes with an adjustable thumb break to keep gun secure. Fits belts up to 1½” wide. Available for right or left hand draw. Black. Made in the USA.

Still have original box and literature. All I did was take the stickers off of the stock because they bother me. 

I bought it for $329.00 which came out to $361.01 out the door. Lets be simple, I bought this gun to turn a profit. I have a 1979 Ruger 10/22 that I love and have no need for this one, it was the last on the shelf and although not impossible to find, it is difficult. $400 isn't bad, less than $40 profit for me, but i'm fine with that, pretty firm on the price. 

I do have 300 rnds of CCI 22 LR Stingers that i'd be willing to sell also. 

Sorry if I sound like an jerk with my post, I just don't want to receive people sending offers lower than what I paid, otherwise I'll just keep it. 

Thanks for reading this ad."

The Model 70's Featherweight stock has a satin finished dark walnut. The stock's lines are clean in a very traditional way, which makes the fancy, wraparound, ribbon paneled, point checkering... fitting, rather than ornate. I believe the patterns are 20 LPI machine cut. That said, the diamonds are clean, a bit sharp when new, but they do what they are suppose to do, provide a slip free surface. The little cross bolt plug is nifty; functional and decorative and the recoil pad is excellent. Decelerator pads are not the newest on the market, but one of the best."

DHS is buying up 1.6 billion rounds (750 million .40 S&W) using our tax dollars borrowed from China, enough for a 100 year war in Afghanistan. Which is causing this shortage, along with insane gun restrictions. So ... before we even talk or shake hands you have to say
