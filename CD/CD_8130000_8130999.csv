These selectors are 3mm shorter than the factory levers, which allows the shooter to take full advantage of the high grip position on the Vector receiver without the discomfort of the selectors biting into the trigger finger. These are 3mm shorter on Gen 1 and Gen 2 receivers built prior to 2017. The post 2017 Gen 2.5 receivers with the redesigned rear receiver extension have a higher grip and these selectors are the same length as the Gen 2.5 factory levers. They do still fit the newest model if you just want more comfortable billet aluminum replacement selectors but they are not shorter on that model. Visit HB Industries for more pictures.These are $30 plus shipping for the pair. Asking $20 and will meet in Hillsboro. Can't beat that!Call, text or e-mail 503-two77-3nine58Thank you!"

No, I don't know if that helps at all, but I am superstitious. I didn't hand load for it, but with quality factory match ammo, it has been a ~half MOA gun for me. I do have the original box for the rifle and the scope, manuals for both, and bottom metal too. I do not want to break up the package as I need to make room. Over $1600 in this rifle. I am letting it go for $1200 to fund new project. Thanks for looking! 865-712-1656"
