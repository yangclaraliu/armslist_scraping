I have thoroughly cleaned and lubricated this weapon and I can assure you that you won't find a scratch or any blemish whatsoever on this rifle. It is immaculate. I haven't shot it since because I haven't had the time to, and to tell you the truth, I didn't feel up to cleaning it so soon. I'm not kidding you, it can be eaten off of it's so clean.

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist. Shipped complete with 30-round magazine, a safety and operations manual, and a carrying sling."

The designation AK-47 stands for Kalashnikov automatic rifle, model of 1947( Avtomat Kalashnikova 47.) It is therefore also known as Avtomat Kalashnikova (or simply 'AK'), Kalashnikov or Russian jargon Kalash). Design work on the AK began in 1944. In 1946 a version of the rifle, the AK-46, was presented for official military trials, and a year later the fixed stock version was introduced into service with select units of the Red Army."

287,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1783287,For Sale:  840 rnds of Lake City 5.56 M855 (not XM855) Green Tip Ammo in Original Packaging,"Brandon / Riverview, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 966,"Listed On: Saturday, July 13, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"840 rounds of single-lot, Lake City 5.56x45mm NATO M855 (not XM855) 62 grain green tip ammunition on stripper clips packed in bandoliers in the original ammo can, with unbroken ""US LC"" seal.

This listing was recently flagged for being ""overpriced."" Overpriced compared to what? All the 62 grain green tip 5.56 ammo listed on this site is XM855, not M855. Yes, there is a difference. 

The ""X"" designation is what Lake City uses when lots of M855 don't meet mil-spec, or contract requirements for whatever reason, and is sold on the civilian market under the Federal brand name. XM855 is good ammo, but M855 is premium grade ammo that is only available to the military and defense contractors. This is the last can from a single lot pallet that was used for R&D by a defense contractor. Lake City's current price for this ammo (M855) to authorized buyers is $1.25 per round. I'm selling it for $1.15 per round. If someone can show me a listing for sealed cans of single lot M855 (not XM855) 5.56 ammo, I will adjust my price accordingly. If you don't want it, don't buy it, but don't flag it just because you don't understand the difference.

What's included in this listing:

840ea rounds of M855 62 grain steel penetrator brass case ammunition 
(reloadable brass cases)*
84ea 10 round stripper clips*
28ea cardboard sleeves
7ea 4 pocket bandoliers (will also hold 4ea 30 round magazines)*
7ea stripper clip feed guides (one ea per bandoleer set)*
7ea heavy gauge anodized safety pins*
1ea water-tight, steel M2 ammo can*

* These items are reusable.

The used brass can be reloaded, the stripper clips can be reused multiple times, the bandoliers serve a multiple purpose and the feed guides make loading magazines quick and easy. Each bandolier holds 120 rounds on 10 round stripper clips in cardboard sleeves of 30 rounds each. The stripper clips slide into the feed guide which slips over the trailing edge of a 30 round magazine. Using the feed guide, rounds from the stripper clips can be loaded into a magazine in a matter of seconds without wearing out your thumb.

Once the bandolier is empty, the white zip stitching running along the lower third of the fabric can be pulled out with one tug, opening the pockets to the proper depth to hold a 30 round magazine (see second photo). The bandolier loaded with four 30 round magazines can then be slung over the shoulder, using the the safety pin to attach the strap to clothing, vest or gear to prevent loss should the wearer fall head over heels or roll. By slinging bandolier straps over opposing shoulders, the weight can be kept in balance. Sixteen magazines with 480 rounds can be carried in just 4 bandoliers. The amount of ammo that can be carried in bandoliers far exceeds the capacity of any ammo vest on the market... civilian or military.

I have a brand new never fired custom built AR-57! The AR-57 is a American tactical version of the PS-90. It takes the same 50rnd mags but has a higher velocity than the PS-90!

Like I said this is a brand new never fired AR-57 if u have ever heard of one then u know exactly what your looking at! This shoots the 5.7x28 rifle round known to be (even the normal round nose) armor piercing ammunition. (Google it!) I have another just like this I built for me this was my girlfriends. I can tell u first hand this thing packs a hell of a punch on what ever your aiming at! 

This package comes with:
6-50rnd mags (5 nib 1 loaded)
300rnds of American eagle 40grain ammo (AP)
1 1-point sling (and proper sling plate installed)
1 AIM reactive site (red/green and 4 different rets)
1 set of MAG-PUL flip up back up sites! 
1 MWG (mag well grip) by fab defence 
1 ""catch can"" hollowed out mag to keep all 50 shells in a nice place for your convenience!!
1 forward grip with side rail and button activated bipod 
1 tac light with silhouette. Low light, high light, and strobe(mounted to forward grip)
And 1 just flat out scary flash guard with 6 fairly sharp points on it in case u just need to push some one away and not waste a round this will work perfectly! 

So like I said all new never fired. AR-57 upper on a fully polymer lightweight ATI Omni lower with a Plum Crazy internals kit!!!

Product Description
The CVA Electra .50 Electronic ARC Ignition Muzzleloader with Fiber Optic Sights is easy to fire and easy to clean. The ARC Electronic Ignition system is completely sealed from the elements, and only the barrel needs to be cleaned of fouling. The electronic switch trigger eliminates pressure explosions, giving you a more accurate shot and allowing full and consistent burn of the powder charge in the barrel. .50-caliber muzzleloading ammunition not included. Requires one 9 volt battery (included) for approximately 500 shots and 600 hours of use.

Loading capacity: 150 grains

Trigger is actually an electronic switch with an incredibly clean pull
DuraSight fiber optic sights give you a clean, crisp aiming point

This rifle has only been fired about 50 times.  I recently acquired a 300 WSM Savage so this one is now redundant.  If you enjoy working on your own guns these Savage rifles can actually be caliber swapped with very little effort.  This model could be a .243, .308, 7mm-08 etc with just a different barrel.

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

The short-lived Valmet M-71 variant Assault Rifle used a stamped steel receiver and a front sight almost identical to that of the AKM. The stock was folding and synthetic, and apparently a modification of that of the FN CAL. The handguard completely surrounded the gas tube, and though synthetic, basically looked like that of the AKM. Unlike the AKM, the bolt has a hold-open device and a bolt catch. A variant is the Valmet M-71S, was chambered in 5.56mm NATO and intended for export, with a semiautomatic-only civilian/police version also available. The Velmet M-71S apparently did not do well; and the Valmet M-71 Assault rifle did not either, being produced only from 1971-73, though they were carefully placed into storage."

The Jericho 941 is a double action/single action semi-automatic pistol developed by Israel Weapon Industries and introduced to the market in 1990 as the Jericho 941. It was first imported into the US in 1990 by K.B.I., Inc. of Harrisburg, PA. It was later imported by O.F. Mossberg & Sons and named the Uzi Eagle and by Magnum Research, Inc. as the Baby Eagle until the end of 2008. Some pistols from Magnum Research are marked Desert Eagle Pistol. Magnum Research, now a division of Kahr Arms, announced a renewed importation of the Jericho."

779,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1783779,For Sale:  Springfield Model 1873 Trapdoor Rifle w/orig sling,"Catlettsburg, Kentucky, United States",$ 600,"Listed On: Thursday, June 20, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is a good Springfield Model 1873 Trapdoor Rifle in unmessed with ""attic found condition."" Serial number on this rifle is 199752, indicating it was manufactured in 1882. Stock is in fine condition great condition with what appears to be crackling of an old varnish in some places near the wrist and stock flats. There is a deep pressure dent just forward of the butt plate tang in the form of a semi-circle that exactly matches the outline of a period bayonet socket. Small sliver approximately 1"" long and 1/8th deep missing along barrel on right side just to the rear of the nose cap and it is a very old injury as the wood patina is almost matching the rest of the stock-barely noticeable. Stock has a crisp ""SWP/1882"" cartouche, which stands for Samuel W. Porter, who was Master Armorer at Springfield Armory from 1879 until 1894. Next to it appears an interesting attempt by a soldier to recreate the Springfield cartouche with one showing his initials and date, although it is now hard to read. Barrel is brown throughout with surface pitting along its length but bore is still amazingly mirror shiny with strong rifling. Barrel has strong ""V/P/Eagle Head,"" with appropriate tilde/""P"" firing proof near the receiver. Breech block is 5th Type with rounded shoulders and marked ""US/MODEL/1873."" Color case hardened finish has turned to a deep plum brown. Cam latch assembly works perfectly. Breech has no play and is tight while in battery. Lockplate is 2nd Type with the small shield in the Eagle. Blue finish has turned brown with surface pitting but Eagle and ""US/SPRINGFIELD"" is still sharp. Hammer is a correct Third Type with beveled lip and enclosed checkering at the thumb piece. Trigger Plate is correct Second Type with brown finish throughout and minor surface pitting. Trigger is correct Smooth First Type with some original case coloring still present on the trigger root. Correct Model 1879 upper barrel band with stacking swivel and 1879 lower barrel band. Ramrod is correct cupped Model 1878 2nd Type with cupped end and a crack in the patch eyelet. Rifle has correct 2nd Type Front Sight Blade. Also has correct Model 1879 4th Form, 3rd Variation rifle Buckhorn Rear Sight with ""R"" Rifle stamp on elevation ladder and left side ramp. Sight works and is brown with some surface pitting. This rifle comes with an original 3rd Type Leather Sling that is in excellent condition and is still pliable with both keepers present and narrow pronged brass hook. It is hard to find these earlier 1873 rifles that have not been modified to incorporate later changes. This weapon is an antique so it can be shipped to anyone. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like additional photos posted."
