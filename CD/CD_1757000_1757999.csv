Improved materials and manufacturing methods have made the PMAG M3 magazine perform to a higher standard in all tests: durability, impact strength, chemical resistance, and exposure to extreme temperatures. Internally, a new low friction, 4-way anti-tilt follower and enhanced constant curve geometry further increase feeding reliability in adverse conditions. Externally, the M3 PMAG has been significantly strengthened in the feed lip and spine areas to better withstand direct impacts when loaded to full capacity. The new Gen M3 has also been engineered to be compatible with a wider variety of magazine pouches via a smaller profile floorplate (which also boasts improved drainage capability) and lower profile ribs on either side of the magazine’s body. These “smoother” side ribs are complemented by the addition of horizontal grooves molded into the front- and back-straps of the body to ensure a positive grip in all conditions. The integration of eight dot-matrix panels (four on each side) enables the shooter to positively mark and identify magazines in a clear and abrasion-resistant way.

The PMAG 30 Gen M3 incorporates additional external improvements to the magazine catch and bolt catch notch areas that have expanded its firearm compatibility to include more than the AR-15 platform alone. It is also fully functional with the FN SCAR-16, the British SA-80, and the HK416/IAR/M27 platforms. The drop-free characteristics of the PMAG were also improved to ensure compatibility with a wider range of magazine wells, including those with tighter tolerances than mil-spec. Made in the USA.

Improved materials and manufacturing methods have made the PMAG M3 magazine perform to a higher standard in all tests: durability, impact strength, chemical resistance, and exposure to extreme temperatures. Internally, a new low friction, 4-way anti-tilt follower and enhanced constant curve geometry further increase feeding reliability in adverse conditions. Externally, the M3 PMAG has been significantly strengthened in the feed lip and spine areas to better withstand direct impacts when loaded to full capacity. The new Gen M3 has also been engineered to be compatible with a wider variety of magazine pouches via a smaller profile floorplate (which also boasts improved drainage capability) and lower profile ribs on either side of the magazine’s body. These “smoother” side ribs are complemented by the addition of horizontal grooves molded into the front- and back-straps of the body to ensure a positive grip in all conditions. The integration of eight dot-matrix panels (four on each side) enables the shooter to positively mark and identify magazines in a clear and abrasion-resistant way.

The PMAG 30 Gen M3 incorporates additional external improvements to the magazine catch and bolt catch notch areas that have expanded its firearm compatibility to include more than the AR-15 platform alone. It is also fully functional with the FN SCAR-16, the British SA-80, and the HK416/IAR/M27 platforms. The drop-free characteristics of the PMAG were also improved to ensure compatibility with a wider range of magazine wells, including those with tighter tolerances than mil-spec. Made in the USA.

The Lite Rail incorporates precision CNC-machined M1913 Picatinny Rail surfaces along its entire length for the addition of lights, lasers, vertical grips and/or other tactical accessories. The skeletonized design of the quad rail handguard removes all unnecessary weight and bulk, keeping the rifle trim and lively for better handling qualities. While light weight was certainly a design goal, Strength and Rigidity are the Lite Rail's true defining characteristics, ensuring military-grade durability and performance under the most demanding of circumstances.

Installation requires the removal of the factory barrel nut, replacing it with Daniel Defense's proprietary ""Bolt-Up System"" featuring a hardened steel barrel nut and simplified alignment of the upper-to-handguard top rail interface. Six Grade-8 Mil-Spec Fasteners are then used to secure the handguard tube to the upper receiver via a pair of matching aluminum Bolt-Up Plates. The ""Bolt-Up System"" is an extremely strong and proven design, tested thoroughly by USSOCOM, who selected it and the Daniel Defense RIS II Handguard for the SOPMOD II Program.

The 7.62 Lite Rail has 3 different barrel nuts to make it compatible with Armalite AR10, Rock River LAR-8 and DPMS LR-308 rifle platforms. This Lite Rail handguard comes with the barrel nut for use with a DPMS LR-308 only. Other barrel nuts are sold separately.

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

This PMR-30 is the updated model. Barrel is smooth and is NOT the barrel older model with fluting (caused rounds to tumble). Updated models have .22 WMR on top. In the pictures you can see the .22 WMR markings on the slide. Also, know that I will be keeping my magazines."

Okay, so apparently the wifey thinks that 1 motorcycle, 1 truck, 1 van, and 2 cars is too much.  But.. a man can never have too many guns!

Blue book value is $4400 for good condition, HOWEVER - I'm no dummy and I know that nothing is getting KBB value these days.. So I'm taking cash and/or trade offers (guns and/or gold) for a 2001 Chevy Malibu 4 door, silver in color.

Starts, runs, drives just fine. No exhaust leaks, nothing leaks or burns anything. New battery & serpentine belt last October, new front brakes & rotors last month. Has a little rust under the fuel lid (as shown in pictures) - other than that it is in pretty good cosmetic shape. No major dents, scratches, and no paint wearing off. Interior is also in good shape. Tires are good (not new, but good). It doesn't shake, wiggle, pull to either side, none of that mess. Mechanically well maintained and the miles are highway miles (work is 50 miles a day round trip). 206,xxx miles. Power windows, door locks, trunk, and steering. A/C does not work - I presume it will need recharged. If I've left anything out please just ask, I'm trying very hard to have a 'no surprises' kind of deal!

CLEAR Ohio title (not rebuilt, salvage, etc). Test drives welcomed with cash, guns and/or gold in my hand - otherwise I will do the driving.

For an additional cost, I can install a nice stereo system. We can discuss options when you come see the car.

If you need more information, or would like to come see the car, please call. If you insist on sending offensively low (3 digit) offers, don't hold your breath for a response.

Also, it was a special model (forget the exact model number) but it was refered to as the GI Collector edition. Aside from USGI parts it came with a collector quality USGI walnut stock. The pictures don't do justice as the stock has a beautiful grain to it - and perfect Defense Acceptance Stamp and P cartouches.

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform. 

Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length 
Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved 
Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours 
The XPS3 is Night Vision compatible, for non-Night Vision compatible units see the XPS2 sights."
