The Spike’s Tactical billet upper receiver is not just another different cosmetic alternative to forged upper receivers but it’s actually designed with functional upgrades that aren’t available on other billet upper receivers!

We machine this bad boy out of 7075 billet Aluminum and finish it in a durable Type III Hardcoat Anodized finish. Of course, we cut the M4 feed ramps before the Anodizing process to avoid reliability issues down the road. We also flared the side walls of the receiver to eliminate accidental bolt release problems and we also machined the upper receiver in a way that lets you use the popular Magpul BAD lever or other aftermarket bolt catch levers which most other billet upper receivers don’t let you do. Because of our beefier design, it allows for less flex than forged upper receivers.

We also play nice here at Spike’s Tactical and because of that, we machined our billet upper receiver to accept most aftermarket rail systems as well as pre-install the forward assist and the ejection port door. Just like how our billet lower receiver utilizes set screws to retain everything in place, the forward assist is held in place with a set screw for easy disassembly if you ever need to in the life of this upper receiver.

Our billet upper receiver matches our billet lower perfectly, but it also works great with standard forged lowers so it’s fully up to you on which receiver you want to use.

Get one today and make your next build the envy of everyone at the range!

With light pellets, the rifle will frequently emit the tell tale crack as the pellet crosses the sound barrier (~1100fps). However the robust spring piston much prefers heavier 10.5 gr pellets.

Ive got a set of fresh GT40P cylinder heads that are the best cast iron heads Ford ever made and will normally add 40-60 horsepower to your small block ford engine and these have upgraded valve springs in them already and were recently pulled from a 5.0 Mustang with a Trick Flow Cam and it was a very fast and fun car to drive so no need to worry about upgrading anything and you will feel a BIG difference over stock heads, these heads flow better than what came on the 5.0 Cobra Engines and 5.8 Ford Lightning Engines and fit any newer or older Small Block Engine including 289/302/351 and 5.0/5.8 engines so you can install these on anything you want for a big difference for a very reasonable price. They work great and need nothing and are totally ready to bolt on and give you a serious power gain averaging 40-65+ Horsepower depending on your engine but you'll feel it no matter what! - i will include the entire Fel Pro Gasket Set and Brand new Platinum Spark Plugs also which cost an extra $150 so this is a true direct bolt on using all factory parts and you don't have to buy anything extra.You can have the factory rocker arms/pushrods/bolts also but your factory parts will work just fine-I'll include them anyway.
 ***I have a Performer RPM AIR GAP style INTAKE MANIFOLD for a small block Ford- fits 260/289/302 and 5.0 Ford V8 Engines.  IT WAS PUT ON AN ENGINE BUT NEVER RAN-basically new
.***I have a HOLLEY 650 DOUBLE PUMPER CARBURETOR that was great when pulled from a daily driver but has been on shelf for a while,  great carb.  I also have a Holley 750 Dual Feed non-double pumper set up to work with mechanical secondaries  that ran great and was pulled off and had been sitting with the other one in the garage since.  Ill include new gaskets for both in case you may want to give them a quick cleaning. They are great carburetors and could never go bad and are so simple. Don't miss a chance to get a good deal on one because they cost over $400 new with no fuel line.  I will include both regular metal dual feed line to plug in your fuel hose and a braided stainless steel dual inlet in case you are using -AN Fittings. Let me know if interested and what you have in mind. 
****I've got lots of miscellaneous mustang parts including a nice black driver side door and fender from a 93 MUSTANG LX complete with all power items- window motor, lock, mirror.

Up for sale is my built AR-15. It includes a Spike's lower, a Del-ton upper, with a 16"" chrome-lined, 1-in-7 twist barrel, standard A2 trigger assly. Carbine-length gas tube. Mil-spec buffer, spring, and tube. I kept the A2 handguard on it, but included is a quad rail with covers and bipod for bench shooting. Magpul MOE grip and buttstock, adjustable. Barrel has a 6.5"" flash hider (I just liked the look of it). I will find and include the standard A2 birdcage flash hider if desired. Upper receiver is chrome-lined, and the BCG has a properly staked gas key. Scope is a Leupold Mark AR, 1.5 - 4x scope. Scope has only seen approximately 40 rounds for a range zero session. 

I've put about 300 rounds through it, and haven't used it in quite some time, so I am selling to make room for a 45-70. Bore and rifling is like-new. Has been kept oiled in my gun cabinet, and cleaned with Hoppes #9 after each shoot. I also will include four magazines, two being standard military surplus magazines, and two being Magpul, one black, one matching. Also included are 276 rounds of .223. Includes 250 boxed rounds, and 26 kept in a magazine. All other magazines and accessories are included.

I am asking $1,200 for everything. That includes the Leupold scope, all ammunition, rail, bipod, and magazines, which retail at $500-$600 alone. This rifle by itself retails between $800-$1000, not including the Scope block, rings, or Magpul accessories. Given the current market on AR's and pricing, I am offering this rifle below value to compensate for competition (you may inquire about purchasing only the rifle)

FFL transfer only. I will not sell ammo or accessories by themselves, But we can negotiate price on just the rifle if you are not interested in the extras.

Cash, money order, or Paypal only. Rifle will ship when funds are cleared. Local pick-up OK. Transfer fee and shipping negotiated.

Winchester Super X Nickel Plated Rounds,"South Side, Wichita, Kansas",$ 30,"Listed On: Friday, July 5, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 150 rounds of nickel plated brass Winchester Super-X Ammunition 357 Magnum 158 Grain Jacketed Hollow Points. I don't think you can buy a box anywhere right now if you wanted to. I have 5 revolvers and this is my carry ammo. If you reload, the Nickel Plated Brass on these is great for relaoding.  If you want some hard hitting .357 Magnum rounds these are for you. I'm keeping several boxes, I generally shoot more .38's in my 357 pistols than 357 rounds, but I like to always shoot at least one, or two cylinders of them and then leave the range with my gun loaded with them. I also shoot .38 Spec, 9mm, .40 S&W, .45 acp and 22Lr.  (I know, its an addiction, haha) So I'm looking to swap some of my good carry rounds for some (I don't care what brand) cheap range ammo. This stuff sells for around 50.00 a box if you could even find it, but I'm not interested in getting top dollar, or inflated prices for it, just a good swap price, or if you just want to buy some I'll sell it outright. I'd like 30.00 per 50 rounds which is 20.00 under average cost. So I'd swap for 2 boxes of 9mm, or 350 rds of .22Lr, or 1 1/2 box of .45 ACP. I don't need any high dollar carry rounds, I have plenty in every caliber listed, just cheap range ammo. Here are three online places, their cost, and none have had it all year.

This design originated from Henry rifles but it had flaws. In 1866, Oliver Winchester took over the another company and named it Winchester Repeating Arms Co. and that same year he made improvements on this Henry Rifle design and introduced it as the Yellowboy. 

This 1866 Uberti Yellowboy Sport Rifle, is a clone of one of the most popular rifle’s of the late 1800’s, which was carried by Chief Sitting Bull, the armies of Benito Juarez and the Turkish armies of the time.  This .45 caliber has a 24.25” octagon barrel and holds 13+1 rounds.  It has a brass frame, brass buttplate, a case hardened lever, a brass fore-end nose cap and a Grade A walnut stock.  This is a new gun and it has never been fired.

Extremely accurate and fun to shoot and cheap since you can plink with 38s. I love the gun but the wife got me the one I wanted which is the 20 inch version and holds 12 rounds. These guns are reliable and a ton of fun. It is super light so if you used it to hunt, plink, or HD for a woman that does not like recoil this is a perfect choice. Lever is smooth and light compared to some lever guns I have shot. It is a great camping gun if like me you carry a .357 while camping you can have a rifle and not worry about bringing 2 kinds of ammo. A .357 out of a rifle is a much higher powered round than a pistol shooting a .357 and it shows in accuracy and distance. If I had room in the safe I would not sell it but I have too many guns as it is.

A Burris MTAC 1-4x24 is mounted, offering a wide field of view for close range target engagement and a 4x zoom for longer range, and a generous 3.5"" to 4"" of eye relief. The MTAC features a Bullet Drop Compensation, or BDC, reticle, for predicting bullet drop at ranges up to 600 yards. These scopes deliver optical performance that is virtually identical to ultra-premium scopes. All lenses are precision ground optical glass that is index matched, multi-coated with HiLumeTM for clear, sharp high resolution images. Magpul MBUS backup sights are mounted on matching Blue 45 degree offsets, ensuring this rifle is always good to go.

Item Description:

This is a brand new in box CMMG MK3 CBR LR-308 rifle. The LR-308 design specification is a variation of the AR-10 followed by manufacturers such as DPMS, CMMG, MagPul and many others. It is chambered in .308 Winchester and has a 16"" Match Grade 416 Stainless Steel barrel with 1:10"" twist rate and threaded muzzle. The Mk3 CBR (Carbine Battle Rifle) utilizes the same core of the standard Mk3 rifles, but features an optimized tapered barrel profile. The perfect balance between weight and rigidity. The Mk3 CBR introduces the new RKM (Revo KeyMod) hand guard and the KeyMod accessory attachment system. The KeyMod accessory mounting system is the new industry standard. KeyMod is a simple, low profile and comfortable mounting alternative to M1913 Picatinny Rail. The standardization of the system will allow direct attachment of accessories without the use of intermediate M1913 rails found on most modular hand guards. The hand guard is a full 15” in length allowing for a large range of accessory placement and shooting styles.

Partnering with other industry leaders allows some the best components to be featured on this rifle. Some of these parts include a Geissele Automatics SSA 2-stage trigger, Surefire SOCOM series suppressor mount muzzle break and Magpul ACS-L buttstock along with a Magpul MOE pistol grip and LR20 PMAG. These features combined create one of the most capable and affordable 308 WIN rifles anywhere.


Caliber: .308 Winchester / 7.62x51mm NATO

Capacity: One 20 round PMAG included

Barrel: 16"" Match Barrel, 416 Stainless Steel, 1:10"" Twist

706,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1824706,For Sale:  Barrett 82A1 82 416 system California,"Alabama, Alabama, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Saturday, June 29, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"If you use the buy now and get full payment to me within 10 days, I'll pick up the shipping on this heavy beast. Don't miss the opportunity. Every one of us dreams of owning the Barrett 82A1. It's one of the ultimate dream guns. It has been featured toward the top of the food chain in the world of guns for 25 years. The design has been steadily refined until it's as proven a system as man can devise. It provides rapid, accurate firepower with untarnished reliability. In late 2004, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division requested a medium/heavy rifle and cartridge combination. The .416 Barrett was designed as an improvement to the .50 BMG using NACA low supersonic drag equations to determine the shape of the projectile. The use of a lighter, narrower bullet results in a significantly higher muzzle velocity and superior ballistic performance to the .50 BMG, supposedly to such a degree that the .416 Barrett retains more energy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. The projectile remains supersonic to out around 2000 yards. That's my typical ground squirrel shooting range. That's why I bought the Barrett. Ha, ha, ha. Heck, I can't even SEE 2000 yards! I saw one ballistic chart that said the Barrett puts a 400gr bullet at 3250fps with a resulting muzzle energy of 9380 foot pounds. That's around twice the .458 Winchester magnum! Those ballistics will provide greater accuracy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. This rifle is brand new in the box. It is chambered in the .416 Barrett. It comes with one 10rd magazine. It is housed in a Pelican 1750 case with a custom moulded interior designed specially for the rifle so it is held securely. This is not a factory California compliant model. If you are in California, you should email me before you bid to discuss compliance work. I included some photos of the rifle with optics mounted just for fun. Those optics are not included in the price of the auction, although they and any others are available if you wish to build a package. I also have spare mags available. I'll try to get a photo of the Leupold Mark 4 with the BORS. That ought to make you salivate! I'm sure you've done your homework and that you know more about the rifle and the cartridge than I do, so I'll let the photos say the remainder. Enjoy the show. If you win the auction, you'll get her quickest if you pay with a postal money order or a bank transfer. Other money orders and anything called a check are fine with me, but they sit ten business days before I ship. I can't do credit or debit cards. I won't do business with PayPal. If PayPal had their way, you wouldn't be able to consider purchasing this rifle. They are opposed to your Second Amendment rights. Don't prostitute yourself to do business with them for the convenience. Take a stand against them and all like them. Drive them out of business! Drive them out of the country! Do it now while resistance doesn't cost you your blood. You'll pay about what UPS charges me. Or, if you use the buy now, I'll pick up the shipping. There are times when multiple targets are to be engaged at extreme distances rapidly. The 82A1 is just about the ultimate tool for that purpose. If you need such a tool or if you've dreamed of developing the skills necessary, this is the opportunity. Thanks for looking over my auctions. Cheers!

Select Cases

Hornady produces most of the brass for Hornady Custom pistol ammo. All other brass is chosen to ensure it meets our unusually high standards for reliable feeding, corrosion resistance, proper hardness and the ability to withstand maximum chamber pressures.

Powder

Each cartridge is loaded to ensure optimal pressure, velocity and consistency from lot to lot.

Primers

Like the powder, each primer is carefully matched to individual loads, and specifically selected for their ability to quickly, completely, and reliably ignite the powder charge.

Depending on the caliber, Hornady handgun ammunition is loaded with Hornady XTP, FMJ-RN, XTP Mag, FTX or FP (flat point)-XTP bullets.

I have equipped this pistol with a Lasermax red laser and belt clip for concealed carry purposes.  I have shot less than 10 rounds and I am the original purchaser.  I have the box, lock, and docs that accompany a new gun.  As you can see from the pics, this is a great little concealed carry gun that is as new as it can get without being bought in a store.  I need something a little lager due to my hands being a little large for this frame.  So, if you have something a little larger and are looking for something more compact, I may be able to add a little cash for the right weapon.  Right now I would prefer to trade but will consider reasonable cash offers.  I'm not going to give it away and would rather see it safely stowed than low balled!   Call or text.
