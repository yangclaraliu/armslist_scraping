The wood has a very high gloss, but does have a few imperfections where the finish has flaked off near the butt of the stock (see photos)and a scratch about 1 1/2"" long at the bass of the forearm that shows a slight sign of cracking (only 1-2mm deep, I can't see it without a hand lens) when you look at the top and inside of the forearm. The safety is currently set up for a left handed shooter, but can easily be changed back for a righty. This is a steal for a Belgium with 2 Belgium barrels.

It is Black in color and shines bright - I have it buffed & waxed twice/year. The paint is in very good condition, and does have some scratches and scrapes that you would expect on a well cared for 2002 truck. It is 4 wheel drive. It has NEW tires with only 3000 miles on them. They are oversized to give it a real truck look. These 265/75R16 tires are 8 ply and will wear very well - they cost $1000 to have them put on. It has a class 4 hitch & wired for a trailer. The truck has an ARE bed cover and it does have some issues. It has some spiderwebbing of the paint, and the trim on one side is coming loose. I considered selling the truck without the cap, but knew someone would probably want it - even with the issues. It has 82,xxx miles and runs very strong. It has the 3.0L V6 and has a lot of power. It has a 5 speed manual transmission. Ford Rangers have two major known issues - the original fuel pump, and the original 4X4 ECM. They were both replaced in the past 18 months. This truck is in excellent shape - I am selling it to buy a small car, as my commute has gotten long with my new job. This is a great truck - you have to see it to see how great of shape it is in. I have an Illinois Title in hand which can be taken to any auto-tag agency and converted to a FL title. (we just moved to Florida) I am looking for $6700 OBO cash.

Specs and link below:

The M2 Tactical is a no-nonsense 12-gauge shotgun that police and military the world over reach for when the going gets tough. The M2 Tactical, like all Benelli semiautomatic shotguns is Inertia Driven, which uses recoil energy to cycle the action. This eliminates all the problems associated with gas-operated systems, such as the necessity of frequent cleaning and the tendency gas-operated systems have for malfunctioning during adverse weather conditions. The M2 Tactical fires all 1º oz. or heavier 2¾"" and 3"" shot loads plus slugs.

The M2 Tactical features a fully adjustable ghost-ring aperture rear sight and military-style fixed-blade front sight or adjustable rifle sights. In addition the M2 Tactical comes with a matte black synthetic stock with tactical pistol grip. The M2 Tactical is a shotgun you can bet your life on.

The rifle is in great condition. The rifle is listed as service grade, but only has a Muzzle erosion of 1 and a Throat erosion of 2. In my opinion, this is the highest level of service grade you can find. This rifle was hand picked by me last year at the CMP store in Anniston Alabama. I spend two days looking through hundreds of rifles to find this one. The barrel is stamped 5-54 for a May 1954 date. The cartouche marks are clear and crisp. The wood is in great shape and has a few knicks and small dents but NO cracks or defects. 
THE best part of all is that ALL OF THE RIFLE PARTS ARE HRA. There is no mix match of HRA and Springfield parts like you see on so many USGI M1 Garands. Thats right, every part from the barrel to the bolt, op rod, trigger group, and sights are ALL HRA. This is an amazing find. I do not believe the rifle was ever rebuilt. 
I am including the green hard plastic case from the CMP, along with all CMP paperwork to the buyer of this rifle. I am also including 200 rounds of 30-06 Ball ammo from the CMP and 5 enblock clips.
Please email me or call me if you have any questions. My lack of photographic skills does not do justice to this amazing rifle. The only reason I am selling it is because of some unforeseen medical bills that  taken priority right now.

*Sells for $47+ shipping brand new from Remora

If you are not familiar with Remora holsters, they are IWB holsters with a tacky outside material.  This allows you to place the holster in between your body and your pants with zero movement, zero printing, and no visible belt loop straps.  You can literally jump, run, crawl, and the holster will not move.  This particular model is tuckable (meaning there is a flap to tuck a shirt and still be able to draw quickly) with a detachable belt clip if you feel it necessary (it is not necessary).  I also opted for the leather lined model for a quick draw and the thinnest possible profile.

I purchased this with the intention of carrying while wearing formal business attire once the IL CCW license is made available.  However, I failed to realize that my company prohibits carrying on/near/during work.  As a result, I'm keeping my non-tuckable Remora holster for personal use and selling this one."

I do not believe this gun has ever been fired.  It has one small blemish on outside of barrel, small dot of rust or corrosion smaller than dime and very light. This in no way effects performance and is probably do to long term storage with a finger print. Aside from this spot gun is perfect and brand new/unfired.  Ready to provide a lifetime of dependable hunting and shooting. Fires 2.75"" 3"" and 3.5"" Loads for duck, goose, and turkey performance.

Dealer appraised last week for $400 in its current condition. Save $150 from retail store pricing.

My goal is to trade or sell this gun to get a small compact carry pistol of high quality.  Would love to trade for a XDS 9 mm, or similar compact pistol. Let me know what you got. also have a .40 hi point pistol or cash to trade with shotgun for the right concealed carry pistol.

4 assisted opening knives in brand new condition.

SOG Flash II Assisted Opening Knife Black Zytel (3.5"" Black Serr) 
This Flash II (TFSA-98) has an AUS-8 stainless steel blade with a partially serrated edge and a black TiNi finish. The lightweight black glass-reinforced nylon handle is durable and features a diamond non-slip texture. 
The SOG Flash II represents super quality at an affordable price. Automatic knives not your thing? Try a spring assisted knife! As you push the thumb stud SOG's Spring Assisted Technology (S.A.T.) takes over and smoothly and quickly deploys the blade. The Flash II blade is easy to release from the open position with the sliding button on the handle that disengages the piston lock mechanism. Another great feature on the Flash II is the side mounted safety tab to prevent a misfire. The SOG Flash is a great EDC with a reversible pocket clip for tip-up carry.

CRKT Carson M16-12ZER Emergency Rescue Zytel Folding Tanto Knife (3"" Satin Serr)
The Kit Carson designed CRKT M16-12ZER Emergency Rescue is a tough mid-sized every day carry (EDC) knife for emergency services with high visibility orange Zytel scales. The InterFrame handle has 420J2 stainless steel liners and CRKT's AutoLAWKS knife safety, which automatically actuates when the blade is open making it a virtual fixed blade. The handle has skeletonized black Zytel scales and a tip-down pocket clip. 
The CRKT M16-12ZER features a hollow ground Tanto style blade with a high satin finish and a partially serrated edge. The blade is easily opened with the dual thumb studs or a push of the Carson Flipper. The Teflon bearings at the blade pivot and an adjustable pivot screw allow for perfect blade action.

Boker Kalashnikov Automatic Knife Acid Green w/ Bowie Blade (3.35"") satin plain.
This Kalashnikov knife features an exclusive bowie clip-point blade. This limited edition knife has satin finished blade, hardware and pocket clip. The AUS8 stainless steel blade holds a razor sharp blade and can tackle just about anything thrown its way. 
The ergonomically shaped handle is acid greenfinished aluminum with molded finger grips and jimping where the handle and blade meet. The design is thin, elegant and comfortable. The action of this knife is first rate. As with other Kalashnikov knives, this knife comes with a pocket clip for easy tip-up carry. 
Limited run, with serial number on blade. 

Boker Orange S2 Knife Sniper Bladeworks Folder (4"" Plain) Limited Edition
This Boker S2 with Orange G-10 scales is a Blade HQ exclusive and limited to just 600 numbered pieces! Numbered 1/600, 2/600 etc. 
The S2 is a collaboration between Boker and Sniper Bladeworks. The knife was designed by Lance Abernathy, a former SWAT member, and features the handiwork of Jody Muller, knifemaker for the past 20 years. This team designs tactical folders of a slightly different kind. 
The S2 is unique due to its wide, completely flat ground 440C steel blade, which provides phenomenal cutting performance. The slim handle sits comfortably in your hand and guarantees perfect control. In addition, the thumb ramp and the flipper protect against slipping of the finger. The structured G-10 scales on steel plates offer maximum stability and a very secure grip.

Cold Steel Safe Keeper III Fixed Blade Push Knife 
Here are perhaps the finest production push knives in almost 150 years. They have the cutting and piercing potential of a larger knife, but are small enough so that they can be easily attached to tactical web gear, tucked in a waistband or boot top, or even strapped to a wrist or ankle. 
The Safe Keeper® III offers outstanding versatility, especially as a boot knife. Its light weight and overall length of five inches make it the perfect combination of small size and big performance. The single edged design of the Safe Keeper® III means you can safely ""choke up"" on the blade for extra fine work, while the false edge provides superior point strength. With only one sharp edge, the Safe Keeper® III can double as a rescue knife. 

Cold Steel Urban Pal Push Knife (1.5"" Satin Serr) 
The Urban Pal from Cold Steel is designed for everyday use. Weighing in at just 3/4 of an ounce, it's perfectly at home in a pocket or purse and can be easily attached to a key ring, or hung around the neck. The AUS 8A stainless steel blade has a serrated cutting edge while the unique handle allows you to really put your weight into its point or edge. The Urban Pal includes a Secure-Ex sheath."

It is all original and has not been touched in anyway since it left the storied Izhevsk Armory.  The folding bayonet, characteristic of the M44 is still attached and in perfect working condition. It also comes with its original sling.  It has a solid bore with no pitting, deep rifling and all matching serial numbers! It feeds flawlessly and does not suffer from ""Sticky bolt syndrome"". 

It is an excellent shooter and the open sights are sighted in accurately.A must have for 7.62x54r fans. The shorter, carbine length makes it an extremely maneuverable and easy to carry rifle, that still has the power and accuracy of the 7.62x54r cartridge. I love it to death, but need the money.

Only about 1,850 of the SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the U.S. and that includes military/police and civilian use. Now about 89 these were changed to a fixed stock version with a smaller 6 round mag vs the pre 89 which were 8 round and collapsible stock. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide, on the civilian market it has been featured in films, several video games and of course TV shows. The coolest feature is the ability to switch from pump to semi automatic. Now as far as military or police applications this allows lower impact rounds such as tear gas bean bags or rubber bullets which generally do not create enough gas pressure to cycle a round allowing the user the ability to manually extract and reload. But in civilian sector especially home defense mode this gun can be stored without a round in the chamber and as you are aware there isn't a criminal anywhere on earth that doesn't know the very distinct sound of a pump shotgun loading a round...... can you say asshole pucker effect. The coolest thing is that once you pump it once it can instantly be in semi auto so if you miss your target on the first shot the criminal may stick his stupid ass head up thinking you forgot to pump the shotgun to reload, bang he's dead. This has only been fired 20-25 times it has been in climate controlled storage in a gun safe since mid 80's this is the roughest toughest shotgun anywhere."

Located near Hwy 50 & 27 

The price below is less than what the gun cost so if you can buy it cheaper go ahead.....but this is what it legitimately cost so with me your saving tax and FFL fee and paperwork and waiting in line to buy.  No Felons. Must be 21 and FL resident.   



Asking $725.    The gun was a little over $600. The tru glo nt sites were $99. With gunsmith and tax it was just under $800 total. 

Have 300 rds of Winchester .45 auto target ammo that was $135 and will sell it for that price to gun buyer only.  



3 mags. Box, lock, papers, extra grip extension pieces......everything it comes with new

If you don't here from me in 30 minutes via text 8am-9pm. I didn't get email so resend.  

Low ballers ignored. Please don't ask my bottom line. Looking for offers.  


It's too big for my hand.  


FTF must pick up in Clermont.  

FL DL required. CWP takes priority  


Only trades I would consider toward it would be a Glock 26 or 27 Gen 4 in OD.  That's like a desert sand color. Must have extras like 3.5 trigger, extended slide release n such or will need cash difference.  Open to other Gen 4's but have to really be in my favor. 

Maybe a Kimber, Smith, Sig or other cool 1911 that is a great deal or (p938 or p238 lower cost models) Plus cash )or other cool tactical weapon.  I can add other ammo to make up difference if a little more. Not looking for any real high end guns unless price is close to mine. 

If you have something else cool to trade that you gotta great deal on that is too good to pass up. I might consider. No Taurus or keltec or junk  

I can't add cash but possibly some ammo or misc gun accessories if yours is a little higher.  


Also have ammo for sale or to trade

What am I hoping for? Mostly cash, but I would also be interested in taking an SKS or AK on trade as long as they came with cash and/or rounds. No handguns please, no shot guns either, or deer rifles. Would love an M1-Garand as well."
