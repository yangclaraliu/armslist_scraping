""The Vinci SuperSport guarantees superb performance in hunting and clay shooting (sporting clays). The stock incorporates the latest ComforTech Plus technology, and recoil, vibration and muzzle climb are minimised by compensation holes at the end of the barrel. The carbon fibre finish on the stock and receiver give this semi-automatic a unique, high-tech look. The SuperSport features a bolt with a special, high density plastic insert that guarantees excellent performance even with low shot loads. The shotgun comes with an easy to replace internal/external knurled choke fitted. As with all Vinci models, anatomic combs and recoil pads allow users to customise their firearm to suit their own preferences."" Shoots 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. Reason for selling: I love the gun and it has worked extremelly well for me in competitions when I started clay target shooting. I have since upgraded to a over and under and my need for the Benelli has dwindled. Would much rather like to have a gun that can shoot 3 1/2"" shells when I go geese/turkey/duck hunting. I would guess that it has been through no more than 2,000 rounds. But like all Benellis it works flawlessly. Finish is still great, has a very minor scratch on the barrel."

I can share some tips and tricks if you buy it from me.  No FFL required.

I dont know anything more than that about the personal history of this revolver.  From what I have read it was pressed into service in WW2.There were 50,617 Commandos made and sold to the government from 1942-1945. This one was probably made in 1943
This Commando does have the standard Colt inspectors stamps and the Colt ""Verified Proof"" stamp of a ""VP"" in a triangle on the left front trigger guard web.
The serial number was stamped in standard Colt form of the number stamped on the frame just below the barrel where the cylinder crane seats, on the cylinder crane, and inside the side plate.

521,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8320521,For Sale/Trade:  Chevy S-10,"Columbus, Indianapolis, Indiana","$ 1,000","Listed On: Saturday, May 5, 2018",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Ok guys, so here’s the scoop. I’ve never listed a non firearm related item on here before and I’m sure many will recongnize my number because I list guns almost daily on here. Anyway, I work a tow business and I have acquired some extra vehicles that I’m not in need of and figured what could be better then turning them into some firearms to add to my collection. I have a 1995 Chevy S-10. It has a 2.2L 4-cylinder and a 5 speed transmission. It is all around a dam good little truck. It has some slight rust and a dent in the fender. The interior is a little dirty but in excellent condition. AC and everything on the truck works properly. It has a CD player with an amp and subwoofer behind the seat. The previous owner just spent a lot of money last month having a brand new Cylinder Head, Valves, Cam, and Timing chain installed as well as new brake lines. When you pop the hood you can look at the engine and automatically tell that everything up top is brand spanking new. The clutch went out so he kept trying to drive it and junked the transmission and that’s when I purchased it from him. I pulled a tranny out of a totaled 94 S-10 that only had 80k miles and installed a brand new clutch, pressure plate, throw out bearing when I put the new tranny in. The truck itself has 140k miles on it and anyone that knows these little trucks know they will push 250k-300k miles with ease as long as they are maintained. It will make someone a dam nice little gas saver to drive back and fourth. I’m looking to get $1,000 trade value out of it. I like anything from Glocks to 1911’s, AR’s, AR Pistols, AK’s. If it’s something you would be interested in checking out just shoot me a text at 812-374-4908 and I can give you further details and more pictures. My name is Charles by the way. Also the truck does have a single line crack across the windshield and very good matching tires all the way around. I think that’s about everything I can think of off the top of my head. Oh and YES it does have a CLEAN AND CLEAR TITLE ready to be signed. Thanks."

I bought it to be my hunting rifle but I'm just going to use my semi. I have only put 40 rounds through it so it's still in good condition. Still has the sticker on the bottom. Bought it last year around may I think. Can come with or without the scope for +/- 100 dollars. Now the bad. I didn't realize that the rest I used to zero the scope had a piece of metal sticking out which wore out some of the blueing on the under side of the barrel. Not horribly scratched or anything. Just a little worn. I also have a sig saur red dot that I have listed that can go with it for the right trade.So 550 for the rifle, red dot and scope.300 for just the gun. 350 trade. Or if we trade everything 600.I paid 850 for everything.I'm working on getting the finish re-blued. The price will go up after it's re-blued. Great gun and accurate. I just can't see myself using this where I hunt. I did take the scope off to try and use the scope on another rifle so if you get the scope just know that you will have to re-zero it.For a quick response text 217-390-4127"
