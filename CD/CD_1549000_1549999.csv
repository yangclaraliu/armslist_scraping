There was a time when high-volume shooters bought steel-cased cartridges to save money, only to discover that lacquer coating on the cases gummed up chambers. You’ll have no such worries with this ammunition. MFS uses a special zinc plating on its cartridge cases that won’t impede the performance of your firearm or foul the chamber.

I put time (and a good amount of money) into this rifle when I bought her, the gun is like new, I only put 50 rounds down the pipe for sighting in the scope and then put her in the safe, well things have changed and I think I'm ready to let her go. I'm willing to sell her out right but I also wouldn't mind trading,If your interested please research the rifle, scope, and bi-pod this is not your run of the mill bushmaster as for the scope and bi-pod there not cheap either, this model is rare and not a standard AR I know the market is flooded but this is a competition AR not a standard model with cheap add ons...I'm a reasonable guy and I respect reasonable offers...thanks."

Action is tight and on face showing lots of case coloring. Stocks are in excellent condition with pachmayr recoil pad. Chambers measure 2 9/16 however, it will shoot 2¾ 1oz. field loads with absolutely no problems and will be well within designed pressure. This gun has a clean bill of health however, buyer is responsible for safe operation. This gun came from a Gunsmith that has over 50+ years of experience so if the buyer wants to pay an extra $100 dollars I will have him lengthen the forcing cones if desired. Lengthening the forcing cones is the responsible and in my opinion the best way to upgrade older shotguns to pattern better with star crimp shells.

It performed wonderfully.  It is a great pistol and accurate.  I love the pistol, but I am moving and need to fund my move.  Cash only.

Description:  The SIG Mosquito is a blowback-operated, semi-automatic pistol based on the SIG Sauer P226, but 10% smaller in size and chambered for the .22 LR cartridge. The pistol is manufactured with an aluminum-zinc alloy slide and polymer frame. The controls are similar to those present on full-size models and include (from front to rear) a left takedown lever, a left decocking lever, reversible magazine catch and ambidextrous manual safety. In addition, the pistol is provided with an integral safety lock located at the rear of the magazine well which when enabled prevents cycling of slide, hammer fall, and trigger action.  It has a double-action/single-action (DA/SA) trigger. Single action trigger pull is 4.4 lbs while Double-action is 12.4 lbs. The polymer frame and small size (compared to the SIG P226) allow the pistol with magazine to weigh little more than 24.6 oz. The overall height is 5.3 inches with a barrel length of 3.9 inches. The Mosquito's frame has an accessory rail, a ten-round capacity magazine, and adjustable sights.

Includes: Sig Sauer Mosquito with threaded barrel; original case; paperwork; package with extra sights, spring, and tool; two magazines; Sig Sauer polymer bridgemount; factory lock; tennis racket bag (same as the ones commonly used to carry Sig rifles with folding stocks).

Description:  SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required.

It is in perfect condition and perfect working order. The last two times I've had it to the range were both a lot of fun. The last time I had some targets that had 3 squirrels on them about the size of your hand. Me and the two fellows working that night had a squirrel shoot out at 25 yards. One of the guys, who shoots better than I ever will, put all 10 rounds in that little squirrel. I got 5 in and 5 close. At 25 yards the front sight was bigger than the whole squirrel. The time before that I shot the Mark II was for my Carry Conceal Class. Why you ask. 1st because they said I could, 2nd because I got to smile when I put all 25 rounds in the little square in the middle of the target's chest and 3rd it cost me 1.25 in Ammo. Guess I could have used my 1911 and spent 15.00 for ammo, but it seemed like overkill at the time. Gun has fully adjustable rear sights and is in A+ excellent condition. These are getting harder to find and you won't find one in better shape than this one. I'm kind of looking for a good revolver. Preferably something with sights, but I'm open to inquires. I have 2 other .22 pistols I can shoot, so being this is the best one of the lot I'm looking for some trade value. e-mail, or feel free to call me @ REDACTED."

Unlike most other MP15's this one has the 4150, Chrome Moly Vanadium (CMV) Barrel steel not just the 4140 Chrome Moly steel as is common with many other MP15's.
It also has the Co-branded Smith and Magpul lower receiver.

It features a lot of attention to detail, such as the flared magazine well for fast magazine insertions.
The larger trigger guard and the serrated magazine well.
Also F-marked Front sight post and Bayonet Lug.

This Smith saw 90 rds for test and Zero that's it!
Afterwards perfectly cleaned and thoroughly oiled.

No wear marks from shooting to be found anywhere on this gun, it simply cannot be told from NIB unfired!

I have never registered this gun for warranty with Smith and Wesson and never claimed my active duty discount so you might still be able to register the warranty, I dont know...
MP15's are good gun this is IMO this is THE BEST version of the MP15! The best receiver the best barrel steel!

Gun was bought in January of this year, it breaks my heart to sell it, but i have too many AR's.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm."

It has an Alpen Optics Kodiak scope on it with see-through mounts and fiber optic sights."

Beginning and veteran shooters alike will enjoy the extraordinary versatility this firearm offers,  It's a single-shot shotgun, centerfire rifle and rimfire rifle all in one.

The shotgun barrel has a front brass bead sight. Outfitted with a weatherproof synthetic stock and ventilated rubber recoil pad, there's a removable raised cheekpiece on the buttstock to adjust the gun's fit. Custom carry case included.
This is a youth model great for first shooting experience. I have fired 6 rds from shotgun and 5 from .243,Have not used the .22. Found a adult sized stock that works for me and it is included. Price is firm"

Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. ""Blind"" magazine exchange The magazine buttons are positioned above the trigger guard and can be operated „blindly“. When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5?+?1 Standard: 4?+?1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor:"

About 1 year old
About 250 Rounds through it. The P220 Compact is a 6+1 capacity pistol featuring the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail frame and extended magazine base for a stronger grip. The new beavertail frame design allows the shooter to access his or her grip from the holster with confidence even under the stressful conditions. The extended magazine floorplate lengthens the grip just enough to provide a firm grip for even large handed shooters. Topping the Compact frame is a shorter, “commander-length” slide housing a 3.9” cold hammer forged barrel. Like all P220 pistols, the Compact features a rock solid lock up and superb out-of-the-box accuracy and performs above and beyond because the SIG SAUER® design allows for unparalleled performance regardless of bullet type or weight. In a world full of concealed carry options, the P220 Compact’s improved ergonomics, slim profile and shorter slide and frame, make the pistol an ideal choice. And with the SIG name you know that when it comes to protecting your life you’re backed by a standard of excellence unmatched in the firearms world.

NIGHTFORCE MODEL: C237
The top choice for law enforcement snipers. A large objective lens increases resolution and exit pupil size for rapid target acquisition and optimal light performance in twilight conditions…an especially useful configuration for tactical teams that may not have dedicated night vision. This superior optical design also benefits hunters and sport shooters who want to maximize their success in low-light environments. A large field of view, 110 MOA of adjustment and a practical magnification range make this an ideal riflescope for both snipers and sportsmen. ***The 3.5-15x56NXS is being discontinued and currently has limited availability"

I bought this thinking it was the CCI mini-mag 1600 round ammo can (I didn't even know they sold a bulk ammo can of stingers).

While my SR22 will shoot this stuff just fine I prefer the ultra cheap bulk 22lr ammo. I thought about just keeping it and using it when I run out of my cheap 22 ammo but I'd rather trade for cheap bulk 22lr or sell it and put the money towards my HK45T or put it towards 9mm ammo that I've been paying double for lately.

This 900rd can is selling online for $335-$375, I'm asking $190 and I'm throwing in a 100 pack of CCI MiniMag HP to make it 1,000 rounds of 22LR Hollow Point ammo.

Here are the CCI Stinger 22 LR specs:
1640 feet/sec, 32 grain hollow point bullet, clean-burning propellants keep actions cleaner, sure-fire CCI priming, reusable plastic box with dispenser lid, nickel plated brass cases, copper plated hollow point bullets.

Here are the CCI MiniMag 22 LR HP specs:
1260 feet/sec, 36 grain hollow point bullet, reusable plastic box with dispenser lid, brass cases, copper plated hollow point bullets.

$190 for all 1,000 rounds and plastic ammo can. Cash only, must be at least 21 years old to buy, no shipping. I prefer a trade for bulk but will sell.

I'd do a trade for bulk 22lr, I prefer the CCI blazer 525 value packs, but I also like the fed 525 blue box packs, win 555 packs and last choice is golden bullet 525 packs. I'd do an even up trade for 5 bulk boxes."

Have a carbine, pistol in the same caliber, with plenty of ammo to use. Makes a perfect home defense setup and only 1 caliber to try to find. Before I get the hater mail for them being Hi-Points, I'll break down the prices. $550 for the Carbine, $250 for the pistol, and $300 for the ammo. I know I didn't pay that much for them and inflation sucks, but SKS's used to go for $89 each and AK's went for $300 tops, and 5.56/.223 used to be under .25 cents per rd. So by those prices, the inflation on Hi-Points are well below the average of the other over priced guns and ammo. The reason for this rant is to curb the socialist freaks out there that just because the prices are not where they think they should be, then I am a horrible person and should automatically sell to them for what I paid 5 years ago. Sorry I don't fit your socialist model, everything is not about you... I have not had any of the usual problems that Hi-Points are always rumored to have. These go bang when you pull the trigger. I would like to sell them together, but will sell the Carbine for $550 and the pistol for $250.  Will not sell the ammo separate. Not really interested in trades at the moment, need the cash. I can take additional pics if requested. Thanks for looking."
