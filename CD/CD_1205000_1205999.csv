These improved C Products Defense 10-Round AR Magazines feature a 2-Piece Stainless Steel Body that is snapped together and mechanically locked before welding, ensuring a straight-walled, highly consistent product that reliably drops free from variously sized magazine wells and allows for smooth movement of the follower during its travel. The magazines are further enhanced by the use of a corrosion resistant Stainless Steel Spring and Anti-Tilt Follower. The finish is a durable matte black coating that is resistant to the elements and slightly self-lubricating. In addition to being perfect for shooters in states with magazine capacity restrictions or for hunting purposes, the low profile of these 10-round magazines also makes them ideal for use when firing from the prone position. For use in AR chambered in 7.62x39mm only."

She is a safe queen and due to some unexpected vehicle issues, i need to sell some things to re-coop some of the costs, so this got picked. I got this 1911 and another un-fired pistol in a trade a while back for an AR and I only got around to shooting this once. The pistol was brand new and never fired before I got it. There have been no more than probably 40 or 50 rounds through it. 

This gun is in immaculate condition as you can see by the pictures. There are no scratches or wear marks on it what so ever. Included in the auction are the (2) brand new stainless factory magazines, the factory Gear 11 gun and magazine belt holsters pictured, as well as (4) new Mecgar 8rnd magazines w/ polymer followers. The polymer followers make for much smoother and more reliable feeding of rounds. These were loaded with ammo for home defense, but never fired. Installed are Hogue wrap around overmolded grips, but I also am including the factory Cocobolo Wood grips. 

Here is a list of the factory specs:

Carry Bevel treatment, high hand beavertail grip safety, dove tail front sight, premuim fixed rear sight with Tritium 3-dot inserts, torx head grip screws and lightweight adjustable speed trigger.

There are a few extras in the reloading equipment that I have not listed as they are relatively small potatoes in the deal.



Your question of how many rounds have been through the barrel on the 06.  I don't know exactly.  But the barrel is stainless and the bullets are molycoated.  There has been no evidence of copper buildup or fouling of any kind.  I would estimate about 400 rounds have gone through the barrel with no change in the accuracy.




The target scope has a lifetime warrantee and the original box will come with the deal.




As I said before, I will be happy if this will net me $1600.

Thank you for signing the petition opposing the Democrats’ gun control package currently being debated in the Colorado General Assembly. On Monday, hundreds of Coloradans showed up to testify against these extreme measures. 

While they passed committee on a party-line vote, the battle isn’t over. These bills will be debated in the Senate, this Friday, March 8th, and the vote is going to be close. This is why we need you to act immediately!

The lower for this upper is a NFA multi cal lower! functions flawlessly! It's one of the best round I've personally seen that has half the recoil of a 308 with better accuracy of a 308!

The Lower is Brand new! & the upper i bought used but it was in fantastic shape! Where the original owner only fired 10 shots through it! And I've only fired 5 shots through it (Just for function purposes)!! So the barrel has not even been broke in! So whoever buys this will have to take it to the range for a day to properly break in the barrel."

Thank you for signing the petition opposing the Democrats’ gun control package currently being debated in the Colorado General Assembly. On Monday, hundreds of Coloradans showed up to testify against these extreme measures. 

While they passed committee on a party-line vote, the battle isn’t over. These bills will be debated in the Senate, this Friday, March 8th, and the vote is going to be close. This is why we need you to act immediately!

As Mark Christian stated, ""These rifles are not clones, they are the real thing"". 

Years ago HK set up a Greek company(Hellenic Arms) with HK tooling and HK trained techs to make HK91's.These were imported by Springfield Armory as SAR3's.When the 89 ban hit the ones that were in the process of being imported were restamped SAR8's––these are called overstamps.SAR3's and SAR8 overstamps are equal to true HK91's in most everybodys opinion."

Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.
GLOCK compensator pistols are equipped with an integrated compensator, rendering the weapon even more controllable during rapid fire and allowing an improved hit pattern. The compensator consists of two longitudinal openings in the barrel and slide of the pistol arranged in ""V-position"". This minimizes front sight blackening through powder gases.

These were produced for Lew Horton back in the 90's. The pictures below are of my actual one. The one pic has a glare and makes it look like there is discoloration but there isn't. There was a total of 350 made and someone I talked to said there were only 250ish ever shipped. I have no idea if that is true or not. Anyways, this is a great gun but I am more into buy for purpose not collecting.  It has a 3.5"" barrel, and the complete pistol is in a black matte finish. Top slide marked ""Tank Officers 45ACP"" on left. ""Officer’s ACP"" on right. Completely parkerized from top to bottom. It comes with original wood grips, after market black grips, and mag. I also have it sitting in a 1450 Pelican Case and can make part of the deal I suppose. Let me know if you have any questions. Was told that with original case, extra mag, and paperwork I could get $1300 but since I am missing those things I am looking for something worth $1100."
