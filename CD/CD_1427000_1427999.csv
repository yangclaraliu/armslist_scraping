Cruise the local waterways in comfort without hauling along a full-size kayak with the Sevylor QuikPak K3 covered sit-on-top inflatable kayak. The word kayak was originally translated to mean ""hunter's boat."" 


The QuikPak K3 sit-on-top kayak includes a dual-action hand pump for easy inflation.
Sevylor's inflatable kayaks and canoes contribute to people's wanderlust by gracefully slicing through lakes or whitewaters, letting boaters hunt for the day's catch or hidden waterways. The K3 kayak is one of Sevylor's grab-and-go kayaks, with an inflatable design that folds and stores in an integrated backpack storage system. When you arrive at the river, just unpack and inflate the kayak and you're ready to go. Despite the inflatable build, the K3 is extremely tough, with an inner hull made of heavy-duty, cold-resistant PVC material and double I-beam construction. The boat's electronically welded seams and super-durable fabric reinforced bottom also add to the K3's longevity, with an AirTight system that's guaranteed not to leak. Best of all for regular kayakers, the K3 is seriously comfortable, with a soft sit-on-top seat and a built-in footrest.

LOOKING FOR PARTIAL TRADE FOR SIG P228 9mm

STG-556 in near new condition. This is an absolutely fantastic little rifle and of the 200-400 rounds I have never had a single problem. This rifle is no longer manufactured by MSAR and with the looming probability of a new assault weapons ban they are going to become rather hard to find.

This particular STG-556 features an 20"" quick detach barrel, forward assist, and is capable of right or left handed ejection. Aside from the newer AR style features this rifle is an exact clone of the famous Steyr AUG A2. I personally think it is an improvement.

it comes with a Bushnell T-Dot sight and 5 30 round MSAR magazines. The rifle has been maintained to the highest standards and is guaranteed to be in perfect clean condition upon transfer. It takes both MSAR and Steyr AUG polymer magazines, I know some people would consider this a flaw but I personally find them vastly superior to the NATO STANAG mags.

It also ships with original box, manual, and associated papers.

Model: 590A1 

Caliber: 12 Guage 

The Model 590 is a workhorse pump action shotgun intended for use in harsh and dirty conditions, such as waterfowl hunting or combat. The Model 590 series is designed to be easy to clean and maintain. This shotgun has an aluminum trigger guard and safety, and a heavier barrel, as it was intended for military use under extreme conditions and rough handling. Wrapping your right hand around the stock with your pointer finger pointed down the barrel, each of the needed controls are in the perfect place. By controls I am talking about the safety and the action release. The safety is right on the top of the receiver. Move your thumb slightly from the natural grip around the stock and the safety is easily manipulated. The Action Release, which enables you to open the action without firing the shotgun, is manipulated loosening your grip and moving your middle finger slightly rearward. 

The M590A1 features a bayonet lug and an Ontario M9 Bayonet to go with it. The bayonet has a hard scabbard. The M590A1 also boasts a picatinny rail.

Ideally suited for informal target shooting, ""plinking,"" small game hunting and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. The 10/22 is still today‚Äôs most popular 22 rifle. It looks right, feels right, shoots right and continues to perform under heavy use - inspiring the most fanatical loyalty from its owners. With proven design, legendary reliability and the modern features demanded by today‚Äôs 22 LR shooters, these firearms are priced right to make keeping tradition affordable.

Look no further! The Ruger 10/22 is truly a joy to shoot. Its supremely accurate, easy to use and maintain and above all it is chambered in 22LR so you can plink for hours and not break the bank.

The stock is custom with an adjustable dual-rod cheek rest and a Freeland Rail in the forestock.  The barrel is custom made, approximately 22 inches long and 1 1/4 inches in diameter, and IS free-floated.  This is an extremely solid barrel for long range accuracy.  It is a Savage long action and has a top-feed/internal magazine.  The current weight is almost exactly 13 lbs.  It does come with the scope rings as seen in the pictures.

This rifle is worth well over $1,000-1,200, and I am very hesitant on letting it go especially at the listed price, but I have another long range .308 and recently got an AR-30 in .300 WinMag, so this rifle is taking a back seat to those rifles.

Caliber: 22LR 



John Browning developed the 1911, possibly the most famous handgun in the world. GSG developed its 1911 in the .22LR caliber while staying true to Browning‚Äôs original design. GSG manufactured the firearm with a strict adherence to the existing design and measurements. Because of this, they were able to maintain ‚ÄúMil-Spec‚Äù specifications. At the same time, GSG added a magazine safety, drop safety and firing pin safety to meet present safety standards. 

With the cost of ammunition sky-high these days This firearm represents an economical way to get used to the feel of a full sized 1911 without breaking the bank on .45 rounds. Plinking never sounded so good!

RPB (which has been rumored to stand for Rape, Pillage, and Burn... but actually stands for the initials of the company founders) manufactured the only semi auto open bolt variety of the M10 ever made, most were stamped ""sM10"" but a very few were made with the model stamped as ""sapM10"" (an abbreviation for semi auto pistol) These few are the only open bolt M10's which are not banned as assault weapons by the state of CA. This is a very rare variant of an extremely hard to come by pistol.

In 1979, Wayne Daniel manufactured a semi auto only version and somehow (miraculously, I still don't know how he pulled it off) was able to get the BATFE to approve it as a Title 1 firearm i.e. a 'Regular' gun. The open bolt semi auto M10 pistol manufactured by RPB were initially made using surplus SMG parts bought from Military Armaments Corporation when they went out of buisness in 1978.

The period of manufacture was short lived however as in 1982 - the BATFE reversed its decision on approving the open bolt semi auto guns when it was found that they were easily converted to full auto. Effective June 21st 1982, any new M10's made as open bolt pistols were to be considered Title 2 firearms (i.e. machine guns)....

These were produced for less than 3 years and can never be made again.

In case you don't believe that there is any way this can be legal please read the following text of the ATF decision rule 82-2 which banned any more of these from being made but (luckily for you) allowed the ones already in circulation to be grandfathered.

This is sold as a unique collectible pistol, you are responsible for complying with all state and federal laws (i.e. don't do anything illegal with it, to it, around it. Don't think illegal thoughts, don't contemplate any hypothetical, don't ask any SHTF questions, and don't discuss anything nefarious even as a joke...) 

Now to business... I really dont want to sell but i will test the waters here.. i would have to see at least 2000 in trade value. I am interested in all kinds of stuff, so try me. 1900 in cash would probably take it home. Again, this is a RARE OPEN BOLT, PRE BAN mac 10 in 9mm, with two mags. message me or text me at 615 ninehundred 673 four."

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‚Äò3-dot‚Äô sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it‚Äôs either positively ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff‚Äù. The safety lever also functions as the pistol‚Äôs decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual‚Äôs hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.

11. Barrrel: The Px4‚Äôs unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction).

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol is the most advanced sub-compact sidearm of its kind. Built around Beretta‚Äôs latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. The Px4 Storm Sub- Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system.

A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant, perfectly suited for concealment close to active, perspiring bodies.The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable backstraps (included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters.

A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller and larger size button (optional). An interchangeable slide catch can also be replaced with an optional low-profile configuration. A standard Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD- 1913) allows for an array of aftermarket accessories.

PF-9
The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

 PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
      The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

I have done extensive testing with the 307 GNR and it performs flawlessly. The 284 GNR works fine, but some of the shorter lighter weight 7mm bullets are hard to find these days so only preliminary testing has been done on it. As more and more 7mm bullets become available I will be doing more testing on it. The 307 GNR will be a bit more power than the 300 GNR plus you don't have to do the cutting, trimming and such that is required on the 300 GNR. The downside is that a Ruger stretch frame revolver is required for the conversion. The good thing is that the Ruger 357 Maximum revolvers are easier to get and cheaper than in recent past."

This gun was made in the mid 90s and is an ex-Swiss law-enforcement weapon. It was once issued to an officer of their State Police or Highway Patrol. The slide is the heavier milled stainless steel part instead of the earlier stamped one, and has the Swiss canton regional crest(Vaud) on the left side. Since it was an issued weapon there is some finish wear, but this doesn't affect anything. In fact I think it gives the gun some character. With the pistol comes 5 high capacity mags: 3 factory 15-rounders(including one '94 Ban-era 'zipper-back'), a new Mec/Gar 17-rounder, and a Mec/Gar 20 round mag. If you are left-handed I will include a kydex OWB holster by Shadow Holsters of Minnesota. Ammo in the mag pic not included."

This is a pretty rare and kind of difficult gun to get your hands on. The .308s are common but the Magnums are hard to find. I have not seen another magnum for sale on armslist, gunbroker, or gunsamerica. The rifle is built to the same specs as the Army's M24. Heavy target/tactical synthetic stock, 26"" heavy barrel, glass bedded. I have had an improved extractor installed, lightweight one piece titanium base and rings by Nightforce will come on the rifle, deceleration pad to help w/ recoil, excellent trigger, and foam lined hard case with wheels. This rifle is not a run of the mill standard rifle. In the right hands this is a very capable sniper rifle effective to easily 1200M. I am a retired Army veteran who attended the US Army sniper school and have used this as my personal rifle of choice. I have shot 1/4MOA groups with this setup. Easily the most accurate rifle I've ever owned. Shot 80 rounds of Black Hills 190gr HPBT match ammo through it. I really love the gun but I just haven't shot it as much as I would like to. I am open to trades, but cash is king. $1300 will get you an excellent rifle capable of long range target shooting or hunting.

This model also comes with a pistol grip for more close quarters, identical to the sort of nylon molded grips used by the Mossberg Persuader series.  Also included is some ammunition, mostly defensive loads which are as follows:

23 rounds of Federal 00 Military Grade Buckshot 
23 rounds of Royal #4 Bucksho
10 rounds of Winchester PDX 00 Buck with 1 oz slugs
10 Federal Law Enforcement Slugs 1 oz
5 Remington 1 oz slugs

Also included is a specialized side saddle that is actually detachable via velcro, but remains rock solid while moving, which holds five rounds.  Each individual card will fit in a standard rifle magazine holder on a tactical vest or in whatever setup you're going for.  Cash is certainly king, but feel free to email me with further questions.  I guarantee you will not find a better deal given the scarcity of some defensive loads around these parts."

This is the Hi-Capacity version with capabilities of holding 10rd's per magazine or even 12 if you purchase or modify the right magazine (according to your state law)

It is chambered in 9x18Mak. The condition is quite good for a pistol of its estimated age. The bore is nice and shiny.

There are a few wear marks,  the front of the slide has a small bit of bluing rubbing off which is hardly noticeable, there is a small nick on the upper right part of the slide, the barrel has a 1 and a half inch scratch due to the spring being put on in an improper manner and the gun over all is an older gun. so there will be slight imperfections. after all, its a Russian Makarov, as crude as they are, they're great pistols.

Includes 3 original KBI magazines, these can run up to $100 a piece now and days. Unfortunately one of the mags is missing a larger main spring. it looks like it can be easily replaced as it is cylindrical.

It also includes the original adjustable sight and the new replacement low profile fixed sight. 

In my personal opinion, this is a fine pistol in top condition among any other hi-cap makarovs I've ever seen. Easily a collectors item.

I absolutely HATE to get rid of it but as we all know, bills eat us alive.

Price- $430 shipping included
Money Order or paypal plus 3%
I will ship to and from my FFL to yours.

...or do local FTF in South Florida.
local buy will be $380

If face to face the surplus 9x18 ammunition is free.

Trades- the only pistols I can do a partial or if complete(depending on condition) trade is for a IMI Jericho 941 or a Ruger p90 or p97

I have feedback on eBay if you require to see.

Thanks for reading! -Henry"

Receiver is marked ""Mauser Modelo Argentino 1891, Manufactura Loewe Berlin"". Caliber 7.65x53, All matching number on the receiver, barrel, bolt handle, and trigger guard. I beleive this is the Calvary model with the shorter barrel and stock, total length is 37"" barrel is 18"" ish. Ammo is still available for these 120+ year old rifles and it runs less than $20 a box for PPU brand. These rifles do not require an FFL to buy or sell since they are pre-1899 production and are classed as Antiques by the ATF - see: 18 USC 921 (a)(16). Since these rifles can shoot modern ammunition and are also exempt from FFL transfers they do bring a slight premium and typically sell for $400-$800 on Gunbroker depending on if the numbers all match, if the Argentine Crest was removed or not, and the rifles overall condition. This one has all matching numbers and the Argentine Crest was not removed which makes it more desireable. The condition however is fair; most of the blueing is gone and there is some pitting, the bore however is nice and bright and the rifling clear but worn as expected for its age. Very unique collectable and like most Mausers, they continue to gain value year after year."

The innovative Browning A-Bolt delivers dependable, pinpoint accuracy that exceeds the stringent standards of the modern rifleman. The renowned A-Bolt is available in three action lengths in a spectrum of popular chamberings, materials and finishes to satisfy your needs in any hunting or shooting situation. Have a look at this broad line up of A-Bolt rifles and see for yourself that the A-Bolt leads the competition in variety, versatility and performance. Nothing hits the mark like today's Browning A-Bolt. 

A very sophisticated bolt action. 
With a short 60¬∞ lift, the bolt incorporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the full length of the bolt. When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.

Barrel
The barrel is free floating and glass bedded at the recoil lug and front of receiver to maintain the proper spacing around the barrel for consistent accuracy. The recessed muzzle crown helps protect the rifling. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity.

Trigger
A chrome-plated trigger sear provides cleaner, crisper trigger pull. Screw adjustable and pre-set at approximately 4 lbs.

Magazine
Hinged floorplate with detachable box magazine makes it simple and fast to load a spare magazine.

Magazine Capacity
 Four in magazine, one in chamber"

I can trap, hunt, or relocate (for hippies)

If you need this service please let me know and we can work something out.

If you would like me to kill deer and other game animals there are some laws I must tell you about first to make sure we do not break any South Carolina gaming laws or local laws. To ensure safety I use any appropriate caliber from 22LR to 300 Win Mag. I can use a bow or a shotgun but most of the time we end up using traps due to geometry's of fire. 

When we do use rifle it is most commonly an M40A5 with 175Gn Sierra Matchking bullets in handloads. We can kill varmints up to 800 yards away confidently anything farther than that and we cant promise results.

Traps usually catch about two animals a week depending on the animal we are trapping."

For sale is a Bulgarian AK74 parts kit with 922r compliance parts and extra's for $600.00 USD.   

PLEASE NOTE: This parts kit does not include the full-auto fire control parts that came with the parts kit, as I have destroyed those parts since they are of no use, however the kit comes with semi-auto only fire control parts (bought from Kvar) that are U.S. made and count toward your compliance parts. Every other part that came with this kit is included and is unopened.

Also, this kit does not include the original wood furniture that was included with this kit, the hand guards, the upper hand guard gas tube, the pistol grip with screw, the pistol grip screw mounting nut, and the rear trunnion for fixed stocks. However, I'm including plastic U.S. made furniture (upper and lower hand guards, pistol grip, AK74M style warsaw pact length folding stock, rear Bulgarian trunnion for folding stock with this kit. Once this parts kit is assembled into a 922r compliance rifle by the buyer, you will have a legal, semi-auto only, 5.45x39mm AK74M.    

Included in this deal, is a Bulgarian AK74 5.45 parts kit (For use with a stamped receiver),   new Bulgarian factory 5.45x39 16 inch hammer forged chrome lined barrel that has never been mounted or used, Bulgarian back latch for side folding stocks, Bulgarian rivet set for stamped receivers with side folding stocks, front latch assembly for side folding stocks, adapter pin for attaching earlier generation 4mm butt stocks to new generation Russian 5.5mm rear trunnions (note this pin will not work with the included side folding stock and rear trunnion.

If you total up the cost of all the parts included, plus the cost of a Bulgarian AK74 wood parts kit without a barrel, it totals to $930.08. I'm selling all of these parts for $600.00 USD, as I no longer have a desire to build this parts kit, and I need the money for other gun related stuff.
