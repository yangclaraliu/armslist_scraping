This rifle is the Bushmaster XM15-E2S Flattop model.
I am the original owner, and I purchased it new in 1999.
It was manufactured in the Windham ME facility and is from the height of Bushmaster Quality BEFORE they were sold off.
This rifle is utterly reliable and has spent most of its life in my safe.
It is in excellent condition with only a few surface scratches from bumping around in the safe.
This model has HBAR 1:9 5.56 stamped onto the bull barrel. This is a 5.56 variant, not .223.

The rifle is in its completely original configuration, the only modifications were the muzzle brake and the addition of a sling post to the hand-guard,  both are easily removed if desired.

I am looking for an AR PISTOL, the lower MUST BE STAMPED PISTOL, yes I know the ATF regulations do not necessarily require it, but its what I want.
I would prefer a metal lower and barrel lengths shorter than 11.5 inches.
I am a discerning AR owner, no junk please. Please respond with pictures.
The rifle is for TRADE ONLY and NOT FOR SALE.

If the trade is right, I will throw in the scope, mounts, and original Bushmaster Rifle case.
The pictures show that it is stored well lubricated, and the serial number covered with tape.
Can meet from Pueblo to Denver.

Face to Face transaction, I have a CCW. I will check ID and ask the proper questions required by law."

This pistol is chambered in 5.56/.223 NATO and the quality of the build and engineering on these Arsenal pistols is like nothing out there, research and look at reviews from top magazines and forums.. I own several high end AK pistols but this one was worth the 9 month wait. I was going to include all the links and feed back and reviews from Guns and Ammo but you can easily find out what they have to say about this pistol. It is the most acurate AK pistol on the market and when you put one in your hands you can tell immediately it is far from your average AK. Solid and extremely precise in every way. It comes with 4 new 30 round mags, by Pro Mag, 5, new 20 round mags by circle 10 Bulgaria.  And 1 Arsenal 5 round mag. I have a Magpul sling on it, and a seweet hand grip. It comes with 360 rounds, most of which is 5.56 NATO Penitrator rounds. Also comes with a Drago custom tactical soft case/pack I just recieved..  The production on these are extremely low. Mine took nine months after deposit to receive. I must put my family first so it goes. Everything is New in box and un used and in mint condition. You will not find a beter made AK than Arsenal and these are truly in another class all alone. The accuracy is by far superior to any Krink pistol made and the ability to eat up any type of ammo consistently is second to none.  Thank you for looking and feel free to ask questions. No games or thugs. Wrong guy for that.    $1900 or best offer. Thanks again"

It's estimated that there are currently less than 1000 in the United States. France never exported them, and there are very few on the open market.

These pistols were manufactured by MAS and also by Manufacture d'Armes de Chatellerault (MAC), until circa 1970. MAC was the most proficient builder of the pistol with around 222,000 pieces made from 1953 to 1963 using the prefix letters A to W by batches of 9999. 

The fabrication was transferred to MAS in 1963 where around 120,000 pieces were made until 1978 using double prefix letters FG (99999) and FH (20,000).

It had been adopted by French Army as a standard sidearm in 1950. These pistols are recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols that use Browning M1911 style locking with the barrel lowered and raised by a swinging underbarrel link and locking into the slide via internal ribs of the slide and on the top side of the barrel. 

They have single action triggers with a slide mounted safety, which locks the firing pin, so the hammer can be lowered by pressing the trigger with the safety engaged. They have fixed sights and a single-stack magazine which holds 9 rounds.

These pistols were used in following conflicts: First Indochina War, Algerian War, Suez Crisis, Chad conflicts, Gulf War and as recently as Afghanistan.

This pistol is unrestored and in great original condition.

Absolutely mint condition, very low serial number (less than 160). Approximately 30 rounds shot through since new. Stored in a safe since.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=AgyF2wEaXLs

Calico firearms incorporate the Helical Feed System with the option of using a 50 or 100 round drum magazine. The Helical feed magazine can be loaded and stored indefinitely without spring fatigue, and with the Calico speed loader, the 50 round magazine can be loaded from an open box of ammo in less than 15 seconds and 30 seconds for 100 rounds.

Both the pistol and carbine have virtually no muzzle climb, even with rapid firing. Spent cases are ejected straight down in front of the trigger guard for close quarter operation. This is very important in a combat or law enforcement tactical operation as shells ejecting to the right give away your position. All models field strip in a few seconds without tools and feature an adjusted front sight for windage and elevation.  
The bolt is a delayed blowback type similar to the ones used on the MP-5 sub machine gun, except is significantly smaller and lighter. It is manufactured from high strength, heat treated, S-7 tool steel that easily withstands shock, wear and corrosive fouling. The bolt, striker, springs, and buffer drop out of the receiver as a single unit with no loose parts.

  The magazines are constructed of space age, high impact, fiber reinforced, and thermoplastic â the same material used in the 9mm series. The M-100 carbine has perfect balanceâ¦ The placement of the magazine puts the center of gravity above the recoil, which counteracts muzzle lift and improves accuracy.

Unlike most unconverted SAIGAs, it has the fire control group moved forward (to the standard AK47 location) which makes converting it to ""assault weapon"" configuration a snap. All you have to do is swap out the FCG ($25), file down the mag catch and you will then legally be able to use hicap AK47 mags. Takes 30 minutes. Some guns require bullet guides ($20) to feed reliably but it depends on the gun/mag combo. Sometimes you don't need it.

This is a quality Russian made AK47, made by Izhmash which is a much higher quality than most other Eastern Bloc AK47s that you see.  It has a 22"" chrome lined barrel, and wood furniture.

UHP-15 Receiver
Ultra High Precision (UHP):  The most finely machined lowers on the market.
The BRP Corp Ultra High Precision (UHP) 15 was specifically made to meet our need for a rugged and precise lower receiver for our XMG Belt-Fed rifles. We hold half of the mil-spec tolerance to ensure exact fits and smooth function.  These lower receivers are fully compatible with common AR parts and accessories.
These lower receivers are machined from forged 7075 aluminum blanks using only the best tooling available.  We take our time making these and it shows in the quality of the machining. Not only are the milled slots and reamed holes precise, they are also clean and smooth.  The internal machining is among the cleanest you will ever see in an AR-type rifle.  Once machined and checked, our receivers are hard-coat anodized.  
We have also included a set screw tightening feature at the rear lug area to eliminated any movement between the upper and lower assemblies.  This is a useful feature for our XMG Belt-Fed rifles and precision shooters.

Here is a assortment of  some .22 long rifle ammunition.  There is several different brands from around the world but all is quit functional.  Any of this ammunition should be fine for every day plinking.  There is 1 brick (500 rds.) of older ""Federal"" Hi-Power copper coated hollow points.  There is 1 brick (500 rds.) of ""Junior"" made in Russia with steel cases.  The brick is unopened and I don't know much about this ammo.  There is 5 boxes (150 rds.) of what appears to Russian steel case uncoated lead ammo.  There is 2 boxes (100 rds.) ""Valor"" made in Yugoslavia.  It has brass cases, uncoated lead bullets and advertised as non-corrosive.  Lastly 1 box (100 rds.) of ""ICI"" ammo.  Again not sure of the country of origin.  I have never shot any of this ammo other than some Federal Hi-Powers in the past.  I was just collecting different brands of .22 ammo.  There is a total of 27 (50 ct.) boxes that I want to sell all or nothing.  Am asking $80.00 firm for all of it which is a little less than $3.00 per box.

I picked this up a while ago and it has simply been too much of a safe queen to hold onto any longer. Needs to go to a new home. As pictured it comes with the stick mag and adapter for it as well as a harder to find drum mag. It is in excellent condition with very strong rifling. The bluing is in excellent condition overall with only a couple small scratches and some ejection marks from brass on the ejection port. These haven't been made in a while and now seems like only the 45acp ones are around so nice way to get some more affordable tommy gun action. The drum mag has some wear as pictured but should still be in working order. I only used the stick mag the 1 time I took it out but the gun worked flawlessly through those few hundred rounds.

This one also comes with an original 16 page Auto Ordnance Catalog along with letter from 1975 BATF certing the firearm is semi auto only and a notarized letter from Heileman Brewing Co noting the rifle as a prize in 1983 for a Seattle plant worker so a neat piece of local history attached.

This sale is for the rifle, 2 mags and adapter only. Any questions feel free to ask. I can meet up anywhere in the general eastside/seattle area. Buyer must be able to present Drivers license, + CPL or WAC card or even copy of C&R license. I am selling this as a lot and will not sell the mags by themselves.

$1300 obo. Looking for cash but I am open to some trades. No hunting stuff, only ""Vietnam style"" ARs(triangular hand guard), RPK style AKs, Colt Snake Guns, blued S&W revolvers (29,27,19,13, 10-hb or 586). No tactical stuff. +/- Cash depending, make offers worst I can say is no etc etc.

PMAGS FOR COLORADANS
During this period of high demand, and with the possibility of pending state legislation, we at Magpul are taking steps to ensure that responsible Colorado residents who want to own standard capacity magazines have the opportunity to do so. To meet this need, we have set up a process for CO residents to purchase limited quantities of magazines from our website.  


In order to participate in this program, go to: http://store.magpul.com/member_register



Create your login account and click the âRegisterâ button to submit. Once you receive a âMembership Confirmationâ e-mail, forward it to REDACTED with your name, the email used to sign up for the account, and your CO address.


BOTH YOUR BILLING AND SHIPPING ADDRESSES MUST BE IN COLORADO!


Once we verify your CO residency (this process can take up to a week due to the large quantities of emails we receive) you will be added to an authorized Special Purchase group, which will allow you to purchase select magazines from a limited access section of our website.  You will then receive a notification e-mail stating that you have been added to this group, and instructions for placing your order will be included.

Selling my Mossberg MVP Predator 20â bbl., chambered 5.56. Purchased new Jan. 2013 & 60 rds fired.

Shoots MOA/sub-MOA with 5.56 NATO. 

The issue: I tried to insert a new magazine to enjoy the rest of my day at the range when the cheap-quality mag well broke (picture below). Magazines still seat, but there is just enough vertical play that the bolt âflapâ does not strip a new round from the magazine. Should be a relatively easy fix for anyone handy. 

Mossberg's customer service seems backed up, and I don't feel like waiting around for it to be fixed.

I am including the following, all purchased around the time of the rifle purchase:
Nikon Monarch 2.5-10x42mm, Nikoplex w/box & papers (typically around $350 new)
Weaver 1â scope rings
Blackhawk 9â-13â bipod (typically about $40 new)
Leather sling
Sling swivels

It has two Grease Gun Lower Receivers (shown below) and the factory lower.


The rifle is unfired and the entire set up is new....it was a safe queen that I am considering letting go....I have seen these ALL over the place in pricing.  Anywhere from $3,000 to $4,500+ (from what I can see).....Mine is new and I am asking $2,800 so it is a great deal.


I have bought and sold over 2 dozen firearms online.  I know the process and if you are inclined as well I can ship to your FFL from my FFL for the cost of my transfer (I will pay shipping...).  So this is a deal that extends beyond Texas.

Methods of payment are Paypal or Cash and can be discussed further in email.

If you have any questions, let me know!  This price has now been changed and it is as low as it can go for me.  Otherwise I will keep it since I will be taking a hit and it is all brand freakin' new."
