PI9128LP “RANGE OFFICER”
Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for
people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™,
“Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter
exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to
create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of
shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he
likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy
Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result
in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model,
at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

It does not have a caliber stamp on the barrel at least the exposed barrel so I had it checked and certified by a gunsmith who stated that it is a standard 30-06. I would not let him stamp the barrel so instead he gave me a written certification that I will pass to the buyer. I am addig this. I recently noticed a hairline crack on the bottom of the stock at the muzzle end. Looks like the end cap of the stock bight have been overtightened ?? it is hardly noticeable and probably has no effect on the gun.

 The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world.  The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer

The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec Cold Hammer Forged Chrome Moly Vanadium Chrome Lined barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Adjustable back-up sights are integrated and can be folded down in to the Picatinny rail, and the front post is Tritium for improved visibility. All metal parts are treated for corrosion resistant. A rubber butt pad is integrated in to the stock to reduce felt recoil. The Tavor is assembled in the USA from US and Israeli manufactured parts.

Up for sale is one, new in the box IWI Tavor bullpup rifle in 5.56 NATO/.223 Rem caliber. The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. **Stock: BLACK** Caliber: 5.56 NATO** Barrel Length: 16 1/2** Weight (lbs):7.9** Overall Length: 26 1/8** Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy. Mil-Spec , chrome lined, cold-hammer forged CrMoV barrel, 6 groove 1:7 RH twist. 100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left hand bolts for 5.56 NATO and 5.45x39mm. Integral folding adjustable backup iron sights with Tritium front post (flat top models only) Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles. Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies. Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR®SAR parts. Uses standard AR-15/M16 magazines. Last round hold open on empty magazine. All metal parts are treated for corrosion resistance. Integral rubber recoil pad. Assembled in the US from Israeli and US manufactured parts. Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use. Clean, long stroke piston operation. Body constructed of high-strength impact modified polymer."

Remington 700 .223 rifle. I bought this gun brand new last fall, and have fired exactly 40 rounds through it in one range session. 

-Remington 700 SPS Varmint .223 Rem. BDL setup (hinged floorplate), matte finished metal.  Model # is 84215 26"" bull barrel, 1-12"" twist rate.  X-Mark Pro trigger.

From Remington.com:

Overview:

“Why yes, that’s really five shots.” Tell your friends it’s genetics. Fact is, when it comes to precision, there’s no finer pedigree in the industry than Remington® varmint rifles. And with the introduction of our new Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint, staking claim to our legendary accuracy is a more attainable feat than ever.

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.

The ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

Key Features:

    Newly designed SPS Varmint stock with vented beavertail fore-end
    Sling swivel studs included
    26"" heavy-contour barrel (0.820"" muzzle O.D.)
    Legendary Model 700™ action
    Drilled and tapped for scope mounts


This gun is close to a new gun as you could get without buying it new.

I'm happy to take additional pictures at your request or answer any questions.

Happy to ship this gun to the buyer's FFL at the buyer's expense (contact me with your zip code if you need a shipping quote).

Will trade (locally) for 12 20 28 or 410 target loads (factory only, no reloads), 20 28 or 410 wads, 12 20 28 or 410 once fired AA or STS hulls, lead shot (7.5 or smaller) or shotshell primers.

I don't have the gun anymore, and I don't know what to do with what's left.

I have 128 rounds of .308 ammo.  

I had the guy reload these with 175 grain Sierra Match Kings, with Federal Match primers.  Brass is Winchester.  Velocity should be in the 2700 fps range (he said).  They were accurate enough in my Savage that I had at that time.  10 shots went into an inch or less at 100 yards.  And overall length of these is 2.75 inches, so you'll want to make sure they fit your magazine, etc.  Not totally match ammo, but semi-""match"", as far as I'm concerned.  



I don't know what it's worth, so I will take offers.  I'm figuring around $100-$125 for the .308 I will consider all reasonable offers.  

I can ship these too.

Up for sale is the hard to get Tavor SAR B-18. The 18 inch barrel on the Tavor is a little harder to come by and makes for more down range accuracy. I have handled about all of the bullpup rifles and the Tavor is the Cadillac of the bunch. Comes with 1 30 round magazine, nice toolkit kit with pouch, lock and all IWI paperwork. Makes sure this rifle is legal for you to own."

The good: Gun runs very well – no fte, ftf with a variety of commercial ammo and an even greater variety of reloaded ammo (really likes 147 grain bullets) Highly reliable, soft shooting and accurate.

The bad: holster wear – has been used and carried and has the wear to prove it. That is it – nothing else wrong with it.

$450 obo – prefer ftf in SE Wisconsin, but will ship to your ffl for actual shipping cost.

I use to use this shotgun for a quazi local three gun competition that was shut down last year. Now it sits in the safe with no practice use. The gun has seen approximately 600 rounds (100 slugs, 200 00-buck, 300 #6 bird) give or take a few boxes and some random loads used for reliability testing. The gun cycles almost every type of ammo I have put through it, with the acceptation of some paper hulled low charge buck shot, #9 dove shot, and less lethal rubber balls. Anything else it eats without issue. I have cleaned it every time I have put rounds down range and is in great condition.

This is a LeFever Nitro Special that got crossed with a Western Field special order at the Ithaca factory. It has WESTERN FIELD DELUXE & MONTGOMERY WARDS & CO. on the barrels. It has two of the few options available with the Western Field guns: dual bead sights and a soft rubber butt pad. The only other option was the ejector that came later.

Now, here’s where the anomalies come in. None of the Western Field guns frames were case hardened, this one was. There are traces of case hardening color under the front of the trigger guard, and on the top tang. The Western Field guns had a setter at point stamped into the frame sides. This one has the LeFever Nitro Special Duck in the Swamp scene. It has serial numbers matching on the frame, for end and barrels that are consistent with a LeFever Nitro Special made in 1929. The serial numbers are not even in the Western Field range. The Western Field guns stocks were not checkered and were not normally good Walnut, the stocks on this gun are checkered and have a bit of natural tiger striping in the walnut.

This is a VERY unusual gun. It’s in an unadulterated form and in perfect functioning condition.

The bores are pristine. Both of the sighting beads have been broken. Bluing on the barrels is excellent with a very few minor surface scratches. The Duck in the Swamp scenes are light, but distinguishable. They aren’t worn, just lightly stamped. The frame is dark, but there is no indication that it has been blued.

The barrels are 12 Ga., 30” choked full and modified.

Here’s your opportunity to own a true Ithaca mix up gun…

Price is $500.00 cash picked up in Midtown Houston. I will ship to your FFL for $35.00. I can send more photos if you are seriously interested.

Wood is original - no splits in stock and there's a longitudinal split in the wooden forend but it doesn't hurt the functionality - it's been there as long as I can remember.

Paypal Okay (Credit Cards Okay).  Ships for $30 to FFL. 
For Sale:  Beretta 92s, MADE IN ITALY.
Lots of Extras including 2 Magazines and Brand new Holster.

Includes Brand new Fixed Tritium Night Sights professionally installed (150 bucks for sights and $30 for installation).  These night sights glow bright green all the time, and can only be seen by the shooter, not the target.

This is a precursor to the M9 (civilian 92fs).  This pistol was made in the early 1980s, collectors are going nuts for these since they are the real deal, original 9mm Beretta 92 series pistols, Italian craftsmanship, always imitated but Never Duplicated.

The 92s is the pistol that was tested by US Special Forces when the Military decided to go with the 9mm pistol.  This one is the original, with the mag release near the bottom of the pistol grip before it was changed in the subsequent models.  The M9 and the 92fs both have the Mag Release in a different position near the top of the mag well near the trigger.    It’s the style used by European Special forces and police officers for decades; also the type exported to the US in the weapon’s early inception.  Of course, it shoots and handles just like the 92fs, but it’s more collectible, and, in my humble opinion, a little finer craftsmanship.

Includes:
•	Brand New Tritium night sights 
(already installed professionally by a local gunsmith)
•	Brand New Uncle Mike’s ambidextrous shoulder holster
•	2 magazines.  One is standard mag, the other is double stacked so it holds more rounds

This Sig Sauer is the officer's type Conceal Carry 45 Auto C3 Revolution with factory Night Sights and Sig Rosewood grips.  Makes a nice carry weapon that is small enough to conceal underneath an untucked shirt but that has all of the power of a 1911 officer’s pistol.  The length is almost the same as the M1911, so it doesn’t lack in power or accuracy like many of the other smaller 1911 versions.  Weight is reduced when compared to a full size M1911. Lighter trigger pull than a normal 1911 makes it an amazing shooter.  Includes all-around strapping that makes it fit your hand perfectly every time with a clean, secure grip.  Has a light trigger pull, accurate as can be.  This weapon is a fine example of what you know is top notch Sig craftsmanship.  

In perfect condition, unbelievably clean, performs flawlessly.  

Includes:
•	Original Box and Paperwork
•	Sig Night Sights
•	Genuine Made in the USA Leather IWB Holster (Inside the Waistband)
