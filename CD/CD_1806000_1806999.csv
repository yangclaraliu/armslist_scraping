Everything on this rifle is in pristine condition (no scratch anywhere even the wood funiture) This comes with 3 magazines, 440 rounds of ammo in a sealed and a side scope mount.

The VEPR semi-auto hunting rifles are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 

VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market 

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope. 

All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory.

The VEPR Rifle in 7.62x54R is the top of the line in Kalashnikov action semi-automatic rifles. With features such as; Hammer forged heavy barrel, (including a chrome lined barrel bore, chamber, gas block and gas piston), 1.5mm thick receiver, RPK front trunnion, three locking lug bolt, spring loaded firing pin, side scope mount rail, hand made walnut thumbhole stock and the Wolf Lifetime Warranty. The VEPR is simply the highest quality rifle based on the Kalashnikov design. The VEPR Rifles and Carbines are sporting arms based on the famous Soviet designed RPK. VEPR rifles are manufactured at the historic Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant (a.k.a. ""MOLOT""). Molot has been building excellence into their firearms for over 50 years."

Shows signs of use, shoots and groups great, great modern 9mm, very rare..
Accepts Beretta and Taurus mags..

The Polish MAG 98 9mm /9x19 NATO caliber pistol is an improved variation of the original Polish MAG95. 
It was produced for the Polish Special Forces, Border Guard and Prison Guard in the 1990's. 
Made in the Z.M. Lucznik factory 11 at Radom Poland. 

These fine pistols feature a ambidextrous decocker safety, steel slide, alloy frame, and serrated trigger guard front strap.
In 1996 the Mag 98 was evaluated for adoption purposes by the Polish Army. It had advantages over its competition such as 
better reliability, durability and safety (better protection against accidental discharge, when dropped). 

Although the quality was deemed superior, the MAG 98 was rejected by the Army because the frame was slightly larger
than the contract qualifications called for. That was a shame because most service members prefered it and in fact 
the pistol has a good reputation among users: It is considered a precise, well balanced and durable weapon 
and its mass leads to good stability during firing. 

This double/single action pistol comes with ONE 15rd magazine."

*** This item come with 1 six-round magazine & 1 eight round magazine.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. 

The Nanos extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nanos magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. 

The Nanos sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

This is a hard to get Colt Government Model in 10mm. Colt was one of the original pioneers in adapting a combat pistol to the potent 10mm cartridge and the first to successfully manufacture a 10mm caliber pistol in the United States. The Colt Delta Elite®, a longtime favorite amongst combat pistol shooters, offers the power to hunt medium sized game with near .41 Magnum ballistics in a legendary 1911 style pistol. Colt only makes a small number of these a year. If you have been thinking of a 10mm pistol get your wallet out now. If you wait to long you will be singing the blues for sure.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

The Model 700 VTR rifle is a culmination of our time-tested bolt-action design, fused with truly innovative new features available only from Remington. For starters, this Model 700 is fit with a distinctive patent-pending triangular contoured target-grade barrel. This design-enhancement is the result of rigorous research and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid heat dissipation. To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured 22-inch barrel has an integral muzzle brake that’s machined-in during production. The hammer-forged, clean carbon steel barrel, machined solid steel receiver, and hinged floorplate feature a durable satin black oxide finish.

For optimal accuracy, the Model 700 VTR is then fitted with the new Remington X-MARK PRO™ adjustable trigger. The X-Mark Pro breaks like glass, has virtually no creep and this externally-accessible, adjustable trigger is set at the factory to a pull weight of 3 ½ pounds with a 2 pound range of adjustment (3 to 5 pounds).

To complete the package, the Model 700 VTR A-TACS barreled action is mated to a synthetic stock featuring vented beaver-tail fore-end, patented Hogue® black overmold grip areas and camo coverage with the technologically-advanced A-TACS (Advanced Tactical Concealment Systems) pattern. This highly-effective, digitized camouflage features a combination of organically-colored and shaped pixels which at a distance provide depth, shadows and the ultimate in concealment. Completing the stock package are front and rear sling swivel studs and Remington’s revolutionary SuperCell™ Recoil Pad which provides recoil reduction up to 54%.

Cutting-edge design, jaw-dropping appearance and the renowned accuracy of our time-proved Model 700 platform – are all standard features of the new Remington Model 700 VTR A-TACS!

More accurate then I am. Usually shot with Federal bulk and CCI mini-mags. Adjustable rear sight, never used it,

My camera does not handle chrome/stainless well (too dark) so I did the picture on my ancient  scanner.

Bought the gun  used from a sporting goods store in 2010. Going by the serial number, about a 1981?  65-81###.

If you need (I checked - most places are still out) .22LR I have some open bulk for $0.08 a round, I have to know BEFORE you come for the gun. I might have up to 500 rounds.

Terms: You have to have a GFL (Georgia concealed carry permit) that is current. We do a bill of sale, GFL to GFL. No exceptions, period.

DHS is buying up 1.6 billion rounds (750 million .40 S&W) using our tax dollars borrowed from China, enough for a 100 year war in Afghanistan. Which is causing this shortage, along with insane gun restrictions. So ... before we even talk or shake hands you have to say:

""I didn't vote for Obama because he sucks."". No exceptions. PERIOD.

Otherwise you can go back home. I don't need or want your money.

M1-22™ BLACK FINISH
Item Number: 500-082
The M1 carbine is a lightweight, easy to use semi-automatic carbine that became a standard ﬁrearm for the U.S. military during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was produced in several variants. It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian ﬁrearm. A total of over 6.5 million M1 carbines of various models were manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II. Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies : the largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but many others were made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and the Rock-Ola jukebox company. The Chiappa Firearms’ M1-22 is a rimﬁre replica of the M1 carbine, featuring a blowback system and an adjustable rear sight, which can be removed to leave guides free for optics mount. The barrel and bolt are made of solid steel, the trigger guard, stock and magazine of polymer. The 10 round magazine has a straight proﬁle like the original. The stock is interchangeable with the original; a wooden stock version and a black synthetic stock version are available."

Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22 LR and .22 Magnum cartridges the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 

The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. Wood grip. Fixed sights. Blued finish. Weight: 33.4 oz. Capacity: 6 rounds.

The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.  Color Billfold Brown, NIB Call REDACTED for more info!

A beautiful S&W .38 Special Model 49-1 in bright polished blued steel, with a case hardened hammer and trigger. This is an older pre-lock Smith revolver so the firing pin is on the hammer, and there are no MIM parts -- it was made back when the internal lockwork was hand fitted. As a result, the trigger is great in both SA and DA -- smooth and crisp. Tight lockup, good timing -- shoots better than you thought a J-frame could.

The bluing is in great shape with almost no visible wear, and only a very faint turn line on the cylinder. Nice new set of shock-absorbing Pachmayr Presentation grips make this the most comfortable shooting J-frame you will ever fire. I got this awhile back with the intent of making it my daily carry, but it ended up sitting in my safe instead. 

The shrouded hammer design gives you the best of both worlds, with a quick draw snag free design, that still allows Single action accuracy. And the steel framed model 49, while a bit heavier than an alloy framed airweight, soaks up a lot more recoil and helps improve accuracy, especially for newer and less practiced shooters. Basically, this is that rare J-frame that is good for both carry and lots of range shooting too. 

$550, OBRO. They don't make 'em like this anymore, and it is very rare for one to have survived in this condition. I have a strong suspicion that the box I ammunition I put though it is all that has ever been fired through this gun."

It is a ""RRA Mid-length A4 LAR-15"" to be exact. It is in awesome condition, only about 100 rounds through it, and cleaned after every range trip. These are very hard to find right now due to the gun craze, and most places that sell these are back-ordered for 3-12 months or more!
It has a 16"" barrel with a mid-length gas system, which gives better accuracy and lower recoil than the short-length gas systems. The barrel is chrome-moly and has a 1:9 twist. As you can see I am including a Red (or Green) Dot Sight that has 8 different reticle options. I am also including a flip-up MBUS (back up site) which is co-witnessed with the red-dot (meaning either or both could be used, they both point to my zero at 50 yards), its a really great setup for some closer-range tactical shooting. If you wanted to put a scope on it its pretty easy to do as well (Note: There is no scope included in this package). It has a 6 position adjustable stock. The accuracy is up to 1 MOA (meaning with a shooting rest, high quality ammo, and a good shooter, you can put 5 rounds within a 1"" circle at 100 yards).
I am also including the tactical sling (partially seen to the left of the stock) as well as 5 - 30 round polymer magazines, 4 of which have a handy window to see how much ammo is remaining. I will include these LOADED at 29 each (can fit 30 but its not very good for the mags and can cause problems) for 145 rounds! [NOTE: NOT SELLING ACCESSORIES/AMMO SEPARATE for this package] The ammo is 55 grain brass cased, not aluminum or steel cased garbage you see nowadays in the current craze. I am able to sell some additional ammunition for additional $.

This has everything you need to start tactical target shooting or even survive the zombie apocalypse!

List of everything included: Firearm, tactical sling, 5 LOADED magazines (29 x 5 = 145 rounds in magazines), red/green dot sight (Truglo, will include a back up battery too), back up sight, original RRA case.

I would be willing to sell the firearm and 1 (unloaded) magazine only (no sights or other accessories) for $1,000.

We are now introducing the Rainier Arms RUC REV™ which is one of the lightest 16"" rifle weighing in at 6 lbs 6.1 oz.

Target acquisition is effortless & extremely fast due to the unique design of the Diamond Head Back Up Iron Sights, and a ALG QMS trigger offers a fluid trigger platform for smooth shooting. To accommodate our ambidextrous shooters, we have installed our Rainier Arms Raptor ambidextrous charging handle by AXTS and B.A.D. selector 45° levers. With all of these components put together, the RUC REV™ is unparalleled in performance. All materials used are of industry-leading standards, each weapon carefully and meticulously assembled with a limited lifetime warranty.

It has exactly 175 rounds through it, not a single issue with any of the various types of ammo I have used. Gun was made late last year according to the factory casing that comes with the firearm when purchased.

This firearm comes with the following:
-Case
-Fire arm with regular and extended magazines.
-All paperwork ( I did not fill out the lifetime warranty card so new buyer can do that if they wish)
-Factory casing and envelope stating born on date.
-Magazine holster
-Firearm holster
-Magazine loader
-Talon gun grips (Rubberized texture) perfect for added control and concealed carry as it won't rub you raw like sandpaper grips. I can remove these if buyer wishes before purchase. However they are a great addition feel free to google reviews on these.
-Mirror polished barrel/trigger lever/guide rode/pins not some cheap at home job professionally done and it shows.
- Firearm has been meticulously maintained in the short time I have had it. Stripped down bare every range trip cleaned and lubed. You would be hard pressed to find residue anywhere on this firearm.



Only reason for selling is I have purchased another pistol and do not need this one. I am in no rush so please do not waste my time with ridiculous offers, I will keep it. Btw this is not the essentials package it is the ""upgraded"" version with the extras that come in the case.

LWRC
M6A2 OD Green
w/ Geiselle Trigger

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.
