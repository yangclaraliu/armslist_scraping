76,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1300076,For Sale:  Sten  MK 3 Demilled parts kit and Indianapolis Ordnance Semi-Auto Sten Mk 3 kit,"North Tampa, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 800,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 3, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is not a gun or frearm and does not require an FFL for shipping.

Original WWII British Sten Mk 3 parts kit. This is a parts kit that has been saw-demilled and cannot be reassembled into a working firearm, and so it has been classified as a non-firearm by the BATFE. These parts were hand-selected for minimal wear and abuse. All parts are included except the missing chunks of the receiver tube. Original gun was demilled and packed in Cosmoline after the war, and is thus well preserved and rust free.  Included but not shown are three 32-rd magazines.

The other parts included are a premium Indianapolis Ordnance Semi-Auto parts kit, all new parts, including an 80% completed receiver tube, 16-inch barrel (required by the BATFE), semi-auto bolt and the various pins, springs, rivets, and small parts required to complete the kit. To be very clear, the new receiver tube CANNOT BE USED WITH THE ORIGINAL BOLT. It is designed with a vertical magazine mount and has ventilation holes already drilled. The bolt kit is for a vertical magazine mount and is designed to fit the receiver tube. The receiver tube has a plan decal attached for ease of use. Instructions are included.

I bought these parts with the intention of doing the disassembly of the Sten and building a semi-auto Sten based on the 80% receiver, which is of course perfectly legal. Then I realized I don't have the time to complete it so I'm taking a bit of a loss to get the parts out of my project to-do list. If you have time to do it, this would be a great project.  If you have a Dremel Tool and some patience, you can do it.

I can ship in the 50 US States (shipping extra, please pay the total by US Postal MO and I'll ship when it clears) or local pickup in the Tampa area (cash payment OK) is great."

Has the Tula star stamp on the barrel bands and retaining rings. All matching except for the bolt. Has the original screw in sling mounts on the stock. No cleaning rod.

The politicians know an ""assault weapon"" ban is political suicide. BUT many of them still think they can pass other gun controls including a magazine ban (which is still very much alive) without any serious consequences.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/03/20/assault-weapons-ban-gets-the-hook/

Feinstein's bill was merely the worst of a bad bunch. The politicians need to be put on notice that we value our rights and freedoms and that we will not tolerate further infringement. 

The grand standing disingenuous, anti-gun politicians are hard at work blaming you and me for the actions of psychotic killers like Lanza in Connecticut and gang bangers in Chicago. With all it's gun laws Chicago has a homicide rate higher than much of the 3rd world and about 4 times the national rate, and they want to BLAME YOU AND YOUR RIGHTS for their homicides. I don't know about you, but I haven't gone to Chicago and killed anybody, and I'm sick of hearing that me and my rights are the reason Chicago's homicides are out of control and that my rights are to blame for some sick freak exploiting a gun free killer safety zone and murdering children. Instead of controlling guns and the millions of law abiding people who own them, how about we control, violent criminals, gang bangers and sick freaks who like to kill our kids? 

Numerous gun bills are now threatening our second amendment rights. From Feinstein's badly crippled ""assault weapon"" ban, to  bans on standard capacity magazines, wrongly called ""high capacity magazines"", to so called ""universal background checks"" that attempt to implement defacto gun registration schemes and allow the Obama administration to stop all legal gun sales at a whim simply by taking NICS offline.

Meanwhile, in 2010 there were 72,659 failed NICS checks. Know how many the Obama ATF referred to DOJ for prosecution for lying on form 4473 or anything else? 62. Yes, 62. Not 62%, not 6,200, not 62,000, only 62. I'm not making it up, see below for proof. I couldn't make this up if  I tried, I don't have that much imagination. Why only 62 cases referred for prosecution? Because the Obama DOJ is more interested in enabling the running of guns to Mexican drug cartels to undermine your second amendment rights than they are in enforcing any existing gun laws.

The following report backs up the above claim regarding prosecutions, or lack thereof and is a goldmine of information on what a joke the NICS system has become, everyone should bookmark it and/or download and save a copy. Remember these numbers when politicians claim they want gun control to increase public safety. IT'S A LIE. They want gun control to control law abiding people. They have no interest in even enforcing the law when it comes to criminals.

https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/239272.pdf

Email your senators and reps now and tell them:

NO MORE GUN CONTROL FOR CRIMINALS AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO IGNORE! Also tell them to allocate funding and provide incentives to school systems to implement real security including trained and armed security in schools. Without this critical step there will just be more school shootings, which endanger our children and our rights. Obama has unleashed a full frontal assault on the 2nd amendment. This gun control agenda needs to be killed decisively or he will keep trying for the next 4 years. He has only so much political capital to spend on gun control. Make him realize he's fighting a losing battle.

AK-74 comes with 2 30rd mags. has uncommon wooden foregrip. shoots great. less than 500rds down range... currently has an OD green SAW grip, but I have the standard grip, just not the hardware to mount it (the SAW grip is much better IMHO)...

It also has side rail mount on the receiver and includes approx 760 rounds of ammo (660 surplus and 100 wolf)

I have had this rifle for three years and love it... this will make someone a happy camper for sure...

Everything is straight, no failures in the 400 or so rounds I have put through it... 

I have pinged 1 foot steel targets out to 300 yards... this with just a red dot reflex sight and with the iron sights...

It's a complete overhaul.  We start by completely disassembling the gun.  Then the gun is buffed completely to remove any scratches or rust pits and restoring all corners and edges to ""factory new"" sharpness.  Then it's polished to a bright luster for better appearance.  The gun is then boiled in a special solution which removes every trace of dirt, and blued to a deep black color.  Finally we reassemble and function test the gun.  The result is a gun which in most cases looks ""better than new"".

I am only interested in Glock 17s manufactured pre-2009 (The serial prefix should be M** or before).

My G19 has a pre-2009 serial, as well as Glock Night Sights. Excellent condition. Sights are still nice and bright.

I would be interested in gun for gun, straight across, or gun +2 mags for gun + 2 mags. The 19 simply doesn't fit my hand as well as the 17 - simple as that.

If your gun does not have night sights, I would expect a little cash, or I can simply swap out my sights for standard Glock sights before the trade.

Again, I am ONLY interested in a Glock 17 (no 'C' models please), and expect the trade to be as straight across as possible. 

In the event that I cannot arrange a trade for an acceptable G17, I may be interested in trading for a Sig P226 - W. German models preferred. Will add cash for the right 226.

I'm NOT looking for anything else at this time, so no other offers, please.

FTF in the Toledo area only. Thanks for looking."
