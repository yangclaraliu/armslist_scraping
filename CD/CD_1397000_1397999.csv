These are much rarer than the carbine length uppers. Still new in the plastic. $855 plus $24.99 Priority Mail Shipping.

Nickel Boron Bolt Carrier Group and charging handle included. These BCGs sell for $400-500 alone on GunBroker. Nickel boron is popular because it doesn't require lubrication and is much easier to clean than a standard BCG.

Melonite coated inside and out to resist corrosion. You can shoot cheap Russian surplus all day and not worry about ruining your gun.

I originally bought this to shoot 5.45, because the ammo is still cheap and available for around $180/1000. You can easily spend double that on .223 lately. It's a good investment during this panic--if you shoot a couple cases you've already broken even on this upper. Note that Spike's test fires a few rounds out of these at the factory.

I am out of 5.45 magazines but I can show you where to get some for $25 each shipped. I would suggest using a heavier buffer and Wolff hammer spring as well, just because the 5.45 uppers function better that way.

I accept discrete PayPal Gift and Money Order. PayPal charges an extra 3%.

Priority Mail shipping is $24.99, insurance is an extra $15 if you want it. I ship the within 2 business days usually. Thanks for looking, feel free to reach me at 503 887 8713 if you have questions."

The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver incorporates a machined in triggerguard that is larger than a mil-spec trigger guard, which allows the trigger to be accessed with thick winter gloves.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver front and rear pivot points are reinforced to avoid breakage of the receiver even when high torque is applied when it is in the break down position

The custom machined match barrels used in RGUNS rifles and uppers are made from 4150 chrome-moly vanadium steel manufactured in the USA. Each 5.56 NATO barrel is properly head spaced with an M4 feed ramp extension installed.

Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded � -28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life. 

Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, as well as a pulled-button rifling, producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. Fluted models feature unique fluting designs to improve rigidity and aid in barrel cooling.

MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver is one of the most recent AR-15 Lower Receivers to hit the market. 
The MAG Tactical Systems AR-15 Lower Receiver is about 35 percent lighter than a standard aluminum receiver, and it is not plastic! 
The MAG Tactical Systems Generation 4 Lower is made of a proprietary magnesium alloy. The patented coating process that MAG Tactical Systems owns gives their lower extreme corrosion resistance characteristics.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver incorporates a machined in triggerguard that is larger than a mil-spec trigger guard, which allows the trigger to be accessed with thick winter gloves.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver front and rear pivot points are reinforced to avoid breakage of the receiver even when high torque is applied when it is in the break down position
Today’s warrior has been looking for a lower receiver that has the low weight and high feature list that the MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver has to offer.

The highlight is an M4-style bayonet (if you are aware of Mini 14's at all, you know what a big deal having a bayonet is) mounted on a BRAND NEW M4-style muzzle brake with winged front sight.  Other modifications on the rifle include a rear tech peep sight and a leather/green web sling.  

Extras include:  
-Original front blade sight (beat up a fair bit before I got it)
-Choate birdcage flash hider which slides over original front sight
-5 magazines (2 metal 40 round, one OEM steel Ruger 20 round, one BRAND NEW ProMag 20 round, one original Ruger 5 round)
-2 BRAND NEW magazine couplers to connect magazines together for quicker mag changes
-An extra magazine reinforcement bracket (if you want to be able to swap between two different stocks quickly)
-100 rounds of loose .223 ammunition
-A brand new weather-resistant ammo can with rubber seal to keep out rain, humidity, etc
-A soft rifle sleeve to protect the gun

I have a handful more new Promag 20 round magazines I would sell, or throw in for the right trade.  I also have a couple hundred rounds of PMC X-Tac 5.56 ammunition I could include for sale.

I haven't fired it since installing the new sights/muzzle break so it will need to be sighted in on the range, but I did bore-sight it as well as possible using a laser so it shouldn't need too much adjustment.  This is an older, used rifle so there's some wear to it.  A few dings in the stock and butt, some wear on the bluing, etc.  There's also some deep scratches on the mounting handle on the bayonet where the hole had to be enlarged to fit over the muzzle brake.  But everything is in great working order, and this is a unique Mini-14 for your collection or use.

Purchased to Coyote hunting, but never went due to bad heath. 72 years old. Just sighted in at Belton Gun Club. Has Barska 10 x 40 Power x 50 Scope with Red Lighted Mil-Dot Reticle. Green Long Range Tac-Llite [300 yards] Scope and Magazine are hand camo'd with 3M Viny to match gun which was factory camo'd. [see photos below]. ls deadly accurate at 300 Yards, probably much farther. An unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.

A bolt is used to hold the fixture in place and the top of the fixture is aligned parallel with the top of the receiver to align sear pin hole. There is a washer that is used to allow the fixture to clear the """"selector stops"""" on the receiver. There is still a small amount of milling that has to be done to allow for clearance for the sear in the receiver but that is explained in the fixture instructions and may be done with a dremel or on a drill press.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench from ATI]

ANECDOTAL:
Broker—While I liked the smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy – I thought the stock and grip too small and a bit awkward.

Mac—The good news for my friend is that Xtreme is designing a completely USA crafted AK with an adjustable stock (that’s a story for another day).

Deacon—The all American AK has been a long time coming. Since enactment of Bubba’s infamous assault weapons ban, perfectly good weapons have been mutilated overseas, stripped of the essentials and imported piecemeal to be rebuilt with selected U.S. components to make superior or inferior rifles depending on what side of the argument you choose to take. Having fired Soviet Bloc milled units in the past, I was pleased to see this rifle introduced by Xtreme Mfg.
The inherent greatness of the AK has been its low cost of manufacture, the simplicity of the machines needed to stamp out the parts by the score and readily field a combat ready weapon. Tolerances are loose by design and while this built in “rattle” provides us with a weather proof rifle, it also leaves us wanting for accuracy. The 7.62 X 39mm round has been badly maligned as being inaccurate. It ain’t the round, it’s the marriage of receiver, bolt and chamber that seats the round, properly spaces the projectile and preps it for our hands to send on its way. I have a friend in the North East who has been hunting deer for years

Broker: While I liked the Xtreme's smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy, I thought the stock and grip were too small and awkward.

with what he calls “Russian rounds” from a Savage bolt action with a Douglas Barrel he had chambered for the 39mm. He takes a ribbing for using the stuff but everyone enjoys his venison stew and that’s where the laughter stops.
It seems from all objective results that Xtreme has tightened tolerances and given us a solid receiver that will shoot on par with any AR upper chambered in the same round. If they pass on importing foreign furniture and sights and build entirely from U.S. components we’ll all benefit.
Made in America. You have to love that. Sure there is room for improvement but the folks at Extreme are listening to the guys in the field and tweaking as I write.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench from ATI]

ANECDOTAL:
Broker—While I liked the smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy – I thought the stock and grip too small and a bit awkward.

Mac—The good news for my friend is that Xtreme is designing a completely USA crafted AK with an adjustable stock (that’s a story for another day).

Deacon—The all American AK has been a long time coming. Since enactment of Bubba’s infamous assault weapons ban, perfectly good weapons have been mutilated overseas, stripped of the essentials and imported piecemeal to be rebuilt with selected U.S. components to make superior or inferior rifles depending on what side of the argument you choose to take. Having fired Soviet Bloc milled units in the past, I was pleased to see this rifle introduced by Xtreme Mfg.
The inherent greatness of the AK has been its low cost of manufacture, the simplicity of the machines needed to stamp out the parts by the score and readily field a combat ready weapon. Tolerances are loose by design and while this built in “rattle” provides us with a weather proof rifle, it also leaves us wanting for accuracy. The 7.62 X 39mm round has been badly maligned as being inaccurate. It ain’t the round, it’s the marriage of receiver, bolt and chamber that seats the round, properly spaces the projectile and preps it for our hands to send on its way. I have a friend in the North East who has been hunting deer for years

Broker: While I liked the Xtreme's smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy, I thought the stock and grip were too small and awkward.

with what he calls “Russian rounds” from a Savage bolt action with a Douglas Barrel he had chambered for the 39mm. He takes a ribbing for using the stuff but everyone enjoys his venison stew and that’s where the laughter stops.
It seems from all objective results that Xtreme has tightened tolerances and given us a solid receiver that will shoot on par with any AR upper chambered in the same round. If they pass on importing foreign furniture and sights and build entirely from U.S. components we’ll all benefit.
Made in America. You have to love that. Sure there is room for improvement but the folks at Extreme are listening to the guys in the field and tweaking as I write.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench from ATI]

ANECDOTAL:
Broker—While I liked the smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy – I thought the stock and grip too small and a bit awkward.

Mac—The good news for my friend is that Xtreme is designing a completely USA crafted AK with an adjustable stock (that’s a story for another day).

Deacon—The all American AK has been a long time coming. Since enactment of Bubba’s infamous assault weapons ban, perfectly good weapons have been mutilated overseas, stripped of the essentials and imported piecemeal to be rebuilt with selected U.S. components to make superior or inferior rifles depending on what side of the argument you choose to take. Having fired Soviet Bloc milled units in the past, I was pleased to see this rifle introduced by Xtreme Mfg.
The inherent greatness of the AK has been its low cost of manufacture, the simplicity of the machines needed to stamp out the parts by the score and readily field a combat ready weapon. Tolerances are loose by design and while this built in “rattle” provides us with a weather proof rifle, it also leaves us wanting for accuracy. The 7.62 X 39mm round has been badly maligned as being inaccurate. It ain’t the round, it’s the marriage of receiver, bolt and chamber that seats the round, properly spaces the projectile and preps it for our hands to send on its way. I have a friend in the North East who has been hunting deer for years

Broker: While I liked the Xtreme's smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy, I thought the stock and grip were too small and awkward.

with what he calls “Russian rounds” from a Savage bolt action with a Douglas Barrel he had chambered for the 39mm. He takes a ribbing for using the stuff but everyone enjoys his venison stew and that’s where the laughter stops.
It seems from all objective results that Xtreme has tightened tolerances and given us a solid receiver that will shoot on par with any AR upper chambered in the same round. If they pass on importing foreign furniture and sights and build entirely from U.S. components we’ll all benefit.
Made in America. You have to love that. Sure there is room for improvement but the folks at Extreme are listening to the guys in the field and tweaking as I write.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench from ATI]

ANECDOTAL:
Broker—While I liked the smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy – I thought the stock and grip too small and a bit awkward.

Mac—The good news for my friend is that Xtreme is designing a completely USA crafted AK with an adjustable stock (that’s a story for another day).

Deacon—The all American AK has been a long time coming. Since enactment of Bubba’s infamous assault weapons ban, perfectly good weapons have been mutilated overseas, stripped of the essentials and imported piecemeal to be rebuilt with selected U.S. components to make superior or inferior rifles depending on what side of the argument you choose to take. Having fired Soviet Bloc milled units in the past, I was pleased to see this rifle introduced by Xtreme Mfg.
The inherent greatness of the AK has been its low cost of manufacture, the simplicity of the machines needed to stamp out the parts by the score and readily field a combat ready weapon. Tolerances are loose by design and while this built in “rattle” provides us with a weather proof rifle, it also leaves us wanting for accuracy. The 7.62 X 39mm round has been badly maligned as being inaccurate. It ain’t the round, it’s the marriage of receiver, bolt and chamber that seats the round, properly spaces the projectile and preps it for our hands to send on its way. I have a friend in the North East who has been hunting deer for years

Broker: While I liked the Xtreme's smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy, I thought the stock and grip were too small and awkward.

with what he calls “Russian rounds” from a Savage bolt action with a Douglas Barrel he had chambered for the 39mm. He takes a ribbing for using the stuff but everyone enjoys his venison stew and that’s where the laughter stops.
It seems from all objective results that Xtreme has tightened tolerances and given us a solid receiver that will shoot on par with any AR upper chambered in the same round. If they pass on importing foreign furniture and sights and build entirely from U.S. components we’ll all benefit.
Made in America. You have to love that. Sure there is room for improvement but the folks at Extreme are listening to the guys in the field and tweaking as I write.

Make: Benelli Armi S.P.A. 

Model: M1 Super 90 

Serial Number: M259487

Year of Manufacture: 1996, Italian Proof Mark “BH” 

Caliber: 12 Gauge 3” or 2 ¾” Shells 

Action Type: Inertia-Operated Semi-Automatic

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “BENELLI ARMI S.P.A. – URBINO – MADE IN ITALY” . The right side of the barrel is marked “12 GA. 3” - FOR 2 ¾” OR 3” SHELLS / READ OWNER’S MANUAL BEFORE USING GUN”. The right side of the receiver is marked “HECKLER & KOCH.INC.-STERLING.VA.-MADE IN ITALY”. The left side of the receiver is marked “12 GA.-M1 SUPER 90- BENELLI -ITALY”. The underside of the receiver is marked with the serial number and Italian proof marks. The bolt is marked “BENELLI ARMI SYSTEM”. 

Barrel Length: 18 ½ ” 

Choke: Improved Cylinder .722

Sights / Optics: This shotgun is mounted with tactical ghost ring dipolar sights. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are synthetic with a pistol grip. The checkering on the forend and ribbing on the pistol grip are sharp. There are very few light handling scuff marks on the buttstock and forend. This shotgun was very well cared for. It likely spent a majority of its life in storage, waiting to be used. The LOP measures 14 ¼” from the trigger to the Benelli rubber recoil pad. The recoil pad is soft and pliable and fits the buttstock nicely. The stocks rate in about Excellent overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Matte

Finish Originality: Factory Original 

Bore Condition: The bore is Bright and Smooth. There is no apparent erosion. 

Overall Condition: This shotgun retains about 98% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows very light handling marks. Most of the marks are on the leading edges of the rear sight and on the left side of the receiver. The non-reflective finish makes these marks only visable at certain angles and do not take away from the overall appearance. The Screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. Overall, this shotgun rates in about Excellent condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We did not fire this shotgun. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: Sling

Our Assessment: This would make a great tactical home defense or 3 gun competition gun. Already boasting ghost ring dipolar sights, sling, and pistol grip, you’re a box of shotgun shells away from a competition grade shooter. Due to the inertia recoil system, the M1 should use heavier loads to cycle. However, the operating system uses the recoil giving the feel of shooting much lighter loads in comparison to a gas operating auto loader. Take a look at the top 3 gun shooters on YouTube, they all use a Benelli. The shotgun is in excellent condition and should not get passed up this Holiday season. You could even send this one to Taran Tactical Innovations and have the best tactical shotgun imaginable built."

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench. REDACTED"

Capacity: (30) Standard AR Magazines
Condition: New in Box


The F2000 is a modular weapon system; its principal component is a compact 5.56×45mm NATO-caliber assault rifle configured in a bullpup layout. The F2000 is a selective fire weapon operating from a closed bolt.
The rifle consists of two main assemblies: the barreled receiver group and the frame, coupled together by means of an axis pin located above the trigger guard. The barrel group has an integral MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail used to mount optical sights. The frame or lower receiver contains the trigger group, the bolt and bolt carrier assembly, return mechanism and magazine well. A removable handguard is installed in front of the trigger which completes and encloses the trigger guard.
[edit]Features
The FS2000 is a gas operated, semi-automatic and ambidextrous bullpup rifle. Both the safety system and trigger mechanism were adopted from the P90 personal defense weapon; the selector toggle is a rotating disc located below the trigger. The fire selector doubles as the weapon’s manual safety and secures the firearm against accidental discharge (the selector/safety disc has 3 settings: ""S""—safe, ""1""—semi-automatic mode, ""A""—fully automatic fire). The ""safe"" setting disables the trigger. The hammers, group pins, and springs are steel while all other components are nylon injection molding. The shell of the rifle is made of composite materials.
The F2000 is fed from standard NATO box magazines (STANAG 4179) with a 30-round cartridge capacity using 5.56×45mm ammunition. The magazine catch/release button is installed symmetrically in the pistol grip, in front of the magazine; the magazine catch is operated by an oversized actuator used when wearing NBC gloves. The F2000 is not configured from the factory to have a drop-free magazine system due to the friction from the removable dust gaskets. The magazine needs to be pulled out manually.
The rifle does not have a hold-open device; the bolt does not stay back after the last round is fired. The cocking handle is placed on the left side of the receiver, just above the handguard, and can be operated by left-handed shooters. There are no access points for the possible ingress of dirt or debris; the cocking handle slot is sealed.
The weapon’s primary sight is a telescopic sight with a fixed 1.6× magnification (the reticle also enables use in low-light conditions) contained in a plastic housing above the receiver (mounted on the MIL-STD-1913 rail), the secondary sight is a non-adjustable fixed notch and front blade, molded into the optical sight housing cover. The sight cover and sight module can be quickly removed to reveal the Picatinny rail.
The rifle’s chromed hammer-forged steel barrel is stated to retain accuracy after 20,000 normal (non-sustained) rounds. The barrel also features a flash suppressor with an angled cut at the tip which directs the muzzle blast upward, compensating for muzzle rise. The F2000 has an optional bayonet lug mounted near the muzzle, and an adjustable gas regulator with two settings: ""normal"" for standard ammunition meeting NATO specifications, and ""adverse""—used to send an increased volume of gas into the system to ensure proper functioning when fouled or when using low pressure ammunition."

I've got an excellent little Taurus Millenium PT145. This handgun has had a couple of hundred rounds through it so it shows normal wear for a gun with that type of wear (see pic). It hasn't been worn much as a conceal weapon though. This would make a great conceal weapon or a first handgun for many people since it is reliable and affordable.

Along with the handgun I am including (3) 10-rounds magazines, all factory Taurus, and a black plastic lockable case.

One of the things I love about Taurus firearms is their lifetime warranty. They warranty the gun for life, not the owner of the gun. So if you ever have a problem with the gun they stand behind it.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Purchased to Coyote hunting, but never went due to bad heath. 72 years old. Just sighted in at Belton Gun Club. Has Barska 10 x 40 Power x 50 Scope with Red Lighted Mil-Dot Reticle. Green Long Range Tac-Llite [300 yards] Scope and Magazine are hand camo'd with 3M Viny to match gun which was factory camo'd. [see photos below]. ls deadly accurate at 300 Yards, probably much farther. An unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.

New semi-automatic AR-15-style rifle developed with the predator hunter in mind
Free-floating button-rifled 0.680"" Muzzle OD Chrome-Moly barrels with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy

 I have spent several hours fully disassembling the weapon cleaning every bit of factory oil out of it. Re oiling it correctly. I resembled it and torqued everything to precise specs. Every screw on it is a torx head so I could torque it correctly. The scope it the same way painstakingly mounted to be correct and torqued down to 25 inch lbs. the action screws are at 50 inch lbs and the scope rings are at 50 inch lbs. the scope rail is at 25inch lbs. all have been marked so you can tell at a glance if they have moved at all. Break in included cleaning after every round for the first ten then after every other round for the next ten waitng until the barrel was cool between each round to break in the barrel.

794,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1397794,For Sale:  Remington [AR15] R-15 VTR Predator,"Simpsonville, SC, Greenville, South Carolina","$ 1,799","Listed On: Thursday, April 25, 2013",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"400 rounds of 40 Grain .223 fired in this gun. Purchased to Coyote hunting, but never went due to bad heath. 72 years old. Just sighted in at Belton Gun Club. Has Barska 10 x 40 Power x 50 Scope with Red Lighted Mil-Dot Reticle. Green Long Range Tac-Llite [300 yards] Scope and Magazine are hand camo'd with 3M Viny to match gun which was factory camo'd. [see photos below]. ls deadly accurate at 300 Yards, probably much farther. An unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.
