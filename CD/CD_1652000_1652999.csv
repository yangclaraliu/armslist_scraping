(#294)***NEW IN BOX*** BERETTA 92FS 9MM - MADE IN ITALY WITH TWO (2) 15-ROUND MAGAZINES.

Specifications

Action: Single / Double 
Caliber: 9 MM 
Barrel Length: 4.9 in. 
Capacity: 15 + 1 
Safety: Thumb Safety 
Grips: Synthetic 
Sights: 3-Dot 
Weight: 33.3 oz (Unloaded) 
Finish: Berettas exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. 

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. INOX version.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

We are an FFL and will do the DROS and FFL transfer for a combined $25 or we can ship it to your FFL. 
The P22 is a 3/4-size rimfire rendition of the famous Walther P99 center-fire pistol. One immediately noticeable difference besides the size is the P22’s external hammer. Its frame is made of polymer, and the slide is zinc alloy. Barrel, recoil spring guide, extractor and ejector are made of steel. The magazine is constructed of stainless steel with a polymer follower and bump pad. An interchangeable backstrap allows the grip to be customized to the shooter’s hand. Sights consist of a polymer ramp front sight with a white dot pressed into the slide and a polymer rear sight adjustable for windage with two white dots. Two additional front sights come with the pistol to adjust elevation. The P22 features a novel ambidextrous magazine release located at the bottom rear of the trigger guard. A nod toward the North American market, the magazine drops free with the activation of its latch."

AR-15 MAGAZINE.THESE ARE NIB.The next-generation PMAG 30RD GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

The gun itself is the value version of the Savage .410, the only difference being the material used for the stock and finish. It was made between 1926-1945, the 94A being the earliest model (that I know of). I'm FAIRLY positive this was purchased out of a Sears Catalog in the late 1920s but couldn't honestly say.

There are minor scratches on the stock and the finish on the metal has aged but is in generally good condition. The gun is in proper firing order and has been inspected by the trained professionals at Wades.

M1 Carbine
While this article is supposed to cover widely available surplus firearms, I couldn’t help including the M1 Carbine. It’s one of the only historic U.S. military firearms still somewhat available, and because there’s really nothing else quite like it.

It was initially developed to be a lighter, more maneuverable rifle than the standard service M1 Garand, with more power and precision than the 1911 and M1917 handguns. It first served in the European Theater in the hands of various branches of the military, most notably among paratroopers, forward artillery observers, officers and ammunition bearers. Later, in a select-fire version fitted with an infrared scope, dubbed the “T3” variation, it did yeoman’s duty at night during the Okinawan campaign. Select-fire M2s were heavily deployed during the Korean War, where they gained a reputation for jamming and had inadequate stopping power in extreme cold.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

The Ruger Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR) is a light, small-frame handgun with a smooth, easy-to-control trigger and highly manageable recoil. Its patent-pending polymer fire-control housing holds components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduces weight significantly and reduces recoil. An optimized friction-reducing cam results in a smooth, nonstacking trigger pull. The cylinder and barrel are supported by a monolithic, aerospace-grade aluminum frame treated with a black synergistic hard coat to reduce weight and enhance durability. The cylinder is strong 400 Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight and is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s durable Target Grey® finish. Five-shot capacity.

This handgun is a very good starter gun or to use for the CCW which is what I used it for. Hate to even get rid of it, but want to rifle. Hate to just see it sittin in the box not being used. I bought it earlier part of this year, got my CCW with it and decided to upgrade to the 9mm which I dearly love. I will not come down on the fee, I will however consider trading for the Ruger 10/22 rifle if you have one. I bought this handgun brand new. Its still in the box after achieving my ccw.

 INFO STRAIGHT FROM DD: The Daniel Defense LightWeight Package, part of our comprehensive line of Professional Operator Solutions, is built to meet the continually evolving rigors and requirements of today’s Law Enforcement mission. This package includes the Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, V5 Lightweight with our Cold Hammer Forged lightweight profile barrel, the new Daniel Defense DDM4 Rail™ 12.0, mid-length gas system and is perfectly outfitted with an Aimpoint Patrol Rifle Optic (PRO), fixed front & rear sights and MAGPUL PMAGS. The DDM4v5 LW is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimmed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This is one of the many features that create a rock solid platform that can be reliably counted on to deliver superior duty rifle service. The continuous flat top in conjunction with fixed front & rear sites and an Aimpoint PRO optic combination provides for a maximum field of view in regard to the suspect or target area, as well as the backdrop / potential round impact area. In other words, the operator can better observe and evaluate the down range area under stress, fatigue, low light situations and inclemement weather conditions.

When i put the clutch cover back on, i couldnt get the clutch to engage. Most likely just needs adjusted.

This units D.O.M. Is 1944 made by the French under German occupation during WW II. The term “Gray Ghost” came from the Gray phosphate finish and metal grips so commonly applied to these particular pistols. Very little if any of the original finish remains on this pistol, there seems to be pitting & fouling in the grooves of the bore but the lands are still strong and shiny. The magazine that accompanies this pistol is correct (according to the research we have been able to do). Overall this pistol is in great shape considering its age and would make a fine addition to a gun collection of pieces from that era.
