Looking for maybe a 125cc-250cc. Im 6'2/ 220 lbs so something that would fit me decently.
I am willing to add cash for the right bike.
Let me know what you have!

Or $500 cash

A ""Boat Tail"" is a sloping end which narrows gently at the base of the bullet, so that the cross-section resembles the shape of a boat's hull. The boat tail shape reduces drag on a bullet, helping it to retain velocity and resist deflection from crosswinds, but causes the bullet to take longer to ""settle"" after leaving the barrel compared to a standard ""flat-base"" bullet. Boat tail bullets are usually selected for long-range shooting, while the flat-base bullet shape tends to be more accurate at short ranges

Red in color.  209K miles.  Automatic transmission. 1.0L 3 cylinder engine. 42+ MPG  I will do my best to describe everything about this car, good and the bad.  Do remember it is 
a 21 year old car.  It is not new.  Overall, I would rate it a 6 out of 10 in comparison to any of these little cars left on the road.

Good:
Brand new 13 inch tires
New front wheel bearings
New calipers, rotors, and brake pads
Newer top- nice dark black- Not sun faded
Fresh transmission filter and fluid change- shifts great
Battery 1 year old
Fresh tune up including new Distributor cap, wires, and plugs
New Valve cover gasket
New Carpet but not professionally installed.  Looks nice though
New Water pump
Newer drive belts
New Distributor
Starts everytime and ultra reliable
$20 fills it up from dead empty.  Gas savings will pay for the car.  I average 42 MPG- not bad for a 21 year old car
Drive anywhere
Clear title in my name.
Tagged and driven once a week.  Drove to Louisiana a few weeks ago, and to Memphis and back today on less than 5 gallons of gas.  Did great.
Fun in the sun, and get lots of people asking about it.  Most younger people dont even know what it is
Newer paint job- was done professionally a few years ago.  Not faded.  A few small chips
No major dents or body damage

Bad
Drivers door latch broken.  I have the clip to fix it
All A/C components replaced.  Needs belt and freon to complete.  The compressor was purchased used and is insalled
3 small cracks on the dash
Seats are a little stained
All metros have rust.  Has some on passenger qtr panel, but none on rocker arms where they usually fail.  See pics
Aftermarket Radio works when it wants to

Extra parts included:
Haynes Manual
Starter- thought it was bad and replaced it only to find out all I needed was a fuse
Extra trim pieces and weather stripping for the seals- hard to come by, and they are expensive
Car cover
Assorted other Metro odds and ends

Most Machine Gun dealers want to give you 70% to 80% of the Value, so they can sell it for a HUGE profit.  Why sell to a Dealer and loose thousands of dollars.  It's easy, you just sell to another collector, NOT a dealer. 

I'm a collector and I want to buy your Machine Gun's. I don't resell them, I collect them. 

If you are a Collector and want to sell your gun to another Collector, Please call me.  I will consider buying any ""NFA Transferable Machine Gun"" 

Please no Gun Dealers.

I Prefer C&R guns but as long as the gun is ""Transferable"" it's not a problem.

If it not C&R we can transfer using a Class 3 Dealer. It's like $100 to the Dealer and another $200 for the Tax stamp. (I will pay those costs as the buyer).

 This like new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in my opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

 Comes with all accessories, including case, mags, and grips.

These pistols use a relatively rare rotating barrel locking system, in which the barrel rotates on recoil to unlock itself from the slide. The rotating motion of the barrel is controlled by the stud on its bottom, which follows the cam track in the steel frame insert.

The frame is made from lightweight aluminum alloy. This is an ""F"" specification pistol, made in Italy and featuring a recoil reducing, rotating barrel locking mechanism, a double action trigger, exposed hammer, and ambidextrous safety/decocking levers. Pistol has tritium night sights, a six round flush fit magazine and an eight round magazine with grip extension.

Comes with both original 8 round magazines and holster.  I have put about 200 rounds through it since I purchased it in 2000.  I am moving on to 1911 based .45s but this pistol is great and hard to find in .45 ACP.  At $450 it is a steal!"

Sale price 450 or best offer / or a trade for an AR-15 type rifle (of course I would offer cash towards the deal) but I am not in the market for anything super fancy.  

Included with the sale or trade is the rifle, scope, original cleaning kit that stores in the stock (not pictured), cleaning rod, original bolt cover (if you want to do away with the scope mount), 9 stripper clips, sling, and 170 rounds of 7.62x39 ammo. (one box is half empty)  Basically everything pictured is included.

Note on the scope; it does not block the iron sights, does not interfere with using stripper clips, nor does it get in the way of spent casings ejecting.   Reticle can also illuminate red or green (not night vision but does help use the crosshairs in low light).

I work in Durham and live in Knightdale so meeting places are flexible.

Somewhat strange weapon which was hastily developed in Croatia during its war for independence in early 1990s. Production and quality of this pistol (which was produced in at least two versions, short-barreled PHP MV 9 and long-barreled PHP VM 17) was sporadic, and it was soon replaced in production and use by much better and more modern HS 2000 pistol.
By design, this pistol represents a mix between Beretta 92 and Walther P38 pistols. The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols, the general appearance of the open-top slide is close to the Walther but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence. Trigger is of traditional double action type, and the safety consists of a manual decocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame. Magazines are double stack. 2 extra high capacity 15 round magazines are included with the pistol. Beretta 92 magazines work as well.

The Model 1076 is a 10mm semi-auto pistol that is a member of Smith and Wesson’s “third generation” models. The S&W 1076 is a double-action handgun made with a stainless steel frame that is currently out of production. The Model 1076 was adopted by the FBI in 1990 to replace less powerful 9mm handguns. The Model 1076s only lasted a few years in the ranks of the F.B.I. as critics claimed the recoil was excessively forceful.

This S&W in very good condition.  It features all stainless steel construction, DA/SA trigger, bobbed hammer, Sig style frame mounted decocker, Novak style 3 dot sights and does not have a magazine safety. Includes 1 magazine.  Grips are in good condition and not beat up or scratched.

This listing is NOT FOR A COMPLETE GUN, just the parts.  

What I have for sale is the following:

-TAPCO Intrafuse T6 tactical stock with straight and angled stock tubes and rubber butt pad.  I have all of the parts that came in this kit.

- Hogue slip on pistol grip sleeve.  This makes a HUGE difference in the feel of this stock

- See through optics mount.  This mount is standard picatinny style (Red dot NOT included in this sale)

- Vertical grip with extra railing and a spot to mount a pressure switch

- UTG low profile folding bipod

- Lots of rubber rail covers

-  Slip on flash suppressor with set screw attachment (allows you to keep your factory irons)

- 3 BattleDyne Industries AR 10/22 magazines.  25 round capacity. These mags can be taken apart and cleaned just like an AR magazine.  I only have 2 pictured but there will be 3 included with this sale.   (These are $30 a piece)

- BoTac Tactical single point sling (Made in the USA)

With this lot you can turn your 10/22 into one sweet trainer or range gun.  All of these parts have seen minimal use.  I have probably only fired less than 200 rounds through the gun since adding all of these parts.  They are all in clean, good condition.  I am selling to buy a stainless bull barrel.  Please contact me through this ad or call me.  Again, this listing is NOT for the complete gun.

ROUGH RIDER COMBOS (22 Long Rifle and 22 Magnum).

970-541-GUNS (4867)

Born of the Traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the Legendary Single Action Army Revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22 LR and .22 Magnum cartridges the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art-precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 

 The machined barrel is micro-threaded, and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes this Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are other grip materials available. For instance our Brilliant White Mother of Pearl and Elegant Black Mother of Pearl or Green Camo Laminate grips. Additional finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin and the deep matt black, low gloss Black Satin or Case Hardened Finish. 

 Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting. Let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver

PROUDLY MADE IN OUR USA. 

 All Heritage revolvers combine quality and affordability ... an American tradition.
