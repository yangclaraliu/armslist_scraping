Cash$450.00 Trade ValueThis was my first personal carry gun I had ever bought, not knowing anything about the gun. This particular model has been around for a long time and is the best choice for CCW, as stated in many different official ratings. Heavier loads can take down large animals if camping, or the self defense loads will stop your intruder with one pull of the trigger. I used this gun in specific to take down my deer last season. Hate to part with the thing, but I already have a CCW that was handed down to me that is quite a bit more expensive, so now the revolver sits in my safe. I have an ankle holster, belly holster, and self defense rounds that will come with the deal. Will trade for a AR-15 with cash on top for the right offer, or will take cash. Call or text is fine.REDACTED"

I purchased this gun, opened the box to look at it, and then put it in my gun safe where it has remained. The pistol has never been fired (by me - Ruger test fires all of its guns before leaving the factory and they ship out the test fired cartridge in the box).   I need cash fast (funeral expenses), so I looked on the site for the least expensive similar pistol in the same ""like new/new"" condition, and listed mine for less than that. It is literally the least expensive Ruger SR9 in this condition on this site.   About me: I am a private party.  Buyer pays UPS shipping:Ground $15.783 Day Select $35.722nd Day Air $44.88Next Day Air Early AM $122.29Next Day Air $90.34NOTE: I will refund back to PayPal any overpayment of the actual shipping costs.

High night sights and extended magazine capacity round out the package. Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots. First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a load of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

It is similar in size to a Glock 19. It came with 2-13rd factory mags and I ordered an additional factory mag for a total of 3. I also ordered H&K flat base plates for the magazines to facilitate easy carry and an H&K extended mag release lever, which I never installed. The pistol has sat in my safe completely un-fired since the day I brought it home(yes, not even 1 shot fired). I also ordered a Streamlight TLR-3 weapon light which is new, unopened in the package which will come with it. I have about $950.00 into this package. Please have NH ID and a P&R license.

I have now competed in USRA Bench rest matches since 2013 and it is time to let this rifle go to someone who will use it. The rifle has a 27 inch polished stainless steel SSGS barrel with a match chamber/ a recessed 90 degree target crown and a polished Harrell Tuner. The SSGS BR2 stock painted in a 3 stage automotive paint sceem. It has been painted pink, then rainbow metalic glitter, then a clear coat. You can barely see the glitter or shine of the clear coat but believe me in the sun the stock pops! Prior to painting the stock the stock was weighted with lead the total weight of the rifle stock, action, tuner, scope, forearm and butt plates is in excess of 15 pounds and was built for the Unlimited class of USGS/BR50-50 matches. The receiver is a stripped and polished Ruger 10/22, tuffer buffer bolt buffer, bolt, bolt charge handle, recoil spring and 6 ounce pull-2 stage trigger group is all Kidd parts. It is topped with a aftermarket scope rail Weaver 6 hole rings and Weaver T-24x fine cross hair target dot scope. The condition for the rifle is 99.9 and it comes in and with a 12""x4""x60"" hard case. I have a total of 20 pictures of this rifle that can be emailed upon request. I would suggest that you right click the pictures in this ad and open them again in another tab, then you can enlarge them to see better detail.I am asking $1500.00 for everything or $1200.00 minus scope and rings or $1050.00 minus scope, rings and tuner. I am willing to ship this rifle to your FFL in the lower 47 states, NO CALIFORNIA SALES. Buyer to pay an additional $50.00 for shipping costs, I will eat any additional cost in shipment due to size and weight of the rifle."

It also has Meprolight green tritium night sights that are very bright (only a couple of years old)   Handgun is in good condition but the duracoat has worn off in places due to the ALS metal lock up points in the Safariland holster. It has approx 500-600 rounds or so through it as it was mainly carried around the ranch rather than shot.  It cycles 230 GR ball ammo just fine but I have never run JHPs threw it. Comes with 8 8RD Chip McCormick SS magazines with removable base pad and 1 8 RD ACT blued magazine for a total of 9 mags. All mags are loaded with 230 GR ball ammo. Also comes with an extra 50RD box Freedom Munitions 230GR ball.  Handgun also comes with 2 holster setups. First one is a right handed FDE Safariland thigh rig that I put together. This is not the standard Safariland thigh holster with 2 leg straps. It only uses one leg strap as it sits up higher which makes it easier to run with (not swinging back and forth). Also allows the handgun to be out of the way if you are wearing full kit.  The rig also has the QLS Locking Fork and Receiver plate allowing you to switch out holsters or remove the holster if necessary. Total cost was around $200-225.

Mag carrier is used but holster is brand new as it just got back from being warrantied by KT Mech. Both are covered under KT Mech's lifetime warranty.

The rifle fires extremely well but the ejection pin (I believe?) could use a little care. For an 8mm it doesn’t kick hardly any and has always turned heads at the range. Will include 19 rounds of ammo (fired 1 too many during testing)Price is $175 (mainly due to gunsmith labor) OBO. NO TRADESTEXT ONLY: REDACTED"

It is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match. Its 15-round magazine is precisely engineered to take a dive to the prone position and naturally roll up toward the target. The checkered polymer frame has a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil, enhanced operator control, and a grip angle that provides unmatched natural point of aim. Four interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The 5.3″ cold hammer-forged stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to accept sound suppressors, compensators, and other accessories. The stainless steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights. Also offered as a non-threaded barrel model, ships with a 10rnd magazine. (State Compliant Model)LOG:52615"

An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting press checks. The DA/SA is available in 9 mm, .40 and .357 SIG. The DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging.

The XD-S Mod.2 features a higher hand position, enhanced grip texturing, thinner slide, available with an Ameriglo® Pro-Glo™ front sight (XDSG93345BT) with tactical-rack rear sight, and an enhanced trigger that advance this polymer-framed pistol’s acclaimed “point and shoot” ergonomics. Other features include a loaded chamber indicator and a grip safety that immediately readies the gun for action yet renders it virtually incapable of firing if dropped. The width of the grip is a mere .975”, and the Mod.2 grip texturing gives the operator a solid feel and secure hold of the pistol – especially important in defensive encounters. Longer Posi-Wedge™ serrations make the slide easier to grab and rack. The enhanced short-reset and consistent trigger is the perfect choice for a defensive carry pistol.

Features factory metal bdm, 10 round magazine, large tactical bolt knob, and EGW brand picatinny rail. I spray painted the stock a camo pattern and installed a home made kydex cheekrest and a surplus ak47 sling to it. The scope is a made in Japan Sightron SIII 6-24x50 lrmoa which has .25moa target turrets and the MOA-2 second focal plane reticle. Extremely good glass and tracks awesome. The .25 moa center dot in the reticle makes shooting groups easy. Comes with the sunshade but has a mark on it from rubbing something inside my back pack. Also has a butler creek cover on the objective but missing the one for the ocular. The rings are Burris Signature XTR which allow you to cant the scope with provided spacers, I have it set to cant about 45 moa to maximize the Sightrons elevation turret. Vortex bubble level already leveled to the reticle. I have shot this combo out to 1200 yards with Hornady 140gr hpbt handloads. Shoots .5 moa and has 620 rounds down the tube so plenty of life left. Recently upgraded to another rifle and scope so no need for this one anymore. Willing to ship at buyers expense."

The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and the deeply recessed combat muzzle crown protects the rifling. The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows one cartridge at a time to be loaded should the magazine be lost or damaged. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door. Beretta's exclusive Bruniton non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear-resistant finish, and the reversible magazine release is positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. The 92 FS pistol is the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history, and this model is made in Italy.

The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance, while the deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown protects the rifling. The open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping allows for one cartridge at a time. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table or door. The Beretta exclusive Bruniton non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear-resistant finish. Its reversible magazine release is positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters. This model has a stainless barrel with an alloy frame, and a 15-round magazine.
