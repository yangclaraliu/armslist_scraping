Also comes with 150 rounds (3 boxes) of Herter’s 9mm Luger 115 gr FMJ and One box minus 7 cartridges of Hornady Critical Defense 9mm Luger 115 gr FTX.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

The GLOCK 36 packs 6 rounds of .45 Caliber Auto stopping power in a package that fits the hands of most any user. In the SLIMLINE™ design, GLOCK has incorporated the use of a single stack magazine. The G36 measures only 1.13 in. in width which makes controlling recoil very simple. The G36 is easy-to-use, hard to see, and tough to face.

This is a single-shot ""break-barrel"" 12-gauge with exposed hammer. Meaning you can leave it loaded & ready but de-cocked, for home defense without worry of wearing out the springs. This gun has a 3"" chamber, so it will take just about every size of 12ga shell made (except the 3-1/2""s, but who even has those?!)

I have only fired it about 100 times since bought new, so the bore is still shiny like a mirror. The most fun thing about this gun is using the ejector to fling the empty shells at your friends when they criticise your shooting skills. They can fly about 10 feet, so be careful. Haha.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Huldra Mark IV Tactical Elite’s patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer free float forearm (with anti-rotational tabs) and extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you a longer, more ergonomic grip, as well as a longer sight radius between the front and rear sights for quicker acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. The 4.5 pound JP Trigger (a $259.95 value) gives you a perfectly crisp, precise break and extremely short reset. The complete absence of take-up and over-travel provides the best combination of speed and precision on the market. The ambidextrous safety allows you to flip off the safety on either side of the weapon. The rugged Mil-Spec Vltor IMod Stock has an extremely comfortable superior cheek weld with a non-slip removable butt pad. Each side compartment of The Vltor IMod can hold two AA or three lithium CR123 3-volt batteries and accepts a push-button, quick detachable sling swivel. The Ergo Grip is solid and comfortable. Its superior texture reduces slippage, even while wearing gloves and is virtually impervious to oils and solvents. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control."

Rugged Enough to Pass a 36"", Fully Loaded Drop Test

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the ultimate refinement in AR/M4 stock technology. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. Our stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle.

The Nano's extremely low profile, snag-free design makes it easy to carry
and draw from concealment. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis
the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is
simple to disassemble and maintain. The light, durable frame employs
thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass-reinforced
techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user-adjustable with a 1.3mm hex
wrench. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine
release button can be easily reversed. Modular structure, ergonomics and
ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The USA.

Want to buy one, prefer private party. Willing to pay exactly what the gun shop is charging, I'm buying one private party or via a store today. If your looking to sell, I would pay the same price as new for a great condition lightly used rifle. That's right at 1200 with taxs. if it's used a little more but includes additional magazines or accessories to offset the decreased value I will pay you the new price. 

If not, keep your rifle you bought in hopes of scamming somebody out of a few hundred, will never fire, and nobody will buy because private parties will be required to go through the same hoops as reputable shops. Times are tough enough, last thing this community ever wanted was this sort of highway robbery."

It’s NOT a Polymer Magazine. One Piece Wrap Around, Hardened Steel Feed Lips won’t bend or break, steel reinforces the back of the polymer body.



NOT a Steel Magazine. Lightweight polymer body is impact resistant from -40F to 180F, won’t dent like steel and weights the same as aluminum

The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage.

An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.



The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few and is available in 10, 20 and 30 round capacity with a translucent or opaque polymer body.

The L5AWM Translucent Advantage for professionals:
 •Increases Op-Tempo •Pre-combat inspections and checks
 •Post contact checks
 •Speeds ammunition consolidation

•Tactical Magazine Changes •The aggressive body texture improve gripping
 •Drops free from lower receivers
 •The magazine is designed to resist damage from rough handling, dropping and abuse

•Vehicle Storage •The L5AWM can be stored loaded in unconditioned environments; from +180F to -50F

•Ammunition Carry Policy •Rapidly know what’s loaded

•Shared Resources – expedites shift change •Know your round count
 •Translucency allows range or shift personnel to see if their magazine is serviceable

•Training Safety •Visual inspection lets everyone know how many rounds are on the firing line
 •Quickly Identify what’s loaded; live rounds, blanks or marker rounds

I could not add the FTJ bio info as I discovered it was copyrighted. However,during the early 1900s Frank Tenney Johnson worked and sketched on a cattle ranch near Hayden, Colorado,attended an early Frontier Days celebration in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and ventured south to Navajo country. All of this influenced both his career and his personal life. It was possibly during this time that he obtained this Colt.) This gun is from the William Ruger Collection and was purchased from his grandson. It is reported to have belonged to Frank Tenney Johnson, a famous Western artist active at the same time as Russell and Remington. The .41 Colt, the holster and gun belt, and the display case are all from the Ruger Collection. Also included, is a framed authenticated print of a 1936 Frank Tenney Johnson painting, ""On the Range"", which was added at a later date. The gun is in excellent mechanical condition and fine cosmetic condition. Case hardening remains on the hammer and frame and the original blue has thinned except on the barrel next to the frame. All serial numbers match, except the loading gate which, as is normal, has an assembly number, and the grips fit well, but are worn. The holster has a tear at the muzzle end, probably from being drawn repeatedly. There are some ""dings"" on the barrel just forward of the "".41 Colt"", and I have no idea what may have caused them. It is apparent that Tenney did not leave this weapon in a closet. This weapon would be an outstanding acquisition for a collector who can display it properly. I cannot, and hence, am selling it to someone who can showcase it as it deserves. The gun was manufactured in 1899"

That wish is now a reality in the form of the 10/22 Takedown—a synthetic and stainless carbine that separates into two major sections quickly and easily without tools.

The new gun has 19 unique parts, including the receiver, which cannot be 
Its two-piece carbine-style polymer stock features a curved, checkered butt and molded-in checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end. The 18 1/2-inch, stainless-steel barrel has a dovetail slot at its rear that mounts a fully adjustable folding leaf sight while an integral band-style boss near the muzzle mounts a blade topped with a 0.650 inch brass bead. A silver-anodized aluminum scope rail that accepts both Weaver-style and 3/8 inch dovetail rings is included and mounts to the receiver with four slotted machine screws.
Unique to the 10/22 Takedown is an included black nylon zippered carry bag with interior sleeves that accommodate the rifle’s sections along with two exterior pockets for accessories. It has a carry handle at its top and D-rings at its corners that could accommodate backpack straps, but they are not included. The case’s size and shape allows for discreet transport of the rifle along with spare magazines, ammunition, tools and other supplies. 
Comes with 1 brick of 22 long rife
