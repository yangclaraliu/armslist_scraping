I DO NOT want opinions. If you're a lawyer, even better. 

What is the legal age to buy/own/possess a handgun in the state of Illinois? I'm asking for the age of a private party transaction, not through an FFL. The federal age for private party is 18.

Here's where it gets confusing, Illinois has an age limit on foid cards (21), unless you have parental consent. I've read through the statutes concerning this matter, and my interpretation is that >18 but <21 may own, possess, and purchase any type of firearm through a private party transaction. Of course, records will be kept, waiting periods as well. 

Please, if you have some factual based evidence that would help me in this matter, please let me know. If you attempt to be rude or uncivil, I'll just ignore it.

Ps. Calling the ISP or DNR gets you nowhere. Some say they don't know, some say 21, some 18. When asked to provide some proof or statute support, no one has time for you. Our state is a joke when it comes to legal firearm owners."

Unfortunately us Colorado residents will no longer be able to purchase these after July 1st when the magazine ban goes into effect. Get them while you can. $45ea. Not looking for any trades. Thanks"

Sorry to sound like a jerk but people treat armslist like its Craigslist and want to get something for nothing.I have a really nice glock 22 gen 2 which is the glock that doesnt have the finger grooves. Most people actually prefer this and alot wonder why glock went to the finger grooves which force your hands into a particular hold. I have heard if you have big hands(which I dont) and the grooves cramp your fingers than a gen2 is what you want. Most people that don't like the feel of a glock do not realize its the finger grooves that are uncomfortable,this gun fits like a glove. I have seen many 3rd gen glocks that have been modified and had the finger grooves removed. Comes with 2 mags , all glock oem,box. It is in great shape and doesn't have many rounds through it( I got it from original owner) and no major wear that I can discern. $395 firm  (NO LOW BALLERS please, this isn't a police trade that the finish is worn off of)  . Must be willing to sign bill of sale and be a current va resident. Thanks for looking. 

If you are going to send BS offers please don't bother and waste my time. I don't have to sell this gun nor is it a piece of crap . I actually really really like this gun and my fiance is the only reason it must go , she says I have too many.  This is an original gen2 glock in excellent condition and will serve your home protection or carry needs for years and years. My price is more than fair. If you want a beat up glock try your luck on gunbroker and see if you win one but you will be surprised what they go for.

The All-Round Talent

GLOCK 19 ""GENERATION 4""


The GLOCK 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in security services. In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. For instance, many of the elite pilots of the USAF for instance trust the GLOCK 19 for their efficient defense in emergency situations. 

The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested
“Safe Action” system
durable exterior finish
cold hammer forged barrel
durability
reliability
light weight

... that make GLOCK firearms famous!

The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back strap) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.

The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.

The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.

    The smallest back strap is integrated in the GLOCK MBS Frame reducing the trigger distance of the standard size frame by 2 mm. The medium back strap is a 2 mm back strap offering equal size of a standard frame. The large back strap is a 4 mm back strap.

    The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.

    Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.

    Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the recoil while simultaneously increasing the life cycle of the assembly.

All GLOCK pistols are backed by the GLOCK Limited Lifetime Warranty and world-class customer service and support that is second to none in the firearms industry!"

You can read a review of this model here: GunBlast.com Review 

The DT Sport proved to be one hundred percent reliable, as expected. The carbine fed, fired, and ejected every cartridge perfectly. Accuracy was excellent, especially considering the mil-spec trigger. I do much better work with a match trigger, such as the Alexander or Timney, but this carbine is built for fighting, and the trigger is well-suited to that task. The AR-15 is a wonderful concept, and Del-Ton executes it very well. The Del-Ton rifles are built very well, and just because the DT Sport is one of the most affordable AR-15 carbines available, does not mean that it sacrifices on quality. The DT Sport has everything that you need, and nothing that you don’t. It performs as well as rifles costing three times the price, and buying a basic rifle such as this leaves a lot more cash to purchase a good optic, plenty of extra magazines, and ammunition. You can’t have too much ammunition. The stuff keeps well, needs no refrigeration, and several thousand rounds will fit neatly under your bed. Buy it while you still can.

I will save you some time researching. The Remington 710 was made from 2001 to 2006. There were complaints about the stiffness of the bolt. It is a scaled down version of the Remington 700 rifle. It is not comparable to the $719 rifle it was made as a cheaper version of. You will have no problems with this gun if you keep it clean and properly lubricated.  I haven't. These were $379 without the scope and bipod. It is a great hunting rifle or range rifle. Again, not as good as a $750 gun, but one heck of a rifle for $250. You won't be disappointed.

It has 200 rounds through it and I have put an Apex Tactical Hard Sear in it which vastly improves the trigger of this gun. This is the best shooting gun of this size that I have ever shot. 

The reason I am selling it is because I am not really fond of the thinness of it. The thinness would make it a great carry piece, it's just not for me.  It will come with all the stuff from the factory, the Apex Tactical Hard Sear already installed as well as the original sear, and a Desantis Nemesis pocket holster. 

Price is $600 but negotiable.

I am not interested in trades at this time unless it is a Gen 4 Glock.

Please do not low ball me or email me asking if it is still available; if it is still listed it is still available. I prefer to be contacted only through the contact seller button. Face to face and cash only in the Tri-Cities area. Thanks for your time."

FN Herstal is discontinuing the FS2000 this year, so the bullpup is now a highly collectible rifle that will only appreciate in price as time goes on.

If you would like to see any specific pictures, feel free to let me know, and I will email them to you.

Local face-to-face transaction preferred, but I am willing to do FFL Transfer / Shipping as well. 

USPS Money Order is preferred to protect both the buyer and seller from fraud. PayPal and Amazon Payments is also an option, but not recommended. Shipment will occur when BOTH the payment is complete/cleared and the buyer's FFL is received.

No sales to Hawaii nor to any state where prohibited. Buyers are responsible for knowing their state, and local, gun laws. I will not ship to any FFL in a state that has laws prohibiting 'assault weapons' or that prohibits the ownership of firearms as configured."

SUPPRESSOR: The 5.56 Saker is the most advanced rifle suppressor on the market. Packed with features never before offered in the industry, the Saker is yet another ground breaking product offered by Silencerco. The Saker has an interchangeable front cap feature for different purposes such as a flash hider. The baffles are made from an exotic material that has never been offered in silencers and is approximately 30% stronger than Inconel®. The Saker has several patent pending technologies that place it leagues above it’s competition. Made for durability, accuracy, and function, the Saker is Superior Silence. FEATURES Silencerco’s Multiple Accessory Attachment Device (MAAD) allows you to interchange the Saker’s mount so that you can attach the Saker to your preexisting quick detach mount and save hundreds of dollars. This patent pending baffle technology protects the Saker’s baffles from erosion thus increasing its durability. Much as armor on an armored vehicle deflects the debris from an IED, the Hoplon Baffle deflects debris and cuts down on baffle erosion up to 90%. The TrifectaRS flash hider is the most advanced quick detach mount on earth. The RS stands for Resonance Suppression which is a patent pending technology that keeps the flash hider from ringing like a tuning fork. The TrifectaRS also allows the Saker to be attached and detached from the rifle quickly with one hand.

Uses standard AR mags. Winner of this auction will also be able to buy optics, ammo, etc at a discounted price. Please contact us if you have any questions. Please see following from IWI website.... At the end of the 1982 Israel-Lebanon War arose an understanding that the modern battlefield had changed. One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts. The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines"

The gun is is excellent shape. Comes factory with one of the best match grade triggers I've ever used & it is very accurate as well. One factory mag & one Wislon Combat mag. The holster is an excellent holster made of horsehide & Kydex. I bought it from a local company here in FL called RBHolsters... very comfortable & stable.

The CZ 52's operating controls consist of a single-action trigger, an external hammer, a magazine catch located at the heel of the grip frame, and a combination de-cock/safety lever located on the left rear side of the receiver aft of the left grip panel. The manual safety blocks movement of the sear, which prevents the hammer from releasing and firing a round. A second safety, in the form of a spring-loaded firing pin block, prevents the pistol from firing unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear; this feature renders the pistol ""drop safe""."

Pretty amazing piece of history here, Rifle is not new (duh) and has lots of character, it has not been refinished, and I would say it is in ""Good"" condition. 100+ years old, I have shot it, but that was 30+ years ago. Seems a shame to keep this conversation piece locked up where nobody can see it. Adventure Outdoors has one for $2,000 and mine looks better. Not a ""have to sell"" just wanting to see if anybody out there has been looking for one. Please don't waste my time, or yours, with low-ball offers, if you want a rifle to kill squirrels this is probably not the one, but she has killed dozens."

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact-resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floor plate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

This latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floor plate when not in use to prevent possible loss. 


Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer
Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes.

The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines.

The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate."

The 10mm seems to be really making a comeback in popularity with ballistics more impressive than the 45ACP.

Comes with 2 mags and everything you would expect to receive as new.

You know having one of these is on your list, so get it now while you can still find them new since I believe Colt has also stopped making this newer version as well.

At this point since I am just listing it, I do not want to ship out of state right now and go through the hassle so local FTF transaction only.

Price is $1500 FIRM  Now this is a pet peeve of mine. I put FIRM, yet still get people offering less.  I will not respond to these offers at all!!!

Now, I did not just pull a random number out of head for a price.  I found about 4 or 5 of the exact same model brand new over the last 2 months and monitored the auction price on gunauction.com.  Some started a .01 with 30 bids usually ending at almost exactly $1500 and others with a starting price higher with a sale price again at almost or at $1500 and others simply put a flat rate for ""Buy it Now"" for $1500 and every single one sold.  So I know this is what I can get.  It would cost me probably $20 for gunauction's sellers fees, but it wouls cost the buyer who almost always pays for sellers FFL to ship it out which includes my FFL's fee and shipping which the price varies between $40 and $60 depending if you get insurance.  Then you have to pay about $25 to $40 for your FFL to receive the gun and then if you use a credit card almost everyone charges 3% for that.  So all these people paying the $1500 on gunauction after all fees are auctually paying $1600 or more.  So that is how I got my price.  No shipping and waiting and hoping it doesn't get damaged.

I do not need to sell. Obviously I prefer a straight green cash money sale!!!! I am only considering a trade for something uncommon, such as a 10mm revolver, Kimber Eclipse, Desert Eagle, high quality bolt actions preferably with octagon barrel. Other trades I might consider are: a newer model crossbow. Also may consider a excellent condition lever action, no junk!
Really not looking for anything with scratches all except possibly the crossbow.

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact-resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floor plate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

This latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floor plate when not in use to prevent possible loss.

Ok; guys here’s what I have. This is a standard Mosin Nagant Trigger that has been accurized by creating a fully adjustable and tuneable set screw into the trigger. After searching and searching. After buying parts after parts I finally figured it out. After much trial and error here is the full and best way to accurize your rifle.  Included are all the other necessary items to completely transform that crappy creepy long hard pull of the Mosin Trigger into the shortest crispest and butter smooth trigger you can put on the gun. 
What do you get?
1-	Original issue trigger that has been altered to take a set screw allowing you to have a fully adjustable trigger with friction reducing performance.
2-	Set screw (already installed) this makes your trigger fully adjustable keeping that smooth action. 
3-	Spring. This keeps the trigger in the correct position while not actively being used. It also creates a two stage trigger. When you pull you will feel when the trigger engages. The next bit of pull and BANG. 
4-	Washers (3). Used as a spacer between the sear and the rifles receiver this sets the sear in a better position for a shorter trigger pull. Mix and match to get the best position for the sear and trigger combination for your rifle.  
Guys this is all you need to take one of the most accurate guns in the world and turn it into the most pleasurable gun in the world to shoot. This helps with accuracy and with pulling off target due to a slow long hard creep trigger."

The stock is black synthetic and it has a big honking He-Ne GAS laser under the barrel. The trigger turns it on (something like an accutrigger). The buttplate opens to reveal the battery pack. I am told that the stock is full of capacitors and other goodies for the laser (which still works). It has pushbutton QD sling swivels.
The only markings I could find (execpt the standard Ruger rollmarks) was under the buttplate ""Laser Products Inc."" with an address in CA and a date code of 06-86.
The fit and finish makes me think this is some kind of limited run because it is very well done.  I only have the stock and laser and the stock is in two pieces, I am very open for offers on this thing!"

 SUPPRESSOR: The 5.56 Saker is the most advanced rifle suppressor on the market. Packed with features never before offered in the industry, the Saker is yet another ground breaking product offered by Silencerco. The Saker has an interchangeable front cap feature for different purposes such as a flash hider. The baffles are made from an exotic material that has never been offered in silencers and is approximately 30% stronger than Inconel®. The Saker has several patent pending technologies that place it leagues above it’s competition. Made for durability, accuracy, and function, the Saker is Superior Silence. FEATURES Silencerco’s Multiple Accessory Attachment Device (MAAD) allows you to interchange the Saker’s mount so that you can attach the Saker to your preexisting quick detach mount and save hundreds of dollars. This patent pending baffle technology protects the Saker’s baffles from erosion thus increasing its durability. Much as armor on an armored vehicle deflects the debris from an IED, the Hoplon Baffle deflects debris and cuts down on baffle erosion up to 90%. The TrifectaRS flash hider is the most advanced quick detach mount on earth. The RS stands for Resonance Suppression which is a patent pending technology that keeps the flash hider from ringing like a tuning fork. The TrifectaRS also allows the Saker to be attached and detached from the rifle quickly with one hand.


 IT ALSO INCLUDES A SUREFIRE MOUNTED ON THE SIDE AND A LAXERLYTE LASER !!
