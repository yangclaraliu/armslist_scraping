PEOPLE POST THINGS SAYING THERE ARE DEALERS EVEYWHERE THAT STILL SELL AT RETAIL PRICES BUT WHEN YOU GO THERE THEY HAVE NOTHING IN STOCK BECAUSE THEY GOT ONE OR TWO RIFLES AND SOLD THEM IN A SECOND! THE SAME GOES FOR AMMUNITION. TRY TO FIND .22 LR, .223/5.56, .40, .45 ACP, .308 / 7.62 AMMUNITION AT ANY STORE AND IF THEY HAVE IT IS IS A LIMIT OF 2 BOXES AND THEY ALREADY RAISED THIER PRICES OR GO TO ANY WEBSITE AND THE PRICES ARE 5 OR 10 TIMES AS HIGH AS THEY WERE BEFORE THE HYSTERIA BEGAN IN DECEMBER.

YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ITEMS ARE NOW GOING TO BE COMMODITIES LIKE GOLD, SILVER, AND STOCKS AND BONDS. PEOPLE ARE WAITING IN LINE TO BUY ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW AND SELLERS ARE GETTING PREMIUM PRICES. JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS PAYING FOR AN ITEM DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN EMAIL PEOPLE NASTY THINGS AND TELL PEOPLE THEY ARE CRAZY. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING AFTER THE BANS START HAPPENING. THEN YOU WILL SEE $500 GUNS GOING FOR $5,000.00 AND UP.

BEFORE THE BRADY BILL PASSED YOU COULD BUY COLT AR15'S FOR ROUGHLY $549 EACH. THE DAY AFTER THE BRADY BILL PASSED THOSE SAME RIFLES WERE BEING SOLD FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS AND UNTIL THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WAS LIFTED YOU COULD BARELY BUY ANYTHING AT ALL. THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT. WE HAVE A PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS HELL BENT ON TAKING AWAY OUR SECOND AMENDMENT AND EVERY STATE IS INTRODUCING BILLS AND PASSING LEGISLATION TO LIMIT OUR RIGHTS AND TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS.

BUY WHAT YOU CAN NOW AND PUT IT AWAY AND MAYBE SOMEDAY YOU CAN BUY A CAR FOR THE MONEY YOU GET FROM SELLING AN AR15! I FOR ONE WILL SELL MY THINGS FOR WHATEVER ANYONE IS WILLING TO PAY FOR THEM AS THE HIGHEST BIDDER AND WILL NOT FEEL BAD FOR A SECOND!"

Although the ammo is available, these rifles are not. Very hard to find a complete S&W. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. Please just compare apples to apples. Complete M&P15R to complete M&P15R, that is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of their rare discontinued status these will continue to climb in value even after the market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson is pleased to announce the M&P15R Rifle (along with the new Upper Receiver Assembly). This new rifle is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifles come with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.
