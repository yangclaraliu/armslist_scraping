This is a rifle for a avid real hunter, long range target;shooter. Or collector of fine weapons that you only come upon  once in a great while. FTF sale Tampa areas. $2500.

These are the communist Chinese variant of the famous M-44, and saw hard use during their time in service. In addition to their service with the Chinese, they were fielded by other communist forces before being supplanted by the SKS and later AK/AKM rifles.
These are admittedly in pretty rough shape, but will make a neat conversation piece, Vietnam ""captured weapons"" display or wall hangers. You could probably also shoot them, but given their rough appearance I give no warranty or advice on if that is a good idea. They are completely mis-matched, with little metal finish remaining. The bores are rough, but still have a decent amount of rifling left. The stocks are beaten up, showing excellent character! They have dings, dents, gouges and a few cracks (worst one shown in picture 3). The top yellow-ish colored stock is in slightly better condition than the lower reddish one. 
The top rifle also has an intersting 3-sided bayonet, as opposed to the more usual ""cruciform"" bayonet found on most M-44s / T-53s. I'm not sure if this is a prototype, mistake, or SKS bayonet pressed into service, but it is kind of neat and unusual. 
I have a bunch of pictures I can text or email, so please contact me for them. I'm asking $150 each or $275 for both. They are worth about that in spare parts, so I'm not ready right now to go much lower."

This obviously does not affect function. Gun was shot very little and is in great shape. It shoots great. I bought to try out H&K and like my 1911 better. This gun is Variant 3(double action/single action, decocking lever, but no safety) The (lever on left) provide the user with a frame-mounted decocking lever that does not have the ""safe"" position. This combination only allows the hammer to be lowered from SA position to DA position. It does not provide the ""safe"" position to prevent the pistol from firing when the trigger is pulled."

This particular rifle didn't see service in that war most likely, but was used hard enough during its time with the Spanish to near an arsenal overhaul sometime around the period of the Spanish Civil War. This was accomplished by fitting it in a new stock, grinding away old markings, stamping new serial numbers and rebluing the metal. The result was a ""new"" rifle ready to continue on in service. Fortunately for collectors, bolt action rifles quickly became obsolete after WW2 and these saw only light use post-war. 
Both the metal and wood finish on this rifle are in very good shape. There is some odd finish-loss near the muzzle and on the floorplate. It almost looks like it was an error during the arsenal re-bluing, or may have been someone being sloppy with solvents later on. Either way it doesn't signficantly detract from the overall look of this rifle.
The bore is shiny, with good rifling. This fires the well-regarding 7mm Mauser which was a revolutionary cartridge in its day. I have more pictures, so please contact me through here and I'll send them either by email or text. 
I'm willing to meet in the Carlisle / Mechanicsburg / Camp Hill area. I can also ship to a FFL (01 or 03), but that will cost $40 due to the length/weight and I will require payment by Postal MO or PP ""friends and family""."

Universal plastic powder funnels have several issues that are solved with this system:1. Static cling. Plastic is prone to being charged with static and kernels of powder will stick to the walls causing you to have to tap the funnel to get them all to fall.2. No such thing as universal. There are always cases that just wont work well with the universal design, and funnels tip off and spill powder, or they just plain wont fit.3. Universal means that it has a hole meant for 22 caliber. So if you are trying to dump 90 grains into a big magnum, you are waiting a long time for the powder to fill.The Area 419 Funnel’s interchangeable heads thread onto the funnel and are neck-diameter specific for each caliber. They do not rely on fitting over the body of the case to hold in place. They are sized slightly larger than the neck diameter so that they hold solid on the case. Each head has a bore sized a few thousandths smaller than the bullet diameter, so maximum flow is achieved for each caliber. This is huge for the super ultra magnum guys (375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac, 50 BMG, etc). The interface between the heads and the funnel is designed in such a way that no kernels can ever get stuck between the two, as long as the head is tightened completely.The Funnel’s design is both aesthetic and performance driven. Being machined from a solid billet of 6061-T6 aluminum means no static charge to cling kernels to the funnel walls. This also makes it far safer for use with black powder.“Flutes” on the outside are for looks, on the inside though, they disturb the powder kernels from trying to jam up at the neck. It also gives some airspace so they do not get packed up so tightly, all aimed to increase flow through the nozzle.3/8″ tall straight section at the top to help prevent kernels of powder from bouncing out when poured in.Smooth surfaces at the neck of the funnel and inside the heads promote quick flow and prevent any sticking kernels.NEW! Machined in handles to give you a grip if you like to grab the funnel from the side instead of top. Symmetrical design means the funnel no longer tips to the side.MADE IN USA! From USA made aluminum, on a USA made HAAS mill, with USA made cutting tools!Billet Storage BlockMachined in house from a solid billet of 6061-T6 aluminum, every single surface of the block is machined.Holds the funnel with or without a head attached as well as 10 spots for heads or drop tubes to be stored.Front six head storage locations are engraved for standard calibers as well as color coded to match the funnel heads anodizing.Rubber feet on the bottom keep from sliding around on your bench.Can be shipped, buyer responsible for shipping.search: long distance shooting, benchrest, RCBS, Sartorius, pistol, revolver, shotgun"

Use this if you either want an additional funnel for a set you already own, or if you only reload one caliber and want to save some money. Add the interchangeable heads HERE. See either the “Reloader Kit” which includes the funnel and six heads, “Master Kit” which includes six heads and a storage block. Or finally the “Ultimate Kit” which includes the entire “Master Kit” PLUS a 50 place cartridge reloading block engraved with your choice of caliber.The Area 419 billet aluminum powder funnel uses a system of interchangeable, caliber specific, heads to make it the ultimate funnel for reloaders available today. Universal plastic powder funnels have several issues that are solved with this system.1. Static cling, plastic is prone to being charged with static and kernels of powder will stick to the walls causing you to have to tap the funnel to get them all to fall.2. No such thing as universal. There are always cases that just wont work well with the universal design, and funnels tip off and spill powder, or they just plain wont work.3. Universal means that it has a hole meant for 22 caliber. So if you are trying to dump 90 grains into a big magnum, you are waiting a long time for the powder to fill.The Area 419 Funnel’s interchangeable heads thread onto the funnel and are neck diameter specific for each caliber. The do not rely on fitting over the body of the case to hold in place. They are sized slightly larger than the neck diameter so that they hold solid on the case. Each head has a bore sized a few thousandths smaller than the bullet diameter, so maximum flow is achieved for each caliber. This is huge for the super ultra magnum guys (375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac, 50 BMG, etc). The interface between the heads and the funnel is designed in such a way that no kernels can ever get stuck between the two, as long as the head is tightened completely.The Funnel’s design is both aesthetic and performance driven. Being machined from a solid billet of 6061-T6 aluminum means no static charge to cling kernels to the funnel walls. This also makes it far safer for use with black powder.“Flutes” on the outside are for looks, on the inside though, they disturb the powder kernels from trying to jam up at the neck. It also gives some airspace so they do not get packed up so tightly, all aimed to increase flow through the nozzle.3/8″ tall straight section at the top to help prevent kernels of powder from bouncing out when poured in.Smooth surfaces at the neck of the funnel and inside the heads promote quick flow and prevent any sticking kernels.MADE IN USA! From USA made aluminum, on a USA made HAAS mill, with USA made cutting tools!search: long distance shooting, benchrest, RCBS, Sartorius, pistol, revolver, shotgun"

This carbine was manufactured in 1941 at the Terni arsenal for use in WW2. Immediately post-war it is believed these carbines were re-chambered for 8mm (7.9) in order to make them more marketable, particularly to Middle Eastern countries, since 8mm was a much more widespread round when compared to the original 7.35 chambering. The carbine is in good overall condition, with the two stamped serial numbers I can find (receiver and stock) matching. There is some speckling on the metal, particularly on the magazine, but this doesn't detract from the overall appearance. The stock overall seems pretty solid, with dings, dents and two small gouges probably from careless storage by a past user. The bore is bright and shiney with good rifling. There is a discreet import mark on the front part of the barrel near the muzzle. This rifle will make a great piece for a WW2 collector / reenactor, someone interested in post-war Arab history, or just someone looking for a cool little carbine. I do not have any feeding clips for this, but I understand they can be modified from 7.35 clips with a little know-how. Please see my other auctions for some other military rifles I am letting go."
