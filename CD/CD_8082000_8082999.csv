Why not read the post before you ask? Listing says very firm and they want to know my bottom dollar. Or where I live. After a couple hours back and forth they agree to buy the gun. The next day after they were supposed to get back with me I text them and ask if they are still going to get the gun. They say I'm gonna pass thanks anyway as if I had called them wanting to make a deal with them not that they texted me all day and into the night and agreed to meet he next day. I require a CWP license but after the deal I am informed they don't have one.I don't trade on here much anymore but from now on don't text me if I am trading or selling without having a CWP period. CWP holders not only are not felons they tend to take things more serious. No offense to the responsible people who don't have CWP  Do your research,. Read the post,  and don't offer if you are not sure. Thanx. Sorry so long."

It appeared to be an older model, because nearly all parts on it were USGI. Rifle was way more accurate than it should have been and after talking to some former CRANE gunsmiths involved in the EBR program, I wanted to see what the rifle was capable of. Added a Sadlak National Match Spring Guide and replaced any remaining commercial internals with USGI ones. Then ordered a SAGE EBR chassis, SAGE EBR Stripper Clip guide, and SAGE Selector Cutout cover for it. Then mounted a set of Badger Ordnance 30MM EBR rings on it. Pretty cool, because they sit low on the gun, yet still allow you to see the iron sights through the cutouts on them. Then decided to make it suppressor ready, and added a Schuster adjustable gas plug, Smith Enterprises GLSH-1 Gas Lock w/ hooded front sight, and a .595""X32 51 tooth Advanced Armament BLACKOUT flash hider / suppressor mount. Also installed a SADLAK Tactical Magazine Release as well as a Smith Enterprises Extended Bolt Stop / Release. Also included with the rifle is a USGI M-14 walnut stock with trap door butt plate, USGI webbed sling, USGI cleaning kit, M1A stock (no cut out, take off of an older model SOCOM 16) and (most, if not all) parts that were replaced. I also have 21 magazines: (1X) unmarked 10 rounder, (2X) Armalite 20 rounders, (7X) CHECK-MATE 20 rounders, and (12X) unmarked 20 rounders. Included as well is a set of USGI castle nut pliers, handguard removal pliers, and a Badger Ordnance bolt grease roller. I also have a Smith Enterprises Gas Lock wrench that I currently can't find, but will include it as soon as it's located.I really love this rifle, but am honestly just get bored with stuff I have and am looking for something new to play with. I don't have a price in mind, but feel free to throw an offer out via PM.Thanks for looking, and feel free to request additional pics, additonal details, questions, or offers via PM."

SMOS started out making parts for Noveske and some for LaRue. It has 76 rounds through it. I decided to try the short barrel route since I have a couple other 18""/20"" AR's, so I've filled the SPR/Precision role and don't think this will be shot much behind my other two builds. I broke the barrel in as follows...5x1 shot. Clean. 3x5 shots. Clean. 1x10 shots. Clean. It likes Black Hills 77gr. If you reload, I can give you the data on some good shooting loads with velocities.Check out Saged Dynamics YouTube video on the capabilities of these barrels in front of a better shooter than me.Comes with unused SMOS gas block and nitride gas tube with pin. $300.

It includes many features that you’d have to pay a lot of money to get in other 1911s. The trigger is very nice, it runs absolutely reliably no matter what ammo I throw at it (NEVER had a malfunction — not one), and it comes with everything you need to put it to use immediately as your carry gun (very slim profile for easy concealment) and/or fun at the range gun. I carried this inside IWB on a very regular basis, and it was very reassuring that I had a full size gun equipped with night sights if it was ever needed. IDPA season is just around the corner, and this would be a perfect setup for your next match. It has been used and carried, but it has been well cared for and is absolutely reliable. It has some holster wear, but it’s still a good looking gun and one that you can count on. Let me know if you have any questions."

Timney Trigger, set pretty light right now.  Threaded and capped barrel(no suppressor or brake included).  Threaded bolt handle with oversize grenade bolt knob, but you can replace it if you want.  20MOA rail.  It currently has a sling on it, but I am happy to keep that as it is a great sling.  I have a crappy bipod on it just for the pics.  Only reason I am getting rid of it is because I robbed the scope and good bipod off of it, so now it is naked and I just don't shoot it as much, so I figure let somebody else use it and appreciate what it is capable of. The recent re-barrel (only about 150 rounds through it since....including break in period), cerakote, and blueprinting/truing was done by a local precision gunsmith, spent over $1200 having it all done.  Only reason we didn't bed the rifle is because of the bedding block in the magpul stock worked well and the gun shot insanely well already.  I'll be honest, the cerakote is definitely showing some wear, but the gun shoots like hell.  may not be the prettiest gun, but i will be amazed if you can find a better shooting gun for this price range. I'm open to trades on all sorts of stuff. Guns, Optics, etc.  I especially like Sig, HK and FN, hunting firearms, quality AR or piston-driven guns, and all sorts of other stuff.  I am currently in need of a good bear protection pistol, such as a short barreled 44 or a 10mm.  Also High end spotters.Thanks for looking, and don't hesitate to reach out with whatever you have.  I may have forgotten to put some stuff, so feel free to ask and i can send more pics.  I promise you will be happy with the accuracy."

It is evident that at one point in time there was some slight surface rust, but the gun has been reblued and is currently rust free. The original grips are missing and have been replaced with some custom (more than likely homemade) target grips. The stampings are light but still visible.The Llama functions well, I test fired it with 50rds of light 38 super loads (well within the firearms original designated chamber pressures) with no apparent failures. The safety is functional, and the gun is a good copy of a 1911, sans grip safety.The model IV was the first gun produced by Llama and were not produced for the American market. The caliber is 9mm largo or 38 acp. The 38 acp is the exact same dimensionally as the 38 super auto, albeit the 38 acp is lower powered than the super. With light 38 super loads, the gun functions marvelously and all internals, including the bore, are in very good shape. It has a 5 1/2” barrel, slightly longer than a standard 1911. Production of the Llama IV started in 1932, with this specific firearm being produced in 1941. If any reference material is needed on this firearm, please email me and I will forward you to where I have found all of my information. I can also send more pictures if needed. These are extremely scarce on the American market, and it is truly a collectible that you will not find anywhere else.Asking price is $700 obo, willing to meet relatively close to Salisbury, NC."
