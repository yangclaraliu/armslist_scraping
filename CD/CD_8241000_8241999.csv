Later I have seen the same gun on armslist again as only 2 mags down the pipe and even NIB. Point being once a gun is shot it's hard for almost all people to tell how much it has been fired.  Honestly if you buy a gun and want to sell after 20 rounds fired hmmmm I want it less than someone who tells me 1400 fired and no malfunctions with added statement of it will shoot anything. IMO 1000 rounds don't wear out a quality gun. I bought 20 year old at the time 3913 Smith from a policeman ( who probably shot it way more than 2 mags) and have shot at least 5000 rounds through it myself and I can tell zero difference from day I bought it 10 years ago and trust my life to it every day. Sometimes 2 mags through it actually may mean 50 rounds through it and it was having problems so I want you to have it. Not calling anyone a liar but  my earlier statement proves the question how many rounds through it only put the people who refuse to lie at a disadvantage against all these guns that nobody ever seem to shoot. IMO yes just an opinion a better question is does the gun have any function issues.Hows fit and finish etc.  You can check the rest out when you see it. If i can prove the gun won't shoot factory brass ammo do I get my money back. That is what I want to know and that question will stop some of these guns that won't shoot from cluttering this sight. Hope I did not offend anyone because I don't claim to be the ultimate authority on guns. Thanks and good luck. I know people where I live as evidence by all the booms shoot there guns more than 20 times or they buy a lot of guns.   PS I know this will be flagged not by people who really know 20 rounds is the true count but by the ones who are ( to be nice) fudging a little or want you to have there gun at new price or because function is suspect if your gun does not function properly tell buyer or take it to a gunsmith.

High night sights and extended magazine capacity round out the package.
Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.
First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.
Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.
Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.
Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.
It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package."

Serial Number: ЧФ367 (Russian letter “Ч” stands for “Ch” and “Ф” for “F”). TT-33 is an 8-shot semi-automatic pistol in 7.62×25mm caliber. This example is all matching except for the mag. The featured TT-33 has matching numbers (except for the magazine) and has Tula Arsenal markings and proofs. It has always been difficult to find Russian Tokarevs. Most TT-33 pistols were issued to commanding Soviet officers. The TT-33 was widely used by Soviet troops during World War II. Few ever made it to the United States after WWII and most that did, were German captured pistols recaptured by GI’s. The pistol survived WWII (1939-1945). WWII-dated, non-import pistol from WWII and a WWII veteran “bring back”. The finish is original and it comes with an original WWII era holster. No import marks. Original Soviet-era grips, made out of black Bakelite (early plastic) and steel clips, are in very good condition. Note “CCCP” (USSR in Russian) printing around the star on the plastic grips. The bore is excellent. The finishes on these guns are typically poor as this one went through a lot of Russian winters and WWII. There is discoloration, but not pitted. Better than most we have offered from the FIRST year of the war. The featured TT-33 pistol comes with an extremely rare and hard-to-find genuine leather light brown flap holster that could fit either Tokarev TT-33 pistols or Nagant M1895 revolvers. This multi-purpose type of holsters was designed in the beginning of 1930s, when the Soviet Army had already adopted new Tokarev TT-33, but still was using Nagant M1895 revolvers as well. The holster constructed in a way that perfectly fits both. Our holster was manufactured in 1949 in Germany as part of their war reparations to the Soviet Union.To buy or call >>>>> CZ NON-IMPORT SOVIET (RUSSIAN) TULA TOKAREV TT-33 1939 PISTOL"

There was a small crack on the forearm that didn't go through. I did a good repair & is not noticible as I tried to illustrate in the picture. Cash price is negotiable. I like the shotgun & it wouldn't hurt my feelings to keep it. I just already have a SxS 12ga. Open to trades because I will just use the cash from the sale to buy another shotgun. I shoot a lot of Trap & also shoot League. Must be Ohio resident W/valid DL. I will not meet in a public parking lot due to the climate towards firearms. Can meet in my driveway I live in a safe neighborhood. If you are local & are in a safe area I may come to you. By local I mean within 10-12 miles. Must not be under firearm disability. I will not ship. Thank you for looking & your consideration."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

This pistol has a capacity of 12+1, comes with 3 magazines, a Viridian Weapon Systems C5L-R laser/light combo ($179), and a custom Defender holster by KT-Mech ($45). This gun has served me faithfully, has had ~2000 rounds put through it, and has been cleaned regularly after 150-300 rounds. This gun would be perfect for a home defense gun, or a concealed carry firearm worn at the 4:00 or 5:00 positions with its custom OWB holster. This weapon is ideal for concealed carry as it lacks any external safety besides the trigger safety (much like a Glock), its owner ought to train accordingly. One will immediately notice appeasing and unique characteristics of this beautiful firearm such as its trapezoid sights, its crisp and quick trigger, and its comfortable finger groves.

 

The gun and magazines itself I would sell for $350 (they run $450-500 new), if you want to buy the entire package (including the holster and light) I would sell for $500.

Serial Number: M1112. This example is ALL matching to include the original magazine. No import marks! No safety lever (found on imported pistols to comply with U.S. firearms regulations)! The Polish Tokarev was referred to as “Pistolet wz. 1933” in the Military manual of Polish-made pistol TT-33 published by Polish MOD in Warsaw, Poland in 1961. If you collect Warsaw Pact pistols, this is one of the rarest variants to obtain. This gun in any type of condition would be something of a sensation, but to get one with a matching mag and in fine condition is almost asking too much of the fates. After the end of World War II, Poland fell under the influence of the Soviet Union, and their newly established socialist government aligned its armaments with that of the victorious Soviet Army. Poland began to manufacture TT pistols according to specifications and documentation supplied from the USSR. Pistols were made to the TT-33 pattern. In Poland, TT pistols were adopted as Pistolet wojskowy wzor 1933, or “Military pistol, model of 1933,” and the first pistols were made at the Radom plant. Polish wz. 1933 Tokarev pistols were manufactured from 1947 to 1959. Poland’s Radom plant manufactured the Tokarev for its armed forces and also supplied it to East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Early Polish Tokarev pistols (like our featured pistol) were distinguishes by Radom’s distinctive “FB” (Fabryka Broni Radom, for “Arms Factory Radom”) and “WP” (Wojskowe Polska, for “Polish Army”) markings on the grip panels. “FB” grip on the left side, and “WP” on the right side. Later models were replaced with flat grips. Overall, about 225,000 TT pistols were made in Poland at the Radom small arms factory. The featured Pistolet wz. 1933 comes with an extra mag and a genuine leather light brown holster manufactured in Poland.To buy call or click>>>Used Polish P11"

This custom-built modern sporting rifle features an 18"" nitrided alloy barrel with rifle-length gas system, Ruger's 15"" free-float handguard compatible with M-LOK® accessories, the Ruger® Elite 452™ AR-Trigger and ergonomic Magpul® furniture. The perfect rifle for a variety of uses, the AR-556 MPR is capable and versatile.Ruger's talented team of engineers worked carefully to develop the ideal custom package for the AR-556 platform that does it all, right out of the box. From plinking to competition shooting, the MPR is the perfect rifle for just about anything.The MPR's cold-hammer forged 18"" alloy barrel with 5R rifling is salt bath nitrided for corrosion resistance and durability. The barrel is contoured to minimize weight without sacrificing rigidity, leaving a 0.75"" journal for the low-profile gas block. The soft-shooting, rifle-length gas system paired with a Ruger® muzzle brake provides smoother operation and softens recoil to keep every shot on target.Ruger's 15"" free-float handguard is light, stiff and versatile, with Magpul M-LOK accessory attachment slots along the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions. Additional slots on the angled surfaces near the muzzle are perfect for mounting a light, laser or QD sling cup. Compared to a typical quad-rail forend, the 1.50"" diameter handguard makes the MPR's forend slim and controllable. M-LOK-compatible Picatinny rail sections can be easily added. The integral Picatinny rail at the 12:00 position is tightly controlled to the most current STANAG 4649 specification.The crisp 4.5 pound trigger pull of the Elite 452 two-stage trigger is a great addition to the MPR. The lower receiver is fitted with Magpul's MOE® grip and Mil-Spec MOE SL™ buttstock, making the rifle easy to handle, shoulder and shoot. The Mil-Spec compatible lower and upper receivers are CNC-machined from forgings and hard coat anodized. The MPR comes complete with dust cover, brass deflector and forward assist.Firearm Features:Lower receiver is fitted with Magpul® MOE® grip and MOE SL™ collapsible buttstock on the Mil-Spec buffer tube.Handguard is free-floating for accuracy and the slim, 15"" length provides enhanced ergonomics and support.Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.The Ruger® Elite 452™ AR-Trigger is a two-stage trigger that offers a smooth, crisp, 4.5 pound trigger pull. It features a full-strength hammer spring for consistent primer ignition and a lightweight hammer that enables a 30% faster lock time over standard MSR triggers.Rifle-length gas system provides smoother operation and reduces felt recoil.Magpul® M-LOK® accessory attachment slots along the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions with additional slots on the angled faces near the muzzle.Cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black nitrided finish provides corrosion resistance.Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.Ruger® muzzle brake is a radial port design that significantly reduces felt recoil and muzzle movement. The 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.-I also just bought a brand new Nikon P-223 3-9x40 Scope and mount.-Custom Kryptek Cerakote.Can add cash for the right trade."
