Send me an OFFER. Worse I can say is no. I'll also take trades for other rifles in 308, 30-06, 270

I bought this off another person planning to make this into a project rifle but things change and I need to sell this rifle. It's a very nice rifle with synthetic stock. Rough enough to take out into the brush without worries of scratching it up. 

It's a 300WSM caliber meant to take down large game. If you intend to hunt large game or are into long range shooting, this rifle is for you. This rifle has a lot of different versatile ammo you can choose from w/ more than plenty knock-down power you'll ever need. 

Has a very nice recoil pad to absorb all recoil. The trigger is extremely smooth with no creep. Feels like a 2.5lb (same as my featherweight m70). The Bolt and action is very tight and smooth with no sloppiness. Bolt is jeweled and very slick. You wont be disappointed. 

What you receive when purchased:
---Rifle only (no scope, no rings, bipod)
---Custom machine muzzle break ($80 value)

I put the scope and piccatinny rail on just for show. The 20MOA piccatinny ($50) rail is brand new and so is the Bushnell XTR 600 DOA Reticle ($200). Belongs on my other rifle. The bushnell 600 DOA allows hold overs for shots at 100-200-300-400-500-600 yards without doping (adjusting elevation) the scope in each and every time."

Balance. Form. Excellence. The new Citori 725 is the evolution of John M. Browning’s legendary B25 Superposed, now with the modern performance advantage of a Low-Profile receiver.

With a 725, you get the ""one with the gun"" feeling you want, with the long lasting durability you expect from a Browning over and under. And the features don't stop there. The 725 showcases an all-new Mechanical Trigger (FireLite) that offers unmatched feel and lighter pull weights than ever before. Inflex Technology has also been added to make shooting more comfortable. And the new Invector-DS choke system moves to a new level of performance. Experience the benefits these improvements can do for your shooting with a new Citori 725.

STILL THE NUMBER ONE AUTOLOADER.

Few hunting rifles in history have achieved the status of the Browning BAR. And no other autoloaders have even come close. The Browning BAR has a long standing tradition for achieving bolt action like accuracy in an autoloading rifle. Some of this is accounted for in the extreme level of precision and careful craftsmanship that goes into every rifle. But the design really sets it apart. The gas system combined with a 7-lug rotary bolt give the shooting significant recoil reduction for comfort, while at the same time locking in bolt action-like accuracy.

In light of this, though, I still babied the thing like my AR-15 so it looks the same as it did when I bought it 3 years ago. I don't really NEED to sell it, so don't low ball me, please. I feel like with the prices on here for the same rifle, less magazines, and terrible furniture, it's below market value.

The 9X18 Makarov cartridges are slightly less powerful than the 9mm Luger cartridge, but are more powerful than the .380.

With the best ammo, it will make the FBI minimum penetration standard of 12 inches.

The pistol was designed for use by the Polish Army and is similar to the Walther PPK design.

What makes it appealing as a conceal carry gun (for those who can do so legally) is it’s diminutive specifications. It’s only one inch thick, about 6 inches long and 4.5 inches in height

I have a very gently used Glock 17 Gen 4 in Flat Dark Earth. Comes with all standard Glock goodies, 3 mags, lock, back straps, cleaning brush, Glock case and paperwork. Only modification was the addition of an extended slide stop and Talon Adhesive Grips which can be peeled off without residue. Original slide stop is included. 200 rounds through the Glock with flawless performance. Date on fired case envelope is September 20, 2012. I can throw in 100 rounds of 124 Grain Federal HydraShock ammo for the right package. 

I have a Spikes Tactical lower that I just assembled which is need of an upper. I am not looking for a Noveske or a real high end upper but am not going to fall in love with a hyper inflated PSA, DPMS, or DELTON upper unless it's packaged with mags, complete parts set with butt stock or something worth around $650 to $700 in trade. I can always just keep it and wait for one to come back in stock. Would like to keep it in 5.56 but open to 5.45. 

If someone was to offer me cash for the Glock with the ammo, I would ask $700. Yes it's a Glock but its the FDE GEN 4 (which people either love or hate) version and comes with $50 of ammo. I would rather trade so it's priced accordingly. 

I thought I would check to see if there was interest in a trade. 
I am in Hastings and would do a FTF trade in the south metro. No need for bill of sale unless you want one. Just need to show a PTP/PTC and valid DL. That's it.  email with interest and offers or text/call:  952*215*4016.

It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower. We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market.

LISTING#1: 270 rounds of Yugoslavian surplus ammunition 7.92x57mm also known as 8mm Mauser. Ammo is dated 1954 and is likely corrosive (clean your rifle after shooting). Ammunition is packaged in cardboard packages. Price = $145.

LISTING#2: 6 rounds of live South African surplus ammunition 7.62x51mm, dated 1984 (headstamp 84-12). This ammunition was originally sold in a 140-round sealed South African battle-pack. I have personally fired some of this ammunition out of my Ishapore Enfield and it functioned flawlessly. 
ALSO, 41 FIRED BRASS CASES (boxer-primed) 7.62x51 NATO. The seller I purchased them from said they were once-fired. Almost all headstamps have NATO cross and are a mix of LC (Lake City), SBS (Santa Barbara Systems), and TAA08. Sampling a handful of them, most of them seem to be Lake City. I am selling these cases because I only want .308 Winchester cases and these were mixed in with the batch I bought. Price for the live ammo and brass = $16

Bundle price for everything (Listing#1 and Listing#2) is $150.

Relax, Rejuvenate, Invigorate
Increase circulation, relieve tension and increase energy with 460 square inches of air massage:

Arm & Palm Massage
Increase circulation and warmth, removes tension.

Shoulder Massage
Gently stimulates your lymphatic system to help cleanse the body.

Arm & Shoulder Stretch
Gradual stretching of shoulder muscles to remove tension & increase flexibility.

Leg Stretch
Works to alleviate stiffness in your lower back, hips and thighs. The air system in the ottoman squeezes the lower legs while it lowers and raises in 20° increments.

Seat & Hip Massage
Gently squeezes and soothes buttocks, outer thighs and waist. Soft adjustable hip acupoint nodule.

Calf Massage
Gently squeezes and loosens tightness, increases circulation.

A Tailored Massage
Using pressure sensor technology, the Ultra creates a virtual map of your back. The massage you receive is contoured to your height and your spine's curve. Real Pro Ultra™ scans your body and is able to identify you. The ""floating"" massage heads glide over your back and know where to massage -- and where not to. You create your own customizable program, which Ultra remembers for the next time you're ready for a massage. The air bags conform to your body, and the Air Ottoman System even extends to open/closed to accommodate any height.

The ""Junetsu"" Massage Technique: A Panasonic Exclusive

Junetsu, the Japanese word for ""ultra-fine kneading,"" is basedon the one-second circular thumb movements of professional massage therapists. Junetsu quickly loosens up tight muscles, and the spiral circular motion reverberates down through the muscles to invigorate you down to the surface of your bones.

Reflexology

For professional, personalized massage therapy on your feet, the Real Pro Ultra™ utilizes adjustable and removable plates to incorporate reflexology into the massage experience. This reflexology stimulates additional massage points on your feet, increasing blood and energy flow throughout your body.

Acupoints

You have approximately 350 acupoints on your body, with nearly 100 on your back and neck alone. From the soothing palm style of Swedish massage, to deep tissue kneading, to Shiatsu massage, the Real Pro Ultra™ has a variety of techniques for invigorating these energy acupoints.

Advanced Quad-Style Massage Technology

Massage heads that open and close -- these four massage styles can be chosen during a massage:
Shiatsu
Swedish
Fist Kneading
Grasping

Edit - this is an ""Old Vaquero"".  This means it has the transfer bar safety, but does NOT have the internal key-operated lock of the ""New Vaquero"", and is also able to handle hotter loads.

I am a private seller.  This means cash only, although I might be interested in a nice Ruger Bearcat in stainless in partial trade.  It also means no tax, shipping, or other fees, and of course no waiting  :)

If you reload, I also have a set of dies, some brass, and bullets available (for a reasonable extra cost).

Thanks for looking, and thank you Armslist!

Another edit - if you're interested, please send me a message other than ""still available?"" - at least say something like ""Hi, I'm Matt and I'm interested in your Ruger"".  I've probably spent too much time on Craigslist but a generic ""still available?"" message makes me think of a bot phishing for email addresses.  Thank you!"
