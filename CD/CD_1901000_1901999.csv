It has the frame of a 30SF with the slide of a 36. This makes it slimmer than any other glock in .45. This glock conceals and feels just like a glock 19. this is my favorite gun at the moment. the only reason Im letting it go is because I don't need two. Price is firm. Cash only unless your deal favors me really well. Pics available later.

$800 cash you can have it today. This is a ""working"" gun, it comes with light wear so if you're one of those guys who handles his guns with kids gloves you won't be interested.

Benelli 121 M1.
Imported into the U.S. by H&K early to mid eighties (Has h&k import stamp) 1 of 5000 brought into the country and snatched up strictly for law enforcement / military use. This is the grand pappy of Benelli shotguns and arguably the fastest cycling shottie Benelli has ever produced. With this being a retired police gun don't expect a museum quality collectors piece but this stout workhorse is in nice shape and runs like a machine when you get her going. A PURE combat shotgun. Cycles fast, cycles smooth, hits hard, well balanced and very stable on target.

Again, the poor English; the classis second line of inquiry asking for more details about me so he can establish a false relationship without giving up anything about himself; he may not even care about the rifle - he wants me to switch some funds for him / provide personal information for more direct follow-up scams / or some variation of these.

Enjoy big frying capacity from a clean frying design with the 17 Gallon Cajun Fryer Propane Cooker Deep Fryer. This fryer utilizes a unique design in its two separate and individually controlled 8-1/2 gallon cooking vats to fry fish, turkeys, chickens or any other food, without the burnt taste. This versatile, high performance, low maintenance propane fryer's burner design positions the fryer's heat source 6'' above the bottom of the oil reservoir at a 45 degree angle. This design allows food and batter to fall to the bottom of the reservoir and not collect on the burner. The oil at the bottom of the reservoir never gets hot enough to burn or scorch the batter, keeping it clean to reduce oil usage by up to 70% over comparable fryers. This durable, high capacity unit features two diamond-plate side tables, diamond plate lid, and six large-capacity nickel-plated baskets with plastic-coated handles and evenly distributed wire mesh for perfect frying. Baskets measure 13-1/4'' x 5-5/8'' x 5-5/8''. Features built-in thermometers and easy access reservoir drains. Wheeled stand for easy moving. Made in USA.

We use only factory stock firearms in recording velocities, so that you get true, actual field velocities with our ammo --- not exaggerated test barrel velocities

All .45-70 Magnum loadings are intended for use in the following firearms:
All Marlin Model 1895 variations made since 1972
Browning Model 1885 and 1886
New England Arms Handi-Rifle
Ruger #1 and #3
T/C Encore

The 500 gr. load uses a dual diameter, bonded core bullet by Alaska Bullet Works. The bullet diameter in front of the crimp groove is .449 inch, while measuring .457 inch on the shank. This dual diameter allows for reliable chambering in rifles with short or no throats. This is a non-expanding Full Metal Jacket bullet designed for the deepest penetration on the largest game animals. This load is safe for use in any firearm designed for the other BBA .45/70 MAG.

Heres The Product Information From the Crimson Trace Website:

The Crimson Trace Lightguard for 1911 Pistols features a highly compact and slim design specifically for ease of holstering. Its 130 lumen tactical white light seamlessly attaches to your non-railed Kimber, Ruger or Smith & Wesson 1911 Full size, Compact or Bobtail non railed 1911 by attaching securely to the triggerguard. Compatible with Crimson Trace Lasergrips, Lightguard also uses the same instinctive activation that Crimson Trace laser sights are famous for. Lightguard removes the need for a flashlight separate from the pistol - giving you a free hand. Both of these low-light tools can be operated separately or simultaneously with a single hand. The LTG-701 features an ergonomic front activation pad (that works seperately with Lasergrips) that activates when your pistol is held in a natural firing grip.

HERE'S THE SIGHTS INFO & SPECIFICATIONS :
""Bigger and badder” is the best way to describe the AR-536. Its 5x magnification makes it easier to find and engage targets out to 600 yards, while the larger 36mm objective delivers brighter, crisper images. The Ballistic/CQTM lighted reticle is ideal for tactical operations or friendly competition. Shooters can choose the high contrast black reticle, or select red or green depending upon the situation. Five different illumination settings make it easy to match any light condition.
Ruggedly built to withstand up recoil, abuse and weather, key features include multi-coated lenses, adjustable diopter, integrated lens covers and three Picatinny rail mounting points. Remove the bottom rail mount and it can be readily mounted to an AR carry handle. It is ready for the range right out of the box. Also comes with a One-Year Warranty.


Specifications:
AR-QD Mount
The AR-QD or Quick Detachable Mount adds a new twist to mounting the Burris AR-536 Red Dot sight. To attach, simply turn the two levers to lock the sight firmly into place and achieve return-to-zero accuracy. Fits any Weaver or Picatinny-style base. The ring tops also include Picatinny slots to mount additional accessories.

Lee Perfect Powder Measure is best for reloading rifle cases, can also be used for pistol cases. Can be used on the included bench mounted stand, or used in conjunction with the Universal Charging Die on the Load Master.

Best for reloading rifle and pistol cases:
Throws charges from 2 to over 100 grains. Eliminates Cut Powder and Jerky Action. A soft elastomer wiper strikes off the metering chamber rather than cut the powder. You'll be surprised at how smoothly the rotor operates. More importantly, you will enjoy the most uniform of charges.

Meaningful Calibration: 
A micrometer adjuster that reads directly in cubic centimeters. Just multiply the charge in grains by the cc for one grain and you have the setting. So very much better than a meaningless setting as most supply.

Versatile:
The metering chamber is the proper size for large rifle charges and the strike off opening small enough to work well with pistol size charges. The Lee Perfect Powder Measure works fine for charges from two grains to over 100 grains.

Its completely full of various tools, all the ones you could imagine, and some you probably cant.

The boxes are pretty nice, and this would be a great set for someone just starting off, or for someone who just needs to add a little extra to thier set.
Ive had a few Mechanics/Body shop guys that I know tell me its worth around 2500.00 give or take.
Id take 1500.00 OBO, or trade for Guns, Camping stuff, fishing stuff, Tactical gear. Im really trying to get a decent camper also, so that would be a plus.
But Im definetly needing to get rid of this set ""and another that I plan on posting also"" for something that I can use.
I have absolutely no use for this set, and all they are doing is taking up room, so dont be shy.  Make a offer! Im willing to wheel and deal.

 Product Information

 Shop more Aimpoint products The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year pesronal use warranty.

The gun does have minor wear marks from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo.

LWRC
M6-SL
(Stretch Lightweight)

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
The new M6-SL is a replacement of our base model M6 rifle of old. The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date.

The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight.

The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated one piece bolt carrier and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A1.5 fixed rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post.

The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price.

Hungary was the only Soviet Satellite nation that actually made a few changes to the original design. Still the same intenally, still dead reliable, the major difference is the shorter barrel, which is made US rifle legal with the large muzzle brake. The brake drastically reduces the recoil of the 7.62. The other big change is the foward grip which does actually come in kinda handy for CQB. 
The rifle comes with an ultimax rail for mounting optics, but unlike most rails made for the AK47 this one sits just right so that when you mount most optics you can co witness with your iron sights. I also have 5 mags, and a couple hundred rounds to come with it. Also have a Tasco Reddot that works great with the iron sights, and holds zero great for a 50$ optic.

Like new only shot about 50 times comes with about 300 .22 lr rounds, speed loader, 25 round mag, laser grip sights, flashlight and a brand new Holographic red dot sight. 

I actually just bought this a few weeks ago, went out and shot with it once, LOVED it, very low cost ammo. 

Best part is, the ability to fire 25 rounds so fast, and then not have to worry about spending much money on ammo. 

The laser is fully adjustable for distance, the holographic is brand new. The flashlight is attached to the laser and all comes off really easy if needed. 

The rifle is also very accurate. 

Also has a 6 position ATI stock on it. 

Fires great and smooth. Only reason I want to sell is because I don't have enough time to shoot.

These little guns are very well made. They have real sights (unlike a Ruger LCP) and are very accurate. 
I have all of the items that came with this gun (including the box and receipt). I also purchased an extra magazine for it that is part of this package.
