The Barrett M107A1 .50 BMG semi-automatic rifle is an exceptional firearm! Here are some of the new upgrades: 

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1). 

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design. 

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it. 

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant. 

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail. 

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet. 

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod. 

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic. 

*More potential investment value as it has the same rollmark as our military gets, with the M107A1 designation. We see with our Knights Armament Rifles, Schmidt & Bender scopes, Remington Defense rifles, etc. that military markings always drive up price further down the road when the rifles are no longer offered."

 Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.
Fast and Accurate Shooting
The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.
The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.
The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy."

This is a custom built AR15 Carbine .223/5.56 Top quality rifle. I have put 1 magazine of 30 rounds through the gun cleaning every 5 rounds to break in the barrel correctly. This is a new gun and shoots like a dream. I built this for my own collection but now want to build a long range shooter so reluctantly I have decided to sell it. The lower receiver has a low profile lower plate to accommodate an auto group if legally owned. This is an extremely dependable rifle. Thanks for taking a look and good luck bidding. I will include two 30 round magazines with this purchase.

Barrel: Daniel Defense AR-15 16 Inch 1/7 Twist 5.56 Barrel Factory New Barrel! Cold Hammer Forging of barrels has been known for decades to produce the most accurate, longest lasting rifle barrels obtainable. The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible. All Daniel Defense cold hammer forged barrels are made from start to finish in our state-of-the-art facility located in Black Creek, GA. In keeping with our heritage of not cutting corners, all cold hammer forged barrels feature a forged chamber and heavy phosphate exterior coating. They are all MP tested on-site.

MAG Tactical lower receiver with RRA LPK

Product Description
MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver is one of the most recent AR-15 Lower Receivers to hit the market. The MAG Tactical Systems AR-15 Lower Receiver is about 35 percent lighter than a standard aluminum receiver, and it is not plastic! The MAG Tactical Systems Generation 4 Lower is made of a proprietary magnesium alloy. The patented coating process that MAG Tactical Systems owns gives their lower extreme corrosion resistance characteristics.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver incorporates a machined in triggerguard that is larger than a mil-spec trigger guard, which allows the trigger to be accessed with thick winter gloves.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver front and rear pivot points are reinforced to avoid breakage of the receiver even when high torque is applied when it is in the break down position
Today’s warrior has been looking for a lower receiver that has the low weight and high feature list that the MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver has to offer.

Interarms, long ago, imported a number of these hard to find classics. To identify these carbines as ""theirs"", they scrubbed the year of manufacture commonly found on the breech and roll marked ""Interarms G33/50"".

The barrel is 18 inches long making this ideal for those of you who brush hunt deer, etc. Add maneuverability to the legendary accuracy of the 6.5 x 55 cartridge and what's not to like.

The action rests in a sporterized Mauser stock as you can see from the photos. The receiver has NOT been drilled or tapped, it's in its as original condition. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds and this is one caliber that hasn't gone through the roof in terms of ammunition prices.

The action, bolt, shroud, and safety are all matching numbers. I've fired this rifle, it's accurate as all get out even with the iron sights and fun to shoot.

I've got some taxes to pay and, if you have any familiarity with Swedish Mausers you'll see that the price is quite attractive as stated. Not interested in any trades at this time.

Cash is king. I live in the NW burbs of Milwaukee and will drive up to 30 minutes if you're a serious buyer. Drop me an email with any questions and we'll go from there. I have additional photos if you're interested."

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made for full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We do not just assemble scopes, mounts and rings into a package and offer them for sale. We install and test different combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is a great combination of a mini-scope and mounting system for your Ruger 10/22. 

This mini-scope package is also an ideal application for your Ruger 10/22 Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled.

986,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1463986,For Sale:  Brand new 30 round mags magazines for AR SCAR Sig ACR and TAVOR ready to go in any quantity!,"Cheap priority shipping!, Hawaii, United States",$ 21,"Listed On: Saturday, April 27, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have for sale 30 round brand new in bag steel AR 30 round magazines. These were designed and manufactured in Israel specifically for the Tavor, but they function flawlessly in any gun designed to accept AR style magazines.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

I also have Thermold 30 rounders coming at just $16 each!

Shipping is via Priority - I am offering a discounted flat rate of $5 for up to 4 magazines, and $10 for 5 or more.

Prices are $23 each, $110 for 5 or $210 for 10."
