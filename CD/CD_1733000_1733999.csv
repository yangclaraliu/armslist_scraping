Yukon Leg Press/Hip Sled - Asking $950
This is my Yukon HLS-2000 Leg Press/Hip Sled. I bought this new for $1,579.00 plus tax about 4 years ago. It is in good condition with some minor scratches…mostly from the kids. The upholstery is perfect. It has seen little use (about 2 1/2 summers). I am getting rid of it because I have had four knee surgeries and cannot use this machine any longer. It was a favorite of mine and those that trained with me in our home gym. The Leg Press/Hip Sled is very versatile, easy to use, and comfortable. It is adjustable for any persons height. I am 6'6'' and used it along side my wife who is 5'4''. This machine is built well. If you know the name Yukon then you know what I mean. It is a heavy beast weighing 450+lbs alone. It also is a beast in the sense that it has (3) Full Sized Pegs that hold 500 lbs. each for a total of 1,500 lbs of weight to possibly press. The most weight I put on this was 1,080 lbs. and it was smooth as butter. We used this machine for Leg Presses/Seated Calf Extensions/Hack Squats/Angled Standing Calf Raises.

Dependable, super-capacity drum magazine lets you shoot 50-round strings of .22 LR ammunition in your 10/22 for plenty of plinking fun. No modifications to rifle needed; simply snaps into the mag well like the standard factory magazine. Tough, impact-resistant polycarbonate body and follower are self-lubricating, so they work with the constant-force spring to deliver smooth, uniform feeding for consistent operation. Smoke-tinted translucent body enables easy visual checks of ammo status. Steel hex screws anchored into brass bushings securely hold the body together to ensure exceptional strength and rigidity, yet are easily removed for disassembly and cleaning."

196,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1733196,For Sale:  Glock 20 Gen4 FDE Flat Dark Earth 10mm NIB! Rare + high-power!,"Minden, NV, Reno, Nevada",$ 900,"Listed On: Saturday, June 8, 2013",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,no type,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is the rarest of the 'FDE' or flat dark earth frame Glock models. Brand new in factory box with three 15rd mags, backstraps to change the grip size/style and docs. This is Glock's most powerful pistol and has been since 1991. 

Let me answer some common questions:

1. 'What Gen?' 4. FOUR. The newest. This gun dates to Feb, 2013.
2. 'What size?' Full-size. The biggest, heaviest, most powerful Glock model made.
3. 'New?' YES. New, unfired except for factory test rounds.
4. 'Magazines?' 3. THREE. 15 rounds each. Yes, you can get 10 round mags for the states that need them but that's up to YOU to find. This gun does NOT come with low-cap magazines.
5. Is this an 'SF' or 'slim frame' model?' NO. There is no such thing. They are a new frame design for Gen4.

I also have 100rds JHP ammo and 50rds FMJ ammo to go with it for a little more. Thankfully 10mm is not too hard to find. No, I will not include it for free or trade for Mauser rifle rounds or $5. I paid around $76 for the ammo.

Asking price is $900. I will haggle slightly but if it takes a while to sell locally I'll just pay the commissions online and sell it. I thought it would be good to offer it to locals first.

DON'T whine about the price, the really large online gun marketplaces are getting near this with shipping and fees and if you call a dealer looking for one they will most likely laugh at you. If you find one for less you go buy it!

Local cash deals preferred. NV ID or CCW in person would be ideal as I am NOT selling to residents of restricted states. NO trades or anything else that isn't cash. Also, NO messages asking if I still have the gun! If this ad is up, the gun is for sale. 

Located in Minden, Nevada but I can meet in Carson City or possibly South Reno for the right price. If you live somewhere really far away I will consider delivering - for full price. This means 50, 60 miles etc.

Email me with your phone number and a name and I will reply asap."

(1) 375 round bulk pack CCI ""AR Tactical"" that was designed for flawless functioning in today's high capacity, magazine fed military clones. Ammo is high velocity with 40 grain copper plated solid point bullets.

(3) boxes = 300 rounds CCI ""Mini-Mag"". This ammo is high velocity with 40 grain copper plated solid point bullets.

(2) boxes = 200 rounds CCI ""Sub-Sonic Hollow Point"". This ammo was designed to operate just under the speed of sound at 1050 FPS which greatly reduces muzzle report and eliminates the super sonic crack associated with all high velocity ammo. The 40 grain lead hollow point bullet makes this ammo perfect for small game hunting with a lot less noise. Would also be fantastic for firearms equipped with suppressors.

(2) boxes = 100 rounds CCI ""VELOCITOR"". Ammo is very high velocity at 1435 FPS and features a 40 grain copper plated hollow point bullet. 

(2) boxes = 100 rounds CCI ""STINGER"". This ammo is SUPER HIGH VELOCITY at 1640 FPS. Features nickel plated cases and a 32 grain copper plated hollow point bullet. Stinger ammo is probably too destructive for small game hunting, but is excellent for varmints and self defense applications.

It has only had about 150 rounds shot through it. It has a Galloway Precision trigger job that reduces the trigger pull by half and also has lighter trigger springs form Galloway Precision also that eliminates the stacking at the end of the LC9 trigger pull by reducing the spring power of the firing pin blocker spring and the lifter arm spring. It also has a set of Traction Grips installed on it. They can be removed easily at anytime but I think they help a lot in gripping the gun. I also removed the magazine safety so that the gun will fire with the magazine removed. I still have the stock trigger springs and the magazine safety plate and spring. I have also polished the whole barrel. The gun still looks like new with no scratches or blemishes. I have also painted the dots on the sights. The front dot is orange and the rear dots are green. This helps a lot with target acquisition. It comes with the stock soft case, one magazine with both base plates (flat plate and pinky extension plate), the stock Ruger lock, manuals/ paper work, internal lock keys, and box.

Description on trigger upgrade from Galloway's site:

The early break trigger system upgrade for the LC9 is the solution for the long heavy false reset of the stock trigger. Our modification to YOUR SUPPLIED hammer and trigger bar will shorten the stroke by half the stock pull length and break at the half way point of the stock travel, all while maintaining the factory safeties. This will allow faster follow up shots and better accuracy due to shorter pull. Expect around a pound reduction in trigger pull weight."

It has only had about 150 rounds shot through it. It has a Galloway Precision trigger job that reduces the trigger pull by half and also has lighter trigger springs form Galloway Precision also that eliminates the stacking at the end of the LC9 trigger pull by reducing the spring power of the firing pin blocker spring and the lifter arm spring. It also has a set of Traction Grips installed on it. They can be removed easily at anytime but I think they help a lot in gripping the gun. I also removed the magazine safety so that the gun will fire with the magazine removed. I still have the stock trigger springs and the magazine safety plate and spring. I have also polished the whole barrel. The gun still looks like new with no scratches or blemishes. I have also painted the dots on the sights. The front dot is orange and the rear dots are green. This helps a lot with target acquisition. It comes with the stock soft case, one magazine with both base plates (flat plate and pinky extension plate), the stock Ruger lock, manuals/ paper work, internal lock keys, and box.

Description on trigger upgrade from Galloway's site:

The early break trigger system upgrade for the LC9 is the solution for the long heavy false reset of the stock trigger. Our modification to YOUR SUPPLIED hammer and trigger bar will shorten the stroke by half the stock pull length and break at the half way point of the stock travel, all while maintaining the factory safeties. This will allow faster follow up shots and better accuracy due to shorter pull. Expect around a pound reduction in trigger pull weight."

The trigger guard and top action area is engraved very nicely also, the metal shines because of the high nickel content. The action opens by pulling down on the trigger guard which also serves as the safety. It has a lever that when it's held back to fire the gun enters an opening in the receiver. When the fingers release their grip on the trigger guard it hangs down a 1/4"" and won't let the gun fire. I've shot the gun and it operates perfectly. the problem is the stock has a crack and a rubber butt pad was added to it. Also the forearm has been repaired, but not done very pretty. I bought the gun to shoot, which it does very well, and It was at a price I could afford. I have a 100 new cases of Norma Brass and 15 loaded rounds that can go with it for a price. I've seen the ammo for sale at $5 a round, but it is still loaded by the Europeans and Sellor and Bennet import it I believe."

The HOLOgraphic Weapon Sight (HWS) by EOTech is the 1st electro-optic sighting system to apply holographic technology to small and medium-sized weapon platforms. When used in Close Quarters Battle (CQB) environments, this revolutionary weapon optic delivers amazing speed and accuracy gains, uncompromising use of peripheral vision, leaves no muzzle-side optical signature and is packaged in a compact, durable unit.

Now deployed with elite Special Forces and SWAT teams the world over, the HWS delivers vastly improved shooting performance for all levels of operators.

The HWS mounts to any universal Picatinny mounting rail (supports standard Weaver dovetail) with an integral mounting platform for adaptation to user preferred eye relief. The EOTech Holographic Sightcan interface to any standard issue M16 or M4 variant in either a fixed carry handle or flattop receiver, and with no modifications to the weapon. The M16 and M4 mounting platforms provide for the functionally critical aspect of co-witnessing the iron sights within the HWS's Heads Up Display while maintaining the operator's critical check weld position.

All M550's have been upgraded to submersible 33 ft. water depth. Within this same feature upgrade, the membrane pad has been redesigned to greatly improve the tactile feel of the push button switches. The switches are designed with raised inlays to provide further separation between switch controls and reduce audible signature.

Compatible with Gen. I-IV Night Vision Systems (tandem operation).
Includes ruggedized hood assembly and knobbed, tooless mounting bolt.
Interfaces to standard 1"" Weaver dovetail/Picatinny rail.
Factory pre-mounted with 2D Standard reticle pattern."

Not just for zombies anymore

While it would be a lot of fun for our marketing department to sell the Camp 10 as the ultimate zombie-whacking tool, the truth is, it actually has a lot of other uses that you just might find to be of a more immediate nature than zombie defense. Not that we’re ignoring to the coming Zombiepocalypse, mind you. We just think that the Camp 10 makes a pretty awesome camp knife and that it does a great job of whacking campsite or other outdoor chores down to size in very short order.

From clearing brush to making kindling, the Camp 10 is the ideal outdoor and survival tool. Cut, chop, slash, hack, split, scrape—just about any task you ask of it, the Camp 10 can handle. The full-tang Camp 10 is made of carbon tool steel for toughness and wear resistance. A basic black powdercoat protects the steel and makes maintenance easier.

You’ll like the secure, contoured grip of the Camp 10, too. The handle has a built-in hand guard and is drilled in both front and rear so you can attach a lanyard either place—or both—for carrying versatility. Of course, if a zombie does get up close and personal with you, then yeah, you’ll be pretty glad to have a Camp 10 in hand, too.

It can bring down about any animal of any size including a bad gun.  The lever action is easy for anyone of any size to operate and makes it's distinct sound just like a pump shotgun.   The scope makes it deadly and is accurate at great distances.

The scope is already laser bore sighted so it is ready to go just the way it is.

A quality reliable rifle that is good for any purpose you need.  Beautiful wood as well as blue on the barrel makes it something that you can really be proud of.  It is not a semi-auto that you will worry about a jam or misfire but it can fire almost as fast with the lever action and is definitely deadlier.

The gas key coming loose is the most common problem for bolt carrier groups.

M6A2 description: 
The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

It can bring down about any animal of any size including a bad gun. The lever action is easy for anyone of any size to operate and makes it's distinct sound just like a pump shotgun. The scope makes it deadly and is accurate at great distances.

The scope is already laser bore sighted so it is ready to go just the way it is.

A quality reliable rifle that is good for any purpose you need. Beautiful wood as well as blue on the barrel makes it something that you can really be proud of. It is not a semi-auto that you will worry about a jam or misfire but it can fire almost as fast with the lever action and is definitely deadlier.

Manufacturer description:
To satisfy customer requests, we now offer the new JP EnhancedBolt™ with great life expectancy while utilizing a standard configuration extractor.

The truth is, the standard Mil-spec 8620 bolt has a number of factors limiting its performance, not the least of which is that the life expectancy of such bolts is only about 6,000 rounds. In fact, standard bolts will start to show stress cracks on the locking lugs adjacent to the extractor cut after only 3,000 rounds. Cracking at the cam pin hole and weak extractor spring tension only add to the problems of the Mil-spec bolt.

The latest edition JP EnhancedBolt™ is made from SAE 9310 high-grade steel. This material makes for an extremely hard surface with a tough, ductile core resistant to structural failure and a life expectancy far exceeding Mil-spec 8620-type bolts. SAE 9310 is the same type of steel used in the transmission gears of Formula One racecars, and the high-load application of a bolt assembly is ideal for this state-of-the-art material; the results of actual full-auto endurance torture tests prove it.

The design of the JP EnhancedBolt™ addresses many other fine points, the most important of which is the utilization of a standard configuration extractor. Most users want the ability to replace extractors and other parts with commonly available Mil-spec parts instead of being dependent on proprietary parts that can be difficult to acquire. Therefore, this new bolt will accept standard extractors, pins and springs."

 Aluminum slides and frames make rimfire pistols exceptionally light—ideal for young.
