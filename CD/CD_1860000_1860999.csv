Brand new.,"North Macon, Macon, Georgia",$ 75,"Listed On: Friday, July 26, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a set of TruGlo TFO tritium/fiber green/green sights for a Sig #8. These are brand new sights. Purchased from Optics Planet in April.

 They were installed on my Sig 2022 by Ingleside Gun Works in Macon. I got home and noticed the front sight was not glowing. Thinking they were defective I bought some Meprolights and returned the pistol with the new sights to Ingleside Gun Works. So they gave me the TFOs back to return and installed the Meprolights. Well guess what. Got home to a dead front sight. So the sights are not defective the gun shop is.

 So after returning my installation fee they are taking care of the RMA of both sets of sights. In my opinion they should have returned my full retail price but when I got to the shop today they gave me these and told me I was free to take them home. I guess 'you broke it you buy it' does not apply to them.

 I finally sent the pistol to Sig and had them install Sig Lights on it for about the same price as the sights and installation. So I am now stuck with these and will soon be stuck with some Meprolights as well. All due to the incompetence of Ingleside Gun Works. 2 broken sets of sights in a row on the same gun makes me worry about anyone having real smithing work done at that shop. They are really nice guys but I will never have work done there again.

 So take your gun to Ingleside Gun Works at your own risk! Rant/over. 

 Ok so Now I have these sights. They have just come back from RMA and are in perfect condition. I paid $90 + shipping for them but I will part with them for $75. I would really prefer cash but will consider trade for 9mm, 10mm, 22 Magnum or 223/5.56. 22 Magnum would be my first choice in trade as it's so hard to find right now.

Specifications: above ^

This model is primarily used for advertising, however, it is easily used as a tv and pc monitor.
It has HDMI inputs which is very typical for modern electronics.
I use one of these for my Xbox 360 and my Desktop(1 tv, 2 appliances)

The ONLY downside is that this particular model does not come with a stand in the box. 

HOWEVER, this decision was made by Samsung to keep costs down to the consumer by allowing many mounting and setting options to be applied. 

Im asking $850 and $900, it normally goes for $1000+(before shipping). With the money you save, you can buy a mount or a stand and apply it however you would like.

Its brand new, in-box, box was only opened to check for remote and cables, and it put back in box. 
Also, have one entirely unopened."

It can be disassembled for cleaning.

The OUTBACK-IID is a highly advanced thread mounting .22LR caliber suppressor adaptable to almost all .22LR rifles and pistols. For its tiny size, the OUTBACK-IID has premium level sound reduction dry with some of the lowest first round in the industry, outperforming many significantly larger units. While a true bargain, Gemtech doesn't skimp on quality: 7075 high tensile strength aluminum is used (not cheaper, weaker grades), and a non-galling titanium thread mount area instead of cheap steels. It is finished in an attractive and durable matte hardcoat finish in black anodizing. Everything that makes up this silencer is premium, except the price.

It mates well with virtually any .22LR firearm which can have the barrel externally threaded. It is usable on pistols as well as a wide variety of .22 rimfire rifles. Since mounting to the firearm is accomplished by attachment to muzzle threads, the suppressor can be quickly removed for cleaning, compact carry, or storage.

IN SHORT: the best .22LR suppressor at the best price; a true ""Sweet Spot"" between sonic performance, price, size, and weight. The Outback-II is America's most popular suppressor for many good reasons, all backed by Gemtech's proven decades of the best customer service in the business!

Up for sale is the ubiquitous, cheap, and un-questionably ugly Hi-Point C9, a 9mm blowback semiautomatic. I've owned this gun for a few months, ran about 500 rounds through it, it's performed damn-near flawlessly. Comes with a spare mag. 

This is a great truck gun, toolbox gun, or canoe gun. Hi-Point has a no-questions asked warranty policy (that I never had to use), and it applies to the gun through multiple owners, so you're covered if anything should break. 

This thing is pretty accurate at 7 yards, meaning it'll absolutely blow apart a pop bottle or paper target in exactly the fashion you want. Anything beyond that gets a little iffy, because we're gallon about a handgun that retails for $150 brand new. 

I'm asking $110 and am also open to pretty much any trade; I'm stuck on the $110 for a cash sale, because it's in excellent shape and comes with an extra mag. 

I prefer to do face to face transactions, but will ship to an FFL if someone actually wants to pay shipping and transfer fees on this. Willing to drive a reasonable distance from my home on the near-Westside of Cleveland.

It's in perfect condition. Great gun.  Comes with 3 - 18 round magazines.  Preference given to those with a CCW permit.  Must sign a bill of sale.  Below is the description from the CZ website...

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

These Glocks features a unique, limited edition Olive Drab Green frame. The GLOCK 22 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this model of perfection that the majority of law enforcement across the country put their trust in every day. The Modular Back Strap design of the G22 Gen4 lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size, including the popular new beavertail backstrap. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G22 Gen4 .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

These pistols includes a speed loader and ship in a Glock branded padded hard case.

What is that??? That is the most common thing that my customers say when they see their target for the first time.
Ultimate Targets are made with the highest quality AR500 steel on the market. They are built with care and attention to detail and are built to last for years. Used properly, a target from Ultimate Targets will outlast the shooter. Do you have a concept for a target? I can work with you to make it a reality!

DUELING TREES:
I offer trees for pistol and rifle ammunition. I also offer trees for .22 rimfire ammunition only as well. The legs and target paddles are removable to make them easy to transport and store. Stakes are also provided to secure it to the ground. The AR500 paddles are 6"" round and 3/8"" thick.

This new 30-30 load was designed as the single 30-30 load for all big game hunting. The Barnes TSX opens fast enough to be brutal on deer sized critters, yet penetrates like TSX bullets normally do, so it gives ample penetration for larger species such as elk. While we feel the 30-30 is marginal for big bull elk, this is the load to use if you choose to pursue elk with a 30-30 and then use the same load to hunt deer, so you don’t have to readjust your sights for differing loads.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

Winchester has a solution for all your rimfire shooting needs. This Super-X Super Speed .22 Long Rifle ammunition with its 40 Grain Round Nose at 1300 fps is an ideal choice for small varmints, plinking, or target shooting. 

Winchester owes its humble beginnings to rimfire Ammunition. As a matter of fact, Winchester's first commercially available metallic cartridge ammunition was a large caliber rimfire load introduced back in 1866. More than 130 years later, rimfire is the world's most popular ammunition. As you would expect, Winchester has you covered with a complete line of high-performance cartridges including the undisputed heavyweight in rimfire ammunition - the 22 Winchester Magnum introduced in 1960. From precision target shooting to plinking, small-game hunting and silhouettes, Winchester is chosen by rimfire shooters worldwide.

You'd spend over $500 buying individually. I will not part out dies or any pieces, hence I won't reply to requests for selling dies or any other pieces unless the person who buys the press just doesn't want them.

Selling as a set for $350, local to RTP/Durham.

LaserLyte, innovators in firearms laser technologies, are rolling out the first Center Mass Laser for handguns and any firearm with a 1-inch minimum Picatinny rail space. The innovative laser system displays a ring of red laser dots surrounding the center aiming laser for quicker target acquisition and more shots on target. The CM-MK4 projects a ring of 8 red laser dots with one red laser dot in the center as the aiming laser. The circle grows at one-inch per yard, approximately the same configuration as a shotgun aimed at a moving target. The red laser circular pattern gives the user the advantage of a wide field-of-view while using both eyes for aiming. The Laserlyte CM-MK4 allows new shooters the advantage of building muscle reflex skills through learning the sight pattern for their specific firearm. For personal defense firearms, the laser circumvents the user from taking precious time aiming with sights when all the user has to do is position the center aiming laser to on the target. For target shooters with vision discrepancies, the CM-MK4 will bring back the fun in target shooting with more successful hits.

The Christensen Arms CA-10 is built on the AR-10 platform. Christensen has created an incredibly lightweight AR-10 that gives the shooter a new level of long range precision in a rapid-fire semi-automatic rifle. The CA-10 is built with a carbon-wrapped, match-grade barrel and is tipped with a titanium flash-hider or muzzle-brake. The hand-guard is constructed out of carbon fiber to lighten the front-end and create exceptional overall balance. It has an 18” barrel with a 1/10 twist. The rifle is equipped with a Magpul STR stock. It is a direct gas-impingement system in an AR platform. The full-length Picatinny top-rail makes it easy to mount any optics and accessories you want to add to your rifle. The bolt carrier group is nickel-boron, and this rifle accepts DPMS-style magazines. The CA-10 is unbelievably lightweight and easy to carry, weighing in at just over 7 lbs. 

FROM CHRISTENSEN:

CA-10 Recon Carbon Barrel

The CA-10 is Christensen Arms™ large-caliber AR-style firearm that weighs several pounds less than other guns of this type. The Carbon Barrel is available from SBR to 24” lengths. The nickel-boron coated bolt carrier acts as a protective finish, polishing the receiver each time it cycles. A perfect match for precision shooting, tactical drills, or hunting, the CA-10 comes in configurations to suit your specific needs.

It comes equipped with a Leupold Mark AR Mod 1 1.5-4x20 scope on a Leupold Mark 2 IMS one piece mount. This scope was designed for AR-15's, as it has a BDC dial tuned for the .223 cartridge at distances up to 650m, an illuminated mil reticle, and externally adjustable turrets with 1/10 MRAD clicks. I have the original box and paperwork for the scope and mount that I can include. The rifle is used but has been meticulously cleaned and maintained. It comes with the following parts installed:

- Magpul MOE black stock 
- Magpul MOE black grip 
- Magpul MOE black trigger guard (Cerakoted burnt bronze)
- Magpul ASAP 
- Magpul RSA 
- Magpul MS2 black sling 
- BCM Gunfighter charging handle

- Leupold Mark 2 IMS one piece scope mount 
- (1) black PMAG loaded with 30 rounds of PMC X-TAC 62gr 5.56 green tip ammo

The rifle has been professionally Cerakoted in Burnt Bronze and Black. The burnt bronze is a mix between FDE and brown, and it blends in well in most environments in North America. If you aren't familiar with Cerakote, it is by far the most durable, corrosion-resistant, rust-resistant, abrasion-resistant coating on the market. Simply put, it is a high dollar armor coating for your rifle. 

*** I will sell extra mags and/or ammo to the buyer for a discounted price if they choose so (as pictured below). I have 24 additional magazines total available (all 30rd): there are 9 PMAG's, 10 unissued steel GI mags--the same mags currently issued to the Army, and 5 Clinton-era Mil/LE-Restricted steel mags. In addition to them, approximately 700 rounds of .223/5.56 ammo are also available. There are 30 rounds of Remington soft point and ballistic tip hunting type cartridges, and the rest is Wolf 62gr hollow point .223.***

You can call or text me at 865-766-755five. Texting is much quicker and easier; please leave a voicemail if you call and I don't answer. Please NO EMAILS!! They tend to go to my spam folder. I am losing about $400 here, so the price is fixed at $1800 with the scope or $1400 without the scope. I REALLY want to trade for a Springfield M1A in either the full size or preferably the Scout length, or I could include all of the ammo and mags for an M1A in a Sage EBR chassis. Aside from those, I would just prefer cash. I will gladly ship everything to the FFL of your choosing if you cannot meet locally. Feel free to text me for more pictures or with any questions you may have. Thanks for looking and God bless!

The 556 has an ambidextrous thumb safety that was a bit stiff to operate on the test rifle, but has a short throw and is natural to operate, pushing downward to fire. The buttstock, hand guard, and lower receiver are made from a reinforced polymer. The trigger feel is unlike that of an AR. It is smooth with about three-eighths inch of travel, with a constant pressure throughout its travel. There is a handy back-up rear sight inlaid into the Picatinny rail that flips up for use. The SIG 556 wears a relatively thin sixteen inch barrel with a one-in-seven twist to accommodate any 223 or 5.56x45mm bullet. The muzzle is threaded, with a closed-bottom birdcage AR-15 style flash suppressor attached. The SIG 556 is very easy to disassemble for cleaning. It has a picatinny rail on the top and bottom so you can place a scope, laser, or whatever else will fit on the rifle. Overall a great rifle with the possibility of being upgraded however you wnt or just leaving it the way it is"

It is chambered in .308. The 22"" heavy barrel makes this rifle extremely accurate, while the synthetic stock helps to keep the weight down. I have a Millett 4-16x50 variable power, illuminated mil dot scope mounted on a EGW 20 MOA single piece mount. It also has a Shooters Ridge 6-9"" adjustable bipod. Between the stability of the bipod, the clarity and field of view of the scope, and the ease of the crisp 3lb adjustable trigger, I can cut clover leaf patterns out of targets at 100 yards. I will also include 2 boxes (40 rounds) of Federal Gold 168gr match grade ammo I am asking $850 obo.

SXT Deep Penetrator ammunition 20 cartridges to a box. Originally designed and released in 1991 this cartridge was the first to include a pre-scored jacket. It also included a reverse taper design which allowed it's signature talons to be released perpendicular to the bullet upon impact. The black color of the bullet comes from the oxidized copper jacket and the LubaLox coating which was new for Winchester at the time. LubaLox protects the rifling of the barrel as well as provides lubrication for the bullet while traveling the length of the barrel. It is still used on many of their cartridges today minus the black color. In all Black Talon was cutting edge technology for it's time, thee best hollow point on the market. After a few mass shootings Black Talon proved it's effectiveness but in an unfortunately negative light. Without even being on the market for two years Winchester decided it was in the company's best interest to pull the Black Talon line in 1993. However the Black Talon bullet was re-incarnated into brass casings and sold in boxes of 50 to law enforcement only up until 2000 under the name Ranger SXT which stood for (Supreme eXpansion Talon) but the media once again criticized the ""Talon"" name into nonexistence and it became known as (Supreme eXpansion Technology) a much more ""politically correct"" term. Although the Black Talon's days seemed over Winchester released a new cartridge in 2009 following the design nearly identically with some modern advancements. This new cartridge which was also part of the Supreme Elite Series, same as the Black Talon is know as PDX1. PDX1 is arguably one of the best cartridges on the market today, so much so, that it is the FBI's ammunition of choice  So what it comes down to is own a piece of Winchester history for $30.00. I will also ship UPS with tracking for $5 more. I hope you at least found my ad informative, thanks for looking"
