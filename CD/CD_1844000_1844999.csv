FAQ:

1.Can I use ANY stock assembly with the tactical stock adapter?
Yes. You can use any fixed stock, collapsible stock, folding stock etc. If it fits on AR-15 / M16 / M4 rifles it will work with the tactical stock adapter.


2.What are all the parts I need in order to use the tactical stock adapter?
1) Buffer tube (also known as a ""receiver extension"")
2) The shoulder stock of your choice
3) Anti-rotational receiver plate (should be included when you buy most stock assemblies)
4) Castle nut (should be included when you buy most stock assemblies)


3.Do I need to insert the buffer spring and the buffer weight inside the receiver extension (buffer tube) before I attach it to the tactical stock adapter?
No. Neither will be useful in this instance.


4.What tools do I need in order to install a tactical stock adapter?
None, but you may want to use a special AR-15 / M16 / M4 stock wrench to snug the castle nut up against the reciever plate, which holds your buffer tube secure. The castle nut does not need to be very tight so a good hand tightening should work fine. A dot of blue loctite will stop the castle nut from coming loose if the issue ever arises.


5.Can my compensated (C), long (L), or Rough Textured Frame (RTF) version Glock be used with the tactical stock adapter?
Yes, it will work with models G17C, G17L, G20C, G21C, G21L, G22C, G24C, and G31C and RTF versions, because the frame is the same size.


6.Will it fit the new Gen4 Glocks?
Yes, with very minor modification to the backstrap insert of the adapter."

This pistol has Meprolight raised adjustable night sights which are less than 6 months old, as well as an extended magazine release lever, a pair of decal grips sandpaper grip tape and a thread protector. 

The 2 original 12-Round factory magazines will be included along with 2 12-Round ProMag steel magazines and a single 20-Round ProMag steel magazine. 

I know ProMag has a pretty spotty reputation but there are a few types of mags that they manage to not screw up... and the 12-Round .45 ACP USP magazines are one of them. The 20-Round magazine is a good range tool... not something that I would use in combat, competition or defense purposes. 

Everything will be included in the original H&K hardcase that the weapon was packaged in, then there is also the owner's manual, 2 factory fired casings, cable gun-lock, replacement barrel o-rings, the standard size magazine release, the factory raised adjustable iron sights and the tool used to internally lock the weapon. 

I live in Scottsdale and would be willing to drive a reasonable distance to make the sale. I will take cash, money order or certified check or PayPal as forms of payment. You need to bring a copy of your legit Arizona ID card, as well as sign a bill of sale. If you are not within driving distance then I am willing to ship to a licensed FFL as long as you pay the costs and deliver payment before delivery. However, for anyone in a state that restricts magazine capacity I wouldn't be able to sell/ship the 5 magazines to you unfortunately. I suppose if you wanted to buy everything except the 5 magazines I would knock $50 off the price. 

I am not looking for a trade, including partial trades, so please do not inquire about them. Sorry.

The wood on the gun is in fine condition and the original finish is retained.  The checkering is original. Receiver, barrels and forearm all have matching serial numbers.  Lockup is good and tight.  The serial number 150xxx indicates the gun was manufactured in 1936.  Additional photos available upon request."

3.8"" XDM 9mm W/ Black Finish

The XD has taken on another design in the XDM Compact. The ""M"" stands for a Model contour frame, Major grasp slide serrations, Match-grade barrel, and Minimal reset trigger. The XDM has a whole other level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches specification and precision engineering like Springfield Armory.

XDM Features
XDM DESIGN

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.


(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.

(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.




(M)ega-Lock Texture

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function.

The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.




XDM TECHNOLOGY

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.


(M)elonite

Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 

The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry




(M)inimal Reset Trigger

The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.



XDM INNOVATIONS

The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.


(M)inimal Error Disassembly

Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

(M)aximum Reach Mag Release

The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.




(M)ega Capacity Magazine

The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag 
X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.



XDM PERSONALIZATION

Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.


(M)ould-Tru Backstraps

With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.

(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System

A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. 




(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case

Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.

(M)agazine X-Tensions

With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)



XDM STANDARDS

In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that….


Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.

Striker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 




USA Trigger System

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

Grip Safety

Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol."

As a defensive cartridge, the 357 Magnum has the highest percentage for one shot stops. The 6 inch barrel allows for optimal performance of 357 rounds and gives you a longer sight radius, allowing for pinpoint accuracy. Add to this the fact that you can also shoot more affordable 38 special and 38 special +p rounds, and you have a powerful, accurate and versatile heirloom quality firearm that the whole family can enjoy. With a revolver this powerful and accurate, you can hunt or protect from anything up to a black bear.

These are the exact same guns used by Weatherby for their Vanguard series of rifle. This is the flagship of the Howa line. This rifle has a green Hogue Overmolded Stock which is soft rubber over an aluminum skeleton, providing a positive grip in all weather conditions, reduced shooting fatigue and high resistance to most gun solvents. The barrel is free floated for maximum accuracy. 

This package includes a Nikko Sterling Targetmaster 4-16x44 scope with rings and a one piece base. A 10 round detachable magazine and 6""-9"" bipod. I have the original flush fit magazine plate as well if you wish to stick with the internal 5 round magazine. Also included is a Tipton carbon fiber cleaning rod, A-Zoom snap caps and a Game Winner lockable hard case that's been cut to hold the rifle, bolt, magazine and cleaning rod. The purchaser will also get four boxes (80 rounds) of the best .308 ammo out there - 168gr Federal Gold Medal Match with the Sierra Match King BTHP. If you're interested I also have about 100 rounds of .308 that I acquired and found out they were reloads (which I will not shoot). I will give you those for free with the rifle if you want them. 

I've shot exactly 40 rounds through this rifle. 20 rounds of Barnes VOR-TX 168gr and 20 rounds of the Federal Gold Medal Match mentioned above. The barrel was broken in using the following method. Cleaned after each shot for 5 rounds, cleaned after every 3 shots for 15 rounds, cleaned after every 5 shots for 20 rounds. The barrel has been cleaned a total of 15 times and should be ready to go.

Despite being 93 years old the bore is mirror bright, truly pristine quality. I have personally shot this rifle and was able to get about a 1.5 MOA group offhand. The wood has a great grain and it looks amazing for 92 years old.

 The bad is that the stock has a crackin it. As picture 3 will show the crack, it is big. The crack makes it so I cannot shoot it, however with a stock repair it would be perfectly shootable. I just do not have the minor skills to fix it, two screws into the wood and some strong wood glue should completely fix it.

 Due to the crack I am selling this cheap, I do not have time to repair it, with my other more pressing projects. So I am selling this for $250. It is easily worth 350+ due to the barrel, however. Again it shoots amazing and with some screws, wood glue, and time it would be a 350-400 rifle.

First I have a cut down 1943 AFH Bayonet, it looks like it was possibly sharpened some time in its life but it is not Greek marked, it will also come with a 16"" cut down scabbard. The scabbard is marked US with the flaming bomb I am asking $60 shipped. 

Next, I have a P-13 Bayonet. The original grips were cracked and the screws were rusted so I replaced with with new production grips and screws that were identical to the originals. It also comes with the scabbard. The bayonet is Remington Marked and say 8-1? I believe the number that is missed is a 3 so it is 8-13 marked, it also has US stamped on it and the British proofs stamps as well and they are lined out. I'm asking $65 shipped.

Next, I have a German Butcher Blade. It is not the razorback. The blade has been reblued, I believe this was a bayonet that was issued to one of the Spanish countries after WWI. It still shows the Wehimar Stamps on the blade as well as the factory: Ficthel & Sachs Schweinfurt the scabbard is number is 8610. I'm asking $215 shipped.

This pistol is about more than appearance, though. The alloy frame reduces the overall weight to just 33 ounces, which is very light for a full-size 1911, and makes it a good choice for carry. The low profile 3-dot Tritium combat sights won't snap on your clothing, and give you an edge in low light.

Front and rear slide serrations allow for fast cycling of the action with either hand. The ambidextrous safety is a great bonus for left-handed shooters, or for shooting weak hand
