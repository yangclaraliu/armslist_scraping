I have for sale a NEW holster with 4 mag pouches that fits the FNH FNX40, FNP40, FNX45 and FNP45. This holster will also fit the FNX9 and FNP9 but the mags will be a little looser in the mag pouches.

That is a total of 5 mags with gun on this rig. Don't be left empty handed. Be prepared. Don't use up valuable space on your vest when you can have one of these. The holster is fully secured to the leg extender. This rig is designed for the most rigorous combat situations. This rig puts your gun right near the palm of your hand. The revolutionary holster holds your firearm securely with the Positive Lock Trigger Guard. There are two retension screws, allowing the user to fine tune their draw to their specific needs. This holster rig also has an elastic secure cord that can be used to help secure the gun in the holster during rigorous situations such as running or going through brush, crawling, jumping, etc. The leg extender has the leg strap to secure the bottom of the holster as well. Has 4 Molle II mag pouches that will hold any of the FNP and FNX 45 mags. The leg extender will fit on any belt as well as any Molle II equipment and the 4 mag pouches can also fit on any belt and Molle II equipment. Leg extender is grey in color and the 4 pouches are digital ACU.

Product Information
 Aimpoint CompM4 sights are the finest sights that Aimpoint has ever produced. The improved energy efficiency provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery! Aimpoint CompM4 sights incorporate an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of firearms. They can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision compatibility. CompM4 sights are available in two versions. The two versions are identical except that the CompM4 offers a high battery compartment, while the CompM4S offers a low battery compartment. The Aimpoint CompM4 is now the latest version of the US Army's M68 CCO (Close-Combat Optic), continuing a legacy that Aimpoint has maintained since 1997. The performance of the CompM4 sights is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD. With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 Daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 and CompM4S are ready for use around the clock. 

Technical Information: Aimpoint CompM4 and CompM4S

Only 6 rounds fired to insure operability.

This is the second stainless steel Flattop chambered in 45 Colt with the first being the same gun in 5-1/2"".  As of right now, these are the only Ruger 45 Colt stainless steel single action revolvers with adjustable sights being produced.  The regular stainless steel Blackhawk in 45 Colt was discontinued by Ruger several years ago. 
As a bonus, Lipsey's spec'd out these guns to include an auxillary 45 ACP cylinder.  This production run also features ""gunfighter"" style simulated ivory grips that Ruger has used on some of their special edition guns, such as the Joe Bowman commemorative.  The front sights on these 45 Colt revolvers are taller so that there is plenty of elevation available for various bullet weights.  On this stainless version, the front sight is pinned into the base so you can switch the front sight out for other heights or configurations that work best for you.  All parts, including the gripframe and ejector rod housing are made out of a brushed finish stainless steel. This configuration combined with the ruggedness of stainless steel construction really make this gun ready for hard use in the field.

Very secure and seals up like a commercial freezer.  Can easily be bolted to the floor or wall. Holds up to 20 long guns and up to 30 handguns. I've built a few of these recently and some people wanted a less expensive version so instead of the full 1/8 inch polished diamond plate interior, i did the bottom half in nice black carpet and the top half in polished diamond plate. Also I left out the fireproof document safe i usually install to help on cost . this one has 20 color LED lights that are remote control. And an 18 inch gun vault dehumidifier. I haven't painted the outside yet so it looks weathered, not rusty. I can paint it if u like. Thieves would never suspect that it's a safe.  Asking 750 price is negotiable and i do trade for the right stuff. I have pics for serious inquiries. Thanks"

I did this just in case, sometimes kimber break in periods can be a little bit funky! Shot 200 rounds of wwb 230 grain fmj through it, without a single problem of any kind!!! none!!!This is my second kimber, the first was a pro CDP II, I sold that one because I was concerned about the longevity of the alloy frame! This frame and slide are both stainless steel!!! This pistol is dead accurate!!! Comes with extras! Original magazine(unused), 3 kimpro tac mags that each hold 8 rounds, extra set of brand new grips, original recoil spring, and another brand new recoil spring(kimber 22lb), and everything else as new!!! I just decided that I like shooting the 9mm more than the 45 ACP! Not planning on putting anymore rounds through this gun.. If you want it, it's yours! It's one badass gun!

This holster uses belt loops at the front and rear to pull your handgun tight against your body for better concealment. The angle this holster positions your handgun allows faster drawing with full combat grip, more comfortable wearing, and much safer use.
A regular Small of the Back (SOB) holster places your gun over the base of the spine. A fall or hard blow with your gun in that position could cause serious spinal cord injury. Our holster is engineered for kidney carry to avoid that danger.
Made of waterproof foam for a comfortable carry and to protect gun from moisture. Lined on both sides with rugged Cordura® nylon for durability and a smooth, fast draw. Webbing inside the holster protects your gun’s sights and keeps holster partially open for easier re-holstering. Great for use while driving. Comes with an adjustable thumb break to keep gun secure. Fits belts up to 1½” wide. Available for right or left hand draw. Black. Made in the USA.

It was made in the famous Soviet factory of Izhevsk. This is a fabulous rifle with a barrel that has strong rifling and grooves. The rifle has all matching serial numbers and is in very good shape! This rifle will make a great shooter. This rifle no longer fits in my collection and therefore I'm selling it. It does have quite a bit of cosmoline preservative on the parts and there is a 3-4 inch by 1 inch part of the stock with a factory repair. I'm not looking to profit on this sale but to pass along a great rifle. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept a Concealed Weapons License number on the bill of sale which would eliminate a DLN and Date of Birth. Thank you!

Specs:
The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 7 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75"" shells each, for a total capacity of 7+7+1=15 rounds. The pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in.
