Backstrap is ribbed, and top sightline is checkered. The workmanship is a good bit superior to the new ones that cost over a grand. Not just opinon, I got that from the Smith Boards.
This was one of three with sequential serial numbers bought new in 1977. This one was part of my intial settlement of an estate some time back that seems to have slowed to a halt. It would be more expensive but I don't have access to the oeigional grips of box. I can't trade it back to the other heir because he'll never have time to shoot it and hopes to thin the herd himself. Anyway, It was shot a bit the first year it was owned and then put away. I'm still shooting mine pretty regular with no problems. I didn't guess on the finnish because I'm bad at it. I often screw myself and on one occasion I made a fellow uptight who felt I tilted it about 4% my way. I can tell you it mechanicaly perfect, looks good, and scares folks the way a Glock  never will.
It comes with a box of ammo that's about half and 38/357 for you to check it out with and a new G&G duty holster of the same vintage that also has a regular belt slot which would work just fine for the range.

Original Hk-91 7.62X51 German rifle, German makrkings, ( In English.) 2 factory 20 round HK German mags (0-1) safety, not (S-F like later versions.) Collectable. This is not just one gun, it is a bulilt package deal. $2500.00. German quality has always been at the top of the line. Was priced at $5000.00 and worth every penny!

First 2500.00 gets the whole package, scope and all, I can't go below this, please, make an offer don't offer less. The weapon has not been fired 500 times.

I'Ve cut it to the bone, don't have a great deal to work with on the whole package but will be considerate to any offers made, no more will ever be imported.

LIKE NEW TO EXCELLENT CONDITION, MUST SEE, OWNER'S MANUAL inclulded, PSG-1 trigger group from HK $12000.00 PSG-1 Sniper Rifle (In the early 1990's, no idea what it sells for now. It will never be inported again.)  installed, breaks clean at 3.5 lbs. ($700.00), HK claw lock scope mount with WEAVER BASE, ($600.00) that detaches and returns to ZERO, 6.5X20 Leupold Vari-X III 40 MM AO Scope/W 3"" Sunshade and Butler Creek Scope covers ($1000.00), ORIGINAL HK EJECTION PORT BUFFER, ($200.00) ORIGINAL HK BI POD, ($350.00) Bipod folds into front stock groves.) ORIGINAL HK BUTT STOCK EXTENSION, ($150.00) Fabian Brother's Muzzle Break, ($200.00) 2 original HK German 20 Rd. mags. Original changed out HK parts included. I have 20, 20 Round Thermold mags that can be negociated intio this offer.

WILL TAKE $2500.00 for the entire package or US 1 OUNCE GOLD EAGLES at spot price, US Silver Eagles are also welcome at spot price. Feel free to make me an offer.

This is a nail driver at 750+ yards. About 3/4 mile is max accurate range for this cartridge.I know you can still get parts for the weapon but you cannot get parts to do the modifications to the weapon, this is as close to a PSG-1 Sniper Rifle except for the stock and barrel that you will ever find, it is not a PSG1 but shoots like one. It will shoot 1/2 minute of angle at 200 yards, no problem.  Not negotiable, no longer imported.  Fine weapon for collecting or personal and home defense. Excellent Sniper Rifle.

PTR ""look alikes"" are available but they are not H&K's and try to find one now. They are moving out of Conn. Not sure to where.

This price is very reasonable but when you add all the custom pieces to the current price of the rifle in new condition you will find that you can't build one like this for anywhere close to this amount, I doubt you can find the parts to build it now without paying much more than what you would for the rifle as it has been built. 

The rifle, scope, and all original mags and all the HK accessories would cost much more than I'm asking. This is a seriously custom built rife for battle, can be returned to factory stock in less than 15 minutes, all factory stock parts included. 100% realiable and capable of 3/4 mile shots. 

It will out perform any AR-10 made, load it, throw it into a lake for a week in mud and sludge, pick it out, deactivate the safety and it will empty the mag with no problems, (This has not been done with this one but I have personally seen it done with the full auto G3 version,) try that with an AR-10 or the PTR-91 ""Clone"" for that matter."

373,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1489373,For Sale/Trade:  Avon RIB with 9.9 Mercury !!!,"Smithfield, Wilmington, North Carolina","$ 4,500","Listed On: Saturday, April 20, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"The RIB is a 2009 Avon Rover 310 Lite, it is made of Hypalon and will last 30 years if taken care of. It is loaded with everything you need to hit the water., 2009 Mercury 9.9 motor, as new, pump, oars, tank, everything. It is a BLAST !!! 
There’s a reason the Navy SEALS use Hypalon RIB’s as does the Coast Guard for rescue missions,,,,,they are TOUGH, they are nearly unsinkable and draft very little water. They can carry a ton of weight and go anywhere. This RIB is carried to the water in my Yukon, in it’s own bag, or on it’s trailer. The floor is rigid, just like a boat, so it’s very tough, easily beached without harm. I use this on local lakes and also down at the beach on the ICW and on nice days you can hit the open ocean !!! Fishing off the RIB is easy. You can go where no one else can, explore remote locations and beach at secluded beaches no one else can get to!
 This set up was  $5,520.00 new, WITHOUT the trailer and used less than 15 times. About $6,300.00 WITH the trailer !

 Again, look at the Navy SEAL and Rescue boats, they use RIB’s !!!

I bought a trailer to make transport even easier ! Then I customized it to also haul the Mercury 9.9 so as to avoid the hassle of putting it in the car trunk, the motor just mounts to the front of the trailer. 

Price is $4,500.00, no less, for everything. I’m looking for guns, ammo and a safe.
 I would also consider a street bike on trade.

If the RIB is so great, why am I selling it ???? I have a 22’ Stingray and I just inherited a mint 18” 1964 Chris Craft and a 16’ Bass boat. I only have so much room /time for boating."

Matching serials on bolt and receiver. The rifles is in great shape: wood's in good shape, no rust, detents on safety are positive and firm, action moves smoothly. Trigger is pretty nice for a milsurp rifle. Sights are in good shape, and they are frequently missing. Not so with this. I have some accessories that I am trying to dig out of storage: sling, cleaning kit, manual, etc. Bore is shiny and rifling sharp. Also included are 8 stripper clips and 58 rounds of commercial ammunition. Would make a great hunting rifle, especially with a cheap scope adapter in place of the rear sight. I am interested in trades. Message me through the site if you are interested. Pictures are available here.http://imgur.com/a/r7MuM"

These are hard to find and are extremely accurate. It has a Bushnell illuminated 1x32 scope and is dialed in at 200 yards. It has had very few rounds through it (less than 200) and looks and shoots like new. It has a custom camo job on it. I removed all of the camo except for the side of the stock that is away from you cheek if you are a right handed shooter. I left it on there for additional concealment when I was calling coyotes. The bull barrel cuts down on recoil and improves accuracy and it doesn't add much weight. It does come with a bi-pod too. It is an awesome gun.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4.

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud

- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification

Springfield Armory XDM95259BHC XDM Competition 9mm 5.25"" 19+1 Poly Grip Black

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World
Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for
competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened
recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced
performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front
sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots.
Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load
combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass
which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be
used.
