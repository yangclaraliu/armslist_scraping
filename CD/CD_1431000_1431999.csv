It was made in 1943. This one has a not so common straight line guard marking. Reading just Ka-Bar on one side and USN on the other side. 

Handle is in good shape. Has USN etched in and initials on other side. Sheath is in good shape. Has the guys nickname on front and his last name on back. On the blade he etched his initials which match up to his last name. I paid to have his name looked up in archieves and he was a marine who enlisted at the age of 19 pre pearl harbor. 

The blade has been sharpened because it was used. I have knives that are pristine but just like those WWII rifles that are spotless. Mostly because they were never issued or never saw frontline battle service. Blad is still in good shape. 
It is the correct leather sheath with sewing and the staples. Keeper is ok too. 

Selling this for 170 FIRM. I will not come down or deal. These as mostly any Mk2 sell for this and more on any site online. So don't ask if I will come down. If you think my price is to high and can find them down the road for 50 dollars then by all means buy those. I'm not giving mine away, especially with the attached history of the soldiers name.

With unrelenting precision and unfailing accuracy, this bolt action newcomer has already defined a whole new class of long-range rifles.

The MRAD rifle’s user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun’s modularity. The precision-grade barrel can be removed by simply unscrewing two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design paves the way for future caliber interchangeability and serviceability.

The MRAD also boasts Barrett’s new easily accessed trigger module. This match-grade trigger is drop-fire-proof and combat-ready. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld.

Integrated into the MRAD rifle’s 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is an M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper and 21.75 inches of rail space. The configurable side and bottom rails can also hold a number of accessories.

The MRAD rifle’s stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. When folded, the stock latches around the bolt handle for added security during transport. Because the stock folds to the bolt handle side of the action, the rifle is the same width overall, folded or extended.

Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle’s length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button.

From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color of the rifle that blends into any environment—every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own.

Bolt guide acts as a dust cover to reduce contaminants

It holds 7+1 of the powerful .45 acp cartridge in a small package which is easy for deep concealment (I can conceal this thing under an undershirt easily, even with the extensions).

Note: This Glock is missing the slide release lever (old one was crappy, and since I never use that function of the gun, I just got rid of it), so slide will not lock back.

Note: I can install a ghost 3.5 connector and ny trigger spring if you would like, or I can leave it stock. Let me know which you would prefer (Ghost and NY combination makes it a much better feeling, crisp trigger, imo).

The SIG P220 has been made in 45acp for almost 40 years... from 1976-1979 there were four different calibers made in a model P220. 45acp,  38 super , 22 Long Rifle and 9mm.
The 38 Super being the most rare the 9mm caliber P220 was a production run for 3 years and have not been made since. Nor according to SigSauer will they ever be again.
There will not be any more of these 9mm P220's made.. additionally this Particular P220 has a stainless steel upper... which was only about 10% of the total production. The combination of the short run..and the rarity of the stainlesss steel slide make this particular gun fairly rare. If you are a serious SIG collector this would be a must-have. I would like for the gun to go home with someone who appreciates its rarity and the quality of the craftsmanship. The frame of the gun milled from aluminum has been cerakoated inside and out. It is hands down the best  coating I have seen done. The color is silver and makes areally nice contrast to the stainless steel slide. When Disassembled the gun is in pristine condition inside and out. and in fully functional  coniditon.. no visible wear on any internal or external parts. This is an excellent guin and would be a great additioon to any collection or  could be used as a daily carry.. great gun!
Original era correct wooden SIG handles.. currently these are only available for purchase frmo SIG online.. and they were  what was issued with the gun in 1976 when it was made. The slide and all functions are tight and crisp. Trigger pull is consistent through te pull.
The serial numebrs on the barrel frame and slide all match
 The magazine release is the european location on the bottom of the grip next to the mag as opposed to the american location. The gun is proof marked to have been made in germany

I am asking 800$ or best offer for the gun but would prefer a trade to a similar interesting gun.. preferrably in 45 or 40 caliber but may consider any firearm  trade

I am looking to sell my 1995 Volkswagen GTI Vr6 project car. I bought this off of my friend who was the original owner. Thinking I could finish it up and have a very fun street tuner. Unfortunately I need to sell this or possibly trade it for a car I can drive daily. The car runs and actually drives flawlessly!! It just needs some final work to get it perfect! Less than 300$ and a little bit of time and you are good to go.

The good

Strong running recently rebuilt Vr6 engine.
New upper and lower chains
10.5 fly wheel
stage 2 clutch kit
Polished manifold
red silicone coolant piping all through bay
new thermostat and housing
new water pump
newer alternator
new spark plugs and wires
new coil pack
Strong running 5 speed transmission
working aftermarket cd player and speakers
Tires with atleast 50% tread all around
original OE VW rims!
newer brake pads/brake lines
newer fuel pump
Central alarm system works

The bad

Needs driver side door (I have the door panel and trim and handle/keys etc so you literally need the door frame itself.)
Needs driver side fender
Could use paint on the hatch, roof,and hood. clear coat has started peeling, I have begun to sand it enough to have it resprayed though!)
Needs shift boot installed (I have one though to put back on it)
Could use a good wash/wax/clean (if i dont get to it already)
A couple small tears on driver seat.

Like I said the Car DOES Run and Drive flawlessly, still pulls strong etc. It just needs a door to be road legal. the rest is mainly TLC stuff. The body has roughly 180,000 on it, the engine and transmission have around 58,000 on them give or take a few miles.

I am looking to sell this project for 1600$. For the amount of work and parts that have been put into it it is worth it. You literally can go to a scrap yard and find a door and fender and boom you have a perfect running fairly fast GTI Vr6 for cheap. If I end up getting the money to buy the parts and paint it I will keep it. But as of right now I need to sell it to buy a clean, reliable 5 speed car. I will take trades on a CLEAN/RELIABLE @@MANUAL TRANSMISSION ONLY@@ CAR. IT CAN BE ANY MAKE AND MODEL CAR AS LONG AS ITS RELIABLE, FAIRLY CLEAN, AND A MANUAL TRANSMISSION.

This rifles practically ""Brand New""...havn't even gotten passed the breakin on it. You can see it and appreciate it. If you where to see it's internal parts you would notice that it hasn't been broken in period! All your tactical removable front and rear forged black matte finish iron Put down range maybe 50rds at the most. Only and exclusively ""QULAITY AMMO""..need to quote that! ""Lead Free"" guys.. Only Copper Plated...my faves 40gr hollow point Federals smooth and sights, rear site flips for eye compensation, front ""Polymer"".. quad rail, not ""Aluminum""... which is not as hard! Comes with a standard A2 style pistol grip, but as you can appreciate on the pics, i have upgraded it with a Hogue 4 finger pistol grip which gives you a snug and sweat free grasp which i love, compared to the standard plastic composite factory version. Pretty much your true legit AR in a .22 Cal an exact clone of the big brother .223/5.56 beautiful rifle. It also has the bolt lock and release button on the left side as well as your fire and safety lever. I have all receipts and warranties including original box, comes with it's standard 10rd mag plus a S&W/M&P 25rd mag i purchased along with it. Bi-pod, Lower quad rail fore end grip i believe it's by Magpul, Optics by Barska with ready mounts Picatinney rail, as you can see in the pics. Red Dot very good scope, about $100 bucks, but very good quality. Also all your quad rail rubber grippers by U.T.G. Lastly, just purchased as you can see 3 Winchester bricks 555rds each, believe 1665rd all together couldn't find federals, but this ammo is as good quality wise as the Federals in preference in my opinion! Lead free..Copper Plated, again hollow points love the damage aftermath on any varmint which never had the privilege since i am still thinking of really keeping it!!! Just to add, it took me only 15rds to drill the red bull at 100 yards. Started of course at 15 yards... then the rest of the 35 were at 1/2 to 2 inch groups...very, very, accurate rifle, fires true!! Purchased it plain no scope for $484 plus taxes $500 and change.. in upgrades $350.......Sorry for all the writing, just wanted to be specific."

The rear sight combo is also found on the Mossberg 500 SPX, 590A1 SPX and 930 SPX. It has a forged steel tactical safety, 7 round side saddle w/adjustable tension on each shell. Blackhawk SpecOps Gen II recoil reducing 7 postition buttstock. Blackhawk SpecOps PowerPack high rise cheek rest, CR123 battery tube and 5 shot saddle. The forend is a billet aluminum ERGO 1913 Picatinny rail system. Mounted on the ERGO is a Streamlight 88040 ProTac HL 600 Lumen Flashlight. This flashlight is the brightest tac light I've used, it is mounted using a Surefire mount. It has 3 modes full on 600 lumen, 600 lumen strobe and 30%. Also has a MagPul AFG2 the real USA made not a knockoff or PTS. The AFG2 is set up so you just hit the light switch with your left thumb and can be easily changed for a left hand shooter. Along with this package will be a 123 round bandoleer. I'll include 60 rnds of mixed 00, 0000 & slug ammo, the ammo pictured on the bandoleer is a stock photo and for presentation only. Again all items used in this build are factory new not knockoffs and I will include the literature that came with the items. Just between the build items and the ammo there's $700 invested. The Mariner's without these upgrades run $450 if you can find one. Subtract $700 from the $850 that leaves $150 saving $300 on the price of a new one.  7 six five 3 seven 6 nine 5 seven 7 - Todd"

We are now using ATF's new Eform system and it has reduced the wait time from 10 months to 3-5 months. Hurry and get yours before the wait time gets bumped back up. Our prices are typically below MSRP and we have silencers that can fit anyone's budget. Military is welcome to purchase suppressors as long as you are PCS in Oklahoma. If you chain of command allows it you can take these on deployments since we know that only the ""cool guys"" get them issued. You never know this could be the piece of equipment that helps save your life or someone else. It helps reduce recoil, keeps your situational awareness, and reduces your muzzle signature when you fire. These are just a few reasons that they could benefit a combat soldier. I sale all major brands of silencers so if you have a special request just ask. It is now legal to hunt with silencers in Oklahoma so get one before the wait gets longer. Anyone who can buy a handgun should be able to qualify for a silencer. I will complete all paperwork for you and make the transfer a smooth and easy process. If you decide to put your suppressor in a trust which I recommend, I can assist you with the process and you won't have to get the CLEO sign off or fingerprints. ATF has proposed to start making trusts also get the CLEO sign off and fingerprints but it is not in effect yet so hurry before the process gets more difficult. Transferable MAC 10 Machine guns typically start at $4500.00 and go up from there. The process for transferable machine guns is the same for silencers, and YES civilians in Oklahoma can own machine guns and you only have to pay the one time $200.00 for the ATF tax stamp when you purchase it. I am an experienced class 3 dealer and if you have any other class 3 or NFA needs or questions please contact me at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED. Leave a message in reference to what you are calling about if I don't answer and I will call you back ASAP. Thanks.

These rifles have a Bell & Carlson, aluminum pillar bedded Kevlar stock.  Black, with the baked on, easy grip finish.  It has the cooling holes in the forearm, & a black Decellerator pad.  It also has two swivel studs in the forearm (one for a bipod/accessory, & the other for a sling).

The receiver & the floor plate/trigger guard are matte blue, & the barrel is matte stainless, fluted, 24 inches long.  The action is Controlled Round Feed (CRF).  That would be a ""claw"" action, to you hard core model 70'ers.

It is in excellent condition.  Other then some discoloration, on the bolt, & a couple minor marks on the top of the barrel; there isn't a mark on it.  It has the smoothest action, I have ever seen, on any bolt action rifle.

We took a photo of the marks on the bolt.  We tried to photograph the marks on the top of the barrel, but they didn't show up in the photo.

We sold this rifle to a guy about two years ago, so we know it has been shot for about two years.  He came in & traded it for one of the new Coyotes, with the threaded barrel (the suppressor ready Coyote).

We take all major credit cards, with a 3% credit card sur-charge. We will also take a check, but we will have to delay shipping for a couple days; on out-of-state checks. 

Of course, money orders & CODs are welcome (add $9.00 for COD). 

This rifle will have to be shipped to your FFL.  If you need help finding a FFL to ship to, we can usually find one for you, in a couple minutes.

In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

(Per Magpul’s product description) – 
Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts.  The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.
The PMAG 30 AR/M4 Gen M2 MOE is a 30 round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/m4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI.  It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.
The Gen M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately.
Made in the USA.

Cowboy Action Shooters.,"Lake View, Buffalo, New York",$ 450,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 10, 2013",Shotguns,Winchester                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This is a pre-64 Model 12 in 12 gauge, with the nickel steel barrel and 2.75"" chamber. It began its career as a field grade 28"" mod choke until I had the barrel professionally shortened and crowned and the bead reset for its current riot-gun configuration.

The gun is a 1954 issue, back from the peak of Winchester's quality, and is in excellent mechanical shape and very good cosmetic shape (only flaw is a small area of shallow pitting and bluing loss on left side of receiver). The solid, straight-grain black walnut stocks retain about 85% of their finish and are crack-free. The bluing and overall fit and finish are excellent. It has a cylinder-bored 20-inch barrel with a bead sight, and the chamber and bore are mirror-bright, as both have just been professionally honed and the barrel back-bored.

This would be an excellent Cowboy Action or Bowling Pin shotgun. It would also be a very good deer gun with slugs or buckshot in brush or tight cover. And, of course, it would make a very persuasive and effective home defense gun. As this model was one of the very few (with the Win. Model 97 and early Ithaca 37) ever built without a trigger disconnect, it can be slam-fired--almost as fast as an autoloader. It is short, well-balanced, and shucks lightning-fast. And, of course, it has that unmistakable heft and feel of a pre-64 Winchester, when polished blued steel and real walnut were standard equipment. Unlike today's cheap pumpguns, the only plastic part associated with this gun is the Winchester embossed buttplate.

These rifles have a Bell & Carlson, aluminum pillar bedded Kevlar stock.  Black, with the baked on, easy grip finish.  It has the cooling holes in the forearm, & a black Decellerator pad.  It also has two swivel studs in the forearm (one for a bipod/accessory, & the other for a sling).

The receiver & the floor plate/trigger guard are matte blue, & the barrel is matte stainless, fluted, 24 inches long.  The action is Controlled Round Feed (CRF).  That would be a ""claw"" action, to you hard core model 70'ers.

It is in excellent condition.  Other then some discoloration, on the bolt, & a couple minor marks on the top of the barrel; there isn't a mark on it.  It has the smoothest action, I have ever seen, on any bolt action rifle.

We took a photo of the marks on the bolt (we took the photo on 24x, so the discoloration would show up; consequently, it looks like the bolt is pitted; it isn’t, the finish on the bolt is silky smooth; these are just marks, & they are barely visible to the naked eye).  We tried to photograph the marks on the top of the barrel, but they didn't show up in the photo.

We sold this rifle to a guy about two years ago, so we know it has been shot for about two years.  He came in & traded it for one of the new Coyotes, with the threaded barrel (the suppressor ready Coyote).

We take all major credit cards, with a 3% credit card sur-charge. We will also take a check, but we will have to delay shipping for a couple days; on out-of-state checks. 

Of course, money orders & CODs are welcome (add $9.00 for COD). 

This rifle will have to be shipped to your FFL.  If you need help finding a FFL to ship to, we can usually find one for you, in a couple minutes.

Hello and thank you for checking out  my riffle. Up for auction is a very lightly used Vigilance Rifles 408 Cheytac simiauto. You wont see many of these in your life, so take the opportunity to own one now. All of these rifles are truly custom. Just think about the size of a 408 Cheytac shell in a simiauto rifle. This is truly Big Game hunting redefined. Any hunt, any country, any animal, is yours for the taking with this beast. The fluted barrel is 23 inches and 26 inches with the break. Very comfortable to shoot and optic ready..

Money order and paying into bank all accepted!!! 



From Vigilance Rifles:
408 Cheytac. The Holy Grail of rifle cartridges, especially when being shot by the VR1 rifles. Quick follow up shots and easy impact reading from the low recoil of the VR1 Rifles is one of the key advantages of stepping down to a 408 Cheytac cartridge from the much bigger 416 Barrett or 50 BMG rifles. Not to mention VR1 rifles only weigh 18 lb. which means you can actually take it some where. It is the cartridge that I designed the VR1 rifles to shoot, all other calibers that we offer just happen to fit in the VR1 Rifles.

Rocky Mountain Bullets has developed real 420 gn. RBBT bullets for the 408 Cheytac, it certainly has taken the 408 Cheytac to a new level in performance. With the new bullets shooters are able to achieve long periods of sustained fire before accuracy deteriorates due to fouling, compared to shooting solid monolithics. 

Distinctive from all others the VR1 is the only Semi-Auto Autoloader on the market chambered in the 408 Cheytac or 505 Gibbs. It is also available in 338 Lapua. The 408 Cheytac cartridge is a highbred, with confirmed kills out to 1 mile from trained hands. The VR1 holds five cartridges in 408 Cheytac - 505 Gibbs and 338 Lapua. The 338 Lapua is NATO and ammo is in military armaments, RAUFUS-AP-API are available, the cartridge proves well out to 1500 yards. VR1 shoots 1 MOA accuracy with 338 Lapua or 408 Cheytac in trained hands. The VR1 is not your typical M16 type conversion sniper rifle. We take great pride in the fact we completely manufacture it from the ground up. Our true 2-stage trigger with oil-lite bearings for a consistent reliable trigger pull. There are four sizes of bi pods and a mono pod available for different shooting requirements they change out in seconds. Our sling is attached to the internal frame of the rifle so an accidental dropping of the rifle due to sling pull is eliminated. The sling design also enables it to double as a turnacate. The Mill-Spec scope rail is mounted with (TORX-FHCS) this precision aligns the scope with the barrel eliminating bullet shift at different distances. Our safety is ambidextrous push type ( Fail Proof) with easy visual identification. We use a rotary screw bolt system that screws the bolt shut; this feature virtually eliminates the required force for opening and shutting the bolt. This is one of the key reasons that we are the only manufacturer able to make the 408 Cheytac cartridges shoot flawlessly in a Semi-Auto Autoloader. Rotary lock rifles usually use a spring loaded ejector, which can cause jams with high rate fire, the VR1 uses a Rotary screw bolt and fixed ejector for sure ejection and no jams. It is unusual to find a large caliber Semi-Auto Autoloader rifle that shoots as accurately and reliably as the VR1. 

BENEFITS - A Long-range PRECISION SNIPER RIFLE (PSR) with quick follow up shots due to low recoil of Semi-Auto operation and Auto loading. Quick detachable magazines for instant load selection and increased firepower. Robust sturdy design that easily assembles and breaks down with no tools in under a minute with no loss of bullet impact. Easily concealable, no assembly being longer than 33 inches. Variable caliber interchangeable barrels. A gas forward design allowing for longer periods before cleaning due to gases not entering the receiver area. Our list is long and all the innovations in this new rifle certainly cannot be described on a concise white paper. The technology and engineering in this rifle are instantly noticeable. 

Features:
Designed and developed to be light and mobile and inspired by several of the finest autoloading rifles in the world, we have taken the best features and incorporated them into a larger than life autoloading rifle.

Chambered in four exciting large calibers, the 338 Lapua, 375 Cheytac, 408 Cheytac and 505 Gibbs. The 338 Lapua for NATO, 375 and 408 Cheytac for long range engagement and the legendary 505 Gibbs made famous by Earnest Hemingway for unbeatable knockdown Power.

With five shots in the quick detachable magazine you’re sure to have plenty of firepower for the largest or most dangerous game. 

Reliability of the VR1 is due to the gas port being optimally located to the chamber. The gases are cleaner and hotter up front and result in more reliable cycling and less fowling, the best autoloading rifles in the world use this system.

Our upper receiver is made from 17-4 PH Stainless Steel and certified Heat Treatment for high-pressure operation with such large calibers. The upper receiver-barrel locks securely into a lightweight hard-anodized lower receiver. The rifle uses a three-lugged rotary screw bolt for sure lockup, and a fixed ejector for high rate fire.

Using a 11/4 Bull Barrel for extreme accuracy and incorporating a proven Titanium Muzzle Brake for taming the Beast, makes the VR1 easy to shoot in any of our four calibers. The VR1 Rifles come standard with our exclusive M1A style Glass Filled Nylon Stocks for all weather conditions and come standard with Coyote M1A CHEEKPAD. Optionally High Comb Stocks machined from (RUTPLY) premium wood are available in several colors.

Our exclusive Pendulum Two Stage Trigger (PTST) at the heart of the gun supplies crisp reliable trigger pull. First stage is 2-½ lb and second stage releases at 3-½ lb respectively, the predictability of the trigger improves shooter accuracy and confidence. Incorporated within the trigger system is a heavy engagement (FAIL PROOF) traditional push safety.
