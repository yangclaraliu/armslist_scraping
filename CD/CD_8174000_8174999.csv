Guessing maybe a case of ammo has been run through it. These can be converted to calibers .22 LR, 9mm, 357 Sig, 40 S&W, 45 ACP, and 10mm. The receiver will work with all calibers, you can buy the parts to convert to any other caliber on line from http://www.tnwfirearms.com/. They can also be easily set up to eject from the left side for south paws. Uses Glock mags, this one will work with any of them from the G19 to the G18 mags. The receiver is drilled and tapped for 3 sections of 1913 rail, that TNW makes for these. I will include 1 with this. The forearm has a drilled and tapped spot on the bottom to add one as well as built in rail on top. Rifle comes from them Parkerized and the stuff will mark up easy. This one has some on it from handling and range trips. The forearm on this runs $100 from TNW. If someone does not want the forearm I will knock $50 off the price and keep it for the others I have and just include one of the barrel nuts these come with as seen in the pics. Will come with rifle, original box, Either the forearm with barrel nut that is part of it and fitted to this rifle, or if buyer wishes just a standard barrel nut, the Backup Iron sights on it, and one G-17 factory mag, 4 position AR stock and the A2 grip on there, one 1913 rail piece made for these. These will take any standard AR Stock and any A2 Grip. Rifle has been stone reliable with Glock Factory mags with every kind of ammo I have used in it. Buyer will pay transfer fees. I prefer to use Mary’s Pistols on Tyler in Tacoma but others could be worked out if buyer has another favorite. Mary’s has always charged me $25 to transfer guns I bought on line so assume it would be the same for this. If more pics or questions e-mail at alexx1401@yahoo"

The same type of anti-seize, high temperature, water resistant, no run, copper grease found in a brand new Glock off the assembly line. When you buy a new Glock you are NOT suppose to clean off the copper grease, you are suppose to let it ware off over time by itself. This special grease serves two very important purposes.<br>The first reason is it works as a smoothing agent as you break it in your gun. Copper is a much softer metal than steel and the grease is a lot thicker than basic gun grease, these two factors give more protection than standard gun grease for parts with metal on metal contact that take lots of abuse. <br>The second reason Glock applies this is because when they make a new gun there is no way to know how long it may sit on the shelf before it is sold. This grease is ideal for long term storage because will not run like typical gun grease or gun oil. This grease can also be used in other firearms in place of regular gun grease or to pack in your some of your spring to keep moisture from rusting them up. This can also be used in other firearms as well. Just a dab of this at a time because a little of this copper grease goes a long way.

When you buy a new Glock you are NOT suppose to clean off the copper grease, you are suppose to let it ware off over time by itself. This special grease serves two very important purposes.<br>The first reason is it works as a smoothing agent as you break it in your gun. Copper is a much softer metal than steel and the grease is a lot thicker than basic gun grease, these two factors give more protection than standard gun grease for parts with metal on metal contact that take lots of abuse. <br>The second reason Glock applies this is because when they make a new gun there is no way to know how long it may sit on the shelf before it is sold. This grease is ideal for long term storage because will not run like typical gun grease or gun oil. This grease can also be used in other firearms in place of regular gun grease or to pack in your some of your spring to keep moisture from rusting them up. This can also be used in other firearms as well. Just a dab of this at a time because a little of this copper grease goes a long way. Place a small drop on the rails and some other metal on metal contact areas or anywhere else you would use traditional gun grease.<br><br><br>Keywords: 9mm, 9 mm, 9MM, 9 MM, luger, 9x19, 9 x 19, 10mm 10 MM, .40 Cal, 40 cal, 40 S&W, .40 S&W, .357 sig, 357 sig, 357sig, .357sig, .45 auto, 45 cal, .45 ACP, 10rd, 10 rd, 10 round, magazine, magazines, mag, clip, G17, G 17, Glock 17, factory, OEM, Austria, polymer, Gen3, Gen4, Gen 3, Gen 4, Gen-3, Gen-4, Body armor, bullet proof vest, steel plate, Ceramic plates, Kevlar, Tactical Vest, MOLLE, Plate Carrier, flak jacket, ammunition, brass case, steel case, rounds, round, rd, rds, 223, 556, 55gr .223 cal, caliber, 5.56 mm, AR15, AR-15, AR, 15, M4, M-4, M16, M-16, , 9mm, 9 mm, 12 gauge, Saiga, SKS, AK47, AK-47, AK 47, 9x19, 9 x 19, .357, Sig, 40 , .40, S&W, 45 Cal .45 Auto, Mini 14, AK, AK-47, AK-47, AK 47, Tactical, sporter, Tapco, SKS, Carbine, Bulk, Ammo Can, Oath Keepers, Militia, Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, CSPOA, stockpile, Prepper, preppers, WROL, SHTF, JIC, teotwawki, Survivalist, hoard, hoarding, bunker, in the woods, Center Fire, Rifle Cartages, Full metal Jacket, FMJ, case, 20rds, 20rd, Box, Nato, Bushmaster, Colt, DPMS, Stag Arms, Windham, Rock River, 20, 30rds, 30rd, American Eagle Tactical, PMC, Lake City, Tula, Federal, Independence, Monarch, Winchester, Remington UMC, Daniel Defense"

The rifle features a 24 inch heavy fluted barrel with a muzzle break, a one piece picitinny rail, digital camo AccuStock, AccuTrigger, and an all steel construction 10 round detachable box magazine by Accurate Mag Company.  In addition to that, I have a 6-18 Vortex Crossfire II scope with a level attached, a cheek riser, and an imitation Harris bipod.  I zeroed the rifle at a hundred yards last August, cleaned it, oiled it, and put it away.  The only adjustment I never made to it is on the magazine feed lip.  I never bothered to buy the adjustment tool because I feed the ammo by hand one round at a time when I shoot long range.  The mag feed lip probably needs to be opened up about 3 thousandths or so to get the cartridges to feed more smoothly.  The adjustment tool costs about 25 bucks.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale.  1000 dollars gets everything I listed in the ad.  900 gets you everything but the optic.  Not looking for trades at this time.  And thanks for your interest."
