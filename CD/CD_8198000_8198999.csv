Well my question is where can I get this fixed in town or close to town so I don't have to send it out to Taurus because who knows how long that will take to get back.

The strength of the action was never compromised- to many, fit and finish are superior to German models and compete well with the US models. Howa manufactured Mark Vs unti production was brought to the United States in 1994. Alll the parts this manufactured would be delivered to weatherby's Southgate facility where the final polishing bluing and assembly would take place the barrel and stocks were made in house by weatherby at the company Southgate facility. The Mark V action is a front lockingl push feed, bolt action repeater. The lug Arrangement allows for 54 degree bolt lift. This shorter bolt  lift allows for increased clearance between the bolt handle and any accessories such as Scopes that may be mounted on the rifle and arguably provides for faster cycling of action."

The Beretta is a great range gun - accurate, reliable, very controllable recoil, and fun to shoot. I wanted a Beretta 92 after shooting most of the big 9mm rented at Point Blank in Greenwood.Loved the Beretta wide grip: my favorite of the 9mms.I wanted to buy one for a range toy.I was put onto SOG International (Southern Ohio Gun) by a member here, and their used service Beretta 92S that usually sell for $279 were on sale for $239 with upgrades I paid to go from good to excellent and handpicked ($30 and $10) and shipping ($20) and FFL fees ($25) for a total of $332.I had it inspected locally.I took it to the range and put 200 rounds through it and it was great.Problem is I bought a Glock after I bought this and decided to keep the Glock for my range toy (and sometimes CC).Full disclosure:I put a pic in of the grip where there is ""speckling"" on the front and back of the grip.I was told here that I can cover that with talon grip tape and I'd never see it: a simple fix.Such are the hazards of buying a service gun: not as ""pretty,"" but for me better than paying double the price for a ""prettier"" one.Need to see LTCH."

The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bull pup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.

For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made. As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot.Manufacturer: Barrett FirearmsModel: 82A1Caliber: .50 BMGBarrel Length: 29 inch"

However I was given the offer to shoot one of their carbines (in a .45 ACP) and I was shocked and immediately started looking for one, this one. Its fun to shoot, very accurate and kinda hard to find as I never see one in the gun shops. I am just concentrating now on finding a deer rifle.Bill of sale is required, if this bothers you then don't bother. All lowball offers will be ignored."
