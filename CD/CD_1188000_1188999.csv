It's a Winchester, 1944 M1 Garand. It's in beautiful condition. The rifle has always been well taken care of. The stock has been oiled regularly, and the metal conditioned with oil. There isn't a speck of rust anywhere on it. There are very few dings on the wood from diving from enemy fire in Korea, but other than that, it's a beaut! All of the numbers on all of the parts of the rifle match. It's not a franken-garand.

She hasn’t been fired in quite a while (20 + years) but has always been cleaned, and cared for. Ram a cleaning cloth through the barrel, and it comes out white every time.

It is a rather rare model, which Taurus discontinued a number of years ago. Hard to find in stores or online.

It is the same height and length as the 85 or any S&W J-Frame, and the gain in width is barely noticeable. Equipped with a locking hammer and transfer bar. 

Selling because I decided I wanted a Smith and Wesson instead. Comes with hammer-lock keys, original packaging, manual, and warranty card. Taurus backs all guns with a lifetime-of-the-gun warranty, so nothing to be afraid of.

I purchased this about a 2 weeks ago and decided to buy the .223 version instead. I am asking $700. The rifle doesn't have a single round through it. I also have plenty of .22LR ammo if interested. Comes with one stock 25rd mag and two new in box 35rd mags. Call or text me at REDACTED. The link below is from Smith & Wesson and specifies all the specs of the rifle.

From Brownells:
A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. New, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in standard military Gray."

It has a collapsible buttstock. We will include 2 slings, nylon carrying case, cleaning kit, 3 magazines (32-round capacity each), round mount for flashlight, and instruction booklets. This carbine and the mags were made during the assault weapons ban and are thus engraved with “for law enforcement use only” but they are legal since that ban expired in 2004. I confirmed this with an ATF agent over the phone, and you should too if you have questions about the legality. 

I would prefer to meet in Clarksville. If you wish to buy, we will conduct the exchange at a gun shop. They will charge you a $25 transfer fee and $10 background check fee, and we’ll both have copies of the paperwork. The $35 will be deducted from the purchase price after the background check comes back clean and we finalize the purchase.

This is one of the rare ones without the finger grooves.  Otherwise identical to a 3rd gen.  The grooves don't fit all hands, so this might work better for you.  I put about 100 rounds through it and decided I want to go with a g26 instead for daily carry.

This hasn't been shot much based on the history I got when purchased.  Still has the factory 'wear in' copper grease on the slide.

This comes with 1 factory 17rd mag and one KCI 17rd mag.  Additional KCI mags are $30 and I have some 115gr fmj reman ammo I might consider letting go for $25/50rd box since apparently 9mm ammo doesn't exist anymore and you might need some to put through this pistol.

Just to clarify:

This is for pickup in Anthem.  I'll no longer meet anybody in Phx after 4 no-shows, sorry.

I require seeing your Photo ID showing you are an AZ resident over the age of 18.
I will verbally ask you if you are prohibited by law from owning a weapon.
I do not require a bill of sale, as none is needed in this state provided the above two measures are taken.
I am NOT required to sell you a pistol just because you reply to the ad.  Seriously, if you are visibly on drugs or I even begin to suspect you might be illegal to transfer to you're not buying a weapon from me.

I Purchased this gun about 8 months ago, it is from Century Arms International and is the Special 50th Anniversary edition with very nice walnut furniture and an emblem in the butt stock. The gun also came with a new Romanian 30-round magazine and a new tapco magazine, I purchased another of each so the gun comes with a total of 4 30-round mags! the gun came with a tapco trigger installed and this is a suprisingly nice trigger. I installed a top of the line Midwest Industries scope mount and a BSA tactical scope with 6-bolt weaver mounts, and a Hogue rubber overmolded grip (very nice!). The gun also comes with a tactical case, cleaning rod and rubber butt-pad. I will also include 100 rounds of ammo. I bought 500 rounds of ammo with the gun and have run 400  through it (not rapid/ high volume fire) and the gun runs amazing! I did not have a single problem with it and it is accurate at 100 yards+ (that's about the limit of my skills). All four clips work flawlessly as well, no feeding problems. 
Attention: serious inquires only, please do not send me an e-mail asking if I still have the gun, I will pull the listing when it sells and will not respond to these e-mails, You must be at least 21 years old and willing to provide a CO driver's license for a bill of sale, thank you."
