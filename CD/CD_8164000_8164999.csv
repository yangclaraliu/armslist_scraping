It's a late 1918 production and has the second heat treatment (my serial number is 2936xx) it's in great shape! This particular rifle was re-issued in World War 2 as evident by both the ""scant"" stock and the 3-42 barrel. My research points to this being a rifle used by the Marine corp in WWII. I'm clearing my gun safe and hoping to get this rifle into the hands of a collector that will enjoy it as much as I have. It's yours for $900.00, if you have any questions feel free to text or call me at (97zero) four33-90six8.Not interested in trades for this rifle."

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Very similar to the P-01, the PCR uses the same alloy frame minus the light rail, making it even more concealable. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger pull is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.LOG:51634"

Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express relies on the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.  Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot.  Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around.  Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility. In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for more than 60 years.   Black Synthetic stock and fore-end ◊ 28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel ◊ Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver ◊ Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells ◊ Receiver milled from a solid billed of steel for maximum strength and reliability ◊ Silk-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting for maximum strength and reliability"

It is often designated the CZ 27 after the naming scheme used by the Česká zbrojovka factory for post-World War II commercial products. However, it is correctly known as vz. 27, an abbreviation of the Czech ""vzor 27"", or ""Model 27"". After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in mid-March 1939 the pistol was folded into the German armed and police forces as the P27. Construction of the pistol continued in Czechoslovakia until the 1950s. Allegedly, the Czechoslovak military authorities sold five and a half thousand surplus vz. 27s to the Swiss in 1973 for half a million marks. Between 620,000 and 650,000 were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation. In December 1948, a gift of five ""ČZ 247"" automatic variants of the pistol (based on both the vz. 24 and vz. 27) was sent to Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie. In 1949, the pistol was exported to 28 countries, including Turkey (3,286 pistols), Great Britain, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, and Pakistan. Known military contracts include India, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Poland.This is a beautiful peace of history.

It's basically a cross between a roller locked MP5 and the newer UMP 9 (ie MP5 style roller delayed action and a polymer receiver designed to replicate the UMP). It's set up with a UMP style folding stock (made by SW, which are bit hard to come by). It has a full auto MP5 bolt carrier and comes with 1 German MP5SD straight mag. I can sell some additional Korean MP5 curved mags with it (new in box), if the buyer is interested. The barrel was cut and re-threaded 1x2x28 by ZR Tactical, who then added the faux suppressor and pinned and welded it. They also removed the ""tumor"" (the built in flashlight bump) and replaced it with a rail for a foregrip.This is as close to a UMP 9 without dropping $4k on an HK USC to UMP conversion or $2400 for one of the new Omega Gideon pistols. The gun is ready to go as is and would be a perfect candidate for an SBR (file your Form 1 and then when you get your tax stamp, you can cut the weld on the faux suppressor and have a ready to go SBR with a threaded barrel).Asking $1300"
