Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers.

(Second from top in the first picture.....the one under it is a 1897 model also for sale) From what I've read and been told by those who collect them, the finish on the receiver for some reason fades faster than the barrel. This can be seen in the pictures below.  The bore is perfectly clean, with no rust or damage.  There doesn't appear to have been any modification at any time.  To the best of my knowledge, this gun is chambered in the factory 2 3/4"".  I have not fired this particular gun, though based on condition I wouldn't hesitate to after a qualified smith inspected it.  This is a great example of a Classic Winchester designed shotgun.  It holds up to 6 of the 2 3/4"" shells in the tube with no plug installed.  All the parts are forged or machined, and the reason that Winchester quit making it was that it became cost prohibitive and couldn't compete with other manufacturers offerings of the time. (And as we've all heard so many times, they just don't make'em like they used to) I have many pictures available, these ads only allow up to 3 per listing.  I can also take pictures of any areas desired.  $450 cash only, no trades.  (I have not cleaned or changed the condition in any way since receiving it so perspective buyers can see it as it has been for the past decade)

Also, I have had several inquiries about shipping this shotgun and out of state buyers wanting to pick it up face to face.  Current BATFE rules and regulations state I CANNOT sell a firearm to anyone not a resident of my home state (GA) without going through a licensed FFL dealer and filling out a form 4473.  I can ship it to your local FFL dealer of choice after receiving a copy of the FFL dealers license, and the buyer will have to pay the $25 outgoing FFL transfer fee from my local dealer.  It is C&R eligible.

Anyone who would like to see this shotgun in person is welcome to email and set up a time to do so.  All meetings to view will take place locally at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming, right off GA400 exit 13.  I will need to see at a minimum a GA drivers license.  This shotgun is listed by the BATFE as C&R eligible, so those holding a C&R license may have it shipped directly to them.  Anyone else wanting shipping not holding a C&R license will have to use an FFL licensed dealer.  As long as the ad is still up, the shotgun is still available."

It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.


This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.

This is the platform that was invented by John Moses Browning.  It was very popular with American GI's in WWI, and it's use was protested by Germany because they felt it caused unnecessary suffering to those on the receiving end. (I found that quite amusing that anyone, or any country for that matter, would protest the use of a weapon because it would cause excessive suffering.....it's a war not a chess match right?  LOL)  You can see the finish in the pictures.  It's developed a pretty nice patina over the years.  There is one small rust spot about the size of a skittle candy on the barrel.  Inside the bore shows it's age and has some wear from years of use, but there are no visible nasty areas that I can see. (I don't have a bore scope so I have looked down the barrel using a flashing to illuminate it which is the best I can do with what I have on hand)  The forearm wood shows a good amount of usage wear, but is still intact with one 3 inch crack.  The stock itself is in decent shape, with one small hairline crack about 1 inch long.  The butt plate also has a crack. Mechanically it functions normally, the action is tight and crisp as it should be.  Inside the chamber shows normal usage wear patterns, nothing out of the ordinary for a 101 year old shotgun.  These guns are becoming more and more rare nowadays.  I have many pictures, these ads only allow for up to 3 pictures.  (In the first picture, this is the 3rd from top)More available upon request, and I can take pictures of any particular part wanted.  $400 cash only, no trades.  

Also, I have had several inquiries about shipping this shotgun and out of state buyers wanting to pick it up face to face.  Current BATFE rules and regulations state I CANNOT sell a firearm to anyone not a resident of my home state (GA) without going through a licensed FFL dealer and filling out a form 4473.  I can ship it to your local FFL dealer of choice after receiving a copy of the FFL dealers license, and the buyer will have to pay the $25 outgoing FFL transfer fee from my local dealer.  It is C&R eligible.

Anyone who would like to see this shotgun in person is welcome to email and setup a time to do so. All meetings to view will take place locally at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming, right off GA400 exit 13. I will need to see at a minimum a GA drivers license. This shotgun is listed by the BATFE as C&R eligible, so those holding a C&R license may have it shipped directly to them. Anyone else wanting shipping not holding a C&R license will have to use an FFL licensed dealer. As long as the ad is still up, the shotgun is still available."

This is an original Mark 4 built in 1994. The counterfeit warnings are for the newer Mark 4s. The markings on the originals are different than the newer ones. I have clearly posted a picture from the start with the serial number visible so that anyone can call Leupold to verify it themselves.

Additional Description: The GLOCK 27 is ideal for home defense, concealed carry, duty or as a hunting sidearm. The Glock 27 is a sub- compact, 9- shot capacity, .40S/W, polymer frame, double action only handgun. It uses a locked breech design in what is called a ""Safe Action"". The pistol does not have a hammer. Rather, the Glock 27 uses a spring-loaded striker that is partially retracted when a round is chambered. The Glock 27 can utilize the 9-round, 13-round, and 15-round Glock magazines for the .40.S&W Round. This weapon is used with some holster wear. It has night sights that still glow, though not as bright as new. The pistol does not come with a case, but does have three mags included.

Something along those lines.  I don't want your bone stock 10/22 for your $350-$500 asking price.....These can still be had new at Walmant for $169 if you catch the stock truck at the right time and I'm not paying a premium hysteria be dammed.

Perhaps a small Marlin youth .22 or the like, so my little girls to learn with.  I live very close to Bullseye Marksman Gun Club of GA400 exit 13 and can meet there anyday for 4:00pm Monday-Friday, and by appointment on Sat-Sun.

By the way, please don't waste your time typing or my time reading trying to convince me that the ""weapons ban"" makes anything worth anymore than it would be otherwise.  Your $250 gun is still a $250 gun, perhaps you can find some $500 idiot to buy it but that's not me.  I don't want your opinion on the market, or your opinion on my wants.

Okay folks here's the deal I have a steyr aug style bushmaster rifle for sale I have put less then 100 rounds through this rifle since I bought it. 

Caliber: 5.56

Willing to Ship: No

Willing to trade: yes *note* the item I am interested in would be a glock 19 4th gen plus cash. if you have newer pistols we can converse more on the topic and maybe reach agreement. 

Item Description: For all you knowledgeable collectors and enthusiasts, bear with me. I am not trying to educate you, I merely want to give a fair   amount of detail for the buyers that are not familiar with these rifles. This rifle was originally manufactured by Armalite and then the production machinery and rights were either sold or licensed to Bushmaster. Armalite products were the predecessors of the AR16, AR15 and M4. very few rounds were sent down range around (100) because of that the rifle is in superb condition.

The rifle uses standard AR 15/16 magazines. 

I love this rifle and its bullpup/steyr aug design, which makes it short and compact without compromising barrel length and accuracy. One caveat, it is not made for left handed shooters. That was not a problem for me but it is noted here for those that would have issues with that.

I am doing multiple listings on numerous sites so as to do a basic bidding process on the rifle the highest offer so far is $1200.00 by friday April 5th I will sell the the highest offer. Good Luck!

Sale arrangements will be worked out with purchaser but for safety reasons on both sides we will be meeting in a public place."

Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail.  Flat-rate shipping fee $15.00.

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.

 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

No parts missing. 30rd Troy Battlemag rebuild kits available to ship today! These are exactly the same as standard Battlemags only disassembled.  
I accept PayPal ""gift"" payments or Postal Money Orders.

Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail and are a flat rate of $15.00.

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.

The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

538,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1364538,For Sale:  Flare pistol package - Geco,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, March 30, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a Geco 26.5mm all steel flare pistol. The Geco is made in Germany and was imported into the US in fairly limited quantities in the early 2000's. Sportsman's Guide and several other retailers sold them inexpensively then. However today they are nearly impossible to find. In my opinion the Geco is the highest quality, strongest and most interesting of all of these type pistols brought to US during the last 20 years. Many feel that the HK is a better pistol however I've owned both and unlike the Geco - the only steel part on the HK is the barrel as the entire frame is plastic.

This Geco is in original UNFIRED condition. Also included in this package is:

26.5 mm to .410/.45 Long Colt adapter that allows 2.5"" & 3"" .410 shotgun ammo or .45LC ammo to be safely fired.

26.5mm to 12 gauge adapter that allows the less expensive 12 gauge flares to be fired. This adapter cannot be used with regular 12 gauge shotgun shells and must never be attempted as the results would be catastrophic.

Original German flap holster that is weather resistant and has room to store the pistol, cleaning brush, 26.5mm ammo, .410 or.45 ammo & one or both adapters. Holster also has a shoulder carry strap attached.

26.5mm cleaning brush and nylon lanyard strap for pistol

(3) 5 round boxes 2.5"" .410 rifled slug ammo. (1) 25 round box of 3"" - 00 buck with 5 pellets per shell, & (1) 25 round box 3"" #7.5 shot (devastating close range defense load).

(2) 26.5mm white parachute illumination shells, (2) 26.5 mm Red Rain shells & (2) 26.5mm orange smoke shells.

(1) sealed 4 round package of Orion 12 gauge super red flares - expire July 2016

The last Geco I saw on Gunbroker was before Christmas and it sold for over $200 without accessories similar to what the HK's do when they come up for sale. So if you investigate and price everything included in this set - you'll see that my asking price is a bargain.

Price: $350 obo. Also this is a pickup item as shipping live flare shells is a hassle and it's costly. Also because this flare pistol becomes a real firearm when the .410 adapter is inserted you must be at least 21 to purchase."

Great bluing and metal finish, nice wood as well. Doesn't have the messy thick shellac you see on a lot of these. Original scope number scrubbed during refurb process like most. Import mark is on barrel, not receiver like the new ones. Barrel and crown both great. Excellent shooter as well. All numbers in rifle match. scope does not match which isnt unusual during the refurb process. Scope has marking on it of and x inside of a box, which means during the refurb process the glass was redone as well, and boy does it show, the scope functions perfectly and the glass is very clear.

This is a nice mixture of looking great and actually SHOOTING even better. If you know what to look for one these, them you'll be able to tell the authenticity.

Oh, and I will include 20 rounds silver tip surplus ammo.

If cash, I will go as low as $620.... If trades, however, trade value is $700. If you want to buy one of these, they are available by one company, and they cost $800 plus shipping plus FFL. So the cash price here is VERY fair, as is trade value. 

I am interested in trading for ammo, mostly 223/556, but also need 22lr and 9mm. No, I will not pay you gouge prices for this ammo.... It can all still be had for regular retail prices, and that is the value I will attach to the ammo in trades. 0.40 a round 223, 0.25 a round 9mm, and 20-25 per brick of 22lr.

No parts missing. 30rd Troy Battlemag rebuild kits available to ship today! These are exactly the same as standard Battlemags only disassembled.  

I accept PayPal ""gift"" payments or Postal Money Orders.
Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail.  

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.

 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

Battlemag rebuild kits AR-15 .223/5.56,"Nationwide, Honolulu, Hawaii",$ 30,"Listed On: Saturday, March 30, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"All brand new.  No parts missing. 30rd Troy Battlemag rebuild kits available to ship today! These are exactly the same as standard Battlemags only disassembled.  

I accept PayPal ""gift"" payments or Postal Money Orders.
Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail.  

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.

The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

Just want to see if any irrefusable offers slide by the table. Interested in other glocks 23/26/30 FDEs, XDM compacts+extras(bi tone). XDS+EXTRAS(bi tone), open to hear offers. But like I said, I'm in no rush at all. Also I don't care what somebody out of state has theirs for, because once you add FFL transfer fees and shipping. It'll cost about $100 more.

Great bluing and metal finish, nice wood as well. Doesn't have the messy thick shellac you see on a lot of these. Original scope number scrubbed during refurb process like most. Import mark is on barrel, not receiver like the new ones. Barrel and crown both great. Excellent shooter as well. All numbers in rifle match. scope does not match which isnt unusual during the refurb process. Scope has marking on it of and x inside of a box, which means during the refurb process the glass was redone as well, and boy does it show, the scope functions perfectly and the glass is very clear.

This is a nice mixture of looking great and actually SHOOTING even better. If you know what to look for one these, them you'll be able to tell the authenticity.

I have a browning/ f.n. hi power 9mm. It is an unusual police issue with the police stamps on it. Has hogue grips, and comes with FOUR 13 round mags and ONE 10 round ma. The gun has minor scratches and minimal wear but it was a carry at one point or another, however barrel is in FANTASTIC shape with very little wear I personally put 50 rounds through it and it shot like a dream. i have upgraded the sear spring, recoil spring guide and recoil spring.
I would love too keep it but I need some cash for unexpected medical bills so i am pricing it low to sell. i have not seen any on here for this price. thanks

I would consider partial trades involving a hunting rifle or 20ga shotgun W/ cash also. 
I would also consider straight trades for something nice.

I also have 200 rounds of 9mm factory fmj and 2 green ammo cases i would add to the right deal or for 125$ more

I live in frederick off of i-25 and hwy 119, but i am willing to meet on i-25 between 136th and hwy 34 

thank you for your time and interest"

I was sold to me as unfired and it appears to be (no carbon showing in the chamber or around the muzzle crown) but can tell it has been mounted because of the locking lugs.

Complete barrel with gas assembly and black fore grip. These did not come with bipod like the AUG or flash hider.

My research shows that MSAR originally had 200 24in barrels made but the harmonics were not greatest and they were less accurate then a shorter barrel (the original AUG is the same and the barrel is more of a LMG barrel then sniper)  so they had most cut down to the 18in heavy barrels because that seems to be the sweet spot for accuracy. MSAR could not confirm how many they sold but did tell me that it was very few and its very rare. I've read a few places that they sold between 9 and 20 (for between $740-830 for the short time they offered them).

Pete Athens (PjsStyerAug) just last month advised someone that it is very rare and should sell for $1000.

He did mention that he had only shot 20 some rounds through it and then sold it to me. I personally at the time only had one gun a ruger p89 9mm and I always wanted a 1911 so this was my first 1911 that I bought in my collection, oh man I was happy and broke for a few weeks. This is a little more than 7 years ago, at that time I didn't know about 45acp i didn't own any at that time, so I never shot it at all I remember storing it under my bed for about 2 years and then the money started getting better for me so I started investing in more 1911s Kimber, Remington, Colt and so on. I kind of stop thinking about my first and was so excited about the new ones, so what I am trying to say is that I haven't shot it till this day, I just didn't want to mess it up, Now I did show it off and wore it on my side. Anyways all included in this auction is the 1911 A-1 pistol, Factory holster, factory double magazine holster, 2 factory 7 round magazines, two factory sets of grips, factory lock and key, factory cleaning brush/tools, factory hard case, and all factory paperwork and manual.
