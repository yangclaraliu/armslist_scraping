The VENOM quickly and easily mounts by simply twisting out the existing cylinder pin and twist in the new LaserLyte integrated laser and cylinder pin configuration. The VENOM integrated laser holds the tiny 4x377 batteries, the switch and laser all in one compact package (less than two inches). The VENOM adds very little bulk to the gun, yet provides the user with the gained confidence of aiming accuracy. No sighting in is required with the VENOM due to the fixed-point-of-aim provided at the LaserLyte factory.

The minuscule circuitry within the LaserLyte VENOM laser holds a programmable laser with: constant on, pulse mode and an auto-off after 6 minutes. The battery life is five hours* in constant on and ten hours* in the pulse mode.

*Normal usage is defined as one minute on and one minute off. This test mimics actual usage where the unit is turned on and off and the battery is given time to automatically regenerate.

This Core30 features a 16"" Stainless Steel barrel with a matte bead blasted finish. The 1:10"" twist rate effectively stabilizes the heavier and longer bullets preferred for long distance shooting and defense purposes, while also adequately stabilizing lighter, shorter bullets at closer distances.

A2 style profile barrel is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.

This rifle also has a very low round count mainly a build and safe queen (only around 300 to 400 rounds through the rifle).

I have replaced / modified every part you can on my SCAR 17 except the lower Receiver. This is like no other FNH SCAR-17 (Heavy) out there (at least not one I have seen). Here is a list of what I have done. But I may be forgetting a couple of things.

1 = Replaced stock grip with Tango Down BG17 pistol grip.
2 = Tango Down Vertical stubby grip with ADM quick detach. Can swap to a Magpul AFG2 if wanted instead.
3 = Removed stock front sight post and replaced with a custom flush-mounted picatinny rail.
4 = Replaced stock flip up sights with good TROY BUIS.
5 = Installed PWS SRX quad-rail extension (Protects gas block) adds more rail space and aids in a farther up front grip on the rifle.
6 = Replaced Stock charging handle with a Tango Down Angled charging handle.
7 = Replaced stock trigger system with a new custom Timney 3lbs single stage trigger system.
8 = replaced stock buttstock assembly with a VLTOR SCAR receiver extension and added a VLTOR basic iMod Buttstock. (Also included is a custom HDD Tactical scar Buttstock assembly with a MagPul ACS Buttstock on it) and of course the stock FN SCAR Buttstock assembly.
9 = Replaced stock ambi-saftey selectors with new after market Magpul levers.
10 = 6 factory FNH 20 round magazines are included......

Sorry bipod is not included....

I have all original parts which are included and spare small parts I ordered like extra barrel bolts, spring and housing.

Original FNH box, manual and paper work included. 

I am asking $4500 OBO or $4900 with the EoTech XPS2-0 ($400 for the EoTech which is practically new with box and papers..etc).

If you think this is over priced or that I am price gouging please do your home work. I have way more money invested in this rifle then what I have it listed for.

I do not need to sell this excellent firearm but I have a baby coming in a couple of months and this would help.

Shot 30-40 times for barrel break-in (cleaning after each of first 12 shots, then after each group of three for 18 more shots) and accuracy testing.  Aside from my Sig P220 Sport .45 ACP, this is the most accurate handgun I've ever shot.  Cared for like a baby, never exposed to bad elements, cleaned meticulously after its few uses.

One major appeal of this pistol is its rapid return to target due to surprisingly manageable recoil.  The gas cycling system aborbs a great deal of the energy, giving this much less muzzle jump than a .44 Mag revolver (I have a Super Blackhawk, and it's a jumper!).  Also, the octagonal rifling lives up to its reputation for accuracy.  This gun will shoot where you point it to a very precise degree.

...included with the Taurus is one clip---I have no idea what I did with the other one...pocket holster and 72 rounds of FMJ  ammo...which is the remaining amount of the original 5oo that I had.  This gun has had 428 rounds fired through it so far.  It seems to like hardball ammo and feeds it pretty flawlessly  .  HPs will ""hang up"" every now and then but, really, with a 380 the FMJs are a better choice because of the lower velocity and punching power of 380 ammo.  ANYWAY...i guarantee the quality.  If you are not happy with it I will buy it back within the first 7 days. Asking price is 150.00...and THAT is a good deal!!

Included is a never fired factory S&W 9mm barrel that can be dropped into the 40 Shield to convert it to a 9mm Shield instantly. These barrels are very sought after and now practically impossible to find since you can no longer order one from S&W. They've restricted the sale of these once people caught on to the simple conversion that pretty much gives you two guns in one. Now the only way to obtain one is to send your 9 Shield in to Smith with a faulty barrel for them to replace. The following video proves that the barrels are identical in every aspect except bore diameter. The 40 mags will be able to load 9mm cartridges with room for one more round than the 40 S&W cartridges. Being able to shoot both calibers gives you more options and can save you money at the range since 9mm ammo runs cheaper.  

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flnFIzI6MIw&feature=share&list=TL0M6XeB3NonM

Comes with three 6 round flush mags (7 rounds when loaded with 9mm)

Two holsters included, DeSantis Insider Black Leather IWB and Uncle Mike's Reflex Holster OWB - both top quality 

Also throwing in a Pachmayr Tactical Grip Sleeve makes a huge difference in terms of positive grip, less felt recoil and better accuracy.

Shield has three dot sights painted with Glow-On gun sight paint that is more durable, glows bright in the dark, and stands out better than original low quality white paint that the three dots come with out of box. Most Shields end up with the factory white dots falling out of the dot holes after so many rounds.

Stamping on the frame and both barrels has been painted silver.

Also included is a 20 round box of Speer Gold Dot 40 S&W - best defense ammo imo

And a like new Smith & Wesson Extreme Ops Folding Knife:

Travis Strahan began accurizing firearms for the United States Army in 1956. He is one of the finest armorers to have worked at the US Army AMU. Travis has provided competition pistols to champions Hershel Anderson, Bonnie Harmon, B.J. Hile, R. D. Whitacre, and M. D. Black. All of these shooters are distinguished champions and hold records still unbeaten today. Anyone having the privilege of owning and shooting one of Travis’s accurized firearms knows that they have experienced the best.
