This model is identical to the M600 Ultra Scout Light but does not include a remote tape switch. Its output is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens into an intense, far-reaching beam that also provides significant peripheral illumination, making it ideal for close- to longer-range applications. The compact M600 Ultra minimizes added weight, frees up rail space for other accessories, and increases weapon maneuverability compared to larger WeaponLights. It attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail. This model (M600U-Z68-TN) comes with an installed click-type pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on. The switch is shrouded to minimize the chance for accidental activation. A remote tape switch can be ordered as an option, or order the previously mentioned M600 Ultra Scout Light, which includes this switch."

I only put 14 rounds through it, and noticed a problem.  When the gun is loaded and you are cocking it, it will sometimes lock up half way, and you will have to rotate the cylander by hand to fully cock it.  I looked online and saw this may be an indexing problem from someone swapping the cylanders refurbashing it, or it may simply not be ""broken in"" yet.  I do not know enough about the design or revolvers to tell you, but there is the full disclaimer.  I think the gun is a fun novelty item, but not something to ever depend on for defense. I paid $250 for it not knowing what was wrong, I am asking $200 or equivalent in trade.  Revolver comes with holster (leather strap for latch is torn), and box of 36 rounds by PPU.Will only sell to 21+, with VA ID, bill of sale, and CHP, or Voter Registration, or Active Military ID."

It is recoil operated much like the venerable Browning A-5. The production years for this model were 1968-1973. The gun looks good and is in nice condition for it's age. The internals are in great shape and honestly don't appear to show much use, and have been freshly cleaned and lubricated. This model uses a friction ring under the forearm to retard the speed of the action. For light loads, the friction cone can be turned flat side to the friction ring. For heavy loads, the friction cone can be flipped to further compress the friction ring during cycling. It is a simple yet brilliant design (Thanks John Browning!!!). The chamber is 2-3/4"". The barrel length is 26"" with a fixed Improved Cylinder choke. This would be a great bird gun and would be equally at home shooting trap or skeet.

I will ONLY sell these suppressors to someone who goes through the PROPPER ATF papperwork which includes passport photos, fingerprints and an approved $200 tax stamp from the ATF (it takes 4 to 6 months but I have had it go through in as little as 3 months at times).       I have two seperate suppressors for sale. A YHM .30 cal phantom with a .30 mount and a 5.56 mount (works on both your AR-15 or 30 cal guns, and an AAC M4-1000 with the old 18 tooth style mounting system and one mount. these both work fine. both have a small nick in the last baffle but still work great. I will not require the money for the suppressor untill you have been fullly approved by the ATF just in case you dont get approved or somthing. Once you have your tax stamp in your hand we will exchange cash for the suppressor to make it easy. $400 for the YHM, $300 for the AAC. That is a great deal for you! In total with ATF tax stamp it will cost you $600 for the YHM (compared to $1000) after you buy your tax stamp, or $500 for the AAC (compared to $800). We can also go through a Class 3 dealer if you want to.  Call or text Dan at 406-498-nine six zero four."
