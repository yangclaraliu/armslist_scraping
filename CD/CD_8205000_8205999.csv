I shot 60 rounds through her (including break-in) and then put the gun in the safe. It sat until now when I took the action off to swap to another caliber. The barrel is flawless with no mars, scratches, etc. It looks just as new as when it was new. The barrel in a good action is capable of sub half-MOA 5 shot groups at 100 yards using factory 175 SMK FGMM ammo (see pic). I also shot it to 600 yards where it shot a 4.5” 5 shot group using the same factory 175 SMK FGMM ammo. The barrel ($300 + $75 threading), lug ($27), nut ($28) and brake ($40) all totaled up to $470 new. I will sell it all for $330 I am not interested in trades.I live and work in the Research Park/Gate 9 area and prefer to meet at the Cabela’s in Huntsville. Thank you for looking and hopefully someone can use this great deal for a barrel that’s hardly broken in to upgrade their 700 into a real tack driver. -Mike"

Rifle is in overall great shape, few typical dings and scratches you find on old surplus rifles. Rifle's serial numbers match, except for magazine plate which is forced matched, scope mount and scope are missmatched. Rifle has the correct Tula factory markings for sniper use, but likely lost it's original scope during the refurbishment process. It shoots very accurately but the mount needs adjusting, currently if I place the scope at around 300 yards it will shoot dead on at 100 yards, easy fix but I need money for an upcoming project so decided to sell it instead. The scope itself is potentially one of the oldest in the USA, it was produced at the No. 3 Kharkov plant in 1940, No. 3 Kharkov was the plant that originally started the PU scope production, they only made roughly 5500 scopes in 1940, this one is No. 4460, meaning it was also originally intended for an SVT 40 but placed on a 91/30 at some point down the line. Scope optics are clear and scope itself is in great shape. Will include scope cover, scope caps, attached sling and Mosin cleaning kit.Willing to drive a reasonable distance from Boise. Not currently looking for trades but will consider offers. If you don't like my price, make me an offer, all reasonable offers will be considered.

The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bull pup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.

The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier. Among its advantages, its bull pup configuration- the rear center of gravity enables a rapid acquisition of the target and provides the ability to fire the weapon with one hand. The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.
