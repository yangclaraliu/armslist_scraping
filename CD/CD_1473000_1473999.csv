This rifle's stock and barrel has a Polymax woodland camouflage finish and all its metal parts are treated with Robar NP3. Comes with a 20"" fluted barrel, modified trigger guard with the detachable Robar M-14 magazine conversion option (a $650 option no longer available by Robar and highly sought after). Included are twelve unused M-14 magazines treated with NP3 valued at $105 for each magazine - (1) 5 Rd,, (1) 10 Rd. and (10) 20 Rd. magazines. Lastly, to compliment the rifle, a new Leupold Vari-X III 3.5-10x Tactical scope. The scope, rings and mounts are finished with the same Polymax woodland camo finish. The following was taken from the www.Robar.com Website: The Robar QR2 Quick Response Multi-Purpose Rifle System opens up a whole new era in the science of precision tactical rifles. It is the one rifle that can emphatically serve multiple functions with ease, be it close quarters or long range. Lightweight and compact, the QR2 packs a punch and delivers uncompromising Robar reliability and accuracy. The QR2 features a Monte-Carlo style ambidextrous stock with a built-in ergonomic palm swell, rear sling swivel stud and a short accessory rail in the beavertail style forend. The fully accurized action is mated with a fluted stainless steel 20 inch match-grade barrel and aluminum pillar bedded to the stock with a free floating barrel channel. The QR2 will deliver precise shot placement consistently and is guaranteed to shoot 1/2 MOA* or better. Robar's NP3 finish is an electroless nickel-based finish for steel, stainless steel and aluminum alloys that co-deposits sub-micron particles of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), otherwise known as Teflon, with electroless nickel. NP3 metal finish offers many benefits. It permits firing for longer periods of time between cleaning, dirt and powder residue have no wet or oily surface to cling to. NP3 is very corrosion resistant and provides a high lubricity and low friction co-efficient, greatly increasing the life expectancy of a firearm due to reduced friction wear. The technicians at The Robar Companies, Inc. have developed a procedure to apply a polymer coating to firearms. POLYMAX offers a number of advantages: Chemical Resistant, Water Resistant, Excellent Adhesion, Mar & Abrasion Resistant, Excellent Hardness & Great Impact Resistance."

They posed as a couple and after the purchase was finalized and Josh signed the bill of sale, they jumped out of their cars and interviewed me. I don't know what to do and feel that something is not right here. During the interview they asked multiple times regarding the legality of the sale and asked multiple times if I 'really' needed to see his ID, which I wouldn't sell unless I saw, which he provided. I am outraged about this and hope others do not fall into their trap. He was driving a black Cadillac Crossover SRX and always signed his texts with a 'J'.

NO CLASS 3 Needed! (legal to own pre-ban)

The Interdynamic KG9 pistol was made in Miami Florida for a short time in the 1981-82 timeframe by Interdynamic of America, Inc. ATF decided in January 1982 that the gun was too easy to convert into a machine gun, and therefore decided that an unmodified open bolt semi-auto KG-9 was a machine gun. ATF exempted unmodified semi-auto KG-9 pistols made before this ruling from the scope of the ruling, so there are so-called grandfathered KG-9 pistols available in the USA. The KG-9 was based on a Swedish designed machine pistol, the MP-9. After the ATF ruling the gun was redesigned into a closed bolt, striker fired pistol, the Interdynamic KG-99, which was sold in the 1982-83 timeframe. After that Interdynamic went out of buisness.

The original gun the cheap tec-9 was made to copy. Rare! Less than 1000 made! Look it up.

Open to most firearm related trades. I'll trade up or down and also add or accept cash either way to even up a good deal if needed. I'm not interested in any hi points/jimenez/bryco/etc weapons at this time. CCW holders will be given preferential treatment, must show ohio ID and be able to legally own a firearm. Thanks!"

This rifle was made from a Maadi receiver and a Chinese MAK90 parts kit.  Rifles built with 1mm receivers and parts kits meant for 1.5mm receivers are no good.  Look at the furniture!  It is MAK90 furniture, and the handguards are Chinese blond wood and are smooth (nothing to grip).  Real Maadi AKM rifles have the ""palm swell"" handguards (which provides something better to grip the rifle).  Don't believe me, then google Chinese and Egyptian AKM handguards.

BUYER BEWARE.  SELLER SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR LYING.  His ad persistently advertises the rifle as a ""Maadi"" when the seller probably knows the truth about his AKM: frankenstein build from the monkies at CAI.

He goes into the store and buys three boxes, brings a friend (making it worse), and that person buys three boxes as a proxy.  Then he goes online and tries to barter the ammo he just got, some of which he got via a proxy buyer.

This is the problem folks.  Only buy what YOU need.

Made in 1967, this is a very desirable 2 ½” barreled .38 Special Diamondback. The pistol is finished in Colt’s deep polished commercial blue and it has factory checkered wooden round butt factory grips with silver-colored Colt medallions. The pistol has a few very minor service marks and tiny spots of freckling, the grips only show very minor wear, and overall condition rates between 90-95%. The pistol’s bore is very shiny with strong rifling, and double action trigger pull is smooth. After a bit of downtime, Colt Snake Guns are once again very “HOT” items, with prices once again starting to skyrocket. Any Colt Diamondback in good condition is a desirable handgun, and it goes without saying that a 2 ½” gun made in 1967, will be a nice enhancement to any collection"

Para‘s 1911 LTC 9mm pistol incorporates many desirable features of the original Colt Commander, plus a few ideas of its own. An alloy frame keeps weight down to a very manageable 28 oz. A ramp match-grade barrel measures out at 4.25"" - long enough for the 9mm cartridge to reach its full potential.

Metal surfaces on the LTC are coated with Para’s non-reflective Covert Black finish. This finish not only casts a very business-like appearance, but also stands up well against the elements. For positive manipulation, the slide features six deep diagonal grooves. Other key features include a flat, checkered mainspring housing and a beavertail trip safety. A single-side, frame-mounted safety is standard. Instead of the usual plug guide, Para went with a full-length recoil spring guide rod on the LTC 9mm.

Details for this Particular Example
Just back from Para USA where it received a factory upgrade to the extractor. With very few rounds fired and now cleaned, lubed, adjusted, and upgraded by the manufacturer, this is probably as close to new as a used pistol can be. Comes with Two Para Mags, Case, Manual, and Bushing Wrench.

Over $2,000 Invested including the following Custom Features
* Reliability and trigger job by Tony Barnes of Brownells
* Crimson Trace Laser Grips
* Fiber Optic Sights (front and rear, with dovetails cut and sighting-in also by Tony)

Ships to FFL only. Your FFL must accept shipment from seller with valid driver's license as ID. Be sure to verify with your FFL.

Special Bonus - three additional mags. That's five mags total (two from Para and three from Wilson Combat)."

The GLOCK 32 Gen4, in .357, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that offers a unique combination of versatility, convincing ballistics, optimum carry comfort, and the GLOCK pistol reliability. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G32 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case.

It is manufactured by Smith & Wesson. It uses the N-frame, similar to the Smith & Wesson Model 29 in .44 Magnum, and the Model 28 in .357 Magnum. Since the 10mm Auto is a rimless automatic pistol cartridge, moon clips are used to hold cartridges when loading and extracting spent cases en bloc. Since the .40 Smith & Wesson is a shorter, less powerful variant of the 10mm Auto but has the same diameter, the Model 610 can also chamber and fire .40 Smith & Wesson rounds.
