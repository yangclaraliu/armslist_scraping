It is in pristine condition except for a windage instruction that was applied to the back of the sight.  Hey, it can only help when you have to crank it quick during a match!  There is also an original box and a high quality paper insert.  I am unclear about the model numbers.  The box says Model 101 and ""MO #2"" is written on the box in multiple places and taped in one spot on the sight.  I will need you to research that yourself, if it is an issue.  I am not sure it really matters.  This sight is simply awesome!  I will ship it only within the 48 contiguous United States.  No returns are accepted, but contact me and we can discuss it.  I would consider a return if the item has been misrepresented for some reason.  I try to do a good job representing the item correctly.  

Thanks.

PSA (Palmetto State Armory) manufactured mid-length gas upper with MBUS rear sight.  Here are the details:
16"" Barrel length
Chrome moly vanadium barrel
5.56 Nato Chamber
1 in 7"" twist rate

Mid-length Gas system

M4 Feed ramps
F-Marked Front sight post

Black MBUS

Also includes a PSA M16 BCG (Bolt Carrier Group):
Milspec Carpenter No. 158® steel bolt
Chrome Lined Carrier (AUTO)
Chrome Lined Gas Key
Gas Key Hardened to USGI Specifications
Gas Key Grade 8 Hardened Fasteners
Gas Key Staked Per Mil-Spec
Tool Steel Extractor
Extractor Spring
Black Extractor Insert
(purchased from http://www.slickguns.com/product/m-16-bolt-carrier-group-17999)

Also includes a standard charging handle.  

So this is a complete new upper that works with 5.56 or .223 ammo, new in box, never fired, never assembled onto a lower.  Paid over $575 for this within the last month, was going to build a featureless NYS-compliant sporting rifle, but decided not to.  I will sell for $100 under cost at $475 or $525 in trade (let me know what you have).  I'm on the east side of Rochester and will meet face to face only at a mutually-convenient time.

This is not subject to the SAFE act because it is not a firearm, it is an upper assembly only, and can be legally sold within NYS as a result.  I believe it can even be assembled onto a lower legally in NYS as well as long as your build is featureless (no pistol grip, replace the flash hider with a permanent thread protector, pinned stock, no foregrip, etc), but I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice so check with one or the NYSP hotline just to be sure."

A part that is not really needed, you can use a pen or plastic stir stick or anything except a steel rod because it will scratch the inside of the barrel, brass would work to push out the fired casings out of the gun. I'll make one for you out of brass stock before it is sold.

This part could be easily fabricated by someone with metal skills, a simple part to make, it should be 3/8"" wide, 1/16"" thick and 3 & 5/8"" long, used to push the fired casings out of the barrels, it fits into a small slot in the handle between the original Walnut grips and the frame.
This derringer will come with 50 round of .22 short 29 grain ammo.

This is a solid gun, approximately 4 & 7/8"" long, 3 & 1/4"" wide, 3/4"" thick with a total weight of 1 pound 1.8 ounces empty. 

Patented July 27, 1920, this was a favorite pocket pistol during the roaring 20's for both the men and the ladies during those wild times, easy to use with a double action rotating firing pin.

It is from my dad's collection and has not been fired for a very long time but it still functions perfectly. It could use a good cleaning.

To take a closer look at this .22 short derringer and buy it, call REDACTED or e-mail to set up a time and place to meet. 

""All reasonable offers will be considered, low ball offered will be ignored""

I know MANY people that have been having issues with them. Many getting stuck in chamber, I've had a couple guys have squibs stuck halfway down there barrel and one of them DID load a round behind the other one.  Luckily he was smart enough to check his barrel because it just didn't ""feel right.""  I get it, times are hard and you have to take what you can get but just be careful.  If it doesn't feel right, stop.  If it doesn't extract, stop.  Check your barrel.  DO NOT RACK THE SLIDE AND PULL THE TRIGGER without checking the barrel.  I talked to a few guys I know and apparently they are having some employee issues and they're not loading like they used to.  QC apparently has gone down.  I guess they were loading .380's in 9mm boxes.  Take it at face value just PLEASE BE CAREFUL!"

From the manufacturer:
Manufactured by KCI of South Korea , Glock drop-free magazines for your Glock .40 handgun.

Capacity: 31 Rounds
Caliber .40
Construction: Polymer/Steel

Features and Accessories


Colt Defense and Bill Rogers have teamed up to engineer the most advanced, third generation of the Super-Stoc, using innovative technologies and proprietary materials. Designed to be as lightweight as possible while maintaining durability, the Colt Super-Stoc weighs 6.56 ounces, ranking it among the lightest stocks available. The stock is designed specifically for the new Colt rifles to give an unequaled fit and survivability during the most extreme conditions.

A unique Cam-Lock system is a new design feature that, when operated, securely locks onto the buffer tube like a solid stock. This Cam-Lock system completely removes any slop or play commonly inherent with aftermarket collapsible stocks as well as eliminating any movement due to wear. The Cam-Lock lever also features a convenient reversible design, enabling the user to customize his or her stock to suit the desired preference. Other features include a removable recoil pad, sling loop, quick detach swivel sling mount and Quick Release lever which unlocks the Cam-Lock and indexing pin with one motion.

Now for the disclaimers. I have no idea who made these. Got them in a package deal before the Newtown incident. Comparing photos from online distributors has convinced me that they are not KCI. The round counters are evenly spaced, unlike the factory Glock 21 mags. They each hold 26 rounds, so the floor plate isn't really an extension like you see on the others. 

I've checked multiple distributors and auction sites. I have yet to find magazines like this. So why sell them? I only have one Glock 21 pistol, and these things are not practical for CCW at all. I haven't personally tested these other than loading them to full capacity, which they do just fine.

***12 Guage***
*Rubber Ball less-than-leathal 2 for $10- High density rubber ball that at close range is capable of bruising, but at 40 feet is like getting hit with a paint ball.

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP a few years back. It has Austrian markings on the trigger housing to add to its history (See more at http://www.bavarianm1carbines.com/index.html). 

It has a mid 4 million series serial number. Stock is dark walnut with the usual nicks and dents for a rifle that has been to war and back.

I am selling it with two 30-rd magazines and one 15-round magazine (USGI Rockola). It also has the sling and oiler. 

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

If you are not familar with the M1 Carbine, these are our first real a$$ault rifle. My favorite gun to shoot. With the fast approaching personal transfer background requirement and high-capacity magazine ban, I decided it is time get rid of the extras.

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades and must be FTF.

My eyes have gotten to the point that precision shooting is something I USED to do well. My son can shoot sub MOA with it.

It has the beavertail vented, OD Green stock and the Exmark trigger. Not a scratch on this gun. I'm taking the Choate stock, Leupold MK4 M1 scope, Warne base, TRS steel rings, and the bipod off to make it more affordable.

KSG
The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

I had 2. I sold the previous one. I have another one for sale without the grips. 

This item is a piece of history. One of the first ""Hammerless Double Action"" revolvers ever produced. It also has the safety trigger. Which is the predecessor to the modern day G design. Great as a conversation piece or as a gift. 

There is a nice patina on this one. This is a top break model

I am the 2nd owner and have personally used this shotgun at the ranger many times so I am not just buying to sell. Functions flawlessly as one one expect it.

Its a Mossberg 500A and has the complete steel reciever.  This is significantly different than the lower end 500 model which uses the thin aluminum reciever.

She has about 500 rounds through her and has been well taken care of and maintenanced after every range visit.  A few paint scuff marks but nothing that has affected the parkerizing, the metal or function.

Great condition.

The worst part of an order is the freight. and that's were buying bulk lowers our cost.
Remember all these calibers are still being sold by the manufacturers at around 20-25 dollars for boxes of 50. Anymore than that is scalping.
