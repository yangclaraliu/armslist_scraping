Based on the original Hawken plains rifle, the Lyman Great Plains Rifle has improved design features, with hidden modern improvements in the lock, make the Lyman Great Plains Rifle  compelling for the big game hunter or serious shooter.
The Plains Rifle was carried across the Great Plains, by western pioneers and fur trappers. It was the culmination of years of firearms development. The Lyman Great Plains Rifle is similar to rifles built by the famous Saint Louis rifle makers, Samuel Hawken, Gemmer, and Horace E. Dimick to the meet the demands of experienced backwoodsmen.
Double lever double set triggers are fitted, for target shooting, or hunting. The triggers are well adjusted, to allow cocking the lock, or setting the trigger, in any sequence. You may fire the rifle with the trigger set, for a hair trigger release. Or, fire this rifle with the trigger unset, for a firm normal trigger release, ideal for cold weather hunting, or youth training.
A Hawken style hooked breech engages a separate tang, for ease of cleaning after shooting. This rifle features a correct iron ramrod entry thimble, and nose cap. Fitted with a reliable coil spring lock, the lock is case hardened in mottled colors.
The forend cap is polished steel, blued to match the iron hardware. The ramrod entry pipe is correctly positioned to touch the rear edge of the forend cap, for a smooth appearance."

  This gun has two sets of stocks and two barrels. It has original walnut buttstock and forend, along with original 26"" barrel. These stocks are in excellent condition with some very minor blemishes, scratch here and there.  The barrel is excellent too. Bore is bright and shiny, bluing is excellent, 95% or better. I have original mag cap. I have taken great care of this 1100.  .  
    The other set of stocks are  nylon reinforced tactical style. Buttstock has pistol grip,  removable butt plate shims for adjusments, and rubber butt pad for reduced recoil and   matching fore end.  The buttock is Not the collaspsible style .Both are black.  Good contion.
   The other barrel was a 21"" , smooth bore slug barrel. It has been professionally cut to 18.5 ""  and a front bead added.It has been professionally re-blued to a matte finish, to match the finish on the mag extension tube. (Note: the picture was taken before the 21"" barrel was modified) Bore is good.. I bought this used for a home defense barrel because the 26"" was to unwieldy for home defense use. 
    Also included is an extended mag tube with barrel clamp with sling swivel, new action and mag spring. I replaced  the original buttstock nut( still have that also) with a newer style nut. That nut can be removed/ installed with a standard socket.  
  This is one great gun!  I don't have to sell,only willing to depart with this because I need other things and don't have extra cash. I will throw in a shotgun soft carrying case.
   I also have boxes  of five shells  #1 buckshot , some slugs  and about 40 #6 birdshot that I will sell for an additional $

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. This carbine is an Underwood with a great stock and handguard. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP a few years back. It has a low 1 million serial number so was made in middle of WWII. Barrel is dated 1943. Stock is dark walnut and is clean with only a few dings.

I am selling it with 50-rds ammo, two 30-round magazines, and a carbine pouch with two-15 round magazines (15-round mags are loaded with ammo). It also includes the sling and oiler.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling any of carbines but with the craziness in Colorado, I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price. This is the second one I am selling.

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades. Thanks for considering."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

Your time and assistance will very much be appreciated. Bushmaster informed me yesterday that Bushmaster is currently producing the ACR Enhanced and ACR Enhanced LE firearms. Bushmaster also assured me the price IS NOT going up (MSRP will remain the same $2699.00 with Dealers probably asking around $2250.00), they are filling back orders first, and that new orders will only be pushed back 6-8 months.  To purchase an ACR LE, Bushmaster told me to locate a Bushmaster Dealer and ask them to place an order with their Distributor for thea Bushmaster ACR Enhanced LE (Law Enforcement) AR-15 5.56/.223 in Coyote (Brown) and it will certainly be filled. If the price needs a little adjusting, please don't hesitate to contact me. As you know, volunteers need a lot of quality assistance to keep firefighters safe and the station open.

Cheek rest is temporary (mcnett camo wrap around a piece of neoprene) and removeable, but quite functional.  Rifle was shot very little (<100 rounds). $1500

2- Savage 24V, 30-30/20ga.  Nice gun, had a little surface rust when I bought it, but it cleaned up nicely.  Had it up at the cabin but don't need it anymore.  Uncommon combination to find.  Shoots fine. $500.

3- Remington 7600 .30-06. First real deer rifle I ever bought (1993), from a guy who bought it for his wife.  She shot ten rounds out of it and said ""nope"".  That was in 1994 and I've had it ever since.  Great shooter, but I switched to a Tikka .308 a couple years ago and never really looked back.  Also have a Tikka in '06 so this one can go down the road.  Has been hunted, but well cared for.  Re-blued a small spot at the muzzle where it had a bit of rust from a wet gun case.  Otherwise bluing is fine and wood is beautiful (deluxe walnut).  Comes with four magazines (worth around $40-50 apiece now). $500

4 - Unfired Savage 93R17 with old Japanese Tasco 2.5x scope and EGW rail ($49).   Bought it for night hunting hogs but the NV scope would not fit on the gun, so I have not even shot it.  $275

TERMS: Cash, FTF, will drive up to 30 miles from Duluth/Superior.  Not shipping.  If you are a MN resident and want the R15, we will do the transfer at an FFL, otherwise just valid photo ID and bill of sale stating you are not prohibited by law from owning firearms.

Fully loaded, all leather interior, moon roof. It has 133k miles on it. KBB value is 3,500 with 155k miles. My mazda has low miles for its year. I have the title and it is in my name. It is not in mint condition. It needs a tune up and a tranny filter. The paint is oxidized from weather and the paint on the hood is peeling. There are some minor tears on the front seats from wear. There is zero body damage the body is perfect. I drove this car for about 4 years with no problems it is a great car and the last time I drove it it ran great but the tranny was slipping into third. The first time I felt it slipping into third was the last time I drove it. I was taking my son to school and felt it slip. My brother had just left to the AF so I had an extra car to drive. I like to take care of my stuff so I just parked it and it sat for a little over a year. The other day I charged the battery and tried to start it. It wanted to turn over and kind of sputtered but it wouldn't start all the way. A mechanic came to look at it and said all it needs a good tune up and a new tranny filter wich he said is an easy fix. I don't have the means or the money to fix it and I have a new car so I figure I'd just sell/trade it. If you want a great car for extremely cheap and you have a nice extra handgun laying around then this car is for you. Please don't think I'm a fool I know what this car is worth but I'm really in need if a handgun for class. I'm starting the Police academy next semester and I need a nice pistol for my course. If you are interested feel free to email me and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. You can also call or text me at REDACTED. I prefer texts but calls are fine. I work graveyards so feel free to call or text after hours. Buyer is responsible for their own tow to either home or a mechanic. Like I said It won't start but needs a good tune up to start.You are welcome to bring your own mechanic with you to verrify what I have already said. I have more pics of the car that I can send threw picture messages. I am over 21 years old. I am not a felon I have no violent recoed I have my right to bare arms. I can provide a valid CO drivers license for propf of age and I require a bill of sale on both ends. My name is Chris. First Come First Serve. Thank you for your time God Bless."

This model was made between the 1920's through WWII (1944), but I believe these are from the 1930's from the research I've found on them. This includes (1) one 70 Round Drum and (3) 36 Round 9 mm Magazines. The receivers have been torch cut to ATF specifications, but all of the other parts are intact including the heavy barrel. Manufactured by Tikka, this WW2 veteran displays the fine craftsmanship that is a hallmark of Finnish firearm makers. These weapons were used by Finnish, Swiss, and Swedish troops successfully against the Soviets in the Winter War of 1940, with production continuing until 1944. This powerful 9mm sub gun saw action until the 1990's, when it was finally rendered obsolete. 

Again, these all have the receiver cut multiple times to prevent any functionality. Used in good condition and 100% legal to own, non-functioning classic military weapon.

The AR-30A1 is the next generation of ArmaLite's highly acclaimed bolt action rifles - the ULTIMATE long range target and tactical firearm. The new AR-30A1 is available in a target version and a standard version. Both versions are available in .338 Lapua and .300 Win Mag. 

On the surface, the AR-30A1 bears a family resemblance to its predecessor, the AR-30.  But, every individual component of the AR-30 was scrutinized
in the AR-30A1.  As a result, only the pistol grip, buttpad, trigger, and a few small components from the AR-30 passed muster for the AR-30A1.  All other components are new and/or improved.  The result is a firearm that maintains its predecessor’s outstanding accuracy, light weight, and soft recoil while dramatically improving its ergonomics, adaptability, versatility, reliability and ease of use.               

Features of all versions of the new AR-30A1:

Muzzle brake threads on the end of the barrels employ threads that are standard for the sound suppressor industry (5/8 x 24 for the 300 Win Mag and 3/4 x 24 for the 338 Lapua).  So, many sound suppressors can be screwed directly onto the barrel without the need for an adaptor.

The long, 26” barrel in the .338 Lapua enhances muzzle velocity, flatness of trajectory, and terminal ballistics.  The 24” barrel of the .300 Win Mag balances ballistic performance with portability.
Optional 1913 rails will support a variety of add-on accessories.

A tough, through-hardened receiver means reduced wear and increased smoothness.

The bolt-mounted safety mechanism locks the firing pin to the rear.  This design is stronger and more secure than a sear or trigger blocking safety because it directly blocks the firing pin itself.

The metal cheekpiece is very durable and the elastomeric cheekpiece pad provides a comfortable shooter interface in all weather conditions. 

The cheekpiece supports contain integral cleaning rod guides that prevent damage to the bore due to inadequate cleaning rod control.

Multiple sling installation locations allow simultaneous use of a sling and a bipod.  And the rear sling swivel can be moved to either the left or right side. 

To provide very compact transportation, the entire buttstock assembly can be quickly and easily removed with only one allen wrench. 

The standard and target buttstocks are interchangeable on any receiver with use of only one allen wrench. 

Military grade anodizing and phosphating finishes enhance durability and corrosion resistance.

Features specific to the AR-30A1 Standard version:

Much evaluation went into the ergonomics of the AR-30A1.  The cheekpiece is at the optimum height for viewing through a telescopic sight by most shooters.  And the buttstock, although not adjustable, is ergonomically correct for most shooters.

The included 20 minute angled top rail on the receiver allows zeroing at the extended range provided by the .338 Lapua.  (A 10 minute rail is also available as an accessory.)

Performance characteristics of all versions of the AR-30A1:

ArmaLite’s testing has proven the muzzle brake to be the best in the industry for both reducing recoil and increasing accuracy.  This makes shooting the AR-30A1 comfortable for even the smallest or recoil-sensitive shooter.

The competition grade barrel and our patented V-block receiver bedding system are keys to the AR-30A1’s minute of angle accuracy. ArmaLite’s patented V-Block™ Bedding Wedge and V-Block Stock assure absolute strength and repeatability for superb accuracy.  The aluminum stock reinforces the receiver like a bench-rest sleeve.

The magazine of any mag-fed firearm is critical to reliable feeding.  The AR-30’s magazine underwent extensive development testing to assure reliability of feeding.  It is made of steel, not polymer or aluminum, to provide years of heavy duty service.

The single stack design of the AR-30A1 magazine minimizes the material removed from the receiver for the mag well.  This significantly contributes to the strength and stiffness of the AR-30A1 receiver.

The deep magazine well under the receiver makes magazine insertion fast and easy, while holding the magazine in exactly the correct position for reliable feeding.

An ambidextrous magazine catch is centrally located so that the shooter can release the magazine and catch it with the same hand.  Reloading is fast, and the expended magazine won’t be dropped to be lost, damaged or muddied.

The rifle balances just in front of the magazine well. So, the rifle can be easily and comfortably carried near the rifle’s balance point with only one hand, freeing the other hand for other critical activities.

The powerful ejection system and generous ejection port eject even loaded .338 Lapua cartridges rapidly and reliably.  The large ejection port also makes single loading of cartridges through it easy and fast. 

The ergonomically improved bolt handle design and “competition grade” dimensions and tolerances in the receiver allow lightning-fast, butter-smooth reloading.

The buttstock can be removed with one allen wrench for compact transportation or storage.  In confined areas, military and LE users can employ the AR-30A1 in a “pistol configuration” without its buttstock. ArmaLite’s highly efficient muzzle brake makes firing, even in the pistol configuration, comfortable

These are from before the plastic Korean import mags dropped the prices.

Im pretty sure a Glock would be better as the grip frames are solid but I no longer have a 9mm Glock so Im selling them cheap. Metal doesnt wear down or flex so these USA Mag magazines are solid as can be compared to the extended plastics I have. I have 2 so you can have the second at same price and no extra shipping.

676,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1136676,For Sale:  AR-30A1 in .338 Lapua,"Minnesota, Minnesota, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Monday, February 25, 2013",Rifles,Armalite                                                                                ,300 Winchester Magnum                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"ArmaLite Inc.® proudly introduces the all new AR-30A1. The AR-30A1 is the next generation of ArmaLite's highly acclaimed bolt action rifles - the ULTIMATE long range target and tactical firearm. The new AR-30A1 is available in a target version and a standard version. Both versions are available in .338 Lapua and .300 Win Mag.

On the surface, the AR-30A1 bears a family resemblance to its predecessor, the AR-30. But, every individual component of the AR-30 was scrutinized
in the AR-30A1. As a result, only the pistol grip, buttpad, trigger, and a few small components from the AR-30 passed muster for the AR-30A1. All other components are new and/or improved. The result is a firearm that maintains its predecessor’s outstanding accuracy, light weight, and soft recoil while dramatically improving its ergonomics, adaptability, versatility, reliability and ease of use.

Features of all versions of the new AR-30A1:

Muzzle brake threads on the end of the barrels employ threads that are standard for the sound suppressor industry (5/8 x 24 for the 300 Win Mag and 3/4 x 24 for the 338 Lapua). So, many sound suppressors can be screwed directly onto the barrel without the need for an adaptor.

The long, 26” barrel in the .338 Lapua enhances muzzle velocity, flatness of trajectory, and terminal ballistics. The 24” barrel of the .300 Win Mag balances ballistic performance with portability.
Optional 1913 rails will support a variety of add-on accessories.

A tough, through-hardened receiver means reduced wear and increased smoothness.

The bolt-mounted safety mechanism locks the firing pin to the rear. This design is stronger and more secure than a sear or trigger blocking safety because it directly blocks the firing pin itself.

The metal cheekpiece is very durable and the elastomeric cheekpiece pad provides a comfortable shooter interface in all weather conditions.

The cheekpiece supports contain integral cleaning rod guides that prevent damage to the bore due to inadequate cleaning rod control.

Multiple sling installation locations allow simultaneous use of a sling and a bipod. And the rear sling swivel can be moved to either the left or right side. 
To provide very compact transportation, the entire buttstock assembly can be quickly and easily removed with only one allen wrench.

The standard and target buttstocks are interchangeable on any receiver with use of only one allen wrench.

Military grade anodizing and phosphating finishes enhance durability and corrosion resistance.

Features specific to the AR-30A1 Standard version:

Much evaluation went into the ergonomics of the AR-30A1. The cheekpiece is at the optimum height for viewing through a telescopic sight by most shooters. And the buttstock, although not adjustable, is ergonomically correct for most shooters.

The included 20 minute angled top rail on the receiver allows zeroing at the extended range provided by the .338 Lapua. (A 10 minute rail is also available as an accessory.)

Performance characteristics of all versions of the AR-30A1:

ArmaLite’s testing has proven the muzzle brake to be the best in the industry for both reducing recoil and increasing accuracy. This makes shooting the AR-30A1 comfortable for even the smallest or recoil-sensitive shooter.

The competition grade barrel and our patented V-block receiver bedding system are keys to the AR-30A1’s minute of angle accuracy. ArmaLite’s patented V-Block™ Bedding Wedge and V-Block Stock assure absolute strength and repeatability for superb accuracy. The aluminum stock reinforces the receiver like a bench-rest sleeve.

The magazine of any mag-fed firearm is critical to reliable feeding. The AR-30’s magazine underwent extensive development testing to assure reliability of feeding. It is made of steel, not polymer or aluminum, to provide years of heavy duty service.

The single stack design of the AR-30A1 magazine minimizes the material removed from the receiver for the mag well. This significantly contributes to the strength and stiffness of the AR-30A1 receiver.

The deep magazine well under the receiver makes magazine insertion fast and easy, while holding the magazine in exactly the correct position for reliable feeding.
An ambidextrous magazine catch is centrally located so that the shooter can release the magazine and catch it with the same hand. Reloading is fast, and the expended magazine won’t be dropped to be lost, damaged or muddied.

The rifle balances just in front of the magazine well. So, the rifle can be easily and comfortably carried near the rifle’s balance point with only one hand, freeing the other hand for other critical activities.

The powerful ejection system and generous ejection port eject even loaded .338 Lapua cartridges rapidly and reliably. The large ejection port also makes single loading of cartridges through it easy and fast.

The ergonomically improved bolt handle design and “competition grade” dimensions and tolerances in the receiver allow lightning-fast, butter-smooth reloading.

The buttstock can be removed with one allen wrench for compact transportation or storage. In confined areas, military and LE users can employ the AR-30A1 in a “pistol configuration” without its buttstock. ArmaLite’s highly efficient muzzle brake makes firing, even in the pistol configuration, comfortable

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

Hello and Thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a brand new in box Barrett M107A1 .50 BMG with a 29"" barrel. Please check availability before bidding.

A whole new legend.It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

Features:
Suppressor-ready muzzle brake.
Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet.
Accepts M1913 accessory rails.
Thermal cheek guard.
Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail.

This is a Microtech Small Arms Research (MSAR) STG-556 5.56mm bullpup rifle, the Bradford PA-made copy/improvement of the venerable Steyr AUG battle rifle. This one has a lot going for it...it's an 8K series rifle, so it was made far enough into the production run that all the early problems were worked out; it comes with the factory 1.5x optic sight in great shape, and also has the additional picatinny rail that can be put on if you want to use another sight system; and it comes in the factory box with a 10rd, a 30 rd and a 42 rd magazine, all see-through mags so you can see your remaining rounds, as well as the factory lock, paperwork etc. This rifle works with either MSAR or Steyr mags, which are relatively easy to find and which are really superb---strong, reliable and VERY tough! The rifle is virtually flawless, with only a couple of minor rub marks I couldn't even get to show up in pics and NO problems with the metal inside or out. This particular rifle is set up for a RH shooter, but LH bolts are available and it's a matter of less than 5 mins to change out the bolts and the ejection ports to set it up for LH shooting if you're so inclined---be advised, this rifle is being sold with ONLY the original RH bolt! These rifles are a real pleasure to handle and shoot---the weight sits to the rear, the trigger is surprisingly crisp and light for a bullpup although it does have some preliminary creep, and one-handed point shooting is really instinctive for CQB training drills. Even if you're a hardcore AR fan, if you shoot this gun you will want to add it to your collection...and the AR will probably gather dust! This is accurate, reliable and definitely has a high degree of ""cool factor""!

This is a 184- series Ruger Mini-14, blued with the original factory folding stock. Rifle is in very good condition with very little/no bluing loss and only compression marks in the wood stock---no rust, no scratches. I am not the original owner so I can't quote a round count, but the bore is bright and the action is clean so it can't be very high. One interesting feature of this gun is that it has the ""V"" rear sight as opposed to the normal peep sight---according to Ruger very few were made like this, and usually it was police department orders, although the gun has no other department serial numbers or the like to show it was ever a police gun, and judging by the condition I doubt that it was. In any case, the sight is a Ruger ""V"" rear, so it might have come this way from the factory or might have been changed out by a previous owner with genuine Ruger parts. This gun also has the ""scope mount"" sideplate installed, and I have an aftermarket scope mount available (brand new, still in the plastic) for my cost of $40---it's never been mounted on the gun. I am including 2 brand new factory 20 rd magazines with the sale---I have others available, as well as a couple 30 rd mags that could be available for an additional charge.

Unfortunately I found out it can't be sold within NY. And before you question me - I have been on the phone with gun shops, the local BATF, the local NY State police office and a NY SAFE LAW specially trained officer. I can't sell this in NY without possibly facing Class A midemeanor charges. I can ship elsewhere but shipping charges (and FFL charges) will apply. It is located in Rochester.

This is a used but practically new Bushmaster XM15-E2S. I purchased this from a local shop that sold it to the original owner a couple years ago. He sold it through them on consignment. I am only selling this because I ordered a rifle just before the NY SAFE law went into effect and I was not sure if I would get it so I picked this one up just in case. My order came in so I want to sell this one.

It has been bore-scoped and tested for function by a highly competent gunsmith. All normal wear areas prove it has only a few rounds through it. The bolt, bolt carrier, buffer, hammer, etc. are all in essentially new condition. The exterior finish is as close to perfect as possible with only a few very light handling marks. I can provide more pictures for any perspective buyers. 

The rifle has a 16"" chrome-moly steel barrel with a chrome-lined chamber and bore. It accepts both 5.56 and .223 ammunition. It has a quad-rail fore-end with covers. It comes with; the original owners manual, an EOTech Holosight (I believe model #512), an A.R.M.S. #40L-SP back-up fold-down rear sight, CAA folding forward grip, original carry handle with integrated rear sight, carry/storage case, 10-round magazine and I will be including a Magpul MOE grip and a Magpul MOE trigger guard that I never installed.

I am asking $1800. for this (less than what I have into it)."
