If you are new to AR's or you are experienced, Colt is not just a classic, it is also one of the MOST popular AR's in history.
The two I have are an SP-1 and an CAR-A3 Hbar Elite
The SP1 is a handle Top with 2 (30rd) mags and a removable bayonet!  This AR is excellent for home protection and it has one of the highest rates of perfection in firing reliability.  This SP1 is also a PRE clinton ban rifle.  That means it has the older design which any shooter will tell you is a better design with less ""restriction"" than the newer designs.  This rifle is in Excellent condition and I would grade it at 95%!  That is like getting a VINTAGE new gun!  Price for this rifle is only 1475

The other Colt AR is a NEW HBAR Elite CAR-A3  This is your Sniper AR on steroids.  This baby will be one of THE MOST accurate long range 223 caliber rifles money can buy!  With a mid to high grade optic (scope) you can have accuracy of a shot spread the size of a quarter at 50 yards!!! and the size of a slice of bologna at over 100 yards!!!
This has a Chrome lined barrel with a tactical tip for accuracy.  VERY nice AR and you can add or build any accessories you want on this baby!  This fine lady has a price of only 1580 w/out the scope, and 1675 with the scope! Act quick, you will have to, to be able to catch one of these beautiful girls!  Each girl comes with 2 steel mags each, and I will sell both of them together for only 3k (3095 w/scope) or for 3500 I will also throw in $700 worth of Ammo and PMags (3595 with scope).
This is TRULY an amazing deal!!! At a Gun Store you would pay excess of $4600.00 for this same deal!!!  But with me in a private sale you are looking at saving over $1600.00!!!  Must be a NV resident for in person sale, or I can ship to your local dealer if you live outside the state (shipping cost and fees will be added for this option).
If you are NV resident CASH only and will meet in person to sell.

I am working on getting a credit card processor and a web store - until then I accept DISCREET paypal payments, money order and personal check (you must wait until the latter clears). I do not charge fees for paypal.

john,

I have some disturbing news to report out of Salem.

Time was running out, all the Judiciary Committee had to do was let the anti-gun bills die...

But anti-gun Senators decided on the last day possible that they couldn't let well enough alone and RAMMED through draconian gun-grabbing legislation -- SB-347, SB-700, and SB-796 along strict party lines.

The bills now move to the Senate floor for discussion and a vote.

But it gets worse.

The Senate is split 16 Democrats and 14 Republicans.

The one glimmer of hope was Democrat Senator Betsy Johnson who stood against the gun-grabbers in her party, pledging to vote against all of these bills.

Unfortunately, Senator Johnson was involved in an automobile accident Monday, keeping her away from the Senate for the foreseeable future.

The Republicans will not only have to vote as a unified front but if Senator Johnson is unable to return in time, they may have to persuade another Democrat to cross party lines and vote against more gun control.

The time to act is now!

The anti-gun crowd in the Senate is poised to vote these bills through, and with the absence of swing vote Sen. Johnson -- they can taste victory.

Your State Senators need to hear from you now.

Click here to find your State Senator.

Or phone 1-REDACTED.

Call your State Senator and urge them to vote No on SB-347, SB-700, and SB-796.

The Israel built DE44W 44 Magnum is in stock!

The Picatinny rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics.

    The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.
    The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
    The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
    Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.
    The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
    The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.

Safety

The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters.
When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.
Construction

Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

590,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1520590,For Sale:  .308 / 7.62x51 NATO,"Akron, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, April 25, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale: 1,000 rounds of 7.62x51mm training ammo made in Germany. These rounds have a plastic case and bullet and are non-corrosive. These are used for training by the German Army and Special Forces - but you can use them where ever (within reason of course :)

These are a ton of fun to use - virtually no recoil, much quieter than the full-power ammo and much lighter. I have shot 1,000's of these rounds of the past several years and they are awesome! I got rid of my .308 rifle, so now I don't have a use for them. I personally used this ammo for sighting in new scopes, target practice, small game hunting, plinking, etc. I have taken out ground hogs, rabbits, squirrels, etc. at well over 150 yrds with this stuff, no problem. This ammo will easily shoot right through 3/4"" plywood at 150 yrds.

One of the many things I like about this ammo is you can shoot much more of it than traditional ammo, and faster, without heating up/warping your barrel or breaking your wallet. Not to mention, it produces very little carbon or other metallic build ups like traditional ammo does. You can shoot 100's of rounds and cleaning is a breeze. As far as accuracy goes, the manufacture claim is this stuff is accurate past 200 yrds. I have tested up to 150 yrds and can confirm it is very accurate at that distance. Perfect for teaching young or new shooters. That being said - THESE ARE BULLETS THAT CAN KILL JUST THE SAME AS METAL BULLETS. These are not a toy and need to be used in a responsible manner. According to the manufacture, this ammo reaches speeds of 4300+ FPS. Again, this is not a toy and CAN KILL!!!

Note: I have only ever used this ammo in a bolt action rifle, not sure how it would act in a semi-auto.

Here is a YouTube video of this exact same ammo. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnEdwZv9WsU

The case I have is factory sealed, never opened. I would like to keep it that way but would entertain breaking it up. Price for the 1,000 round case is $300 OBO. This is less than a 3rd of what traditional 308/762.51 ammo is going for. Using this ammo in place of traditional ammo even a third of the time will same you lots of money. 

FTF cash sale ONLY. No shipping. I live in the Akron area; please keep this in mind when replying. Not really looking for any trades, but the worst I can say is no thanks. Must be at least 18 to buy rifle ammo in OHIO."

BEAMSHOT is proud to introduce the NEW Laser/Flashlight Combo. Smaller, lighter, more powerful and accurate the NEW 9001 series fits and performs better than bulkier and heavier competitive products. New technology allowed us to dramatically improve an already excellent product. Beamshot’s 2012 design has a slim body that conforms to new high speed weapon designs and fits current combo holsters. It has a detachable rail clamp that lets it fit tightly onto any universal or Picatinny rail system. We added a strobe feature for the laser to go along with the strobe light. Two separate, intuitive hand operation switches for laser and light avoids any possible mistake during emergency situations. A protective silicon cover gives the unit a rugged look and adds additional shock and water resistant capabilities. The battery has been upgraded to a rechargeable unit that makes for longer and more efficient operation. A Car Charger is included so the unit can be recharged in any situation. A new LED power indicator will warn you when the power is getting low and need to recharge. The new BEAMSHOT 9001 series…….a shooting experience you won’t soon forget."

Fast - Superformance ammunition is 100 to 200 fps FASTER than any conventional ammunition on the market today, and achieves this performance in EVERY gun, WITHOUT increases in felt recoil, muzzle blast, temperature sensitivity, fouling or loss of accuracy.

Innovative
Superformance is a cutting edge technological advancement in ammunition design that transcends convention and achieves the highest performance of any ammunition on the market today. 

Specialized
Superformance uses ultra progressive propellants that take your favorite SST or GMX bullets to levels of performance that are simply unattainable with conventional propellants. In order to get more velocity in the past – shooters have used a brute force approach – large charge weights of a slow burning powder in a larger cartridge case. Ultimately this leads to more recoil and muzzle blast. The Superformance solution is an elegant approach that utilizes specialized powders…at NORMAL charge weights, that impart ALL useable energy to the bullet reducing the ROCKET NOZZLE EFFECT at the muzzle while still increasing velocity!

Versatile
Superformance provides increased performance, and is safe to use in ALL firearms, including semi-autos*, lever gun and pump actions.

Increases in rifle performance, no increases in barrel wear and felt recoil, along with superior temperature stability are all realized with Superformance ammunition.

It really IS… Rocket Science!

Trades  I am interested in : (1) Full size 1911 of similar value (Sig, Colt, Kimber, Springfield Loaded Parkerized) (2) Desert Eagle in .44 or .357 (3) VZ-58 (not century).

Taurus large frame revolvers deliver the goods in a big way when the chips are down. The model 44 offers up 6 rounds of full power .44 Magnum loads. Hammer forged for tough performance and confidence-boosting accuracy, these decision-makers come with hand-fitted actions, and clean, crisp triggers right out of the box. New innovations include ported barrels that reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil.

         Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
 	Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 	Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

 Down to the last of my new ammo. Still available are:

 5.56 - I have both PMC-XTac (55gr FMJ) and PMC X-Tac 5.56 62gr w/penetrator (""Green Tip"") this is NEW production direct from Poonsang (South Korea) with 13 Headstamps. I don't imagine, given their political climate, we'll see much more of this in the immediate future. This is PMC's 'mission critical' round - so it's meant to be fired tomorrow, or held for a few years, and still perform just the same. Selling at $25/box delivered or $99 for 5 boxes - delivered

 .223 PMC Bronze (55gr Boat Tail) (their tactical vs. marksmanship/target rounds) - Same story as above (down to 10 boxes) $19/box or $90/5 boxes - delivered.

 .22lr - gone

 Check http://ammoseek.com to see the prices prople are actively paying for this ammo, when it's available. I know the prices seem high, but they've been high for months, and this is for people looking to shoot. The 5.56/.223 is all first-run factory production, and you get the quality brass that goes with it, NOT steel cases.

 **NOTE: .223 is USUALLY perfectly safe to fire in systems chambered for 5.56, but the inverse/opposite is NOT the case. We're talking 50,000 PSI a few inches from your peepers- better to ask questions and play it safe than blow pieces of your weapon (or yourself) into the guy standing next to you."

In addition, the 3” Modular Picatinny Rail sections allow the shooter to customize the rail set up.

The v7 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down."

Each cartridge is loaded to ensure optimal pressure, velocity, accuracy and lot-to-lot consistency.

Hornady produces most of the brass for Hornady Varmint Express ammunition. All of the brass is chosen to ensure it meets our high standards for reliable feeding, corrosion resistance, proper hardness and the ability to withstand maximum chamber pressures.

Primers
Like the powder, each primer is carefully matched to individual loads, and all are chosen for their ability to quickly, completely and reliably ignite the powder charge.
