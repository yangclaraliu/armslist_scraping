SN 473. According to the ""The Springfield 1903 Rifle"" by Brophy (pg 128-129) the Ordnance Department purchased 10 of these rifles after the 1927 International Competitions fitting them with 31 inch heavy barrels (1 inch across the muzzle),Swiss Globe front sights,target scope blocks, Lyman 48 Receiver sights, palm rests, dbl set triggers, Scheuzen style check pieces, elaborate Trigger Guards and Butt Stocks. Others were offered for sale through the DCM and NRA at a cost of $231.46 from 1929 to 1932 for a total of about 40 rifles. ""Few of these scarce rifles have survived in original condition"" This rifle will letter through the SRS, as it has in the past. The condition of this is very fine plus with 96% to 98% strong blue on the barrel, 95% original blue with some freckles of light rust on the Receiver. The wood is sound with minor nicks and scratches and a hairline crack in the butt stock behind the butt plate attaching pin escutcheon, it retains most of its original fine hand rubbed oil finish. The mechanics are excellent with a bright and shiny bore. If one has any question please feel free to ask. This CR OK, IF paid with MO or Certified funds I usually ship within 24 hours with a MO, personal checks and Certified have to clear. Buyer to pay shipping, Weight of this rifle is 14 lbs and WILL HAVE to be shipped USPS REGISTERED MAIL to insure it adequately. Reasonable offers will be entertained. This is a rare and hard rifle to find,it could take years to find one let alone one as nice.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5/9/12 It has recently been brought to my attention that several of these Springfield Hammerillis (SN 434 and SN 456) have been sold at auction for substantially less than my offering price. After closely examining the auction catalogs multiple photos it is very clear that one has a large crack in the stock at the back of the Receiver, has a non configuration Springfield barrel and in general the condition of the stock, receiver & barrel and small parts in particular the Trigger assembly DO NOT tell the same story. It therefore appears that one of the two is REFINSIHED. The second ones pictures are a bit too vague to determine exactly what is going on with that rifle however again the barrel appears to be a replacement and the stock and metal parts condition seems to be at odds with each other. Also both rifle appear to have been shot either not at all or very little after they were blued. One MUST REMEMBER that Springfield Hammerillis rifles WERE SHOT both before and after they were sold through the DCM in the 1930's and to be in original condition need to show some commensurate wear. Again to quote Brophy, ""Very few of these scarce rifles have survived in ORIGINAL condition."""

Since the expiration of the Federal High Capacity magazine ban in 2004 they are now available to most of the general public (unless you live in a state that restricts magazines see below) These are L.E. / Govt. marked magazines. Springs and followers are excellent. Some slight cosmetic wear. These were law enforcement magazines so they have very few rounds through them, mostly road around in magazine pouches or in the gun all day. These magazines are legal for civilians to own since the expiration of the federal high capacity magazine ban in 2004. In fact the L/E Govt inscription provides proof that these magazines were manufactured between 1994 and 2004 thereby making them legal if future federal hi cap bans or state bans are put in place. Remember, in 1994 when the federal ban was passed, all existing hi-cap mags were grandfathered in and legal. Get them while they last or before the feds or your states enact a ban on high cap mag. Remember, just as before, when they ban them, the ones that already exist you can keep. Manufacturers just can‚Äôt sell any new ones to individuals>. These magazines cannot be shipped to individuals in California, or Mass, unless you are law enforcement personnel, or a FFL dealer, or if you are the holder of a valid high capacity magazine license.

A new, old stock, tunnel extractor was obtained and carefully fitted to this pistol.  I'll throw in the old one, for those who want everything the way it left the factory.  The bluing looks good, but there is thinning and wear visible on the front and backstraps and some wear on the high spots near the muzzle, presumably from some holster wear. Other signs of use and bad at all.  Also included are the red backed walnut grips and one period correct, aluminum follower, 13 round magazine.  

I will require an Ohio driver's licence and the buyer to sign a bill of sale. I will also provide the same information to you.

If you purchase this pistol, I will sell you 2 additional, new old stock tunnel extractors and a ""like new"" set of Herret's Cocobolo grips for an additional $125 if desired.  The extractors each are being offered on Gunbroker and eBay for $80-90 each, the grips are worth about $45.  I will NOT sell these separately, don't even ask.

If you have any questions, please ask, but I am NOT prepared to haggle as I am looking to recover these funds for other purposes, and I am NOT interested in trades at this time.  I've used Armslist before and lowball offers will be ignored.

I consider this to be an excellent example of a post-WWII Hi-Power, especially as it is 60 years old!

I'll be out of town, Friday-Tuesday, with limited email access.  Be patient, I'll answer your questions."

It doesn't like to feed 36 grain hollowpoints, they aren't heavy enough to reliably cycle the action.

This gun works great and I love it, but I'm moving to California and the threaded barrel makes it an assault weapon there...

The suppressor is fake, it is just a metal tube with no sound modification properties, not an NFA item.  The P22 comes with all original parts, including the threaded barrel tip as well as the original non-threaded barrel tip, and the thread protector for use with the threaded barrel when the suppressor isn't on.  It also includes the wrench needed to change the barrel tip, the plastic piece for putting the slide back on the gun easier during re-assembly, and an additional different sized backstrap.

2 Magazines and original box included.

Over 1575 rounds of Blazer .22LR 40 grain lead round nose (the open box has a little more than 525 because I poured in the rest of another box) as well as over 1000 rounds of CCI mini-mag 40 grain copper plated round nose.

$500 buys everything in the kit.  If you don't want the ammo, I'll sell just the P22 with no ammo for $300.  The Blazer boxes (525 rounds) I'm selling individually for $45, and the CCI mini-mag are $12.50 per box (100 rounds)"

Ive tried a couple different times to sandblast the bodies but it hasn't worked out so I boxed them up and forgot about them for a couple years. Several years ago I had these in storage, some brand new and some used mags and water was spilled on the top of the box and left for several months. A few of the mags developed some pitting near the bottom or top depending on how they were sitting and other have light surface rust . Its a mixture of new BRW USGI mags, at least 1 Winchester OM marked mag, a couple new CMI mags and the bulk were mostly new blued mags that were sold in 2003/2004 as Taiwanese Type 57 mags. They all have welded rear locking tabs,no issues beyond the finish. If you have a sandblast set up it'd be an easy project.
I'd rather sell them all as one lot and not have to deal with piecing them out. 
They're currently dissambled, and I'd be willing to sell them as rebuild kits or put them back together.

For those of you that may not know, Olympic Arms is in fact the oldest and longest continuous manufacturer of AR15 products to the civilian market in the WORLD. Colt is the only manufacturer older, and they are to the point where they actually manufacturer less than 7 parts in house. When Bushmaster¬Æ got its start; Olympic Arms made their lowers for them and sold them parts kits. Oly has been either contracted for or has delivered parts for Colt, Bushmaster, DPMS, Rock River Arms and Armalite. Olympic Arms is the only TRUE MANUFACTURER of AR's in America in that they make every major component part of the AR15/M16 system IN HOUSE. No other brand name can make such a claim. Olympic Arms innovated the flat-top upper, the free-floating handguard system, had the first 4-rail integral free floating handguard, the first 7.62x39 conversion, invented the 9mm conversions as well as the Simunitions¬Æ training AR15's.

I am selling a Howa 1500 in 30-06 with a Nikko Stirling Gameking 3.5-10x44 scope. The rifle has a green rubberized Hogue stock. 

I bought the rifle about 3 years ago and have done nothing but a little bit of target shooting with it. It probably has about 50-100 rounds through it. The scope was purchased at the same time. I am only selling them because I want to finance a slug gun for deer hunting this year. (A Savage 220 is what I am interested in if someone happens to be interested in a trade) 

I am asking $450 obo. (gun retails for $461 on Buds Gun Shop which is a well priced site, and the scope retails for about $150) If you have any questions please feel free to ask.  (If your interested in pictures let me know, I can take them but the gun looks brand new)

Thanks for looking.

Only about 1,850 of the SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the U.S. and that includes military/police and civilian use. Now about 89 these were changed to a fixed stock version with a smaller 6 round mag vs the pre 89 which were 8 round and collapsible stock. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide, on the civilian market it has been featured in films, several video games and of course TV shows. The coolest feature is the ability to switch from pump to semi automatic. Now as far as military or police applications this allows lower impact rounds such as tear gas bean bags or rubber bullets which generally do not create enough gas pressure to cycle a round allowing the user the ability to manually extract and reload. But in civilian sector especially home defense mode this gun can be stored without a round in the chamber and as you are aware there isn't a criminal anywhere on earth that doesn't know the very distinct sound of a pump shotgun loading a round...... can you say asshole pucker effect. The coolest thing is that once you pump it once it can instantly be in semi auto so if you miss your target on the first shot the criminal may stick his stupid ass head up thinking you forgot to pump the shotgun to reload, bang he's dead. This has only been fired 20-25 times it has been in climate controlled storage in a gun safe since mid 80's this is the roughest toughest shotgun anywhere."

Taken for granted before they stopped being made, the Smith & Wesson 4013 Tactical Smith & Wesson (TSW) has since gained a cult following. If you aren't already familiar with this model, and you're a .40 S&W fan, I encourage you to conduct a brief internet search, and you will hear the high praises that his pistol typically receives. A phenomenal carry piece, this second generation DA/SA model has a capacity of 9+1, and features a decocking safety.

-1x S&W 4013TSW Gen. 2 pistol, DA/SA, bobbed hammer, decocking safety, stainless pistol with Novak [three white dot] sights.

New CCW license holder? This package can get you carrying an effective piece NOW. This is a used pistol, but has not been abused and shows minimal wear. I can provide multiple additional pictures to genuinely interested parties (close-ups etc.). With this pistol, S&W created an optimal carry piece, and then stopped making it. The only thing that makes me bring this beauty to market is consolidation of calibers, and .40 S&W is not on the final list of ""made it"" loadings [*Sigh*]. It shoots everything, and it does so accurately.
