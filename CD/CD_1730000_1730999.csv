These are amazing!  Battery lasts 3 years continuously on. Works great with night vision as well.  Includes the factory mount, lense covers, battery and the paperwork that they come with from the factory.  The box was only opened to photograph the optic.  $400 FTF in the Chickasha area. Here is the factory info:

Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

 The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

 Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in a emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique Features •Always red - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. No need to fumble with switches prior to use. 
•2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances. 
•In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy. 
•Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared to iron sights and magnified scopes. 
•Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with Aimpoint 3X Magnifiers and Concealed Engagement unit. 
•Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world conditions and waterproof to 150 feet. 
•Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD). 
•Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.> 
•Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with both covers closed in an emergency. 
•Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces. 
•Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles. (Adapter available for carry handle mounting) 
•Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns. 
•QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount. Will not deform your rail like many other mounts. 
•Recessed lens openings helps prevent against impact damage, fingerprints and scratches."

(Looks like a cd holder, there is no writing on the bag, just the S&W Black on Black S&W Logo Stamp. nobody would suspect it is a weapon). 

 I also have an extra set of batteries for the integrated laser sights.  
______________________________________________________________________
I also have a Mossberg 715T the flat top model with a Red/Green Dot Scope on it. It is a Mossberg Tactical 715T 22lr Semi-Automatic. Looks and feels just like an AR-15 only it fires 22lr.  It comes with a new Tactical Hand Grip on the forend, I also have (2) 25 Round Extended Magazines (Both with speed loaders) & (1) 10 round magazine to fight off Zombies while you are re-loading the 25 round magazines. (25 Round Magazines are hard to locate & expensive if you can even them). The ones you see for $300.00 or $350.00 are the one that come with (1) 10 round magazine.  Don’t be fooled.  If you back-order them from Gander Mountain, You may get lucky. Gun Lock and Original Manuals are also included. All of this comes in a hard durable rifle case. The gun looks and works great. I have put around 400 rounds (Different Manufacturers) through it and the gun works flawlessly. I have shot it at the range twice and both times I have cleaned & oiled & put it away in the safe. I have the original cardboard box it came in if you would like that also.

Tossing and turning every night, waking up in a cold sweat wondering, ""AM I BRINGING ENOUGH GUN TO THE VARMINT BATTLE!?"" 

Well, in 2002, the heavens were parted, and the .17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire cartridge was born. Developed by wildcatters and hailed by critics as the best ammunition innovation in 50 years, this cartridge has since served as the speed hungry, flat shooting, scary accurate cousin to its more humble rimfire relatives. 

""But..."" you say, ""isn't this cartridge too small to take down anything bigger than a squirrel!?"" Let me stop you right there. It won't just take down a squirrel. Once the polymer tip cartridge contacts the squirrel, there is such a magnificent flurry of cartridge expansion and frangibility that the squirrel will cease to exist. Scientists call this radical change in matter disintegration, others call it ballistic magic.  People have taken down deer, coyotes, and bobcats with this screaming cartridge. A testament to skill, of course, but those legends were born out of using the right tool for the job. 

""But what about zombies???""

Son, just stop.

Included is Savage's homage to the mighty .17 HMR cartridge in the form of their flagship 93R17 rifle. This particular model, the BTVS, has a laminated wood thumbhole stock (looks like Michaelangelo scultped it himself during his tactical days), a floating barrel (likely designed by David Copperfield because it's a wonderous curiosity to behold), and slick stainless steel bolt hardware (Tony Stark probably was sought as a consultant for that portion).

In addition, it's only fair that this rifle have the right scope attached so you can see the perfectly round holes you'll be drilliing through quarters at 100 yards. Enter the Redfield Revolution 3-9x40 with Accu-Range Reticle. Forged by some of Leupold's best and brightest, you can watch the amazing fusion of science and physics play out in real time as your targets become history. High-mounted on custom ring mounts, this scope knows what's up.

I've also thrown in an aftermarket 10-round detachable magazine to go with the 5-round OEM one for those of the trigger happy variety.  

A hard case, a sling, and some ammo thrown in as well. Only a couple hundred rounds through it, and I've got a couple hundred more, but I can't guarantee you'll get all 200 I have left because I just might take this out to one last outing for old times sake. Shoot this once and you'll immediately understand.

He has 6 postings today alone.  He is using the phone number sIx1TwO7zERo8fIve601 (612 708 5601) in most of his postings.  The reason ammo prices are what they are is because people are paying scumbags like this guy who go to fleet farm, buy it at a reasonable price, then flip it on sites like Armslist and Gunbroker.  The ATF may consider this a criminal act since he is obviously making the purchases with the intent to resell for profit.  My recommendation is that you do not support these dirt bags and leave him holding the bag on ammo he can't shoot.  Good luck."

Our CQB Sling is an ambidextrous single point sling similar to our Urban Ops Sling but with the added benefit of heavy duty elastic cord added to each side of the weapon attachment point. The elastic creates tension that keeps the weapon secured close to the body when released with little or no slack in the sling to get caught up on equipment when you need to shoulder the weapon. Designed to be used with weapons equiped with sling mounts behind the receiver and will fit most factory or aftermarket loop style attachment points.

The Pistol Grip used in this build is a mil-spec Magpul MOE Plus Pistol Grip. The MOE+ Grip combines reinforced polymer body construction with comfortable, wrap-around rubber overmolding for maximum weapon control in adverse environments. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, this AR15/M16 drop-in design features a hard-polymer bottom edge to reduce the possibility of equipment snags or grip damage. The MOE+ Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. This is the most comfortable pistol grip that Magpul makes. Don't settle for a cheap plastic pistol grip, make sure it's a Magpul.

Magazine Specifications

The Magazine included in this build is a mil-spec Magpul PMag GEN M3. The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

It has 153,411 miles.
Comes with 2 sets of tires and rims. Glacier Grip 2 snow tires and Hankook Optimo H727 touring tires. Very good tread on both sets.
Options: power steering, windows, locks. AC, CD/radio, cruise control.
The Bad: The AC blend door that makes the air move from Defrost to Vent or Floor is not working. The check engine light came on when it stopped working and it is giving an Evap Code so I am assuming it is a vacuum problem related to the blend door as it is run by vacuum. It is leaking a very small amount of anti-freeze. It will need brakes this year.
Pictures of the undercarriage and engine here: http://s832.photobucket.com/user/rbsimba/library/2003%20Chevrolet%20Impala?sort=2&page=1 
Head Gaskets were done @ 115K when they started showing signs of leaking. Water pump and climate control head unit replaced @ 145K.
I have the hub caps but they need the plastic lug covers.
The car runs great. I moved to SC earlier this year and just can't take the car. It started immediately with no hesitation after sitting a while when I has in SC. It shifts smooth through all gears and still gets 24-27 MPG
Look close and you will see a dent around the drivers side door handle from a suicidal deer. I can't think of any problems other than the AC and light mentioned above.

This is the Romak 991 model. It comes with gorgeous laminate wood thumbhole stock and forearm furniture. It is used and has some signs of use; however it is in great shape for its age. I have owned this rifle for a number of years and have enjoyed it the entire time, never had one issue with it. It is extremely dependable, lightweight, and easy to clean. The iron sights are dead on up to about 200 yards, and maybe further. I don't have anywhere to shoot further than 200 yards. I recently purchased a Sig Sauer 556r and it's time to find this AK a new home, although I hate to see it go. This rifle comes with the following:

- (2) 75 round high capacity drum magazines (these things are both fun and expensive)
 - Sturdy adjustable sling
 - Bump fire enabled trigger attachment (allows you to easily use the semi-auto recoil of the rifle to shoot in ""full auto"". Attachment can easily be removed, if desired)
 - 135 rounds of 7.63x39 ammo
 - Hard carry case (holds both the rifle and both drum magazines)
 - I have a regular (30 round???) magazine for this rifle somewhere. If I can find it, it's included as well.
 - Plenty of additional ammo available for purchase if needed.

Price - $800 OBO for everything. This is a steal; you will not be disappointed with this rifle and the drum magazines. I am not in a hurry to sell so lowball offers will be discarded. Will not separate, package deal only. Must be at least 18 yrs. old and have a valid Ohio ID to purchase, NO EXCEPTIONS!!! FTFsales only, no shipping. CCW owners preferred (like myself). Willing to meet in, or around, the Akron area. 

Although I'm not looking for any trades, feel free to try me. Will only consider high end optics and higher end 9mm semi-auto pistols for trade. Cash either way to make the trade fair."

Gun comes with original holster and two original magazines. Matching numbers on receiver, slide. Correct serial number range for party leader (between 173000k-411000k). Late war finish on wartime ppk’s were between 359000k-429000k. Correct markings for party leader throughout. Hoheitsabzeichen on grips and holster. Test proofs (Nitro) in correct locations (side of slide below ejection port, right side of chamber, and right side of barrel near muzzle). This is an authentic and original party leader grip with the machined metal clip inside the grip. The holster is not D.R.G.M marked, but is original to the gun. The bore is near mint on this gun as well as all internal parts. Party leader PPK’s were presented to NAZI party leaders. Approximately 4,000 party leader PPK’s with party leader grips and without RZM markings were made from 1935-1945. These guns are also rare because many were destroyed or discarded to help conceal identities of NAZI party leaders. The late war phosphate blued guns with black grip are partucularly rare"

We do not waste time teaching subject matter you already know, and we do not accept just anyone willing to pay the fee on the firing line either. 

If someone accused us of placing high standards on our clients, we would have to enter a plea of guilt. We require every student to pass a handgun safety and proficiency test before the class starts to ensure the safety of all of our clients. 

Because all of our Concealed Carry-Handgun (CCH) instructors are Marine Veterans who possess Criminal Justice expertise, we know first-hand how best to prepare you for two of the worst fights you could be in; a gun fight in the Civ.Div. and the legal fight that will surely follow. 

Though we teach the state mandated materials, we spend the majority of time teaching and explaining what you must know about North Carolina concealed carry and use of force law. If what you are looking for is both a challenge of your handgun skills and an educational course that will teach you much more than the N.C. CCH curriculum requires, this is your course.

I have a used Kel-Tec PF 9 for sale or for trade. This has been my carry gun for about a year, but I have only put about 200 rounds through it. The gun works fine but I recently got a different gun for a birthday present. I do not really NEED to sell the gun so I am going to let it go for a fair price, or for a fair trade. Like I said, this is a carry gun, and as such, it has some cosmetic wear on it but nothing unreasonable and nothing that can not be removed with a moderate polish.

I am in Tuscaloosa and will only do a Face to Face transfer with cash. I request that you complete a bill of sale and have a valid CCW.
