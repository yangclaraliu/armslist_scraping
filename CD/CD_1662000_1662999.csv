Let me know what you have so we can deal. I can do 9mm and .40 on top of .357Sig or combo thereof, but for now I am mainly interested in .357Sig. Im not looking for anything special at this point and will ignore every single person who even hints towards price gouging. Keep in mind if you are not a licensed manufacturer then why would I buy your now used ammo by definition of manufacturer and seller return policies for over the top prices?

I have, aside from cash, an AR15 rear sight for a rail and a 75mm WWII trench art set I can throw in for trade or partial for the right deal. Pics of both upon request. I also like firearms so if you like what you see feel free to offer. If you are potentially interested in procuring an original model GSG5PK in .22 with extras let me know too.

All Brand New Items Included In Sale:

1- ESEE AH-1 Survival Arrowhead With Factory Box 
2- Handmade Three or Four Eyelet Kydex Sheath (Buyer's Choice)
3- Military Dogtag Chain and Key Chain
4- ESEE Survival Card
5- ESEE Sticker

These are brand new ESEE AH-1 arrowheads and have only been removed from the box to mold the kydex to each blade, attach the chain and polish the edge.
They are made from 1095 high carbon steel, which is the same steel used in many of the best knives in service today. They are also covered by ESEE's unconditional lifetime warranty, should you somehow break it. As a free service to all buyers, I will professionally hone your AH-1 to a mirror shine.

*Please note, these arrowheads will not in any way sharpen to a razor's edge without serious reprofiling of the blade. I have completely stripped the powder coating off one and reprofiled the blade and even then will not shave hair as well as most blades.*

The triangle shaped three eyelet or square shaped four eyelet sheaths are the available sheath shape options. I plan to have other colors available soon but at the present time only have black kydex.

There are several ways to carry your new ESEE arrowhead. The most common is like a necklace or ""neck knife"" with the provided dogtag chain threaded through one or more eyelets and worn around the neck. Other ways include as a keychain or simply dropping it in a pocket or purse secured in the sheath without the chain attached.

I have included a few pictures of another optional way to carry your new arrowhead. I have one lashed to the front of my personal Becker Necker. (The Becker knife, sheath, paracord etc. is not included in this sale.)  is a handy way to keep it close at hand but out of the way until it is needed and since both are secured to my belt, there is little chance of losing them.

I am asking $25 for Knoxville or surrounding area.  I'd be happy to ship if you will pay $2 for shipping with tracking. 

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

For those who say ""I don't like 357 sig, it's not a good round."" Here's a little food for thought for the misinformed. A 125gr 357 sig bullert travels at 1450fps with 584 ft/lbs of energy.

The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

Weatherby Vanguard Sub MOA (original model) with bipod, Nikon Buckmaster 6-18x40 BDC scope, ammo, reloading dies and brass.

Rifle: This is the original Sub MOA. It has the Bell and Carlson stock. The action is bedded and also maybe the 1st inch of the barell. Trigger is light and feels nice. It has Picatinny Rail and medium scope rings, although I think short rings would have been a better fit for the 40mm scope.

Scope: Nikon Buckmaster 6-18x40mm BDC. Works perfect, clear lenses. Dials nice and returns to zero. Comes with a couple sets of Nikon turret knobs. When I pulled this scope off the other gun, I did find a very minor scope ring mark on the bottom, maybe just a couple thousandths indentation. Scope has been installed but is just boresighted.

This is a single stroke pneumatic airgun similar to the Beeman P3, except in .22 instead of .177.  Adjustable sights.  Purchased from Pyramid Air about five years ago for about $225.00.  Included with pistol:  Doskocil lockable hard case, will fit any service size pistol - 3-1/2 cans of RWS Meisterkugeln match wadcutter pellets (approx. 1800 pellets) - mounted 1-1/2 power pistol scope.  Extremely accurate, wonderful trigger action.  Please note:  this is a great pistol for plinking, training, or target shooting, but it is NOT suitable for pest control, squirrel hunting, or the like.  The velocity is just not high enough.  If you are not familiar with single stroke pneumatic air guns, some of the pluses are:  quiet, no recoil or vibration whatsoever, no springs to wear out or take a set, consistent velocity, great accuracy.  They do not, however, work for very high velocity field use.  Excellent condition.  I can't send pictures, so don't ask.  Many suppliers are now selling a very low price spring BB gun that looks a lot like this one - they are NOT the same.  I'm retired, so I can meet you at your convenience so you can examine the pistol.

Cash sale, or will trade for .9mm practice ammo.  How much ammo depends on what kind you have.  NO reloads.  NO Tula or the various color ""Bears"" from our friends in the former Warsaw Pact.  I really don't like leaving the range covered with soot and smelling like a tire fire.  Various bullet weights (full boxes only) are okay, because I'm trying to determine a best load for a new pistol."

It is the exact same sight used by the Israeli military on all their weapons. I installed in on my AR and tried it a couple times at the range and decided to stick with iron sights. The only blemish on it is shown in the picture and is barely noticeable. I haven't had it long and so I still have the original box, manual, and the protective neoprene cover that comes with it. It has a built in quick release lever mount that allows you to remove the sight easily by hand from your picatinny rail and it returns to zero (I've tested it) when you reinstall it assuming you have the levers set tight and you put it on the same rail slot, which goes for any optic. This optic is well over $500 new and since it has barely even been used I am fairly firm on the price. It uses NO batteries. Instead it has fiber optics for illumination in daylight, and tritium for night illumination. Because of this it is always on and is guaranteed by Meprolight for 10 years. So for 9.5 more years from now."
