I'm selling off some of my stored ammo so I can buy a shotgun.  Please look at my other listings to see if you want to bundle anything together.

I live in the far west suburbs of Chicago, but am willing to meet up with buyers.  Will not ship ammo and buyer will need a FOID card to buy ammo.  Cash at time of transaction or PayPal before with 3% added to cover fees.

This is a great way to get lots of ammo all at once and not have to worry about sales tax, shipping, availiblity or limits on the amount you buy!"

functions flawlessly out of the box. a rare one because these are a hit or miss to have  to do further modifications to run the cheap birdshot.
it has a side scope rail mount. has a center point red / green dot scope. guess i left it turned on last time i went to the range needs new batterys.

i have everything from all the upgrades i purchased.
i got a hogue rubber grip. 
a tapco t-6 collapseable stock.
a ram trigger guard/pistol grip nut attachment.
trigger group fully moved forward and more modifications probley not listed.
i have so much stuff for this gun its not funny. its all pristine, original packageing ect. the box the gun came in has some minor damages but its still good.

i also have like 200 rounds of 12 gauge birdshot some slugs and some 00, and 000 buckshot along with other rounds. i think i even may have some tracers in a box put up im going to throw in. i have a gun safe for sale also on here for 200$ on a different add, but i modified a military ammo box. i sandblasted it, ready for a fresh NEW coat of military olive drab green. then i welded a hisp to the front of it to make it able to have a lock so the ammo box is lockable and ill include a lock for it that has a changeable combination. there is sling to shoulder or put the shotty on your back. ill also throw in not shown that holds shells and fits on the saiga 12 nicely. 

i have 2 original saiga -12 izmash factory 5 rounder mags jungle clipped together with something i made. doesnt look like shit its steel holding them together and you can load em up hang em off a pant leg pocket or cargo jean pockets and your good to go. it only came with one and i know how rare the factory ones are so i bought one off of someone on here who was only interested in the crappy drums.
i also have a promag 10 rounder and the box it came in.
i also have a 2 round sgm tactical mag so you can take it to a skeet shooting range nicely since most have rules that say you have to only have 2 rounds in the gun at a time then with that there will never be any kind of problems.


theres no bs here, 1200$ if your interested. i understand the economy right now and frankly i dont want any offers or sob storys i got my own dont you see im selling my most prized and only gun?

call me at 1REDACTED if you want to come check it out. i dont have the g2 trigger and stuff in it at this time because i just got it in the mail and did some more work to it, but i can put it in if its an issue so it will be fully fuctional when you leave and you can learn how to fully dissassemble it. if need be i may throw in a amazeing 100$ cleaning kit for all pistols, rifles and shotguns. this thing is clean as a toothepick and oiled up good. i got all kinds of cleaning stuff id throw in for an extra 50$ but its super dooper clean and my friend online has a saiga 12 and hes lost count of how many rounds been through his at 2000, so yea these will last forever if you care for them. max this gun has 2-300 rounds through it i got it 4 months ago or so and its pretty much brand new.

Hello and thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a very nice rare Springfield Armory M1A Super Match .308/7.62 sitting in a McMillan stock from the factory.

The Springfield Super Match M1A is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in 7.62 NATO or .308 Win. The M1A is a civilian version of the famous M14, which was once a standard issue US military rifle and known to be very accurate and reliable. Springfield offers eight different models of the M1A.

The Super Match is very similar to the National Match, but the difference is the Super has a Douglas air gauged heavy match barrel. Air gauged quality means designers pushed air through the barrel and measured the amount that escaped. The process determines the tolerance (or consistency of design) of the bore. It basically proves the barrel shoots accurately and keeps a tight seal on the propellant gases as they push the projectile out the bore. It also has a rear lugged receiver that increases available bedding area. With a larger bedding area, any wear is distributed to a wider body in turn less direct wear and increased lifespan.

The Super Match is gas-operated, so propellant gases are captured by a tube near the muzzle, which directs the gas into a valve on the bolt, and the gas pushes the bolt back so it can eject a spent casing and chamber a fresh round.

Its features include a national match two-stage trigger that sets off the action with a 4.5- to 5-pound pull. A match hooded rear sight aperture that’s like looking through a pinhole. It’s also adjustable for windage and elevation. It has a fixed blade front sight. The national match flash suppressor helps reduce muzzle climb, so the shooter can stay on target after every shot. The barrel rests on a glass bedding, which acts as an intermediary so when the barrel heats and swells it will press against the bedding instead of the stock. The Super Match is also available with either a matte black barrel or a stainless steel one."

I live in the far west suburbs of Chicago, but am willing to meet up with buyers.  Will not ship ammo and buyer will need a FOID card to buy ammo.  Cash at time of transaction or PayPal before with 3% added to cover fees.

This is a great way to get lots of ammo all at once and not have to worry about sales tax, shipping, availiblity or limits on the amount you buy!"

I pay $CASH$ for junk shotguns -- Mossberg, Remington, Winchester, Browning

The average price I've paid over the last month is $112 per shotgun.  That is more than the sellers would have gotten from the LGS or pawn shop.  These were all really beat up and at least 40 years old.

If you've got an old beat up shotgun, missing parts, or won't function, sell it to me for $CASH$.  I pay more if it works.  I especially like pump action shotguns.


Giving new life to old shotguns is just a hobby of mine, something to do when I'm watching TV.  I'm a shotgun enthusiast and amateur gunsmith, NOT a firearms dealer.  I only trade with nice people.

Don't even think about selling anything stolen.  I check every serial number.  A bill of sale will be completed.  Must have valid TN AR or MS ID.

I bought a WASR-10 for $338 out the door pre-Obama and never found them that cheap again, love my gains! As you should too. 
However the Anti-gouge crowd is not protesting firearms not being pre-Obama prices they are protesting the jackasses who go to the stores when they open, buy all the mags ammo etc... Effectively creating a shortage for those of us who work hours in which we can't wait at the stores all morning. Then when these same people re-sell what they bought out from under the rest of us just to make 100-200% profit, that's what the anti-gouge crowd means. No one expects to lose on an investment like me (WASR-10 for $338 pre bush; same gun $600 post bush :) ) but to go buy everything that is available at Obama prices and charge triple. Stragglers are willing to pay Obama prices, just not Post sandy hook scare fuck over your neighbor  prices.

I am the second owner and if this this gun probably has no more than 300 rounds through it.  The only reason I am selling is that I want to buy some other handguns for my collection.  Unlike many of the other blued guns you might see, there is no holster or other wear on the bluing (e.g. at the muzzle end of the barrel).  The action is really smooth, the gun has been meticulously maintained and it really shoots well.  The only defect is that there are six really tiny, pin-prick sized “nicks” on the cylinder, along with a turn ring (see photo where a couple show up).  There is no rust or other things to be concerned about.  I have two sets of grips; the one pictured on the gun is in Rosewood that I added not too long ago, the original grips are also included.  The grips that came with the gun have two nicks on the bottom by the back strap (see photo).  Gun will ship with a nice soft gun case as there are no box, papers, etc.  Sorry, not interested in trades!"

New Unique SA/DA Trigger System
The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.

LWRC M6A2 SPR Patriot Brown 5.56  for $3399
Spiral Fluted Barrel

Brand New! NO credit card fees!!


The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

We also have a Brand New! LWRC REPR 20"" Sniper Patriot Brown in stock for $SOLD

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed (not included), and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

It was produced by the Czechs on contract for Romania in 1940.  All of the metal parts have been reblued at postwar arsenal refurbishment with a deep bluing.  The royal Romanian receiver crest was scrubbed by the Communists after the war, but the outer edges of the original crest are just visible on the receiver ring. The stock serial number matches the receiver, and the bolt has been electropenciled by the arsenal during refurb to match.

It has a PW Arms import mark on the side of the barrel. The stock is a lighter replacement stock installed during the refurb and is in excellent condition, while the handguard is the darker original wood with the bumps and bruises of heavy use but no cracks. The bore is shiny, with some slight frosting. It is an excellent shooter. The original reblued extractor had issues, so it has been replaced with an ""in the white"" extractor that functions perfectly.

Also included is a similarly refurbed Vz. 24 bayonet with sheath. 

Note that the rifle will not include the reproduction Czech-style sling shown in these photos. 

Additional higher resolution photos are available by email.

An assault weapon ban is just not going to happen.

With that said, the people that are still re-selling ARs on here for 2X their value, is getting old. Which is perfectly legal, and fine with me. But don't come on here and try to justify what you're doing, especially when terms/phrases such as ""market value"", ""supply and demand"" are used, when it is obvious that the seller has never taken a general economics class. 
Using a little logic and common sense, I will walk way out on a limb and venture to say that the prices of these rifles will decrease quite a bit over the next 6-12 months, after the credit cards are maxed out and the rate of supply overtakes the rate of demand. 

I always thought it was a universally shared rule of thumb that after an individual buys a brand new firearm (assuming it is in new condition), the maximum price they should sell it for is the total price paid minus the sales tax. When a gun leaves the store, it is automatically worth less than what the dealer sold it for. The private seller is not a dealer running a business; a profit does not have to be made. Just sell the item for the price is it worth.

Anyway, to those of you trying to make profits off of this ""situation""...just post your overpriced gun, and leave it at that. Trying to justify what you're doing, making yourself feel better, less guilty, etc., is a losing battle and it makes you look pathetic."

If you look at Clawson’s large reference book on Page 325, Fig 10-25, you will see one from the same period. This one is approximately 285,000 earlier than the one pictured, which was produced in July, 1945 - near the end of production.
      The pistol is excellent overall with the original parkerized finish and correct parts and matching proof marks, to include the correct Scoville magazine. Mechanically, it is excellent and though I believe it was fired, it must have been meticulously cleaned its whole life. The bore on the correct HS barrel is clean and free of any pitting; with good rifling. The correct grips are in excellent condition. There are some areas of light high point wear on the slide. That and a few other small marks make this about (in my opinion) about 96%. This is a beautiful example of a late WWII Remington M 1911 A1 pistol.  Price is $1600.
     The Ammunition pictured can also be purchased at a price we both agree on by contacting me. By law, it cannot be shipped with the pistol, and will require additional money to ship it to you.  There are 4 boxes of Remington .45ACP lot no. 5773, with a year stamp of RA 61.  Additionally, there are 2 boxes of lot no. 5555, with a year stamp of RA 52.  1 box is full; the other has 27 rounds in it.  There is also 1 box of vintage “Western super-match 180gr. 45 AWCP ammunition” if interested.  All looks perfectly usable."
