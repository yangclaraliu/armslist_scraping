used for the last  5 or 6 years. It has a Simmons Pro-Diamond 4x 
scope on it. It is in excellent condition with very little wear.
It has probably had no more than 100 rounds shot through it.
For someone looking for a slug gun, this is a real good one.
Asking $550.

This is marked Interarms, Alexandria Virginia, Zastava Yugoslavia, and if my research is right, its a Mauser Model 98 Action... 

I will not give this rifle away; they dont pop up much on Gunbroker with this caliber and barrel, but last one I saw with bids was over $600. I'll keep it for less than that. That was with no ammo and reloading stuff with that one..."

The rifle has a new op rod spring, bullet guide, clip latch spring, and comes with the original and an adjustable gas plug (so you can shoot any ammo you like, not just M2 ball)

Also comes with 22 enbloc clips.

The parkerizing on the rifle is good, and the furniture looks better than most with original stocks. The finish on the gas tube shows some wear (again, common. Stainless doesnt hold park well.)

This Garand feeds, fires, and ejects perfectly. The muzzle and throat erosion both are minimal, and the rifle is quite accurate. A really fun rifle!

It is in great shape but the Allen bolt that you use to mount it to any picatinny rail is a little stripped can still be tightened but could easily be replaced since it completely detaches from the sight. Aside from that the sight is in great shape. The red dot is crisp without any of the flair you see in cheap knock offs. The windage adjustments work just fine and the protective plastic cover that slides over the sight turns the red dot off. It originally cost a little over 400 after tax. Feel free to bring your pistol to mount it and see how it feels, no shooting unfortunately I live in the suburb. Price is negotiable but please no low ballers.

PS. A note for all price gouging a-holes on the site. Congratulations on letting the Obama administration win. The mindless frenzy that has skyrocketed prices has officially regulated firearms in the United States by pricing the populace out of the privilege of being a gun owner. Regulation without legislation all because of you! If you honestly think that prices will ever normalize after this, then you are blinded by ignorance. Have gas prices dropped after oil spills or wars...Nope! So thank you and I hope greed comes back to bite you in the a$$!"

I will not answer messages offering less. You can do the math and see this is retail price and feel this is about what I paid new at gander mtn for most of this.  That seems to be cheaper than most people are selling just a couple hundred rounds of 5.56 for.  I know I paid about 11 a box for the federal and 7 for the steel 5,56 so this seems pretty cheap for all of it."

The serial number puts this guns manufacture at March of 1890. Great old rifle with a lot of history. Still has a shiny bore and would make a great addition to any collection. This is not a wall hanger, it is still very functional.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention 

I don't have the time to ship. If I did I would already have sold all of my guns. I lose too much money taking off work to get to a post office during business hours. Sorry, I just like to get back my original investment and I can't do that if I've lost that money elsewhere."

Comes with a factory scope mount, factory speed loader, and a 2 rails (bottom one for forward grip, top rail for flashlight/laser). About $180 worth of factory accessories!

Probably 1500 rounds or so put through this, which isn't much considering that you are normally loading up 50 rounds at a time. First and only owner of this nice gun, and has been babied and well kept over the years I have owned it.

Get one of these while you still can! It's been specifically named in the new assault weapons ban, and you can bet if there is ""any"" sort of ban, this will be on it as the smallest magazine it can accept is 50 rounds! These things were hard enough to find before all this gun control nonsense started, so buy it before they become impossible to get!

Price if FIRM at $850, this is probably the cheapest Calico 9mm you will find on Armslist. CASH ONLY, I'm not a bank so I can't take cards and I don't want to take a check hoping it won't bounce. Buyer agrees to meet at Buds Gun Shop in Lexington, KY to do a proper FFL transfer of the firearm into your name.

bushmaster

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist. Shipped complete with 30-round magazine, a safety and operations manual, and a carrying sling.

Direct from Magpul:
----
We are proud to announce that within a matter of days we will be going live with a new program. Due to a bill currently moving through the Colorado legislature, there is the possibility that Colorado residents' ability to purchase standard capacity magazines will soon be infringed. Before that happens, and Magpul is forced to leave the state in order to keep to our principles, we will be doing our best to get standard capacity PMAGs into the hands of any Colorado resident that wants them.

 Verified Colorado residents will be able to purchase up to ten (10) standard capacity AR/M4 magazines directly from Magpul, and will be given immediate flat-rate $5 shipping, bypassing our current order queue.

 Our customers outside of Colorado, please know that our PMAG production will continue at an ever-increasing rate until we do relocate, shipments to our distributors in other states will continue, and that we do not expect relocation to significantly impact PMAG production. We are also aware that Colorado is not the only state with existing or pending magazine capacity restrictions; we are working on programs for other affected states as well.

 Full details and instructions will be announced when we are able to go live; please watch here for the coming announcement.

First, try splashing cold water in your face so you can become more alert and clear thinking because after the wave of current stock is depleted $0.50 ammo will be a fond memory on the grand scale of things. Thanks to numerous unrelated factors, a Perfect Storm has come upon us to make $1 per round ammo the new normal. Which brings me to recommend #2. Do all that you can to grab all the 60 cent ammo you can. When they're gone, they're gone. This is not my opinion. Last week numerous stories came out of the ammo industry that will shape the future for us all. So good luck to all as we buy and sell the last lot of ""cheap"" ammo.

Direct from Magpul:
----
We are proud to announce that within a matter of days we will be going live with a new program. Due to a bill currently moving through the Colorado legislature, there is the possibility that Colorado residents' ability to purchase standard capacity magazines will soon be infringed. Before that happens, and Magpul is forced to leave the state in order to keep to our principles, we will be doing our best to get standard capacity PMAGs into the hands of any Colorado resident that wants them.

 Verified Colorado residents will be able to purchase up to ten (10) standard capacity AR/M4 magazines directly from Magpul, and will be given immediate flat-rate $5 shipping, bypassing our current order queue.

 Our customers outside of Colorado, please know that our PMAG production will continue at an ever-increasing rate until we do relocate, shipments to our distributors in other states will continue, and that we do not expect relocation to significantly impact PMAG production. We are also aware that Colorado is not the only state with existing or pending magazine capacity restrictions; we are working on programs for other affected states as well.

 Full details and instructions will be announced when we are able to go live; please watch here for the coming announcement.

Me: A guy who knows the real value of the NIB gear I'm seeing start to spring up here.  Using round figures, most of what I see is at least twice the retail value.  Any ""carbon"" or ""plastic"" AR-15 would retail for around $700.  Those were the CHEAP guns.

I'm going to guess that a lot of these guns need to be sold long before any interested party really needs to buy them.  Credit card bills, mortgages and property taxes are coming due.  I hope those guns are warm and tasty, because you may wind up eating them or living in them.

And trying to drive up your price with ""make an offer,"" that's what gunbroker is for.  But you're too scared to face the fact that you're on the downside of this panic, and your investments are depreciating quickly.  You don't want to risk an auction because you know it's possible you won't break even.  If you manage to recover your principle you should consider yourself fortunate."

Winchester discontinued production of this ammo years ago because it was deemed as too destructive for civilian use. If memory serves me this ammo was used in a few very unfortunate mass shootings in the 90's to devastating effect. So Winchester decided to discontinue rather than face the rather large amount of controversy at the time. Today this ammo is very collectible but could also serve well in your 1911 or similar pistol. Many have said this was the best ""one shot stopping"" ammo every made. Ammo has been stored properly and boxes are in very good but not perfect condition.
