This is a complete BCM upper, straight from BCM's factory, no mods. Upper is brand new and has never been mated to a lower. Not looking to part out - selling as complete upper.

Shipping is $30 to nearby states where this upper (and its features - threaded barrel, flash hider, bayonet lug) is legal. Might be a couple of bucks more to ship farther west. Payment options for shipping: DISCREET Paypal (no mention of anything gun related), either marked using 'Gift' option or tack on 3% to cover paypal's fee, or USPS money order.

For those not familiar with the different barrel profiles, the lightweight barrel reduces a bit of muzzle-end weight (where you want to reduce weight - i.e., the part of the rifle farthest from your body) relative to the government profile barrel. From the chamber to the FSB, the barrel is identical to the government profile barrel. All the weight savings is at the muzzle end.

The streaks and unevenness you see is just the preservative oil that is slathered on at the factory.

 Includes swag - hat, posters, DVD's, stickers, lube."

I am interested in selling/trading my Springfield Armory (S.A.) 1911 with several accessories. I have a Glaco ""Miami Classic II Shoulder System"" holster (~$190.00) that fits the 1911, and holds two magazines on the other strap. I also have a Wilson Combat 8-round magazine, and a Kimber 7 round magazine (in addition to the two factory 7 round magazines) to include. There are also the (2) factory belt strap holsters which came with the gun (in the case from factory) from S.A. 

I have taken care of this gun since I have purchased it. S.A. released this model in 2011. I have cleaned it after every shooting session, never dropped, damaged, or broken any piece of the gun. The parkerized finish has some blemishes, mostly from the holsters. 

Ideally, I would like to sell/trade everything together. This is my only 1911, and I would have no other uses for the holsters/magazines. Everything is negotiable, but please don't waste my time. I know what everything is worth, I know what I have paid for everything, and I expect a respectable, reasonable offer.

Upon coming to an agreement of sale or trade, all sales/trades will be documented correctly, and comply with all state, local, and federal law."

From the Sig Sauer website:

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220® Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.

I bought this online for $349.00 plus shipping. After receiving it I found it was too big for the application I was wanting to do. The online company does not give refunds and I didn't know that. Only online in-store credits. I don't do business with companies that don't give refunds for this very reason. So instead of returning for the credit I will sell this to regain something close to what I gave for it. 

I will sell this for $325 obo. 

please text me. email will be slow response because I don't check it constantly.

CCI is known in the shooting sports industry for having reliable ammunition that delivers exceptional performance every time the trigger is pulled. It is this reliability that makes this the ammunition of choice for the Swamp People, Troy and Jacob Landry, when they are taking huge gators in the Louisiana Bayou. 

CCI 36 Grain Mini-Mag ammunition is one of the most popular 22 Long Rifle rounds ever produced. It is the perfect load for shooters and hunters looking for a great round for a day at the range or an afternoon chasing small game and varmints. One of the great features of this ammunition is the clean-burning powder. This powder provides optimum velocity while maintaining consistent chamber pressures while keeping the firearm clean from powder residue helping to ensure the rifle will function in even the harshest conditions. The copper plated hollow point bullet offers reliable feeding and great penetration. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

The gun is in good condition with no functional issues.  The finish on the gun is good, with some wear in a few places.  The grips on the gun are complete, with no cracks, but do show some nicks and wear.  However, these would be very easy to source and replace. 

I have replaced the factory sights with Meprolight night sights.  I will also include a Wolff recoil spring tune kit (14.5lb, 16lb, and 18lb springs, with the 18lb spring currently installed). I also have a CZ factory spring replacement set, which includes brand new springs to replace every spring on the gun.  Finally, I have 3 12 round magazines for this pistol.  Magazines for this pistol run $40-$50 each.

Model #50455. asking, $300. Bought this back in 09 for my wife to have for self defense when work called me out of town. Shot a grand total of 6 slugs, tucked it in the corner next to the bed, it's been there ever since. Now we have kids,and it's time to sell. It's ease of use and lightweight make it an ideal home defense shotgun an entire family can learn and protect themselves with. Holds 6 shells, recoil was surprisingly easy for my wife to handle, and most importantly she wasn't terrified of it. Mossberg has the list price set at $447.00. I paid $369.99, $397 with tax. Asking $300 considering it's in excellent shape with only 6 rounds through the chamber.  Most people overlook the .410 gauge for home defense, yet it was in my wife's comfort zone despite her being intimidated by most firearms. Local pickup only, must have ID so I can make a bill of sale receipt, cash n carry. thanks"

Norinco SKS sportster 7.62 X 39 works flawlessly. Great rifling , I recently did a total breakdown and cleaned the entire gun. Bolt and carrier shine like brand new. 
Fitted into a very comfortable and ""evil looking"" ATI stock, ergonomic pistol grip feels perfect, folding stock (shoots in folded position) adjustable as well for a perfect fit for any person. Rails on bottom for foregrip and a rail was installed on the top of the hand hard as well for optics. 
I've been thinking of selling this for 2 months and have finally decided to just do it. Comes with 1 steel 30 round magazine. 
This SKS is ready to throw on your optic of choice and a foregrip for ultimate tactical use. All I can say is go out and shoot a cinder block with an AR15 and see a nice hole through the first wall of the block, shoot one with the SKS and there is only small pieces of that cinderblock scattered as the 7.62x39 round makes it EXPLODE. It's nice to have that firepower and able to send 30 down range in just a few seconds. 
I am fully aware that in the 1990s and even as recent as a few years back an SKS could be found for around $300. 
I've seen this same gun at a Pawn shop on N ave for $700, another on consignment at a local gun store for $650. 
This ATI stock is $100 item alone and is hard to find now days, any military semi auto weapon is worth more and is harder to find now . I'm not a scum bag gouger like you see all the time now however I know how much time and money it would take to replace this rifle and $575 is a fair deal. I'm throwing in a pack of stripper clips to so you can show your libtard neighbor the difference between a clip and a magazine :) 
I want cash, if you have saiga 12 drums , stick mags over 10 round capacity, revolver I'd concider it but dead presidents are the best trade.  I know a local store with dozens of mags for this gun if your worried about finding more. 
If you live in Denver area I will meet near vail."

From Vintage Audio Review:
Pioneer CS-99A built in the 1970’s is a 5 way speaker with 6 speakers featuring a 15 inch woofer, a pair of 4 inch midranges, a 3 1/2 inch metal horn, and a pair of 1 1/2 inch tweeters. The woofer and the midranges have high quality cambric surrounds, so they won't rot or deteriorate the way foam surrounds do. 
These speakers employ Pioneer's ""FB"" pulp material in the woofer and midrange drivers. These pressed cones are made of specialized pulp material that is stiffer and has better damping than standard paper cones. The result is audibly different with solid and deep base that sounds natural and not boomy. Midrange presence is outstanding with the characteristics of the ""FB"" cone material.
""The CS-99A combines a powerful 100 watt handling ability with the finest in components & internal engineering for a new dimension in fidelity, purity, & realism. The result is compromised lifelike stereo reproduction throughout a wide 25 to 22,000 Hz frequency response range. The CS-99A's were considered to be Pioneer's most brilliant 5 way speakers of their time."" They sound like a wall of thunder. The tone is amazing! Each speaker measures 11 by 16 1/2 by 25 inches. Weight around 55 pounds each."

I am selling my Browning Silver Stalker 12ga shotgun.  This is a great gun as all Browning made guns are!  It has a 28"" barrel and a 3 1/2"" chamber.  It has a composite stock and foregrip with a Dura-Touch Armor coating and a matte black finish, both which protect it from the environment making it a durable gun especially for the avid duck hunter.  Semi-humback design.  With the gun comes 3 invector plus choke tubes (full, improved cyl., modified).

For more specs see: http://www.browning.com/products/catalog/firearms/detail.asp?fid=020B&cid=011&tid=351

I absolutely love the gun and hate to sell it but it must go! Gun is in good condition and only used for one duck season and shooting a few clays.

Price with chokes is $875!

I found a few mentions about it and just copied them here: ""The first significant batch of practice ammunition to reach our shores was some Swedish 6.5x55. This is a strange looking round. The bullet--no--the projectile is a small, hollow, copper cup weighing only 6 grains and barely long enough to project beyond the neck of the case. Powered by 8.3-grains of flake powder, this goofy looking, flying ashtray averages 2,707 fps in my M40 Swedish Mauser with its 24"" barrel. The case doesn't obdurate very well and comes out smoky, but those wee copper cups regularly slam into 1 1/2 at 25 yards. The brass, by the way, is stunning. In fact, tens-of-thousands of rounds of this load were broken down by reloaders for the value of the brass alone.  It's a hoot to shoot and there's absolutely no recoil.

The P2X Fury uses a high-efficiency, virtually failure-proof LED to deliver 15 or 500 lumens of perfectly focused light. The 15-lumen level is excellent for general work at close-to-medium distances and extends battery life. The 500-lumen level qualifies the Fury as a pocket-sized searchlight. The high-strength polymer micro-textured reflector delivers a smooth, wide beam with a brighter central area and generous peripheral light. The Fury is activated with a click-type tailcap switch for momentary-on low, constant-on low, off, then two seconds for high. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is hard anodized to mil-spec for extreme resistance to scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, and is o-ring sealed to be weatherproof.

Don't overpay price gougers, vampires, hoarders, and price criminals without visiting this site first. You'll be glad you did. Here's a small exert from the site:

ARMSLIST and all other gun marketplaces are community run for the most part. As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

AR-15: $600-$1300 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
AK-47: $400-$900
SKS:$300-$500
SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
AR-10: $1000-1500
Glock: $400-600
10/22: $229
ACR: $2000
1911: $600-1100
9mm ammo: $0.25/round is on the higher end
223/5.56: $0.35/round
.308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $1/round (on high side)
.22: $0.05/round is high

Like New Rossi Matched Pair Combo Rifle / Shotgun.  This gun is super cool the barrels swap out in minutes and change from a 20 Gauge single shot shotgun to a 270 Winchester single shot rifle.  The case says full size but it seems to be smaller than a normal full size rifle / Shotgun so it would be perfect for a teenager or woman.  I have only fired 8 rounds of the 270 Winchester and 0 rounds through the 20 Gauge.  This gun is mint condition.  Included in the sale is a box of 25 20 gauge rounds and remaining 12 rounds of 270 Winchester from the original box of 20.  Call with questions cash only no credit cards as I am a private party."
