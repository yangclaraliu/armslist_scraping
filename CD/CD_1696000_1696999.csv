The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
New Adjustable Sigths Kit
Other PX4 Accessories 
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. 
9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction)."

Sights / Optics: The carbine is mounted with a front dovetail mounted blade with brass bead, and rear adjustable flip down notch with white diamond.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are varnished hardwood with rubber butt pad; there are a few depressions in the stock’s surface but nothing distracting.

Finish Originality: Factory original

Bore Condition: The bore is Bright and shiny and the rifling is deep and sharp. There is no erosion.

Overall Condition: This carbine retains about 98 of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows some storage and handling wear. There is a small loss on the painted barrel band.

Our Assessment: The perfect carbine to match your .44 magnum revolver, small light and agile this carbine packs a wallop.

This one was made in 1976 as it has the special stamping celebrating America’s 200th year. With the popularity of the new carbines in 9mm and 45 acp these days, this one trumps them all, and it’s a Ruger!"

 This pistol is absolutely FLAWLESS.The only way you will ever find one in better condition is to go back in time and hand pick it from the assembly bench.
 With that being said,i have a gen 2 g17.Two factory 17 rd magazines,standard sights,factory Tupperware,cleaning brush,mag loader.
 The old gentleman that I got this from stated that this was an L.E. gun but may have been un-issued.
 He had only run 50 rds through it and as far as barrel wear is concerned it coincides with that amount.
 I can not stress to you the absolute incredible condition of this gun.There is not a single scratch on it,any handling wear on the frame or any holster wear AT ALL.
 You truly have to see this to believe it.
 I am not placing a cash price as I have no idea what to ask for it.
 I am entertaining trades of all sorts but am asking that handgun trades be of a larger caliber than 9mm.Any other trades considered.
 For the right trade I will include 250 rounds of federal 9mm white box
For those insisting on a cash price 600.00 with 250 rds of ammo I think is fair"

We are a law firm with over 50 years of experience, and avid outdoors men.  One thing to note, now that July 1 has passed, we can also help you set up a separate trust (revocable-so you have the power to change) for non-Class III items, which should not be mixed in with a Class III trust, an ATF quirk.  Since the transfer issue is now upon us, it is a good idea to keep all of ones guns, magazines, and other devices in an entity that allows the trustee to change wit the times.  Imagine if you had a class III item, but did not have a trust allowing for the transfer of the gun and extended magazine?  One woudl be left with a gun, a can and a one shot (dangerous) piece.  these are the things we think about for you, as we work with shops, ranges, wholesalers, retailers, and as want to ensure that what little rights we have left, are protected even if the law changes.  Please contact me to set an appointment, the consultation is free.  Ensure that when you apply for a Class III item, that the underlying trust, which alleviates the need for the Chief Law Enforcement Officer to approve, that the trust is not some form off the internet that works in TX, but not Colorado.  We specialize in firearm laws and issues, which is very different than the, geez, I hope this works approach.  Please call today, REDACTED.  One final note, the simple trust is $600, does not include the $200 stamp, however if you require or request a complicated trust or other estate planning (such as creating a separate trust for non-Class III items, the prices will change).  We have worked with individuals, businesses, ranges, instructors, and are avid firearm enthusiasts.  Unlike many of the law firms trying to break into this area, we have read the ATF manual, visited with the ATF, and done our best to make sure anyone who inspects will give us the seal of approval."

Below is a brief description of the rifle (borrowed from Ask.com). From what I have researched, there are very limited numbers of this rifle (I will not quote the numbers as I can not guarantee their accuracy).
This package comes with 4 mags and the sling. The rifle has around 350 rounds through it and is a blast to shoot! Also, I can say that it is incredibly accurate.
Please do your research on the gun, and you will see the price is a good one. I am selling to go with a smaller caliber AR15. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. 
Thank you for looking.

History:

The M16K was produced by La France beginning in 1982, subsequently a highly modified variation of this gun was developed which was designated the M16K-45 which was chambered for the .45 ACP round and utilizing 20 or 30 round Thompson submachine gun magazines. Except for the magazines this firearm was entirely manufactured by La France and not just a modification of an existing firearm as was case with the original M16K. 

The later M-16K .45 variant (this gun for sale) was produced using proprietary upper and lower receivers designed by Timothy F. La France specifically for the .45 ACP round. Both are forgings. The M-16K 45 was produced in both a fully automatic Title II version with a short barrel and a semi-automatic version fitted with a 16"" barrel to allow it to be sold as a Title I firearm (this gun). The barrels are compensated to reduce muzzle climb in fully automatic fire. Production delays resulted in the semi-automatic version not being ready for civilian sales until after enactment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 1994, which impaired sales. When the Federal Assault Weapons Ban lapsed, M-16K 45s again became legal for sale."

New Prairie Storm™ features the FLITECONTROL® wad and FLITESTOPPER® (FS) lead. It uses the same technology that's proven outstanding on waterfowl-but is specially designed for the needs of pheasant hunters. Never before have loads produced such full, consistent patterns. A mix of Premium® copper-plated lead (70%) and nickel-plated FS lead (30%) gives these loads better down-range performance. This translates to fewer lost birds. As part of the on box royalty program, every box purchased will give money directly to Pheasants Forever®. With this new specialized ammunition, hunters know they'll get edge-to-edge pattern consistency. And excellent retained velocity and energy means increased lethality.

The scope was sighted in for 50 yards, still has front and rear iron sight on the gun as well. I do not recall any feed/jamming issues. Only issue for me was I shoot lefty and the hot brass ejected onto my forearm which was kind of a bummer when wearing a t shirt, hence I don't shoot it a lot in the summer."

just a little history, but please note the polygonal rifling
The Česká zbrojovka Vz. 82 is a compact semi-automatic pistol made for the Czechoslovakian military. ""Vz"" is an abbreviation for ""vzor"", which translates to ""model."" A civilian export version is called the CZ 83.
Manufactured by the Czechoslovak firm Česká zbrojovka the vz. 82 replaced the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 52 pistol in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous. The vz. 82 was the first service pistol to feature both these features. The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore. This replaces the traditional lands and grooves rifling design with a rounded, smooth polygonal pattern which has a more ""hills and valleys"" appearance."

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

The PMAG 30 Gen M3 incorporates additional external improvements to the magazine catch and bolt catch notch areas that have expanded its firearm compatibility to include more than the AR-15 platform alone. It is also fully functional with the FN SCAR-16, the British SA-80, and the HK416/IAR/M27 platforms. The drop-free characteristics of the PMAG were also improved to ensure compatibility with a wider range of magazine wells, including those with tighter tolerances than mil-spec. Made in the USA.

I am wanting to sell these pistols but are entirely open to trades as well. Please take a look and make me an offer. No offer is a bad offer I may ask for more or counter offer if not fair/reasonable.

I have a Browning High Power that is beautiful, it has been refinished and is in great shape! I am open to offers, pictures will be below and if you want more just ask me, I am also open to trades and am willing to combine multiple firearms for the right trade or do +/- cash. Comes with (1) mag. This gun is all steel except for the grips. 9mm.

I also have a BNIB FNS. 40, Have not shot it, it is a two-tone. Comes with Plastic box as well as (3) mags and interchangeable backstrap. This is a pretty gun. .40

Another one is the Mossad, it is in near perfect condition but is of course used, it has a star of David on it from the manufacturer. This gun has a nickel finish and shines, has solid weight to it. This gun is all steel. 9mm

Last, but not least we have a Smith & Wesson 915, this gun is a good fit in the hand, the only issue I personally have with this gun is that the mag release takes a little bit of getting used to. It takes more strength to push it out, not sure if this is because it needs a little cleaning or what. 9mm

I have some rifles that I may be willing to trade as well. No pictures at this time for those. These would only be if the right trade came along.

Its brand new ammo that just arrived at my door last week. 

I've used this Federal HST Ammo in my Glock 19 for a while and its my favorite ammo (still keeping a few boxes for my Glock!) and figured I'd try to run it through my Kahr CM9 as well. Turns out its pretty good in my Kahr, but I had a couple hard to clear nose dives and I'm thinking the feeding issue would be resolved with a smaller and shorter round. After reading online it seems the Speer Gold Dot get almost all positive reviews in regards to the sub compact Kahrs, so that's what I'm looking for.

I'm hoping to trade my ammo for yours. Please don't contact me about buying my ammo outright (if I buy the ammo I need and have a box of HST to sell I'll update or re post the ad). If you have the ammo I want and will sell outright feel free to contact me."

I have a Browning High Power that is beautiful, it has been refinished and is in great shape! I am open to offers, pictures will be below and if you want more just ask me, I am also open to trades and am willing to combine multiple firearms for the right trade or do +/- cash. Comes with (1) mag. This gun is all steel except for the grips. 9mm.

I also have a BNIB FNS. 40, Have not shot it, it is a two-tone. Comes with Plastic box as well as (3) mags and interchangeable backstrap. This is a pretty gun. .40

Another one is the Mossad, it is in near perfect condition but is of course used, it has a star of David on it from the manufacturer. This gun has a nickel finish and shines, has solid weight to it. This gun is all steel. 9mm

Last, but not least we have a Smith & Wesson 915, this gun is a good fit in the hand, the only issue I personally have with this gun is that the mag release takes a little bit of getting used to. It takes more strength to push it out, not sure if this is because it needs a little cleaning or what. 9mm

I have some rifles that I may be willing to trade as well. No pictures at this time for those. These would only be if the right trade came along."

This is the model that Clint Eastwood used in his Dirty Harry movies.  I purchased the gun new in 1984 and used it for hunting for several years then put it away.  I just took it out of the safe a couple of months ago and shot six round through it, it is still a great gun.  My interests have changed over the years and I now shoot 1911's.
The gun is in excellent condition, there is no muzzle wear form the holster since I seldom put it in.  It has the typical light scratch on the cylinder but it is very faint.  It has the original target grips, target trigger and hammer and the orange insert in the front sight.  If I had to guess, this gun has only  had about 2 or 3 boxes of shells through it in its life.

I have for sale a Thompson TM1C Semi-Auto (45 ACP). I've had it about 2.5 years, I'm the second owner.

What is included:

1. Thompson Case
2. Thompson TM1C
3. Thompson Auto-loader
4. Thompson Sling (new, never installed on the rifle, came with the original gun purchase)
5. 1 10rd Magazine (bought new from Auto-Ordnance)
6. 17 30rd Magazines (no, thats not a typo, 17 are included)
7. Manual
8. Bolt Locking device
9. 2 custom made bolt chargers (shown on pic DSC_3328a) These were made by a gunsmith for me. In the pic mentioned I have one of the customs installed, and the silver extension shown just above the installed one can be used on the original. Either setup runs fine, I just wanted something a little longer.

Bore is super nice, no issues. All magazines work. They are a mix of NIB from AO (11) and the older full auto that I've converted. I had 8 of the mags keracoated for long term storage and protection, they work great. The little white tags on the mags are my control #s, I will remove upon selling the weapon.

The stocks have been refinished with Birchwood casey true oil finish (I was tired of getting gun oil on them), so had finished to maintain them.

The gun is very accurate out to 50 yards (I haven't shot it further then that distance). Sights are very accurate.

I'm asking $2,200 for the whole kit plus shipping.   Serious inquiries only, please.

IF I SHIP IT TO YOU: The shipment will be in 2 pieces. One shipment will be the gun in the case, the second shipment just the mags. I will ship the mags straight to you, the gun goes to an FFL. I assume shipping will run $75. Anything over that and I will pay, If under you get it back. I will not pay for the FFL transfer fee.

Local Sale/FTF, my max distance to drive from home is 50 miles (I live in NOVA). Also, I will ask for a VA drivers license, either a VA voter registration card, or CCW.  Active Duty Military with orders OK.  A simple Bill of Sale (BOS) will also be completed assuming you pass the above checks.  If you won't do a BOS (on a local sale), you ain't buying this weapon, sorry."

This is a really neat package- and easy! With two barrels, you can cover all your bases-- hunting, sport and home defense. One shotgun, two barrels. With a simple twist of the front cap, you can change out barrels. Pull the shotgun out of the closet for a Saturday dove hunt- just drop in the long barrel. When you get home, change the barrel and load it up with some home protection rounds and you''re prepared for any situation that may endanger your family

Since 1919, O.F. Mossberg & Sons has produced weapons that all levels of gun users – including novices – continue to operate today. In fact, Mossberg was the first long-gun manufacturer in the U.S. to achieve ISO 9001 certification, which sets the standard on manufacturing and quality control procedures. The Mossberg 500, which was first produced in 1961, continues to be one of its most popular shotguns for sale on the market, and it’s currently used by the United States and allied armed forces, as well as by police and civilian gun owners. The Mossberg 500 also makes for an excellent field weapon, and is often used as a trap and skeet gun.
