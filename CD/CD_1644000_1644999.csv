I think it's an awesome gun but I'd rather have a couple more modern guns that I could get some use out of.  
I don't know tons about this gun, I have shot it and it shoots well, everything is original as far as I can tell and the numbers all match, I've taken it apart to check and oil it and nothing is broken or missing.  As you can see there is no strawing left, maybe it was reblued a long time ago, I don't know, but it definitely wasn't anytime recently, I've had it for several years too.  
From the research I've done it's not a super common gun and hopefully somebody will be wanting it for a collection and get more use out of it than me.  I'm sorry I'm not a better photographer, I did the best I could, but the pictures never seem to do the gun justice.  I have lots more pictures of this gun, just email me and I'll send them all to you if you are interested.  I can also take specific ones if there is something you want to see.
There's a bit more than 100 rounds of ammo too, which also isn't super easy to find.  It will come with the gun as I will have no need for it once the pistol is gone.  I will dump them all out and give you an exact count of the rounds for serious buyers.

Also I'm willing to travel to other places around Oregon for serious buyers, I could make a weekend trip out of it to Portland or Bend or somewhere!

Asking for $1200 or trades!

I'm willing to ship if somebody is really interested, just email me and we can figure something out!"

One photo shows the smooth feed ramp. There are very few signs of wear on this gun, I won’t say it looks brand new but you just might.  This item comes with one Colt 8 round magazine, one Kimber 8 round magazine, and the 8 round magazine that comes with the gun.

This item is also listed on the gunbroker site using the following link, so if there be any doubts about the legitimacy of this posting, please refer to my listing on that site and check my record. My handle is Revelator 227. http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=342906540

Because this listing appears on two sites, the wording in this description may be geared for one or the other site. I am only looking to deal locally. In the state of Missouri, I need nothing more than a bill of sale to transfer a gun to a buyer. I am also willing to drop this pistol off at your local BRICK AND MORTAR gun dealer in the St. Louis or St. Charles area if you prefer to go the FFL transfer route. I will not ship this pistol. 

There is an additional charge of $10.00 dollars if I have to create the bill of sale paperwork for this transfer. You can avoid that charge if you come up with your own and it includes the sufficient information. Lastly, I take cash only.

As a side note, I listed a Ruger LCP last Thursday and the armslist community flagged the listing as a SCAM. My first thoughts were that local dealers were trying to block my post because my price was very competitive. I was also told by the person that eventually did buy the pistol that it may have had to do with the fact that I do tend to write a lot and include too many details. When I hear of all the horror stories on the news about sites like Craigslist and what not, I tend to say things and arrange the situation in such a way that I can avoid that. However, I do realize the setbacks to that, so I will not make this listing so wordy where it shouldn’t be, but I do want to say that if my listing was flagged because people were trying to prevent me from competing, you who are responsible JUST LOST ANOTHER ONE because at the end of the day, I did make the deal, it was a very smooth transaction, I got my money and he got a good gun cheaper than he would have paid you for.

This handgun features a grip safety similar to the 1911, and is known for being a very safe as well as practical firearm. Instead of having the grip safety at the palm of your hands it is at your finger tips which in my opinion is an awesome feature.

This model has been used by police and military forces all over the world, the gun in specific has issue branding of the Military Police of the Bundeswehr, both on the lower and upper of the gun.

It has only had about 300 (about half of a 525 round brick) rounds through it.  These are very scarce right now, much like the tactical Knoxx stock it is in.  It comes with all the original equipment (Laminated stock, 10 round mag, weaver rail, bi-pod, soft case, box, manual, etc...).  As you can see I put it in a new stock making it lighter and shorter overall length.  I also added an extra long picatinny rail in place of the original rail.  Internally, i added in a volquartsen recoil buffer, volquartsen extractor, and volquartsen target hammer.  The target hammer made the trigger really nice.  I will also include all of the original parts.
I decided I wanted to sell it and turn it into a bolt .22lr, so all this accumulation is my loss and your gain.  I do have a few bx-25 magazines that I am selling independently.  If you want one or two I will hold one for you to buy if you buy this pistol.  Yes, legally this is a pistol not a short barreled rifle."

To start off with I LOVE GLOCKS!! This gun was purchased in January of this year. I have only taken it to the range a few times and did love how it shot. But last week I purchased his bigger brother the Glock 21 and decided their is no need to have both of them. This gun was purchased at 111 Gun Shop here in louisville for $585 +tax($35.10) for a Total of $620.10 After I purchased this gun I thought it would be neat to have a 9 round mag that fits flush with the gun for if I ever decided to carry. It took forever to find one but I was able to get one shipped and I ordered an extra 10 round mag also. They were each $30ish dollars +tax. So the gun is basically brand new in box, shot only a couple times at the range, comes with everything that was in the box on the day I purchased it and comes with a total of 4 Magazines (3 ten rounders, and 1 nine rounder). I am not trying to gouge the price and all that crazy mess. I don't even know if this gun is hard to find or not. I have about $700 in this gun with the extra mags and I know that guns don't really go down in value especially a Glock. I was trying to decide what a fair deal would be so I thought...Gun was $585 new, knock off $20, the extra mags were $30 a piece. I'm gonna lose on taxes and shipping, blah blah. So $625 is what I decided sounds like a fair deal for this gun with 4 mags. I can honestly say that I won't be sad if this doesn't sell. I'm gonna stick pretty firm to this deal.Thanks for your time.

Has been well cleaned (ask me for pictures of my other weapons and you will see the OCD I have haha!). It has only been taken to the range at Palmetto State Armory twice. I’ve put approx 4 mags of ammo through (approx 50 rounds) while I’ve owned it. 

The XDm features: grip safety (1911 style; I prefer this to the Glock angled grip), loaded chamber indicator, striker status indicator (NOT on a Glock), MATCH GRADE barrel, Major Grasp serrations (front and back of slide), minimal reset trigger (one of the smoothest I’ve felt on a 45) and fixed dovetail white 3-dot sights. 

Pistol package includes: (2) 13-round magazines, molded holster and mag pouch, mag loading tool, cable lock, heavy-duty plastic case, and owner's manual.

The question most people like to ask; Why are you selling it?
The answer: I am selling it because I have 3 handguns already. I recently purchased an XD service model and a nice FN FNX. I would love to keep all three but I would rather save the money up for something else later or a new competition model XDm 45 (the 5.5” ported/compensated version). Really could use the money which is the main reason why I am not taking any trades.

Pricing: This package sells for right around 689.99. Fairly hard to find in the 4.5"". 

I do have more ammo for extra money. I have approx. 260 more rounds of brass casing .45 ACP."

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

I do not know how to fix this issue thus it is for sale.  I did fire a few rounds through the gun by loading manually and it functioned perfectly.  These rifles, in working order, are selling in the $850-$1000 range on gun broker and this may go there unless I receive a reasonable offer.

The purpose of the mount is to create a higher rail mount for optics so that you can use the optic over the AR-15 front tower sight. The rail mount is also hollow on the inside so you can still use your sights without removing the scope. This is a must-have for anyone looking to mount optics without getting rid of your standard front sight. I just love shooting off of irons only too much, otherwise I'd keep it!

This is an made of all steel – No Plastic or alum.Trigger guard on this one! 
Has a sort of sand blasted finish would be the best way to describe it to me. You can use all the Remington 870 Accessories on it also! This is a wonderful Firearm for Home defense or the squad Car! The only Difference you’ll notice when you take your first look at it is the way the receiver swipes up just a little in the back.
This is to me a great but subtle improvement on the 870-it lets you quickly get a sight picture on your target when seconds count! I myself for a defense shotgun you can’t beat this one-even with a regular Remington 870……
