In anticipation of finding the Sig Lady, I ordered the AIWB holster from TT Gunleather.  It is made entirely of natural gray elephant hide & specifically molded for use with the p238.  The gun was inserted to ensure fitment (which is perfect) never carried & is being included with the weapon, since I have no use for it without the .380 (not separating)

I have $225 invested in the holster (including shipment)

I do not intend to lose money in this deal - if I can recoup my investment fully, then I will gladly sell, otherwise it is not bothersome to keep it in my safe indefinitely.

My listed asking price of $950 is FIRM & payable in the form of a USPS money order.  To be clear $950 will buy the NEW Sig Sauer (with box & all original contents), the TT Gunleather holster & covers the insured shipment from my FFL to your FFL.

I appreciate your time & consideration - if you are ready.to.buy, contact me through Armslist, if your intention is to negotiate price .. please save yourself the time & effort, if you can buy this somewhere for less money - good for you."

millitary red-dot optic.
U.S. Army’s M68CCO  

The CompM4s is the latest version of the U.S. Army’s M68CCO (Close Combat Optic), continuing an Aimpoint legacy since 1997.
Complete and ready to mount
The CompM4s sight is shipped complete with a QRP2 mount and standard AR15 spacer. These sights also come equipped with a killFlash® anti-reflection device and MILSPEC rubber lens covers.
Integral mount
The CompM4s sight features an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring, and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of weapon systems.
Designed for 3rd generation night vision technology
The CompM4s sight can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility.
The performance of CompM4s sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.
The clearest, brightest image possible
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).
Ready for use around the clock
With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4s sight is ready for round the clock use.

Unique features of the CompM4s
Low battery compartment

Unique features of the CompM4s and CompM4
Compatible with every generation of NVD
ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery
Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery
7 NVD settings and 9 daylight settings
QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation and lower the risk of snagging on other gear
Mount base is keyed into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil
Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring required.
500,000 hours of use on NVD setting
2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
Matches perfectly with Aimpoint® 3XMag
Unequalled light transmission
Front lens opening is threaded for addition of killFlash® anti-reflective device

Also comes with Magpul MOE forward grip, detachable iron sights, and 500 rds of ammo. 200 round nose, 200 hp, and 100 quiet rounds. The quiet rounds are powderless, and does not enough power to cycle the action. They do not jam the rifle, but you pretty much have to work it like a bolt action. However, they are about as loud as a BB gun, and I've been able to fire them in my back yard without any complaints from neighbors. 

The gun itself is pretty cool, and functions kinda like an AR. It has an ambidextrous magazine release, you can lock the bolt to the rear to make sure the chamber is empty, and the bolt catches when your magazine is empty, which is something most .22's do not do."

The M40 Field Protective mask features 3 voicemitters, one on either the right or left side, and one in front. A voicecom adapter may be placed over the front voicemitter to amplify the user's voice. The mask can be adjusted in the field to accept the filtering canister on either side, so that a weapon may be shouldered. Right-handed shooters will normally locate the canister on the left side of the mask and vice-versa.

The C2 canister on the M40 mask can protect the user from up to 15 nerve, choking, and blister agent attacks, and two blood agent attacks.

The M40 comes with a drinking system that allows the user to drink water when donning the mask for long periods of time in a chemically contaminated environment. In order to use the drinking system the user must also have suitably equipped canteen lids or an adapter for other containers.

The U.S. ARMY M40A1 Field Protective Gas Mask has been in use by the military of the United States since 1992 to protect from field concentrations of chemical and biological agents, along with radiological fallout particles. It still remains in U.S. Military service today.

The M40 series was reworked with a better nose cup and a new Butyl protective hood that covers the head and shoulder area. The new hood required a rubber ""second skin"" that covered the entire mask's face piece This new design offered a higher level of protection against penetrating NBC agents and also made it easier to don the protective hood.

--Canister with this item is opened, but again, was only used to conduct sealing test. It may be used as is, or replaced with other canisters."

Prices are obo, but please be reasonable. I will also accept trades, just let me know what you have.

Myotron Checkmate personal defense ""Stun Gun"". This was given to me, but I have a CCW, so I would never use it. The battery is about 50%, so it should be replaced. Rated at 25,000 pulse watts, which is designed to ""scramble"" somebody's brain; ""FBI preferred"". I personally laughed at the commercial they had, but this would be great for someone who doesn't like guns. MSRP around $200 (5 easy payments of $40 on TV). ---$50

NcStar Red dot tactical reflex sight. This came with my Masterpiece Arms gun, but I prefer the iron sights. This was mounted on several guns, but never fired with. ---$30

CDM Gear MOD-C. This is an awesome mount for the Mossberg 500, I got it a while back, but now I have a Surefire on my mind. This may fit a Remington 870, but I do not remember. Should fit any 1"" flashlight. ---$30

Pressure pad for flashlight. Interior thread size of about 23mm. Beyond that, I really don't know/ can't remember. Bring your flashlight to test it. ---$10

Muzzle Break for Ruger 10/22. This slips on over the factory sight, and tightens down with a screw at the bottom. --- $20

Barrel mounted Quad rail. I got this for my 10/22, but never really used it. I put it on, disliked it, and took it off. Good for a bipod or flashlight/ laser. ---$10

Polymer rail for MOE handguard. I bought three of these, but I am only using the one, so I have 2 to sell. I put them on, but didn't really like the added rails. ---$10 (each)

UTG quick disconnect Picatinny rail rings. I got these for a scope, but they were too wide. I got a compact scope that these just won't work for. ""Law enforcement"", but UTG. Fits 30mm scopes, with a 60mm objective diameter. Medium Profile.  ---$30

Thermold 20 round AR15 magazine. I bought this, and just plain don't want it. It was one of those impulse things. Most ammo comes 20 rounds in a box, so a 20 round magazine solves the OCD at the range. I inserted this into the rifle, but never loaded it or fired it. So pretty much new. Price is firm, it's what I paid on sale. ---$15

Bianchi Professional 100 IWB Holster Size 12. I used this for my SR9, but do not carry it anymore. Fits full size Glock 17,22, and other guns. Still in good shape, thick leather, not flimsy like old thin leather holsters. IWB is the best way to conceal IMO. ---$30

With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard"

Its great quality ammo from Freedom Munitions. Its remanufactured ammunition but they do a professional job and inspect and run the ammo through the SAME machines that new ammo runs through. Here is there description from the website:

Freedom Munitions ""Like-New"" manufacturing process provides like-new ammo performance.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS inspects all cartridge cases for defects. The Scharch Range Master machines are fully automated and cases are checked for any debris and pressure tested for any splits or cracks. Primers are removed, flash holes are cleared, and primer pockets are reamed to accept new primers.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS then washes cases in an acid wash specially designed to remove all remaining burnt powder from the flash hole and interior of the case which tumbling doesn't remove. Then cases are tumbled in a dryer for a factory look and finish.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS roll sizes all cases on our own designed machines to meet S.A.A.M.I.specification. This method is the industry standard for commercial sizing, insuring the case wall is sized down to the rim which insures new component performance.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS then loads these processed components on the same fiber optic-controlled Ammo Load machines as our premium new ammo. These are the same machines used by some of the largest manufacturers in the industry. These machines assure S.A.A.M.I. specifications for priming depth, pressure and overall cartridge length.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS ""Like-New"" manufacturing process with the new projectile, powder and primer assures factory ammo performance that discriminating shooters expect.

I reside in Palm City, FL.  Firearms safety, knowing my backdrop & where my bullet is going is a pet peeve of mine & I absolutely cannot stand being around people that are careless with firearms & do not respect them. 
 I wouldn't call myself a firearms ""collector"" but I am always looking to add to my firearm collection whenever financially possible.  

  I am NOT into bump-firing or anything trying to simulate full auto, I couldn't care any less about that kind of shooting.  I am into taking my time & being as accurate as I can be...doesn't matter if I'm shooting one of my many 22 rifles, an Ak, Sks or a 7mm mag bolt action...I treat them all the same. 
  I am not a fan of public ranges, don't like being around bunch of people...specially people that act like they don't have a clue what to do when their semi-auto ftf's, fte's, jams...etc...  plus I want to work on extending my shooting range past 200yds with a few of my rifles & I don't know of a range locally that has that capability.
    I am looking for someone that has property out in the country & would be willing to allow me the privilege to shoot on the property for a few hours a couple days per month.  It would always be on Saturday or Sunday as I work full time Mon-Fri. 

  I am willing to pay cash, preferably a one time lump sum payment per year.  I would be more than willing to hunt & do my part to rid your land of wild problem hogs if needed...and yes, I will hunt them for food, not just kill them for sport. If I have enough meat in the freezer, I will give it to someone who can use it.  

  You will Not have a problem with me bringing a bunch of people with me to shoot or hunt. I don't really have friends that are into shooting. I would like to be able bring my father with me sometimes as he enjoys shooting as well, although not to the same degree or as often as I do though. I would like to bring my wife with me occasionally, & my younger brother as well when he occasionally comes in to town. 
  I want to eventually buy some land out in the country to raise my growing family on & be able to shoot on but that is at least a few years down the road at minimum, So for now I am trying to find someone willing to allow me the privilege of the above mentioned proposition.  I would prefer the land be within 1hr or so of Stuart/Palm City. 

  If you are interested in or know someone that might be interested in my proposition, please email me thru armslist & we can go from there.

It comes with original blue S&W box, book, warranty card, and even the brown paper packing material.  This is a rare find.
This historic gun was manufactured in 1967, 46 years-ago...and is far superior to anything being produced today.  S&W says that it is rated for +P ammo.  It has the diamond wood grips.  I believe that this gun has never been fired except at the factory.
All serial numbers match including the one on the inside of the right grip.
This is a six-shot double action revolver, with adjustable open sights, built on the medium-size ""K"" frame.  
If you live outside of the state of Utah, I will ship it to your local FFL dealer for the actual cost or transfer and shipping.
If you live in the state of Utah, I will consider a trade for a S&W model 60 (38 or 357) or a model 37 (38) or a model 66 with a 2 1/2"" barrel and round grips, plus some cash.  The model 60, 27 or 66 do not have to be in perfect condition...I am a shooter not a collector.

It is the takedown model, and being a no. 42 it is the last model of exposed hammer. This one has all of the safeties that Marlin added over the years (hammer, firing pin, slide position and inertia) My research shows that the 42 was made from 1922 to 1934. This has been completely disassembled, cleaned, inspected and reassembled. It is smooth. This model, like the 97 Winchester can be slam-fired by design. That means you can hold the trigger down, and when the action closes it will fire. The takedown process is a bit stiff, with the magazine tube being fairly tight in the receiver. The action is very smooth however and when I took it out it fed smoothly and functioned as expected. It has a Pachmayr White line recoil absorbing butt plate on it.

This is as close to factory new as it gets. Comes with what many consider necessary upgrades... comes with Pearce +0 finger extensions installed and Wolff steel full length guide rod with full power springs. Most factory 10mm is downloaded top FBI specs but these springs allow you to fire full power 10mm ammo! Also comes with the original factory springs if you want to fire regular factory loads, Glock box, magazine loader, and factory paperwork. I also have a right hand Don Hume JIT Slide holster I used with this gun (holster is labelled for a XD40 but fit the G29 well).
