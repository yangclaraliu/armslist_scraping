A key feature of the pistol is its modular design. The main module of the P250 is an internal stainless steel frame fire control unit which consist of the integrated fire control group (trigger, hammer and all necessary linkage and springs), ambidextrous slide release (one on each side of the pistol), ejector and four slide rails. This steel receiver unit is used in every P250 grip module, top end, and chambering combination and is inserted into the grip frame module and held in place by the axis pin of the disassembly lever. The firearm's serial number is on the fire control unit instead of the grip module. The fire control unit allows the operator to interchange differently-sized slide assembly or top end modules and polymer grip frame modules and trigger shoes and (limited) chambering conversions to adapt the gun to the individual user and address different needs.

The P250 was designed to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous slide catch lever and user reversible magazine catch. All other operating controls are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm can be field stripped with no tools."

The Adaptable Carbine Stock-Light (ACS-L) is a slimmed-down, lightweight, version of Magpul’s popular ACS stock. The ACS-L provides extra maneuverability by eliminating the ACS’s side storage compartments, while retaining the wide, sloping top for a secure, comfortable cheekweld. Also retained is the storage compartment in the tail of the stock, and the friction locking system that prevents unwanted wobble after extending the stock. Includes a reversible socket for QD pushbutton sling swivels and a 1"" sling loop molded in the toe of the stock. The .3"" thick rubber recoil pad can be replaced by Magpul Tactical Recoil Pads (sold separately). Models available to fit Mil-Spec (1.14"" O.D.) or Commercial (1.17"" O.D.) carbine buffer tubes.

1 The ban is not happening

3 all these parts are becoming available again ordered PSA lower last week $119 got it this week, bownells also is getting at parts again.
4 If you go to any local gun shop you will see a lot more guns for sale

It's a cool gun, and in near perfect shape (the only thing I didn't like about it is the loading port was pretty stiff feeling, and there may be some light scratches noticeable around the opening there from trying to feed the ammo into the tube.  I assume that over time, the spring would have softened up and made loading easier)

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

PWS Direct Impingement Carrier for the AR15 is based on the bolt carrier used in the MK1 and MK2 piston driven rifles.
 A combination of a reduced overall diameter coupled with oversized skid pads create less points of contact and thus less friction inside of your carrier.
 The heavier weight of the carrier aids in a longer dwell time, allowing barrel pressure to be greatly reduced and promoting easier extraction.
 Made from tool steel and then Isonite treated, this carrier will be the one you want for all of your direct impingement rifles.

CARRIER ONLY.

965,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1479965,For Sale/Trade:  Lee pro 1000 Plus many extras brand new!!,"Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 2,"Listed On: Thursday, April 18, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Where to start..

I have a lee pro 1000 progressive reloading press.. I bought it last month with hopes of reloading 9mm.. It was out of stock every where but I happened to find one in stock for 45 long colt.. So I ordered it for 45LC.  I then went about ordering all of the parts to turn it into 9mm..  I had to buy:

9mm shell plate
Lee small primer attachment
Lee 9 mm dies( I have the 4 die set with factory crimp die.. As well as an extra powder through sizing die)
I also had to order small pistol case feed tube kit.
Also have the case collator 

I also ordered a .380 shell plate but could not find dies for it..
I have a digital grain scale to double check your work.
I have a bullet puller
I have a case tumbler and a full box of media
I have a hornady lock n load powder drop(haven't even taken out of the box..)
Several hundred 9mm and .380 once fired brass
1.5 pounds of bullseye powder..
Digital calipers to check length

I'm sure I'm missing stuff here..  It's all brand new.  I set up the press but have not used it..  I'm not sure if reloading is something I want to do.

This set is so complete, all you have to do is buy the dies to change it over.. I already ordered all the parts to let it take small and large cases and primers.

I spent hundreds of dollars and countless hours scouring the Internet to find these things in stock as they are sold out everywhere..  All you need to reload 9 mm is primers and bullets as I have powder too.  The same goes for 45 LC.

For those that don't know.. A progressive press like this does all the actions required to reload with one pull of the press..:it automatically feeds the cases into the machine; it deprimes, sizes it; then it reprimes, flares it to accept the bullet, measures and adds the powder; you place the bullet on the case and it seats the bullet, crimps it then ejects the completed round..  It does all of this with ONE pull of the handle.  I have read that after you get the hang of it it is common place to reload 250-300 bullets per hour.

I am interested in trading my entire set up.. Basically everything you need to start reloading minus primers and bullets.. For firearms.  I am most interested in assault style rifles such as sks's ak's ar15's..  I'm also interested in pistols..  Make me am offer.  Cash can be added or subtracted both ends to make it all work."
