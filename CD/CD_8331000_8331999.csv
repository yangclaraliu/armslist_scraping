Out of all of the AR style rifles I have used, this one has been my favorite. I have to let it go due to a family situation though. This model is “like new” and I haven’t even had a chance to put an optic on it yet.
 
At the range, using iron sights, slapping steel at 100 yards is easy. At 300 yards, hitting steel with the help of a spotter is not a challenge. All this rifle needs is a red-dot for close quarters shooting or a nice scope for long range fun.
 
Package comes with Rifle, Partriot AR Case, and one 30 round Magpul PMAG

This handgun is my pride and joy. I personally installed the Cajun Gun Works upgrades to get the SA pull down to 2 lbs, 7 oz., and eliminated all trigger creep. All critical internals have been polished. It shoots like a dream, and feels great in the hand. Recoil is almost non-existent, thanks to the all-steel frame. The handgun is in like-new condition, with only about 400 rounds through it – barely broken in!
Unfortunately, my aging eyes (I’m 67 years old) aren’t what they used to be, and I am switching all of my pistols over to red dot sights. I could have had the slide of the SP-01 milled and drilled to accept a red dot, but couldn’t bring myself to do it. It just wouldn’t look right. I have all receipts.

It has a wood stock. I also have a Mossburg 500 12 GA pump with choke on the tip. Both shot great. I am looking to trade. You may not think it's worth it but someone may. I am looking for a 16' trailer. If it needs some work I am cool with that. I must be able to pull it back to Cadiz, KY. Or I would trade for a 28' to 33' camper frame that I can turn into a trailer. Again I must be able to pull it home. If you have something like these let me know. I would also take cash. $450 for both. I will not separate them. Must meet face to face. Cash only and I will do a bill of sale."
