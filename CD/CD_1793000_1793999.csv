Yes, yes, yes, after the apocalypse we’ll be able to “score” anything we want. Sure, right. Until then, we have to get what we can, and not everyone has a Mercedes budget when it comes to stocking the armory. What to do? How to stock up, without busting the budget? Mossberg to the rescue. Yes, Mossberg has jumped into the fray, offering us suitable tools for surviving the coming zombie apocalypse. (Or the end of the Mayan calendar, or whatever.)

All of these have the Mossberg ZMB logo on them, plus the all-synthetic furniture means that you can sanitize them with boiling water, bleach or other disinfectants. No need to worry about potential warpage from treating wooden furniture that way, nor residual infection from sloppily-cleaned wood stocks and such. The amount of 12 gauge and .30-30 ammo manufactured each year in the US is enough to sink a small island, so just about anywhere you search you’ll be able to find some. 

The stock is synthetic, the forearm a tri-rail so you can mount a light, and the capacity: 8 shots of 12-gauge goodness. The Mossberg 500 chassis has been around since before zombies, and you can find parts anywhere, in case you break something dealing with an outbreak. The safety is on top, suitable for you left-handed survivors, and operation is easy. Even a university English professor can learn to pump a shotgun

Brand new with tags, just received them in the mail today. Ordered 2, one for me and my wife. One is OD green and the other one is Black. They are really nice but we changed our minds when they were already being mailed to us and was too late to cancel. We decided to get something a bit smaller (like the 5.11 covrt backpacks). It would be a hassle to try and ship them back to return them, plus we'd have to pay to restock them because there is nothing wrong with them we just changed our minds. If you don't know about these back packs please look them up they are one of the best you can get. Will sell for $140 each FIRM and must be able to meet me in VB area. Please don't e-mail me and ask if I will take lower than $140, these are brand new with tags and we are already taking a price cut because we changed our minds so our loss is your gain, thank you.

It's also possible that they live in Richmond yet work in Ohio and their employer provides the cell phone.

An enhanced version of the USP, the tactical is designed for users who need the features found on the Mark 23, but in a smaller and more affordable pistol. The USP tactical pistol approaches the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with rubber o-ring and drift adjustable target type sights to the USP. 

The USP Tactical incorporates a fully adjustable rear sight, a higher-profile front sight (as to be visible above the suppressor), an extended threaded barrel and O-ring, a match grade trigger, and an adjustable trigger stop. Sound suppressors designed for the USP Tactical are available from Brügger & Thomet, Knight's Armament, Yankee Hill Machine (YHM) and SilencerCO. A unique feature of the USP Tactical is that the barrel is left-hand threaded (counter-clockwise to tighten), which makes the pistol incompatible with suppressors designed for the MK23 Mod 0.

369,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1793369,For Sale:  MOSSBERG 464 LEVER ACTION 30-30 RIFLE (MSRP: $535),"Richardson, Dallas, Texas",$ 410,"Listed On: Saturday, July 27, 2013",Rifles,Mossberg                                                                                ,30-30 Winchester                                                                                ,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"MARKED DOWN FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND!

THIS RIFLE IS SOLD WITH A LIFETIME REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE!


Manufactured in Mossberg's ISO 9001 certified Eagle Pass, Texas manufacturing facility, the gun comes out of its carton cleanly  finished and without functional or aesthetic defects. In overall heft and appearance it is much less bulky than any current production Marlin Model 336 variant and certainly much better made than my New Haven built, rough cut 2x4ish Winchester Model 94 Deluxe.

The Model 464™ 41020 package includes the firearm, a gun lock, instruction manual and two pamphlets regarding safe use and safe storage of a firearm. There is also a hammer extension for use when a scope is mounted on the rifle. The Model 464™ utilizes a symmetrical two piece base; Warne's two piece Weaver type base number is M827/827.

Marlin utilizes a 1:10"" twist for their 30-30 WCF products, the Mossberg checked 1:10"". Current Winchester production employs a 1:12"" twist. Even the longest 170 grain bullet intended for the .30-30 WCF should stabilize with anything tighter than a 13"" twist, so the 1:10"" should work well and, at 30-30 WCF velocity, there would be no over rotation speed issues.

The trigger pull is crisp and it is a very short pull. The lever needs to be fully closed before the sear will release, which requires no more than a normal hold.

The walnut stock has a durable satin finish. Both oil and smokeless powder cleaning solvent wiped right off without leaving a shine. The barrel and magazine tube appear to have a #240 grit finish, the receiver is polished, but not to a high gloss.

Very closely following the traditional Winchester Model 94 in appearance, the Model 464™ is an angle eject type. 

If you miss the classic lever action rifle in its fast handling 30-30 WCF form, stop whining and check out Mossberg's Model 464™, first hand, and form your own opinions.

The product's quality is first class, the derivative design is excellent and the consistency of fit and finish is that of a much more expensive firearm. Best of all, the Mossberg Model 464™ is an accurate and reliable hunting rifle at a more than fair price.

This firearm has a moderately-low round count (estimating under 1,000).  It has been my carry weapon and does show slight wear and has a few minor imperfections but remains very photogenic.  It is accurate, easy to shoot, has flawless function, and is buttery smooth.  I have cleaned and oiled this weapon after each use and periodically between uses.

I made a slight modification to the frame by removing the second raised finger hump (separator??) from the grip and then stippled that same area.  This was done to facilitate my larger hands and has no impact on functionality or frame integrity.  It has a nice fit for both smaller and larger hands.

I just purchased a Glock 22 for my primary and need to adopt this one out to a good home."

They are 40 Grain and loaded with V-Max bullets.  Here is the details on them...  

Fiocchi Extrema Ammunition is loaded with premium bullets from popular component manufacturers, a broad spectrum of cartridges are offered for competition shooters, hunters and law enforcement. Produced with precision cases and reliable Fiocchi primers, this ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer-primed, reloadable brass cases.

Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and helps to stabilize the bullet in flight. It also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles.

I am asking $160 for all 350 rounds which is a great price considering Gander Mountain stocks them for $40 plus tax.  Check out MidwayUSA(Which is where I purchased them for $22.49 per 50 rds) I am located in Cary, which is right outside of Crystal Lake in the northwest suburbs.  You must have a FOID card.

Pistol package includes: (2) 13-round magazines, molded holster and mag pouch, mag loading tool, cable lock, heavy-duty plastic case, and owner's manual.

The question most people like to ask; Why are you selling it?
The answer: I am selling it because I have 3 handguns already. I recently purchased an XD service model and a nice FN FNX. I would love to keep all three but I would rather save the money up for something else later or a new competition model XDm 45 (the 5.5” ported/compensated version). Really could use the money which is the main reason why I am not taking any trades.

Pricing: This package sells for right around 689.99. Fairly hard to find in the 4.5"". 

I do have more ammo for extra money. I have approx. 260 more rounds of brass casing .45 ACP."

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

There is a total of 330 rounds as follows: 

(1) Box of 50 rounds PPU Brand - this ammo is brass case, boxer primed and is non-corrosive. It's also fully reloadable.

(4) Boxes of 70 rounds surplus. As I recall this is Polish made ammo, but I'm not 100% certain since I don't read Polish. I will tell you that this ammo is loaded in bright brass cases and is 100% sure to fire. I had a full case and this is what is left. I shot the rest through my CZ and never had a failure to fire. Of course it is made with a corrosive primer so simply clean your gun after firing. I used to run 2 or 3 patches of warm soapy water through the bore followed by 1 patch to dry. Then 1 patch with gun oil and my CZ's bore always looked like the day it was made. This surplus ammo is also loaded noticeably hotter than more recent production ammo. However it's not a problem because the guns that fire this ammo were designed to handle it like the CZ 52, TT33, & the PPSH.

Price is $160 - FTF picked up in Brandon. I can't ship because my local UPS store won't accept ammo anymore and the UPS hub is just too far away. You must be at least 21 and able to prove it to buy this ammo."

I have a good reputation for owning & building sweet AR's and other firearms for my own use... I spare no expense. When I decide to sell off the occasional weapon, the folks on this site have that acquired Weapons from me have been quite satisfied... I take my time and assemble things correctly... I seek professional assistance if I have even the most minor doubt about what I am building. WITH THAT SAID, it is always wise to have any firearm that you are not familiar with checked out by a qualified gunsmith and obtain an operations manual prior to operating any firearm.

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

The RANGE FINDER reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is an excellent mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

THis is a large frame pistol, if you have big hands this is the one for you.  SHoots and looks great with no problems.
Here's what Glock says about it:

The GLOCK 20, in 10mm Auto, provides nothing short of massive firepower especially suited for hunting. The use of GLOCK hi-tech polymer considerably reduces felt recoil. With muzzle energy of 550 ft/lbs, and a magazine capacity of 15 rounds, this 10mm is your reliable companion on every hunt. The G20 also provides a safe and accurate finishing shot, even when hunting big game.

Rifle is in great condition.  Shoots wonderfully.  Absolutely beautiful rifle, it always gets lots of oohs and aaahs at the range.

This rifle is based on the AK-47 design, but it uses the stronger RPK receiver, resulting in less receiver flex and therefore more intrinsic accuracy.  It also features gorgeous walnut wood that is head and shoulders above the recycled driftwood you find on a lot of AK's.   This wood puts a lot of Western rifles to shame.

Comes with a hammer-forged, chrome lined barrel, a push-button mag release, and a push-button safety (see pics).

Comes with a mounted and zeroed 2-7x Nikon Prostaff scope and 9 mags:

2 x 5 round mags
4 x 10 round mags
1 x 20 round mag adapted from M1A magazine
2 x 20 round mags.  These last two are from a third party vendor and the fit is a bit tight (they probably need some work with a dremel tool), but I'll throw them in anyway.

If you've not at least heard of this gun, you don't know guns!  The phrase ""bang for your buck"" was probably invented to describe this fine weapon!  If firing this pistol doesn't get our blood pumping, nothing will!

The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing.

After 25 years of being accessorized, customized and re-imagined in countless movies, television shows and video games, the Desert Eagle® Pistol has emerged as a pop-culture icon. You can customize your Desert Eagle Pistol with a variety of impressive finishes to add your own distinctive twist to this timeless firearm. All models feature a full Picatinny rail on the barrel from the end of the chamber to right behind the front sight and standard ambidextrous safeties.
