I have for sale one like new MARS optic. I do not have the case, or any of the accessories. However, this optic was only on my rifle long enough to zero, then was removed and stowed in a hard case. I am selling because I have an ACOG now, and have no need for the MARS. As you can see from the pictures, the optic has no scratches, scuffs, dings, etc. The lenses are clear, with no scratches, and both the laser and the reticle work. The reticle is a .3 MOA, it will only cover up about an inch of a target at a hundred yards, which is much better than an aimpoint or eotech. Theses optics are Israeli made, are are designed to be very tough and durable. I have more pictures, but they exceed the maximum upload allowed. I will send them to you if you want.

     Up for sale or trade is a Brazilian Mauser reworked by the Springfield Armory. I must admit, I really don't know very much about Mausers, and even less about this one. It seems that any similar ones I can find from the Springfield armory seem to be in .308. I AM NOT SURE OF THE CALIBER OF THIS RIFLE....JUST ADDING INFORMATION I HAVE FOUND. It came to me without the bolt and will be sold that way. If you happen to know more about this rifle than I do feel free to PM some info, or have a bolt for sale that will fit, I may be interested in purchasing it for this rifle. It does have a LYMAN sight on the receiver as seen in the picture. The receiver looks to be chrome or nickel finished and it looks like Springfield painted the barrel black...almost like a powder coated finish. I realize that a price is necessary as a starting point, but I really am just looking the best cash offer or trade I can get. I guess we can start at a million dollars and just say I'm very negotiable. Looking for cash, silver, gold, other firearms or who knows...try me, I can always say no."

I am the original owner and bought the bow 6 months ago. I have used it maybe 5-6 times practicing in my backyard. I didnt even have time to make it tho the woods this year and i dont have time to hunt anymore so i have no need for this bow. It comes fully setup and RTH with 60-70 pounds pull and 27 inch draw. ACCYS include:
1) Axion 3 pin sights
2)QAD Drop Away rest pro hunter
3)NAP Apache Stabilizer
4)Mathews Tactical Quiver
5)G5 Peep and D Loop
6)Tru fire release
7)5 Gold tip arrows
8)I chose to put all green harmonic dampners and stoppers on it for a sick look!
Please Be aware that the Z7 Extreme Tactical was only made one year and is very rare, especially in this condition. These bows are more expensive than the lost camo or any other model. I paid $1500 for this setup 6 months ago and the bow is in the exact same condition. Please research this bow if you're unfamiliar with it. This is not your typical $600 bow from dicks or gander! 

I will also throw in my $120 Delta Mckenzie 3D deer target if you want!!

Also added the nice low profile soft quad rail hand guards that clip onto the rail for comfort, have a few extras new in bag still. Super sweet rifle setup, very well kept and nothing but quality upgrades made to the rifle and I still have any original parts that may have been removed in place of upgrades so you can change it back if that suits your needs. 
Dont want to sell, but to pay the taxman, it has to go. Never fired, single owner, purchased new.
asking 1600, taking a loss considering all the extras. Two of the mags are still new in the plastic. Serious buyers, Please Dont be afraid to make an offer.

Never fired or handled. Cash only, I can meet you anywhere along the front range.  Complete firearm - upper and lower are both factory CMMG.  I have some ammo I can sell at a reasonable price (subsonic and supersonic).

This unique and hard to find firearm is the ultimate setup for home defense.  It is being tested and adopted by US Special Forces as the ideal close quarters weapon.

Check out this feature article in the current edition of Guns & Ammo on this weapon (same setup, but from a different manufacturer – the DD is not yet released, this is available today!)

http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/fade-to-black-daniel-defense-ddm4-300-sbr-review/


This AR15 is a CMMG 12.5” chambered in 300 Blackout.  It is the ideal home defense firearm because:

•	It has a 30 caliber bullet.  More potent than the standard AR (.223 or 5.56).
•	It has ideal ballistics in a Short Barrel Weapon.  Standard AR needs a longer barrel to achieve ideal ballistics.
•	It is designed to run subsonic or supersonic ammo.  What’s the point of a home defense weapon that if used renders everyone deaf afterwards?  This is one of the main reasons I have switched to the 300 Blackout.
•	It is also legal to hunt with in Colorado.  You can’t hunt with a standard AR.

300 Blackout only needs a different barrel.  Other than that, it uses all the standard AR parts.  Magazine, bolt, everything is standard.

A standard AR  has a 16” barrel, which is longer than ideal for home defense.  You can get a Short Barrel Rifle (SBR), but you need to apply to the ATF, pay $200 for a stamp and wait 4-8 months for approval.

This AR lower is registered as a pistol.   If you want to make it a rifle, you just need to apply, but this means you can legally use it immediately as-is.

What is 300 Blackout?

From Wikipedia:
Since its inception, as the standard US military primary issue rifle ammunition, the 5.56×45mm NATO round has run up against firm opposition from those who argue that the 30 caliber round provides the minimum, if not ideal, performance necessary for the modern battlefield soldier. While 5.56mm NATO has enjoyed widespread acceptance in military circles, the fluid nature of the missions that some special operations groups encounter often demand a round that not only provides better performance[1] than that available in the high energy standard velocity rounds but also one that can offer subsonic performance greater than the current standard 9mm submachine guns now in use.

CMMG is considered the best value in the AR platform.  This post is a great overview of the AR and is legendary with millions of views.  Bottom line:  The Police Officer that wrote this article recommends the CMMG.

This is really an outstanding all-around rifle and despite some internet nonsense, they are very accurate, and the 308/7.62 is an outstanding hunting/target round. This rifle has only been to the range a couple of times, and out once or twice with me in the field, so is in excellent condition.

The original manual, butt spacers, two 5 round and two 10 round boxes, and Ruger rings, per the pic, are included. Please let me know if you would like any additional use or picture information.

Up for sale are brand new, never used or loaded, Bulgarian magazines. I have both AK74 (5.45) and AKM (7.62) magazines. No pictures at this time.

I went back and forth trying to decide if I should keep these in case of a ban of high capacity magazines for future use if I decide to buy another Kalashnikov designed weapon, or clone. However, decided since I am selling all of my variant ammunition, then I will go ahead and sell the magazines as well. 

I would like to keep this local to keep shipping down to a minimum, but may be willing to ship in 1 or 2 lots. 1 lot of both AK74 and AKM magazines or 2 lots, 1 with AKM magazines and 1 with AK74 magazines. Buyer pays for shipping, approximately $16 for each lot. If both sets are purchased together, I will pay cost of shipping over $16. 

Payment: Discreet PayPal Gift or +3% or USPS Money Order.

Magazines:

Bulgarian AK74 (5.45) 30 rounds capacity - New black Bulgarian Circle ((10)) - 10 Available - $48 each

Bulgarian AKM (7.62) 30 rounds capacity - New in wrapper black Bulgarian Steel - 8 Available - $40 each

FEG model SMC-380 da/sa pistol in 380 acp caliber. A copy of the Walther PPK. Blue finish, alloy frame, 3.5"" barrel, plastic grips with thumbrest. 

The SMC-380 is of historical interest because it is the smallest gun ever imported legally into the U.S. since the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (according to which a gun cannot be imported if it is less than 4.0 inches in height). The SMC-380, which is barely 4.1 inches high, had to have a target-type left grip installed to meet the government's stringent importation criteria. The left target-style grip widened the pistol from 1.1 to 1.3 inches, but that was a small price to pay. A thinner, flatter left grip panel is also available on request.

Like the PMK-380, the SMC-380 is available only in .380 ACP caliber. Its alloy frame makes it smoother and two or three ounces lighter than the PPK. It also carries better in a pocket than the higher-priced German gun and it fits the average hand better. Its sights, while tiny, are easy to line up quickly, thanks to the comfortable curve of the backstrap. In testing an early SMC-380, the pistol proved quite accurate."
