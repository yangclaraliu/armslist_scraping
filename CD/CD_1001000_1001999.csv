It does not even have a full box of ammo through it. It has everything that originally came with the firearm, which includes the box, two 17-round magazines, three backstraps to adjust the size of the grip for your specific comfort, a lock, and all original paperwork. This one is a full size frame with a 4.25"" barrel.

The M&P is a solid firearm for personal and home defense and smooth to shoot. The one criticism often heard is about the mushiness of the trigger, especially on reset. To correct that, this firearm already has Apex's Universal Striker Block and also it's Reset Assist Mechanism (RAM). The trigger reset is now both tactile and audible for those lightning double taps.

I'm asking $5755 OBO for this firearm. I saw a brand new one just last week at a local dealer but just for the stock model, their price is much higher than my price, even before tax. I won't call mine new because that would be a lie; but, the only difference is a few extra rounds fired. Look closely at the pictures though, and you will see that the slide has no holster wear. On top there is a little rubbing but nothing else, which supports that only a few rounds have been fired through this firearm.

I would consider trades for firearms that are of different manufacturers so that I can diversify.  Any sales or trades would require two forms of ID to include your driver's license and either your voter registration card or concealed permit and willingness to complete a simple bill of sale."

I don't shoot it nearly as often as I'd like, and I'd prefer somebody else get the chance to actually shoot and maybe do some hunting with it. I've put around 600 rounds through it. That is not really a lot of wear, and it is in great condition. Other than the few times I've shot it, it pretty much just sits in the rifle case. It has a 24"" bull barrel with a 1 in 9"" twist. While that is optimum for lighter varmint rounds, it will shoot 75 grain match rounds at 500 yards all day long, as long as the shooter can use the rifle correctly. The bipod is not included. I'll include the Millett 4-16 power scope with illuminated mil-dot reticle for a total of $1400. The scope is very clear, and has only been used to shoot once. If you don't agree with the price, just make an offer. The least I can say is no. I'll also consider trades for firearms and/or ammo. I can also sell some 5.56 ammo for extra cash.

I acquired these items from Glen Sonmor a few years ago as he lived at the property I worked at. 

1) An autograph puck dating back to the Minnesota Fighting Saints. Ted Hampson was the Saints' captain in their first four seasons.
Among the Saints' notable players in their brief history were Ted Hampson, Jack Carlson, Bill Butters and Pat Westrum. Glen Sonmor was the Saints general manager throughout their history. Sonmor also coached the Saints for the first part of their inaugural season. Feel free to look up the history and stats on the players listed above.

2) A personal letter and Minnesota Wild book given to Glen Sonmor from CEO - Jac Sperling - of the Minnesota Wild. To whom that don't know, Glen coached the North Stars and was entered into the Minnesota Hall Fame in 2007.

3) Flyers equipment bag - Glen played for the Flyers between 1951-1952 season. Although his bag doesn't date back from then, It's kind of a cool piece. It has a Flyers patch and name tag...

4) Rare 1982 All Star Photo - For any Wayne Gretzky fans, this was his first all star appearance...

I have what I call a ""high volume compensator"" paired with a muzzle coupling for a Ruger MarkII with a 10"" Bull Bbl. The compensator is an empty tube that allows the gas to expand and cool, then to vent upwards through ports in the end of the tube. This reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise to keep you on target.  They are threaded 1/2x20.  There is a set screw on the rear bushing that lets you rotate the tube to position the vents upward.
The muzzle coupling allows you to use the threaded compensators (or other threaded accessories) without having a threaded barrel.  The coupling fits over the end of the barrel with a slot for the front site.  Then, two split rings can be tightened up against the rear of the front site to lock the coupling in place and providing a 1/2x20 thread for accessories.
All parts are blued steel.  
This listing is for a 5"" compensator and a muzzle coupling for a Ruger MarkII with a 10"" Bull Target bbl.  This bbl is a round, slightly tapered bbl.  It is not for a slab-side bull bbl.

Experience the rugged reliability Ruger is renowned for in a new rifle that redefines the AR platform. Its chrome-plated, two-stage, piston-driven operating system offers improved dependability over gas-driven rifles. A four-position, chrome-plated gas regulator allows the shooter to tune the rifle to specific ammunition or conditions. The bolt, bolt carrier and extractor are also chrome-plated to enhance performance and durability. A cold hammer-forged, chrome- lined, mil-spec 41V45 barrel delivers consistent accuracy. Troy Industries folding battle sights are adjustable and co- witness with mil-spec optics so they can easily be removed to make room for high-powered scopes. The Troy Industries quad-rail handguard provides a rigid mount for the piston-driven transfer rod. Rail covers for unused rails make for a more comfortable hold. A six-position, telescoping M4-style buttstock can be used to adjust length of pull. 

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

Rifle specs:
The M10-762 is manufactured out of brand-new high quality parts - everything is newly manufactured to be US Section 922(r) compliant, though the receiver is made in Romania.  The M10-762 has a brand-new, chrome-lined 16.25"" barrel, with a 1:10 twist rate, with four lands and grooves, with a right-hand twist, if this stuff is important you. The overall length of this gun is 26"" with the fixed stock. The rifle weighs-in at 7.3 pounds.  
 It has a TAPCO RAZR muzzle brake/flash suppressor on the end of the barrel. The RAZR can also be used as a ""compliance"" device because of the super-sharp cut to the brake. The pistol grip is outstanding. This rubber covered pistol grip is not only larger than the standard AK pistol grip, but it is perfectly configured to fit the hand. If there is a better pistol grip out there for an AK, then I haven't found it. The stock is USA-made (by TAPCO) and is black synthetic of some sort. The fore end on the M10-762 is an aluminum quad-rail type, firmly attached, so you can mount lasers, lights and red dot optics on it if you choose - and this is a really nice quad-rail, to be sure.   
 The front sight is mounted on the gas block, instead of on the end of the barrel. The rear sight is an RPK graduated fully adjustable for windage and elevation sight that adjusts all the way up to 1,000 meters.  
 A TAPCO single-hook trigger is installed in the M10-762. The let-off is supposed to be right at 4 pounds. A TAPCO AK retaining plate is used to keep the trigger pin and safety pin in place - a much better set-up than the simple bent spring that comes with most AKs these days. The lower receiver is stamped and heat-treated to military specs. There is also a quick-detachable scope mount base on the left side of the receiver if you want to mount a scope."

The compensators are empty tubes that allow the gas to expand and cool, then to vent upwards through ports in the end of the tube. This reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise to keep you on target.  They are threaded 1/2x20.  There is a set screw on the rear bushing that lets you rotate the tube to position the vents upward.
The muzzle couplings allow you to use these threaded compensators (or other threaded accessories) without having threaded barrels.  The couplings fit over the end of the barrel with a slot for the front site.  Then, two split rings can be tightened up against the rear of the front site to lock the coupling in place and providing a 1/2x20 thread for accessories.
All parts are blued steel.  
This listing is for a 6"" compensator with muzzle coupling for a Ruger 10/22 rifle, std bbl., a threaded flash suppressor and a thread protector. $100."

The bolt has been replaced with a GI Bolt. Sights have been replace with National Match Sights. Fires .308 / 7.62 x 54 mm rounds flawlessly. Flash hider is GI. It has a beautiful wood GI stock with flip open metal compartment. Stock has been glass bedded. Includes 6 high capacity 20 round magazines. Excellent fit and finish on rifle and stock.  Previous owner told me rifle was re-barrelled however I cannot confirm this. Their are no markings on the barrel of any kind.  Rifle has also had a rails installed on near the forearm.

This rifle was manufactured by Polytech, not Springfield, which means the receiver is forged. The forged receiver is very desirable making them the platform on which many high-end custom M14 style rifles are built. These receivers are stronger than the cast receivers made by Springfield.

Magazines are functionally excellent but a two of them show a couple of spots of rusting.

Excellent condition, beautiful bluing and grips.  Out of production for several years, real collector's item!  When they come up on gunbroker, they sell for $4,000 plus!  

The Mateba Model 6 uses the recoil from firing to rotate the cylinder and cock the hammer, unlike conventional revolvers, which depend on the user physically pulling the trigger and/or cocking the hammer to actuate the weapon's mechanism of operation.
The Mateba Autorevolver's barrel alignment is different from most other revolvers. The barrel is aligned with the bottom of the cylinder instead of the top. This lowers the bore axis (line of the barrel) which directs the recoil in line with the shooter's hand thereby reducing the twisting motion or muzzle flip of normal revolvers. The gun's entire upper assembly (barrel, cylinder and frame) are mounted on rails on the lower frame, which houses the trigger, hammer, and grip, and recoils 1/2 of an inch, or 12.7mm, on firing. The rearward motion of the upper assembly cocks the hammer, and the cylinder is rotated on the forward stroke.

The 380 caliber is the rarest of the already rare RPB series of pistols made in 1982

LITTLE HISTORY
RPB was on the verge of going under from finical problems. In the late 1970s Wayne Daniel purchased a large majority of the companies stock and started to produce semi-auto versions of the M11-A1. By removing the collapsible stock and the ability to fire Full-Auto, the open bolt SM11-A1 became a Title 1 pistol and could be purchased by anyone.

These new semi versions of the M11 sold like hot cakes until the BATF intervened in 1982 because they felt these open bolt semi-auto copies could be converted to Full-Auto to easily. Because of this all open-bolt pistol produced after 1982 are considered Machine Guns and this is why we don’t see semi-auto open bolt guns any more.

Luckily for owners of these semi-auto pistols all guns not modified on or produced before the ruling were grand fathered and not considered machine guns.

Unfortunately this ruling by the BATF hurt RPB financially and brought unwanted legal attention so Wayne Daniel dissolved the company in April 1982.

The RPB SM11-A1 is chambered in .380 ACP & uses steel magazines in either 16 or 32 round capacities. Unlike most M-11s it has no collapsible stock that extends from the butt of the weapon and only fires in semi-auto. It does use the open bolt method of operation & the end of the barrel is threaded to accept a silencer or other barrel accessory. Compared to other M-11s the RPB guns are generally of a higher quality.

The RPB SM11-A1s is rare because they are the last of the legal open-bolt semi-auto pistols. Because of this they command a good deal for a Title 1 pistol on the open market because MAC collectors are always on the look out for them.

The TEC-9 design was started in Sweden, when the Interdynamic AB company of Stockholm developed a relatively simple submachine gun. Since Sweden was a poor market for such product, a subsidiary company Interdynamic was established in Miami (Florida, USA), to market Interdynamic guns in USA. As the full-automatic weapons market in USA is very restrictive, the basic submachine gun was converted in semi-automatic only variant, apparently suitable for civilian US market. This semi-automatic pistol, like its submachine gun predecessor, was a simple blowback design, firing from the open bolt. It was designated Interdynamic KG-9. But, sooner than later, US Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) found that this semiautomatic pistol can be easily converted back to full automatic, and restricted it manufacture. Interdynamic redesigned the KG-9 into ""closed bolt"" design by adding the separate striker, and designated it KG-99. About the same time (mid-1980s) the Interdynamic of USA turned into Intratec Firearms, Inc, based in the same city of Miami (Florida). Intratec initially  produced the KG-99 under the designation of  TEC-9, but about 1989 renamed it into DC-9. With the introduction of the infamous US Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 the Intratec pistols were prohibited for manufacture (but not for ownership, if made before the ban) AND THIS ONE WAS MADE AND PURCHASED BEFORE THE BAN. Original owner with original booklet.

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine.  It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine.  First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel.  Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds.  Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine.  

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market.

I know these are going for a pretty penny now, so I won't accept crap offers. The rifle has been cleaned after every trip to the range, the rifle has no handling marks of any kinds, has about 200 rounds through the barrel. I bought the handguards from Sig Manufacturing for about $80 or so and have the little rail pieces that mount to the handguards to accommodate a picatinney rail. I currently have an EOTech 512 on the rifle, but I think that will be taken off to put on the AR-15 that I hope to get from trade. I am mainly looking for a Colt-manufactured AR-15 with some extras. I want to stay within the ""AR Platform"" so that I can have a nice semi-auto rifle. I will entertain all ""multi-gun"" offers for the SIG556 and maybe even cash+gun offers. I mainly want a trade that includes an AR-15 in it. Not acception Palmetto State Arms, DPMS, Rock River, etc. Colt is about the only brand I want unless the deal is too good to pass up. 

SIG556 will come with box, paperwork, diopter sight, and a magazine."

If you want to buy lots of it, I'll knock my price down, but don't even think it'll get close to retail price.

Seriously people, do a little shopping around, and avoid price gougers.  You CAN find 9mm and other calibers in retail stores.  Within the past month I bought 550 rounds of 9mm(Blazer Brass and Remington) around $.25 a round at local shops.  Cabelas has ammo for cheaper than Armslist sellers do if you're desperate.

Please don't be taken in by these people.  They're doing exactly what you should be doing.  They're shopping around local shops, buying up the ammo, then reselling it at almost DOUBLE the price.

A simple process if you have a dremel, also a gunsmith can do it no problem. I don't know what they're running for now but when I got them mags were like a buck a piece. Spare parts and accessories for this guy are FREAKING CHEAP. Anyway, asking $700, I'm selling it to get myself a .357 lever action so if anybody has one of those I would consider a partial trade. Unlike most CAI imports this one is made ENTIRELY of Cetme parts. That's why the G3 mags don't fit. All mags are 20 round capacity."

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.



Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.


Fiber Optic Sight
Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic"

Includes 4 magazines! Barrett M107A1 29"" Barrel Semi-Auto .50BMG Description from Website: It may be 

related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every 

component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less 

than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you 

to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt 

carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port muzzle brake is 

engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver 

features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, 

anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. 

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are 

bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore 

and chamber add to the rifle’s durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear 

grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side. The 

M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The 

bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that 

increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just 

another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference."

Prefer a Mossberg 500 bantam-or Remington 870 youth-but I'm not picky.  I am on a bit of a budget, though-as I have to completely outfit her too.  She's outgrown all her old camo clothing.  (Which-I'm also looking for if you have any along with that old gun...?)  Hoping to get a decent used one for $200.00 or so.  

I know there has to be some out there-why not pass it on to another excited young hunter just getting started...and free up some space for something new of your own?

Complete with charging handle and bolt carrier group. Features a air gauged, MP tested, 16"" 4150 Steel Chrome-Moly Barrel w/ 1:9"" Rifling and a true 5.56mm military chamber.

The custom machined match barrels used in RGUNS rifles and uppers are made from 4150 chrome-moly vanadium steel manufactured in the USA. Each 5.56 NATO/.223 barrel is properly head spaced with an M4 feed ramp extension installed.

Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded 1/2-28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life.

Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, as well as a pulled-button rifling, producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. Fluted models feature unique fluting designs to improve rigidity and aid in barrel cooling."

History & A Prayer

God made man. George Washington rendered monarchies obsolete.  America's Founders recognized our rights in 1791 and prayed our fledgling Republic would last.  Sam Colt made men equal in 1836.  Winchester permitted our rifles to repeat & Remington did it with shotguns.  Smith & Wesson gaves us levers and cartridges. Gatling facilitated walls of steel in 1861 and Maxim followed with portable & suppressed.  John Browning and John Garand made men more efficient, then Eugene Stoner made the burden lighter.  God bless these men and their descendents.  Also bless & enlighten our modern leaders so they remain certain that should they attempt to curtail our rights they will personally re-discover Sam Colt's achievement, subsequent technical innovations, and be rapidly returned to their maker.  de Oppresso Liber!
