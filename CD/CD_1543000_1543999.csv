I have a low round count, PM9 Black Diamond Edition for sale. It comes with a 6 round and 7 round mag, and Meprolight Night Sights installed.  Gun is flawless both cosmetically and functioning, and would make a real nice pocket carry gun.  Also awesome if carried IWB, this thing just disappears in your waist band.  The Black Diamond Edition is tough to come by in gun shops, most carry just the two tone PM9 with the stainless colored slide.  Only reason im selling is because my big meat hooks like my G26 better.  The only trade I would consider is for a  new S&W Shield 9 for the wife to carry.  Will sell for $525 out right.

It has target turrets, illuminated crosshairs, sunshade, adjustable parallax an very clear glass. The crosshairs have little dots that are 1 MOA apart. You look where your last shot hit then count the number of dots you are from the bullseye then click the turrets that many dots. Can sight this scope in with two shots. 

I bought the scope new an have used it at the range twice, only firing 40 rounds with. It holds a zero and returns to zero everytime. All vortex scopes have a fully transferable lifetime no questions asked warranty from the factory. It is well known as one of the best warranties in the industry.

I bought this at an NRA banquet auction for my AR. Turns out mine won't fit with the current scope setup I have. So I have no use for it, as I have no desire to take the scope off everytime. 

I paid $225 plus tax.  I've never used it, and it's still brand new. PLUS, you get the OFFICIAL NRA VERSION.  How cool is that???

See the link for more details, and realize this is even BETTER as it supports the NRA:)

Gun was finished last year by United Chroming in michigan and they did an awesome job with the nickel plating, there are some minor scratches to the receiver as this is no show queen this gun has been shot and is meant to be a shooter. Some of the other custom touches include a finger tab on the safety for working the safety without your hand having to leave the grip, a pistol grip plate allowing for a neck sling to be mounted, all rivets welded and smoothed before plating, hand pinstriped muzzle break also done by united chroming, that break gets almost as many compliments as the gun at the range. This rifle comes with 6 mags, 2 steel 30rd mags clamped together, 40 rd steel with a magpul loop on the bottom plate, 3 different style polymer mags. anything that isnt nickel plated on this gun has been sprayed with black duracoat in a matte black finish.

Case
I urge you to look around to see how much the 226 Stainless Elite in 9 mm  goes for, it is not equivalent to the Dark Elite or Enhanced Elite or Scorpion Elite. It's Steel Beavertail frame ensures this pistol will last for generation and will not deteriorate or bruise like an aluminum frame will over time. Not to mention Sig Sauer makes fewer of these than any other pistol which drives the value much higher than any other model. The 226 is the standard firearm in Sig enthusiasts collections and the Stainless Elite in 226 is very much a marvel of beauty and example of excellence in the Sig Sauer line of firearms. This is as close as you will get to the all West German Sig that is much sought after just for its Steel frame. On auction setting this pistol generally runs over $1600 used and over $2k new please research to verify just because I want you to see for yourself. If you can get one cheaper I'd love for you to go buy it there and take me with you. If the pistol sells for over $1600 I will include the grips for 1/3 of retail. Please email with telephone number because texting is much easier and more direct 440-384-242FIVE...

It's chambered in 7.65mm Browning but should also work with .32ACP.  I have not test fired it and do not plan to since it hasn't been inspected by a gunsmith.

The proofmarks found on this pistol are shown in the pictures below.  The shield with a diagonal cross and a crown on top means that the gun was inspected by the proofhouse in Eibar, Spain.  Following that is the initials P.V., which mean that the gun was intended for smokeless powder.  To the right of that, very faded, is a rampaging lion.  This series of 3 marks was used by the Eibar proofhouse between 1923 and 1927.  Before 1923, there were no government marks on Spanish firearms.  Starting in late 1927, they began using a code to indicate the year of construction.  Therefore, this gun is between 86 and 90 years old.  The rampaging lion mark appears on the slide and is visible on the barrel as well.  Under the trigger guard there is a maker's mark of ""G.A."" and there is a very faint mark on the slide which appears to be another ""G.A."".  From the literature I've seen, there is no record of a company using this mark, but there is mention of a man named Gaspar Arizaga who made these pistols, but I don't know if anyone will ever know for sure.

Mechanically, it seems sound.  The magazine seems to be in good condition as well.  I think it has a lot of charm and it'll be a very nice addition to a collection.  

****UPDATE**** - This pistol is old but isn't old enough to ship as a collectible and if you want it shipped I can only send it to an FFL.  Don't email me to ask otherwise."

The free float rails are designed to fit all the tactical gear that you can carry. Unlike many ARs, this is a standard feature which you won't end up spending more to upgrade the rail set-ups. It has an efficient autoloading direct-impingement gas system for ejection of spent cartridges and auto reloading. No forward assist is necessary for a rifle this smooth. It does have a dust cover, a large trigger hole, and nice charging handle. The blued barrel is 16.25"", rifled for 1 in 9"" and ends with the muzzle-flash suppressor. The receiver, magazine release, and charging handle are all well designed to make use and maintenance reliable and easy. The upper and lower separate easily with two pins for service and cleaning. The receiver accepts 5.56 Nato ammunition as well as .223 Remington brass or steel casings. It has a 31 round capacity and is a real front-runner in the AR style market. Colt also makes a good quad rail set-up like this, but is generally much more costly. Mossberg redefined affordable with .223s and the .22lr. They have been around over 90 years. They must be doing something right. Mossberg offers their one year manu. warranty on this product. I have additional 30 round factory Mossberg magazines for sale."

If you are unfamiliar with these, read the reviews online. They are extremely efficient, and deliver crisp bass at every level. I have used SPG555's for over six years now, but am downsizing to something that will fit under the seat. These are a little over a year old, and sound VERY nice. These subs sound VERY clean and clear, they are amazingly responsive, and weigh very little for their size. One will rattle your eyes out, run both of them and you will need earplugs. The foam surrounds have some scuffing, but it is purely cosmetic and effects the sound/performance in no way at all. I will run these (hard) for the buyer so they can hear it for themselves. They sound amazing. These are very unique that they are component built. The voice coil, frame, and surround foam can be replaced individually, so no fears of ever damaging them and having to replace the whole sub.  If you want to replace the surround foam for cosmetic reasons, they are $100.00 online and bolt right in. I am somewhat firm on this price, as these are some of the highest rated subs on the market. Serious offers only! NO SPAMMERS! Call or text REDACTED. $500.00 or BEST REASONABLE OFFER. NO LOW BALLERS!! Poss trades, just let me know what ya got.

838,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1543838,Want To Buy:  A Very Special First Generation Colt SAA,"Denver, Denver, Colorado","$ 3,333","Listed On: Tuesday, April 30, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi folks, this is a complete shot in the dark, but I am looking to recover a very important family heirloom. The gun was stolen from my grandfather's home decades ago in Colorado. Three guns were taken at the time. A Savage Model 110, a Browning Sweet 16 and a Colt Single Action Army revolver. We recovered the Savage many many years later (the sheriff found it in a pawn shop in the same exact condition it was in when stolen) but the sweet and the SAA were not there. 

We do not have a serial number, but we know it was a low serial number pistol, first generation, nickel with either bone or ivory grips. The gun was well used and the nickel plating was in poor condition. The special things that would make this particular pistol stand out are the fact that it has two notched carved into the grip and that it had one screw (we are not sure which) in the frame that would not tighten, it must have been stripped out. 

I know this is vague, but on the off chance you have encountered this gun, or might know where it is, please contact me. We would do anything to recover the gun, it is very important to su."

We have a litter, with one exceptional boy we are offering for sale.  His pedigree is as pristine as it gets.  Nearly every dog in his pedigree holds multiple champion titles. His grandsire was World Winner 2008 with many other titles. Please see for yourself, the website allows you to research there entire line: 
Grandsire http://ingrus.net/frbull/en/details.php?id=3393
Granddame: http://ingrus.net/frbull/en/details.php?id=6338
We are currently having professional photographs taken of this puppy.  However he is fawn with white markings and a black mask just like his father.  This puppy has potential to participate in any show around the world including Westminster.  We have taken this breeding very serious and will provide you any information you would like.
The puppy will be sold for a bargain price of $10,000 or we provide a $2,000 discount of $8,000 with agreement that he will be actively shown, as you can see this price is quite low for this quality of dog. We are doing this because we are confident in his abilities, and would like to request the second pick of the litter on his first breeding once he receives his champion title.  He is AKC and UKC registered for the reason of giving the buyer multiple opportunities to hopefully bring many purple ribbons to their home.   Opportunities like this only come once in a life time, this could be your chance to have something very special. 
The mother and father are very well mannered making perfect companions in for the home. You would be getting the best of both worlds. An easy going loving dog who also has potential to dominate the show ring.  
So you can say that by buying this puppy, you will not just have a pet but it’s like owning canine royalty.
We breed pups for show quality, health, beauty, and temperament.  Please email or text me at info@drjaredcooper.com/     801-674-9504 if you are interested in owning a truly outstanding French bulldog puppy.  The puppy is located in Utah, special travel arrangements can be made if needed.
