These HIGH QUALITY 80% AR-15 Lower receivers are TRUE BILLETS. That means they start as one solid block of 7075-T6 Aluminum and are fully machined down to military-spec tolerances. They come with an integral Trigger Guard for added strength and rigidity. There also have very subtle and slight grooves machined into the front of the magazine well for extra grip in any situation. The operations left to be completed are as follows: fire control group slot, trigger pin hole, hammer pin hole, and the safety selector hole. This is a not an FFL item and can be SHIPPED TO YOUR DOOR. This is not a complete receiver and still requires some machining in order to have a fully operational firearm.

It is in very good condition. The only imperfection I can see is a bit of holster wear by the muzzle on the right side. This pistol is amazingly accurate and thin so it is easy to carry. It was manufactured in 1982 at the Walther factory in Ulm Germany. On the side it says ""West Germany"" which is kind of cool. Along with the pistol come a cheapo holster I got with it and 50 rounds of Winchester 95gr .380 ammo.

The site is not being cooperative with me posting pics. If you have something I want I can send pics to your email. 

Purchased it for concealed carry but something else panned out shortly thereafter so it became redundant. Just looking to get out of it what I put into it in cash or trade. If I cannot do that it will go into the collection. Since this PP is a beautiful gun that will not sadden me much.

Cash price is $600 firm. Not interested in selling it for less.

This rifle is in great condition, with a bent bolt, similar to the Engineer's Carbine version.
The wood is in fine condition, the rifling is near flawless (by that I don't mean there are any flaws, I just mean that my young eyes can't percieve anything wrong), the action is still as smooth as fresh from the mint, and the internal 5 round magazine functions greatly.
All around, it's a great gun.

There is one item that many believe to be a problem, but it's actually a non-issue.
My rifle has had the Argentine military seal taken off.
Yes, this does depreciate the value (which I've taken into account.), but it was done due to law.
Most knowledge of this gun is gained from the internet, so most people only find that this rifle with seal is worth a good $300 more than if it was without.
But, if you look deeper, you'll find why. It's because the rifles with the seal just don't practically exist outside of museums and collectors.
Why?
Because after the military rifles where surplussed to mercenaries and other governments in South America, a problem arose when other governments where found being overthrown by weapons stamped with an Argentine seal.
The solution? Take off the seal when the government is finished with the weapon. So every weapon that was imported to America in the 50's did not have the seal on them, and the ones with them are old mercenary relics worth more, with a colorful history.
I'm sure there are a few exeptions, but not many.

Just a little history lesson.

Oh, and the high pricing on my rifle? It's due to the 150 rounds of ammo that I have, which I will be including. It fires the 7.65x53 Argentine round (which is still manufactured), which is incredibly similar to the .308."

Thanks.
Gun shows some bluing and stock wear - see pictures.  There was some rust on the end and outside of the barrel and the bead was missing.  I sanded the end rust off and used a rust remover on the outside, then re-blued with a cold bluing.  I also installed a new bead.  Gun is my father-in-laws, it was in the garage rafters for 20+ years.  I finally convinced him to just let me sell it and use the money for something else.  After I finished the barrel, I test fired the gun, works good.  Shot a round of trap with it.  Gun has a 30 inch fixed full choke barrel.  If the pitting at the end bothers you, it could be cut down to a modified choke barrel behind the pitting and a new bead installed.  This would make a very nice low cost pheasant or other small game gun, or trap shooting.  2-3/4"" 12 gauge only.  Please email with any question or full size pictures.  $150 OBO."

A key feature of the pistol is its modular design. The main module of the P250 is an internal stainless steel frame fire control unit which consist of the 
integrated fire control group (trigger, hammer and all necessary linkage and springs), ambidextrous slide release (one on each side of the pistol), ejector and four slide rails. This steel receiver unit is used in every P250 grip module, top end, and chambering combination and is inserted into the grip frame module and held in place by the axis pin of the disassembly lever. The firearm's serial number is on the fire control unit instead of the grip module. The fire control unit allows the operator to interchange differently-sized slide assembly or top end modules and polymer grip frame modules and trigger shoes and (limited) chambering conversions to adapt the gun to the individual user and address different needs.
The P250 was designed to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous slide catch lever and user reversible magazine catch. All other operating controls are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm can be field stripped with no tools.
The full-size and compact grip modules feature an integral Picatinny rail mounting-bracket at the lower forward edge of the module to allow the mounting of laser sights, tactical lights, and other accessories.

It comes with standard sights, stainless steel with Sig's Nitron finish. I bought an extra magazine for this, so it will go with the deal, a thinner trigger sold by Sig to reduce the perceived pull, and a hybrid style holster.

User comment from blog site: 
""In the 2007 October issue of Shooting Illustrated magazine there is an article where the author tests 14 different SD loads in the S&W Body Guard .380acp. Out of the 14 loads tested the Buffalo Bore+P 100gr Hard Cast LFN penetrated 31""+ through the 10% Gel.""

From the Manufacturer:
"" This 380 Auto+P ammo will better all American made 380 Auto ammo by 150 fps to 200 fps in all bullet weights we make. This is a serious improvement in this typically anemic cartridge. This 380 auto+P ammo is more powerful than the typical 38SPL ammo made by most American ammo makers and you'll get 7 shots of it in a small/flat/light weight 380 versus 5 shots out of a bulkier 38 SPL J frame revolver. Additionally, with the 380 you'll get much faster reloads and the little magazines are flatter than a speed-loader used for a J frame.

Item 27A/20 is a 100gr. HARD cast bullet with a flat nose. It is traveling over 1,150 fps out of my 3.75 inch BDA (Browning Double Action). We've used a flash suppressed powder for all three of our 380 auto loads so that you wont be blinded by your own gunfire if you have to shoot in the dark and since around 95% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light, the chances that your own gunfire will blind you while you are trying to save your life, are good - we've eliminated this variable by using flash suppressed powder. We've also chosen a flat nosed solid bullet. The flat on the nose ensures that the bullet will cut/smash its way through flesh and bone and do much more destruction than typical round nose FMJ bullets. Round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through matter, doing little damage as opposed to a flat nosed bullet. The flat nose not only wounds much more than a round nosed bullet, but it actually keeps the penetration straight and thus deeper. Notice the below velocities recorded from my personal 380 auto pistols. These are real world guns and thus the speeds are realistic and not exaggerated speeds produced from laboratory test barrels. What you see with Buffalo Bore Ammo, is truly what you get in the ""real world"", where it matters. You can expect 20+ inches of straight-line penetration in flesh and bone with this load. If you are worried about over penetration with this load, DON'T! You chose to carry a tiny under-powered 380 auto pistol and the trade-off is that you are now going to have to stay alive with that pistol and over penetration will be the least of your worries if you end up needing this gun to save yourself or your family.

I am not sure of the model number, I think a 98 but not certain as there is no model number stamped on it because model numbers were not stamped on shotguns until 1900... It has the usual Manufacturer name and patent dates, serial number and thats all. It looks like a 12 ga and it has a 30 inch barrel. I have never fired it although it is complete and the action is solid and seems to operate as it should. The wood is excellent, no cracks or major chips. The slide wood has all its screws and metal has maintained some of its blueing.  There is a confusing issue regarding this shotgun as some online experts say you can fire low power smokeless shells and some say you can only fire black powder shells. I am not an antique expert so I really don't know. If you buy this firearm I recommend that you have it checked out by a competent gunsmith before shooting it. This is the one with the button to the right of the hammer that you push to release the action.. Even if you never fire it the gun looks really good and would be nice to add to a collection or possibly have a shotgun to hunt with. I will sell or trade it."
