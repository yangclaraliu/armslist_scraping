Even if you've never shot a gun before, or if you've been shooting for years, you're skills will improve dramatically. After completing the course you will have a complete understanding of the defensive handgun and a skill level that surpasses many of those who carry a gun for a living. Your gun handling, marksmanship, and tactical skills will be better than they've ever been and you will be able to safely and easily draw your weapon from a CONCEALED holster and fire two,sighted shots to the center of a target 5 yards away - all under 1.5 seconds!

This is a .357 Magnum Mark I pistol from 1985. It has a 6"" Magnaported barrel and Millet adjustable sights (white outline rear and bright orange front). It comes with one stainless mag and one blued mag. Comes with the original box, literature, cleaning rod, brush and gas system scraping tool. The gun has a ""stainless' appearance and that's where the story gets interesting.

The Desert Eagle serial numbers began at ""3000."" The suffix ""S"" was used for ""stainless guns."" This pistol is serial 309x - S, making it one of the first 100 ""stainless"" Desert Eagles to ever be imported into this country. According to Magnum Research, these old guns that were catalogued as ""stainless"" were actually stainless steel cast frames along with Satin Nickel plated barrels and slides (made of chromoly steel). This one has black accents and it looks sharp. It handles screaming full-power .357 loads like a champ and recoils like a 9mm pistol. It's a ton of fun to shoot; nobody has shot it without having a huge smile on their face afterwards. Someone in the past 30 years ground down the sharp edge inside the trigger guard on the right side of the frame. If you're looking for a solid shooter that looks great, this is it!

It isn't very common to come across the ""stainless"" MKI in .357MAG, let alone one with the Millet sights and Magnaport factory upgrades. In fact, it was several years before I came across this one. I think it's safe to call it ""rare"" but this one is a shooting piece, not a collector's piece.

I don't want to sell it, but I would consider trades, plus or minus cash for:"

I've got other AR's and this one shoots just as well, if not better, than the others. It's only got about 100 rounds through it.

I'm only selling it because I have a couple others, and I am starting a new build. Just trying to help fund my new build is all. I'm asking $750, which I think is pretty fair considering what most others are asking.  Buyer must have photo ID and/or CCW and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

If interested, I've also got some other AR parts that could be purchased to go along with this rifle. See link below:

Served in the German military and has the F to signify that. 9mm chamber and still has the original magazine that was issued with it.

The story behind it is that some poor German officer got shot and a G.I. took it. then a US general took it from the GI and nickled it. My friends dad bombed a German Armour column coming up on GIs and he made them retreat by bombing them with his b-17. He was handed the Luger by the General for saving his GIs and he sent it home. His son inherited it. Then me. i am selling this Luger with case and original magazine, and 2 repro magazines for it.

it was a 2,000- 2,200$ pistol. But with nickleing and a set of new grips i am asking a fair 1600$. i am open to offers. i prefer cash and near St louis-Scoot Airforce base.

It's in really good shape.  The plastic guide rod was removed and replaced with a stainless upgrade. The gun has the standard Nitron sights and includes two factory Sig Sauer 15-round magazines. This does not include a case. It came in a Sig Sauer box (like a shoebox), which you will get as part of the package. 

The 2022 is DA/SA, features the SRT (Short Reset Trigger) and a decocker just like the Sigs that sell for $800-1000. The difference is the frame, which is polymer, much like any Glock and many Springfields. This is a mid-size pistol and over a half inch shorter than a full-size Glock. Because of the SRT, it's a lot more accurate, too. This is a great gun for the price. I now own a P226 in 9mm Extreme and a P220, so this thing doesn't see much range time anymore. It's been cleaned after each trip to the range, then stored - never carried.

I consider myself an honest guy and a helpful one. If you have questions about the gun, feel free to ask. If I can't answer your question, I'll do some research. That being said, you can keep your comments to yourself. I expect the buyer to present a CPL and valid ID. I'll be happy to show you mine. No exceptions. Sorry. If you want to text, send me your phone number via email.

I'm in no real rush to sell it. Ridiculous offers will be replied to as such.

Thanks for looking."

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our Exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seal the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

Shotgun has 25 rounds of buckshot through it. It also comes with an extra barrel and breaching choke. Functions flawlessly unfortunately I need new tires."
