Found out it was a Youth model but all in all it is everything anyone would want in a semi auto shotgun.Pictures really doesn't do it much justice, the light in my garage isn't the best...Its Super Light Weight and holds just as many rounds as my Remington 1100 model... Easily fits wherever. Found a few on other websites for around $460--$520 plus tax and shipping. I'm not and have not ever used this gun and would like to get my money back. (NOTHING WRONG WITH THE GUN)  I paid roughly $432 and change after taxes. I also purchased a choke tube for it but can't remember if I got the full or modified choke for it. It was another almost $40 after taxes. So almost $500 in this gun...Can't find them at Dicks anymore or at Sportsman's even Buds has sold out of them... Haven't tried anywhere else but I think you'll be happy with this gun if your in the market or looking for something similar. A few YouTube videos show the quick action of this guns capabilities...Really is a great gun. Bought this over Christmas. Asking $425 firm but I am open to ALL FAIR offers. The choke will be part of the deal , as far as I know it only fits this model and brand of gun.maybe a M3 brand?? Not really sure. Thanks for looking. Not interested in trades at the moment. I have a new purchase plan in mind and will be putting this towards that. Thanks again for taking the time to look at my post."

It has maybe shot 50 eds thru it.. it has.a 3x9 40.bushnel optics. It also has a sling and bipod. The leather sling optics and bipod all go with the rifle. The gun it basically brand new you won' find a cleaner used gun on the.market. This gun would be just what you want for your kids first deer gun. I will either take money or trde for this rifle. I am looking for any rifles pre1949 maybe mosin or kaiser something along those lines. I know the value of the gun so please don' try and 22s or something like that. I value the gun with all the attachments at.350 dollars and when I bought the gun it was more then that. I put the optics 100 bucks the bipod 30 bucks and the sling 25 bucks so add it up you are getting the gun for a good deal. Again send me what you have to trade please make sure it' pre 1949. Who knows maybe you have something really good if so I can always throw in some money or 243 eds. But to do that I would really have to like the gun you are trading me.

The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available.

The improvement reduces projectile deformation as it passes through the bore during the firing sequence and the projectile stays uniform instead of squeezing material on opposite side grooves. Hence, the more uniform projectile, the better the accuracy.   All Finished Barrels go through a 100% Inspection Process.   Inspections Equipment includes CMMs and Air Gauges for the Bores.   Our expectations is that our Barrels, 16 inch or longer, will hold a 1.000"" MOA at 100 yards with appropriate ammo and shooting techniques.

This 1941 BYF Black Widow is an amazing find remaining all original and in high condition. This excellent example is all matching with proper serials and stampings in place. A special notation goes to the two properly marked FXO aluminum base magazines which are serialized to the gun. The follower plate on the 2nd magazine does not show a line from loading indicating that was likely the back up that stayed in the holster. The later Black Widows had bakelite bottoms without being numbered to the gun making this one even more scarce. Also included in this offering is the 1941 Holster properly marked P.08 which contains the tool and provision for the 2nd magazine storage. The original Bakelite grips are still in place and remain in very good condition. We took a pin and heated it red hot touching it to the back of the grips with NO smoke to verify their authenticity. A very complete and high condition example of the extremely desirable Black Widow for your collection.EMAIL ME DIRECTLY VIA REDACTED
