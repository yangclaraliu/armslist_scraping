Pretty accurate, short crisp trigger & clean reset. Glock after market sights fit if you want to upgrade to TFO night sights. Grip is full size, yet narrow and sleek for a really good, comfortable feel. Single Action only, no second strike or double action, and no thumb safety.  This has been compared to a mix between the Glock 17 and the Arsenal Strike1.Full size pic rail up front has plenty of room for dots or lights. This is my home defense gun so I don't have a holster but that also means its finish is near prefect. Some wear is visible on the barrel at the ejection port.Custom color fill makes for a distinguished slide and grip.Some reviews say it fails to feed or fails to eject.  No.  I've put through over 100 rounds. First two mags had some failures. I polished the feed ramp, oiled her up, and ran it again. Since then it has run great out of both mags!  Looks like those reviewers didn't allow a proper break-in.Retail for this (hard to find) firearm is $300-400 and that's only with 1 magazine. I'm offering it, broken in with an extra mag for $250(obo) I'm looking for the sale, but I'll consider trades... i just want to get something I can carry concealed. Again: great for home defense or range time. Seriously comfortable to shoot. Fantastic ergonomics!"

Lets be honest here, there are a few knocks and dings in the rifle .  It was used prior to me making this post so lets all be adults here and realize its not brand new out of the box, but it is in damn good condition considering some of the others that are left out there.  Some people have commented on the forend having a gouge out of it.  The rifle took a spill about 40 years ago on a stump and a piece was broken off.  As I got older I took it upon myself to fix it and ended uniformly sanding the sides to mtch. In no way does this hinder the performance of the rifle.  If its really a big deal, I know a man personally who has the jigs to make a new one or there are replacements on the internet. I would rate the overall condition of this rifle at 95 % and have had a few people look at it and people that have seen me shoot it at the farm offer a considerable amount of money for it.  It also comes with 5 rounds of ammunition on an origional stripper clip ( I know what these go for and its right around 75-100$ a piece).I know what these rifles go for and what it is worth, so please dont waste your time or mine with a low ball offer.  The only trade that I would even consider is for an M1-Garand, 1917 enfield, 1903 springfield,  of course cash would be thrown in on my end......, or unless you have a sweet package deal of a few guns, seeing as I'm a Milsurp collecter and i might just need what you have CASH ONLY gets you....-The Rifle of course-The ammunition-The origional stripper clipp made for and the rifle itself-Soft sided transport caseLike I said lowballs will be ignored, but if you ave a reasonable one, throw it my way, you never know unless you ask.  I will also not sell to anyone unless you have a PTP, C/C or a C&R license.  I know you dont need one, but with all this shit going on in the world thats the last thing I need on my plate.CASH/TRADE ONLY LOCAL SALES ONLY.

It's chambered in 5.56X45mm NATO. It has a cold-forged 16"" barrel with a 1:7 twist. In November 2008, I paid $1675.00 for it at Scottsdale Gun Club. This was at the beginning of the Obama gun rush. This is a fairly rare rifle since it has ""Law Enforcement / Military Use"" or something similar rolled into the receiver. I haven't shot it much. I have put maybe 100 rounds through it total. It has been fitted with a premium gas piston system made by Adams Arms that allows you to adjust the gas pressure as needed, including for a suppressor. I paid $300.00 for this kit. I have put over $300.00 worth of Magpul accessories on it. I have also installed a Daniel Defense Omega 7.0 fore end on it. This I paid around $200.00 for. All the original Colt parts will convey in case you want to restore it to factory appearance (pretty easy). I'm including (6) 30- round Magpul Pmags with Ranger plates and dust covers. Optics not included, but can be negotiated separately. The scope is a super-clear Burris 1-4X24mm XTR 14 mounted with a Burris PEPR mount. I paid around 750.00 for the scope and 70.00 for the mount. This is not some garage-built Frankengun. This is the same rifle the Marines use. I'm asking $1250.00 for the rifle package. If you want the optics, $1750.00 The price is pretty firm. My phone number is REDACTED. Text is best since where I live the phone service is spotty. You can call me an leave a message, too. I'll include the owner's manual, cleaning rod, and two aluminum mags. I have some 5.56 ammo I'll make you a deal on also, if you're interested. Thanks."

There are countless militaries, law enforcement agencies, and practical shooting competitors around the world that wouldn’t use anything else. The Vepr 12-01 includes a Molot factory fixed tubular stock and has an adjustable padded cheek piece that accommodates both left and right handed shooters. The Vepr features a bolt hold open button to manually lock the bolt back. The bolt also locks back on an empty magazine. To release the bolt, either pull it back slightly or use the bolt release button. Magazines go in and out of the Vepr enlarged magazine well very easily, and do not require “rocking” them in as on the Saiga. Empty magazines drop free of the gun when released. The Vepr 12 ships with a 5 round magazine. Quality, durability, and attention to detail are the hallmarks of the Molot Vepr 12. Another example of this is the spring loaded pin on top of the dust cover latch which must be depressed in order to push the button in and lift up the top cover. This prevents the hinged dust cover from ever coming open if the gun is dropped, or during recoil. The all important bolt of the shotgun is precisely machined steel- not a cast component as on other AK platform guns. The Vepr comes with a Picatinny rail attached on the top of the dust cover for those wanting to use magnified or red-dot optics. If not, the Vepr 12 has the most easily adjustable rear sight of any shotgun. It offers tool-less repeatable adjustments for both elevation AND windage. A 19” chrome lined externally threaded barrel (same thread as Saiga) with muzzle cap completes the gun, and allows easy attachment of flash hiders, muzzles brakes, chokes, and sound suppressors. If you want the finest defensive personal protection shotgun in the world for your own, this shotgun is for you. Features: Hinged dust cover with a picatinny rail Original Molot Polymer Pistol Grip Original Molot Polymer Lower Handguard Original Molot  Polymer Upper Handguard Molot Self-Regulating Gas System Original Molot Competition Magazine Well One Original Molot Factory 5 round Magazine Molot Factory AK adjustable rear sight Factory chrome lined barrel, chamber, receiver shaft and gas chamber Factory last round bolt hold open Factory threaded barrel (thread pattern is the same as Saiga) Factory machined bolt assembly, gas blocks etc. (not cast like other AK shotguns) Cheek Rest unlocks and rotates on stock from right to left hand side for ambidextrous shooting."
