I will not prime and load the round due to legal issues, but I will make you the brass. Bring me your .223 brass and I will turn it into 300 Blackout brass for you! We can decide on a price or a trade or something. I am open to any and all ideas. I am not responsible for the quality of brass you bring me. It is your job to decide if the brass you are using is fit to be reloaded. All I am doing is turning your .223 into .300 BLK. I make it the right way, slowly and carefully. Start by cutting the .223, then trimming down to exact size before sizing. I size it, trim it again to proper length, and finally chamfer/debur it. SAAMI says 1.368 is the maximum case length. I will trim your brass to between 1.365 and 1.368. If you want it cleaned I could do that as well. If it's military brass I can de-crimp the primer pockets if you need me to. Any questions please ask."

.50 BMG Rifle Systems (Comes With: 10 Round Magazine, Carry Handle, Bipod, Monopod & Hard Carrying Case). All barrels are black.

After 30-plus years of making history, the powerhouse rifle that started it all is still leading the pack. With its low felt recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down.

For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made.

As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot."

It has the vent rib 28"" barrel that takes the Winchoke, Browning Invector (older style) Mossberg tubes and comes with 8 choke tubes from Cylinder to extra-full plus a turkey choke.  The extra barrel at 21 5/8"" is a great addition as a home defense, upland bird or turkey gun and will also take 2 3/4-3"" shells.  Colonial Arms of Georgia cut the vent rib barrel, turned down the end then installed a full size threaded bushing that will accept the same choke tubes as the original 28"" barrel.  Most mods like this use a thin wall choke tube that goes internal to the barrel where this one goes full size.  Its in 95% condition with no rust and only very minor handling marks.  Barrels are chrome lined (unlike todays ream jobs) clean and bright.  I have a buttplate that gives a 13 1/4"" LOP that is easy to install and works great for shorter shooters/heavy hunting clothes or put the pad back on for the big guys with only two screws.  This is one of the first autoloaders that reliably cycles the light 2 3/4"" to heavy 3"" loads.  It holds 4 rounds with pin removed or 3 with pin in place. Priced at $385 gun only, $175 short barrel only or $499 for both.  I only respond by phone so email your phone number to purchase or ask questions please.

It comes with 3 ten round mags one is a COLT mag and the other two are older made in the USA mags and they all work flawlessly. Also it comes in the original box with papers showing the gun model and telling about it. these guns are super rare and irreplaceable. A colt like this will only go up in value over time, i am asking 1200 OBO because i have seen them sell at upwards of 1800 mine does have a few tiny scratches but nothing to major, the gun works flawlessly it has had 300 rounds through it its whole life it is truly a colt collectors piece. the gun does come with 20 rounds of self defense ball ammo."

Description from LWRC:  

LWRCI™ has engineered a complete solution to the deficits found in the direct impingement M16/AR15/M4 family of rifles and carbines. The principal improvement comes from the incorporation of our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas-piston system. This system eliminates the venting of hot, carbon-laden gases into the receiver and bolt carrier group, thus eliminating the intensive cleaning regime of the legacy rifle. It also means the bolt carrier group and associated springs are not subjected to the searing heat of the tapped gasses, this being one of the major causes of small parts failure. This translates into carbines that are far more reliable than the legacy direct impingement carbines regardless of user maintenance.

Another benefit of our short-stroke gas-piston system is the improved handling characteristics of our weapons over the direct impingement legacy weapons. Recoil is lighter and muzzle rise is greatly reduced. Amazingly, this is accomplished in a carbine that is ergonomically identical, weighs almost the same, and retains 80% parts commonality with the legacy direct impingement carbine.

But our revolutionary short-stroke gas-piston system is only one of the improvements we’ve made in the legacy carbine. LWRCI™ rifles and carbines utilize cold hammer forged barrels made out of 41V45 steel alloy and treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology. Cold hammer forging takes an oversized barrel blank, and using high pressure rotary hammers, compacts the barrel blank over a mandrel. This forms perfect rifling devoid of tool marks. It also compacts the molecular structure of the metal making it denser and stronger. These barrels can take a lot more use and abuse than a standard barrel before any degradation in accuracy or loss of velocity. NiCorr™ surface conversion has proved more lubricious, harder wearing, more heat and corrosion resistant than the hard chrome normally used in the bore. Our barrels can handle 20,000 rounds before replacement, as compared to 6,000-10,000 rounds on a standard M4.

The bolt carriers of all M6™ rifles are now coated with a proprietary nickel coating that nearly eliminates corrosion while providing greatly increased lubricity. This coating provides permanent lubrication to the moving parts. This nickel coating is similar to that being used by the US Army Research Lab and USSOCOM to extend the service life of their weapons systems. 

Also available is the EOTech EXPS2 holographic weapon sight and Crimson Trace MVF-515 RED Modular Vertical Foregrip™ Red Laser / Light combo (Both brand new, never used).  Price for rifle, sight and foregrip - $3300.00"

Features:

Polymer Tip

The polymer tip increases the ballistic coefficient and also initiates dramatic expansion upon impact – even at velocities as low as 1600 fps.

Higher Ballistic Coefficient

Hornady® combines the sharp, pointed polymer tip with the most aerodynamic profile for a high ballistic coefficient. The V-MAX™ profile also provides the maximum bearing surface for added in-flight stability.

Swaged Lead Core

The swaging process allows for precise formation of the core up and around the tip, with a cavity under the tip's stem. This allows the tip to build up energy before smashing into the core, causing dramatic fragmentation of the core and jacket.

Precise Boattail & Flatbase Designs

Utilizing the proper base design provides incredible in-flight stability for long-range shooting."

Has few features nicer than a basic rifle, such as a M249 ""Machine Gun Steel"" barrel, mil-spec full auto M16 bolt carrier group, and Magpul furniture. Plus it is a mid-length gas-system that you dont see on many of these M4 style rifles with the 16"" barrel and has numerous advantages - it takes a longer handguard which offers more room for your hands and for mounting accessories, but more importantly is is softer shooting due to the fact the longer gas system slows down the cycling. Combined with the heavier full auto bolt carrier, this set-up offers the ultimate in reliability. Also included is one brand new Magpul 30 round PMAG. 

This gun is set up right and I do not NEED to sell it, so price is pretty firm - please no low-ball offers. **If interested and serious include a phone number in your reply.**

All on stripper clips.
It's in great condition, but does not have the stamp on the reciever, but it does have the ""handshake"" marked stamped in various places, showing its approval from the Argentine military inspectors.
They are valued anywhere between $100-$400, and even though mine is in stunning condition, without proper verification from an antique dealer, I have to list it at the lower end. The ammo is taken into consideration at lower than any I've found online.

I dare you to find a better working, smoother, prettier, modern rifle, and get this much ammo, for twice what I've listed this as.
Bore is clean, and rifling is flawless. A great gun for a budget hunter, or someone with an eye for history, backpacking (it's very light), survival (wood finish, and the renowned Mauser action), or just as display.

If I get it appraised from an antique gun shop, I'm sure I could get more, but I'd just like the cash for other projects sooner than that."
