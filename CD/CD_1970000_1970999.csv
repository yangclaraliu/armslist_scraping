If you don't this is the NATO pressure law enforcement round. Please note, this ammunition will, not, function in a .223. This is the 75gr BTHP, T2 bullet, crimped primer, temperature stabilized ball powder. 

The T2 projectile is designed to maximize ballistic performance and feeding in the M4?M16 platform.  All the other Hornady TAP uses a different projectile, primer and most importantly short cut extruded powder.  So, if your squirreling this away you can store this stuff for years and years, hot or cold, wet or dry, it will not be a problem.

This ammo will get the very best out of any AR.  Further this round can reach out accurately with power!

For those unfamiliar, here's one good sources: 

http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_3_16/283506_.html 

I've been looking for some of this for months now and its pretty much unobtainable to us non LE folk. Subsequently I tried to source it through a couple of LE folks I know. Apparently its pretty much unobtainable to them as well. After much effort I finally found some but the only way to get it was to buy a metric s***load. 

I live in San Francisco. No tax, you come to San Francisco and pay me green, capitalist, American, cash I hand you ammo. No BS. This is new stock, in factory boxes.  I'm happy to ship it.  Lesson learned thus far, shipping three cases cost $3-$4 more than the $20-$24 its cost to ship one to different places.

For the record this is, not, a profit making venture. I paid $255/case after shippng. Yeah, yeah I know, I won't even say you're wrong, but that was then, and this is now.  Look around, if you can find this stuff, my price is darned reasonable.  Hornady will not be manufacturing any more of this in 2013.  For the determined Hornady's production schedule can be found on-line.  

I'm pretty confident I can sell it for this price in this environment. Therefore the price is not negotiable. If you're looking to negotiate, get married or take on a business partner. 


I can also be reached at eight eight eight, four eight two, one nine nine nine. This is the number for my architectural practice. It rings through to my cell if I'm in the field.  Please note, the 888 number does, not, receive texts.

From 1939-1946 the Turks manufactured new 8mm Mausers in Ankara, instead of piecing old Mauser parts together.  They marked them K. Kale.  They made 250,000ish of them from 1939-1946.  This is a 1946 K. Kale.

It is in good shape for being a 1946 rifle.  If only this old rifle could talk.  The wood has no cracks or repairs, and is very solid, but has a fair share of dings and scratches.  The bore is actually great for a non-chromed lined, 67-year old barrel.  It has very deep lands and grooves with very solid rifling.  All numbers match, except the bolt, but the chances of finding one with a matching bolt is more than 1000 to 1.

The stock fire control group has been replaced with a Timney Trigger Systems 3.5lbs match trigger, which has been again tailored to cycle any ammunition. Unlike the brand new 716's, this one comes with all MagPul furniture; an ACS stock MOE grip aswell as an AFG. With the rifle comes Troy Battle sights which have already been zeroed at 100 meters.

Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
Features & System Characteristics:
    Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
    Grooved target triggers
    Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

Well it just so happens that I have yet to shoot more than 40 rounds through it to get it broken in and other wise it has just sat in my safe. I have since picked up an AR-10 pattern rifle and really no longer have a use for it so up for sale it goes. I really tried to use the best parts I could get my hands on and most are still unavailable today.

Components used-
-Mega Arms billet upper
-White Oak 6.8SPC 18"" barrel
-Troy VTac 15"" Alpha rail
-Gemtech Vortex flash hider/quickmount
-Precision Reflex 6.8SPC bolt

I never picked up a carrier for it since I was never able to locate one without a bolt.

The barrel was cerakoted Sniper Grey and assembled by Chris at Performance Arms here in Wichita. The work he does is phenomenal and one of the few people I trust with my rifles.

In addition to the upper I also have mags and ammo that will go with it.

RAM 110gr Hornady V-Max (Factory New Loaded) x1 box/20rds
Hornady once fired brass x40pcs

That is a total of 420 rounds to get you started with. As I mentioned above the barrel was broken in properly per WOA instructions with Hornady 110gr V-Max and as sat since. I want to sell it as a whole package and would prefer not to split it up. I am looking to get $1250 for the lot.

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.


Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours

Have some bank invested in your home theater set up at home?  Or are you going to treat yourself to a nice home theater set up this Xmas?  Then this is the one piece of gear you need.  If your firearms have just been sitting there gathering dust or you're moved on to better firearms, perhaps we can help each other out.  I have  a brand new Furman home theater 7 outlet line conditioner. It is still in original box and has never been used.  Furman line conditioners are high end home theater power management/protection systems, not your cheap surge suppressor. There's a Furman Elite 15 which is $380+tax on Amazon.com right now.   If you have expensive home theater gadgets, you need this.
I don't mind you ending up with a slightly better trade, if we trade.. but I would like to keep the trade fairly close to current market prices.   So if your rifle is close to $150 in used value,  I wouldn't trade away the $399 Furman unit.  
I'm not interested in outlaying any cash...looking for outright trades only. Provide me details of your item (make, model, what's included, age, condition, number of rounds through it so I can fully research).  I would fully expect you to inspect and test my items should we get to that point....so please understand I'd like to do the same and would be open to your suggestions on how to op-test your rifle.  I'd waive that inspection if you're active duty or a Veteran."

It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.Up for auction is a New in Box Savage 110 BA in .338 Lapua with Hillbilly 223 camo, and Leupold Mark 4 8.5-25x50 2nd focal TMR. The opening bid is for rifle only, the buy it now price is for the scope, rings, and bipod. If you would like a different shade/camo we can order it several different ways just email us and we can advise you the turn around time frame.

The appearance of the Model 110 BA from Savage is as radical as the extreme accuracy it delivers. The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more. 

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made.Shipping/handling for this rifle will be $55. Insurance will be added unless you request it not to be and will cost 1.75% of the price of the gun to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price in this auction reflects a 5% discount for certified funds that is not given if you pay with a credit card. The value of all merchandise traded will be treated like certified funds; therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the shipment, California orders on firearms will be charged an additional $25 transfer fee. If wiring funds there will be a $25 charge."

Read up on these guns. Watch nutnfancy's review on youtube. They're of excellent quality.
This model is the newer model with the magpul flip-up rear sight. The only difference between this gun and it's much more expensive counterpart is that it has no dust cover or forward assist. Which in my opinion are totally unnecessary and only add extra weight.
The gun has only had about 150 rounds through it and let me tell you IT IS ACCURATE!!!  I have had 2 other AR15s and they both pale in comparasin to this one in the accuracy department. My rock river is close but not quite as accurate (even at double the price tag) and the dpms oracle (first AR) can't touch this guns accuracy. 
Features:
-standard flash hider
-bayonet/launcher lug
-Mission 1st Tactical stock (vltor look-alike w/ enhanced cheek weld, q.d. Sling mount & multiple battery storage) 
-I forget the brand and model of grip but it's very good.

-3 custom stippled 30rd Pmags (2 black 1 FDE)
-highly sought after Primary Arms red dot (rare AA model)
-high Rise mount for perfect co-witness.
-coast flash light and mount. (~120-160 lumens) bright as hell.
-magpul angle for grip.
-magpul rail covers
-150 mixed ammo (.223, 5.56 & a few steel cases Tula)
-mystery brand Single point sling. 
-mystery brand bi-pod.
-comes in original box with manual.
-original furnature included. 
-about 200 once fired 223/5.56 brass.
-medium profile16"" barrel (not crappy m4 profile) this thing is a tack driver!
-this model has a trigger guard that will easily fit a gloved hand.

theres probably more stuff inforgot but the point is this is a complete package... No missing parts. Just buy and shoot same day. 
The price I posted is just kind of the average I've seen this type of gun go for on this very site. And they sell fast!
I'm looking for cash offers... Trades will be considered but unless its an lr308/ar-10 or some other kind of semi-auto .308/7.62x51 I can't guarantee anything. But I have been swooned by many guns in my day and it'd be foolish to assume I won't be again.

This is a very compact, light weight red dot sight. It runs on a single CR2032 battery, and has a solar panel to supplement battery life (which must work since I have been using the same battery for the last two years), and uses a sensor to automatically adjust the 3.5 MOA dot's brightness level for the current surroundings. It has an integral QD mount that is very quick and easy to operate, and has held its zero very well for me (admittedly, I seldom shot past 100 yards with it). It has the fastest activation switch on any red dot I have ever used, with very easy controls: touch the switch to activate the sight, touch then hold the switch to raise the dot's intensity, and touch - touch - hold to lower the dot's intensity. It has an auto shut-off feature if left on for four continuous hours, or you can simply hold the switch down for three seconds to manually turn the sight off. The lenses are in very good condition, no apparent scratches that I can see. The body of the sight is in good condition as well, but the sight does exhibit some wear on the bar that fits between the picatinny rails. I am including the protective rubber cover and I will throw in a 3/4"" riser (allows a proper lower 1/3 co-witness with your iron sights on an AR-15) that I cut short to fit this sight and leave room for a magnifier. I really like this sight, but I am consolidating my sights to those that take CR1/3N batteries or no batteries at all, and selling my others to build a little capital.

I am looking to trade for a used but decent Trijicon RX30, a Trijicon RMR, a Meprolight M-21, or an Aimpoint Comp M2/M3/C3/ML3/PRO, depending on the condition of your sight and the type of mount. Let me know what you have and what you're thinking and we can discuss a trade. I will take $395 to sell this outright. I am willing to meet locally or ship this at the buyer's expense. Thanks for looking, and please check out my other listings for a great deal on some new in the box Aimpoint CompM4's."

Burris FastFire II Red-Dot Reflex Sight w/ 4 MOA Dot Reticle Product Info

The Burris FastFire II Red Dot Sight dramatically increases aiming speed and accuracy. This red dot simplifies the act of aiming by eliminating the need to focus on and alignimage the front sight, rear sight and target. With the Burris FastFire 2 Red Dot Reflex Sight, the aiming dot and target are always in focus and properly aligned for the ultimate in accuracy. Originally developed as a red dot sight for semi-automatic handguns that could withstand the abuse of slide mounting, this tiny but tough, non-magnifying, reflex type red dot sight by Burris has proven to be a terrific fast target acquisition sight for turkey shotguns, deer slug guns, tactical and close range hunting carbines, muzzleloaders, paint ball guns, home defense shotguns and even upland and waterfowl shotguns. The Burris FastFire Red Dot Reflex Sight weighs in at just 2 ounces, fully mounted, and with its all metal housing construction and advanced circuitry, the Burris FastFire II Red Dot Sight w/ 4 MOA Dot Reticle is extremely robust, shrugging off recoil forces up to 1000 G's. A target directed light sensor automatically adjusts and controls the brightness of the 4MOA red dot reticle for maximum visibility based on the ambient light conditions - from very dim in dark conditions to very bright in sunlight. With unlimited eye relief, the Burris FastFire II Waterproof Red Dot Reflex Sight can be used on handguns, rifles and shotguns and its low magnification provides an extremely large field of view and the ability to aim with both eyes open.

It is in excellent condition, and I'm including the $25 optional Volquartsen front sight (only) and all mounting screws.  I can allow a partial credit to a buyer who can trade me a Hi-Viz (or similar) front Fiber Optic Sight to fit the same Ruger .22 pistol with 5.5 inch bull barrel.  Picture shows the rail mounting system on my pistol, but the pistol, rear sight, and red dot sight are NOT for sale.  Additional info follows:

The tactically-influenced mount for the Ruger MKII and MKIII features a mil-spec Picatinny-style rail on both the top and bottom to provide an efficient double-mounting platform for virtually any combination of conventional scope, red-dot optic, laser-aiming device or tactical light. The new mount attaches easily to any Mark II, MKIII, and 22/45 models with a 5.5"" bull barrel. The sturdy, yet, lightweight mount is CNC-machined from billet aluminum.  If installing the mount on a MKII that does not have the receiver drilled and tapped, this will need to be done prior to installing the mount.

My price is $125.   Pick up in N. Austin, or I can ship if everything is paid for in advance. Paypal is accepted if the fee is paid for by the buyer."

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns ... and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art. 

The P22 features a novel ambidextrous magazine release located at the bottom rear of the trigger guard. A nod toward the North American market, the magazine drops free with the activation of its latch.

Not interested in bows, crossbows, or black powder.

6""x6""x40"", pure 304 Stainless Steel. Tank, cover, and Stainless Steel ball valve are included. 

We are proud to offer the very best Parkerizing Tanks in the industry. They are cut and formed out of pure 304 stainless steel. Handles are formed right into the ends. All edges of these tanks are hemmed, so there are no exposed sharp edges. Feel free to handle these tank with your bare hands! 

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

There is also an inflatable floatation bladder that gets placed forward and then blown up with a filler tube- nice to have a little safety insurance in case you capsize.

The Benelli Cordoba is a lightning-fast 12-gauge shotgun or 20-gauge shotgun, especially built for hunting. Inspired by the high volume of dove shooting found around Cordoba, Argentina, the designers of Benelli shotguns engineered this one with all the advanced features of a serious sporting clays model. Incorporated into the Cordoba is the 10-mm tapered sporting rib favored by competition shooters and porting to keep barrel climb to a minimum
The ComforTech® stock cushions the blow when ammo isn’t measured in boxes, but by cases in an afternoon. The ComforTech® system also helps reduce barrel climb and puts the shooter back on target 69% faster, so that the Cordoba just may be the fastest field gun ever built. A Crio® barrel and extended Crio® choke tubes put more pellets on target. And the whole package is finished in matte black GripTight® coating or Realtree MAX-4®, so a reflected flash won’t give you away."
