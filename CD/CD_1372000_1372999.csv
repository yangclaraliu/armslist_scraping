Webbing is perfect.  Clips all work perfectly.  Retaining straps in perfect condition.  Both have a lining in them to protect finish of gun.
Rec'd them in a trade with friend but won't work on my Sig 229 as thought.  These are expensive tactical holsters if on retail shelf.  

First holster w/2 leg straps has a Code ""6004-77-SIG"" (100.00) and matches second holster w/1 leg strap that states ""SIG 225-228"" (100.00).  Safariland, these are top of line rigs.

Local trade preferred.  What do you have to barter with (ammo-Sig 229 concealment holsters, a .25 or .380 pocket pistol for both)?  No duty rigs needed.  Open to suggestion that I might not be considering right now, we can agree or disagree.  Saying ""yes"" or ""no"" is not a bad thing.  Make offer....

Will mail out to US only if sold.  No personal checks.  Will take money order or Pay Pal check first and send holster to you."

Smooth light trigger pull. Even has a bullet indicator where you can see if there is brass chambered on top of pistol. Keep in mind that this pistol has NO SAFETY. Comes with 2 double stacked magazines that holds 10 + 1 in the chamber. The magazines can also be used in a Sig Sauer .357. Has 3 different sized interchangeable grips for different hand sizes. Field stripping is a breeze. I have only shot this pistol 50 times with various grains and brands plus hollow points and have no FTF or FTE. It comes with the original blue Smith and Wesson hard cased box, owners manual, original test fire cartridge and wire lock and key for child protection. I have taken very good care of this pistol even when I only shoot it with two bullets I clean it after every shooting. I am also throwing in an inside the waistband black leather holster that clips to your belt that was made for this pistol, very comfortable. Included in the deal is a box of 50 Winchester 155 grain hollow points and a factory laser I have installed on the lower pica-tinny rail under the barrel, you can take it off if you like but its sighted in perfectly at 10 feet. While the laser is installed it will not fit in holster so keep that in mind. But with all this I am throwing in I am asking for $500. Price is not negotiable. I prefer cash on hand and just a signature from you for my documents in case you were ever have to use it in self defense I can prove I sold it to you. If you would like I copy I can give you one also. Your choice. I also have Golden Saber 180 grain bullets and PVU bullets you can buy if you would like but that will cost extra but at a good deal.

I have worked up loads that perform sub-moa, but in the 3 years I have owned it I haven't sent too many rounds down range with it because when I do shoot .223 I grab my 700 or my encore. I estimate that about 200 rounds have been fired through it.  This can be traded with optics, bipod, and mount or without. Aside from the 10 round magazine shown, I have a stack of 30 rounders as well that can be thrown in for the right deal and I do have 130 rounds of Lake city military ball ammo on stripper clips and 160 rounds of Wolf.

It seems (acording to Dieter Marschall in ""Handguns of the Armed Organizations of the Soviet Occupation Zone and German Democratic Republic"") that these little .25 ACP pistols were status symbols in East Germany. Marshall states that the Tezet was not supposed to be worn in an outside belt holster by regulations but this was widely ignored by high party officials, staff officers, and Stasi. I have also read where female police officers prefered this pistol. I know that the belt holsters are few and far between. However I do know where to obtain/aquire a brand new shoulder rig for an additional $50 .. Let me know if interested.

The Vzor 45, commonly known as CZ 45 is a compact blowback operated semi-automatic pistol chambered in .25 ACP . It was made in Czechoslovakia and later in the Czech Republic . Derived from the CZ-36 following World War II, the CZ-45 is currently manufactured by Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod as theCZ-92.
In 1945 the CZ-36 was redesigned by Jan Kratochvil to make it easier (hence cheaper) to manufacture and became the Vzor 45 (model 1945) but is generally known as CZ-45. The safety lever which had sometimes appeared on the CZ-36 was eliminated (though a few early model 45s were manufactured with a safety lever). The changes included the addition of a side plate to simplify assembly and a magazine safety. The CZ-36 had a connector from the trigger to the hammer that ran on the left side of the magazine, whereas the CZ-45 has a Browning style stirrup-shaped connector that runs on both sides of the magazine.
The overall design of the receiver, slide, guide rod, and recoil spring are very similar to the earlier Browning .25 design. The barrel mount is also like the Browning, with a single lug that rotates into a slot in the frame. The trigger pivots on a pin.
When the trigger is activated and the hammer is down, the connector is pulled forward, rotating the hammer backward into cocked position. When the hammer reaches full cock, it is freed to fall and strike the firing pin , which ignites the cartridge. The hammer is not cocked by the slide--technically speaking, this is a self-loading repeating pistol, not an automatic or semi-automatic. Other than the heavy double-action trigger pull, the only safety mechanism is the magazine safety. When the magazine is inserted, it moves a bar which allows the connector to engage the sear. When the magazine is removed from the gun, the bar disconnects the trigger from the sear.
Disassembly is similar to the Browning. Remove the magazine and make sure the chamber is empty. Draw the slide back about 1 centimeter and rotate the barrel clockwise a quarter-turn. Remove the barrel and slide forward off the receiver. Other than the guide rod and recoil spring, there are no small parts that come loose.
The CZ-45 holds 8 rounds in the magazine and has a simple groove down the top of the slide for sighting. Its great merits are its simplicity and reliability, ease of field-stripping, and accuracy--despite its primitive sighting groove and double action only trigger.
The only design weakness in the CZ-45 is a brittle firing pin (like the CZ 52 ). This gun should never be dry fired.
In 1992 the gun was slightly redesigned, given a magazine release behind the trigger and a futuristic grip, and is now sold as the CZ-92. Unfortunately, due to the Gun Control Act of 1968, the gun can no longer be imported into the U.S., as it is too small. After the GCA blocked further importation, US Manufacturer Intratec started producing a near-exact clone called the Protec, though the build quality is somewhat lower.
CZ-45's are somewhat rare in the US resale market and go for about $250 in good condition and up to $500 in mint condition. CZ-92's are virtually non-existing in the US and go for higher prices, despite the limited applications of the .25 ACP as a self-defense round.
The CZ Custom Shop in the United States is planning to produce a limited run of US-made CZ 92's. A prototype was shown at the 2011 SHOT Show. CZ Custom aims to have the US-made CZ-92 included in the CZ Catalog at the 2012 SHOT Show. It is not confirmed if the chambering will remain .25ACP or possibly switch to .32 or .380.
The modern successors to the Model CZ-45 are the Seecamp .25 and .32, the North American Arms .32 and .380, and the Kel-Tec P-32 and P-3AT.

GOVERNMENT IS BUYING UP ALL THE AMMUNITION- Brietbart
Something strange is going on. Federal non-military agencies have bought two billion rounds of ammunition in the last 10 months. The Obama Administration says that federal law enforcement agents need the ammunition for “mandatory quarterly firearms qualifications and other training sessions.”
Radio show host Mark Levin is suspicious. He commented:
To provide some perspective, experts estimate that at the peak of the Iraq war American troops were firing around 5.5 million rounds per month. At that rate, the [Department of Homeland Security] is armed now for a 24-year Iraq war. A 24-year Iraq war! I’m going to tell you what I think is going on. I don’t think domestic insurrection. Law enforcement and national security agencies, they play out multiple scenarios. … I’ll tell you what I think they’re simulating: the collapse of our financial system, the collapse of our society and the potential for widespread violence, looting, killing in the streets, because that’s what happens when an economy collapses. I suspect that just in case our fiscal situation, our monetary situation, collapses, and following it the civil society collapses, that is the rule of law, they want to be prepared. I know why the government’s arming up: It’s not because there’s going to be an insurrection; it’s because our society is unraveling. 
An economic collapse?

THATS TERRIBLE NEWS..

375 H&H Mag

The Rifle – Ruger #1 falling block

The specific rifle is the “Ruger 1 – H Tropical” – Ruger’s model number 1320. It’s an all-steel falling block rifle, blued, and single shot with American walnut furniture. The gun weighs in at just over 9 pounds with the barrel length of 24 inches and an overall length of 40 1/2 inches (a larger barrel-to-overall-weight ratio than most hunting rifles). The rifling is a one in twelve-inch right-handed twist with six grooves; the iron sights are adjustable flip up (rear) and a front bead. The rifle can best be defined as stocky, with a definitive style and attitude. The bluing is fairly highly polished and all the edges are rounded. The walnut is finished in a semi-gloss, and it looks as though it’s been hand rubbed. The focal point of the rifle, aside from its “girthy” barrel, is of course the trigger guard, which doubles as the actuator for the falling block. It’s a simple yet classy piece of finish work on a utilitarian yet beautiful rifle.

The falling breech block is simple and built for strength; the sliding tang safety is reminiscent of an over-under shotgun and is inherently usable. Ruger includes a preinstalled quarter rib scope base that uses Ruger brand scope rings and an ejection mechanism that is fully adjustable and allows for easier brass collection if the hunter desires extraction only. An extra on an otherwise somewhat-minimalist rifle is the sling swivel studs.

The Caliber – .375 H&H

The .375 H&H is one of the first belted cartridges, a feature given to brass to prepare it for the rigors and power of Magnum loads and to facilitate easier breech loading in the bolt action rifle, which, at the time of the .375 H&H’s introduction (1912), was essentially a new technology (at least not yet an established widespread technology). The cartridges tapered slightly, another design execution specifically made for easy chambering and extraction, which has continued to this day. As a side note: Belting a cartridge also facilitated better head spacing for tapered cartridges, though, contrary to popular belief, that was not the only purpose.

While many African countries’ specific laws consider it the minimum cartridge for dangerous game, in North America it’s considered an appropriate and exceptional cartridge for large game.

The cartridge tends to be incredibly flat shooting, relatively speedy, and delivers an incredibly good amount of impact (while maintaining a very consistent point of impact), allowing easier transition between iron sights and scope. Because of these unique characteristics, it’s considered one of the best large game all-around rifle cartridges on the planet. Many safari regulars use it, and it has high praise from professional hunters, trackers, and guides.

Bullet grain weights range between 200 and 380 grains, with a typical load being a 270-grain verging on 2,700 ft./s and 4,400 foot-pounds of energy and barrel exit. This load compares favorably to a .30-06 at 180 grains in terms of trajectory, but the .375 H&H delivers about 12,00 foot-pounds more energy.

The 300-grain projectile is perhaps the cartridge’s best-known bullet weight; it typically achieves (with factory loads) 2,500+ ft./s and 4,250+ foot-pounds of energy – comparing favorably (trajectory wise) to the 180-grain .308 projectile.

Some factory loads are now pushing a 300-grain projectile at nearly 2700 ft./s and 4,800 foot-pounds of energy—an absolutely devastating combination of ballistic potential.

Interestingly, unlike many hunting rifle cartridges, there has never really been a use outside of “dangerous game hunting” for the .375 H&H Magnum, and it has never seen wartime usage by any major army.

Because of its popularity and incredible balance of speed and impact, it has perhaps been the single most implemented cartridge in dangerous game hunting since its inception, and it has likely killed more large dangerous game than any other cartridge in history. Its recoil and muzzle snap tend to be more of a dull roar that an all-out attack on the shooter, and relatively speaking, it has lower recoil than most of the big-game rifle cartridges.

The cartridge has played Frankenstein for a lot of other cartridges, including a popular wildcat called the .375 H&H Ackley improved, as well as the .375 Weatherby Magnum.

The .300H&H is tough to find, so the blue book value on this rifle is higher than the more popular calibers.  The stock on this rifle has laquer flaking off.  The metal is in great shape, the bore and crown are perfect.  The floorplate bluing is a little faded.  The recoil pad is Weatherby (i think) and in terrible shape.  I bought a Winchester replacement pad, but haven't installed it yet.  I'll throw that in with the gun.

I am asking $1400 or best offer.  I would prefer not to ship the rifle.  I would consider a trade for a complete .458 SOCOM upper with BCG and charging handle.

Super solid old school Mossberg pump. Chambered for 2 3/4 and 3in shells. 5 rd tube. Engraved ejection slide. Full length vented rib 30 inch barrel. Exactly the same as a Mossberg 500 but with a anti rattle mechanism in the magazine too prevent jams. Gun is a bit beat up, could use wood refinished and metal reblued. Large scuffs on metal and forend on ejection side (shown in pictures). Action is tight and smooth. Only problem is trigger assembly is cracked. Just buy a new one and drop it in. Would be a great first duck gun or home defense shotgun with minimal work and money. Just not a Mossberg guy. $175."

I won't kid anyone, it has some age and could use a little TLC.  It has some beautiful old walnut on stock and I only wish I knew it's history.  There isn't a lot of blue on it but I'm gettin' kind of gray, too, and this old timer is probably older than me by a long shot.  I've looked and looked to try to find when the Mod 17 first was developed.  Anyone with any ideas, please let me know, because if this guy doesn't sell, I'm going to try to fix it up best as I can and pass it on.  I have NOT fired it yet but the safety, pump mechanism, hammer, trigger...all are functional.  Not knowing Mod 17s, I'll be honest with you and tell you to see the one pic where the pc comes out of the bottom when you open it up.  I really don't know if that's ok or is supposed to do that."

I found more norma brass for it, 97 pieces now. Coyote in picture was 285 yardsish I hit the exact hold point I was aiming at. This model gun only, starts at 1070.00 new from ruger today. This one is like new fired only about 60 times. This is quite a deal. Most people can almost make clover leavers at 200 yards with the 22ppc cartridge. Barrel is floated from the factory. It is a record breaking Bench rest or distance hunting for varmints gun. Very collectible. I am the sole owner and have not had time to work up a load much until recently. Only about 50 rounds sent down range. Grouping 1.5 inch at 275 yards with 55 grain nosler Ballistic tip #39526 and 27.5 grains BLC-2 Powder. Just sighted it in and started with one load first. I know the gun can do so much more than the time i can give it. Those in the know can testify to the accuracy of this cartridge. Gun is stock from factory no adjustments made. I think the trigger is 2.5 lb . Bi pod is 180 degree reversible so you can sling the weapon comfortably. Only one small scratch on right rear of stock which happened when it was shipped home from when I was in the service. Bought it in 1995 and have not had the time to work with it. Comes with about 97 pieces of Norma brass fired only once and 25 pieces have never been fired. Also a two die rcbs set of reloading dies comes with it. Of course the sling and bipod too. Has a simmons 6-18X40 scope which works fine. seller pays shipping. Sorry for the dull pictures. My camera doesn't do it justice. If you are looking to get in to bench shooting this is a very cost effective way to start. The gun alone now books for $800.00 The brass was about $1.00 each when purchased totaling $100.00 The scope was about $225.00. The bi pod and sling another $75.00 And the reloading Dies are 145.00 now from midway. This is a highly collectible gun. total worth 1350.00 I am asking much less than that. Thanks for looking.

The Megastar pistol is a heavy, powerful pistol, which appeared on the markets in 1993. It was designed and manufactured by the Spanish company Star Bonifacio Echeverria SA, and its design is based on the previous guns by the same manufacturer, such as Star 30M. Production of the Megastar was completed in the late 1990s.
Megastar is a recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol. It uses a Browning High-Power type locking system with tilting barrel. Megastar is a hammer fired pistol, with double action trigger and ambidextrous, slide mounted safety-decocker lever. The safety lever has three positions: upper one for ""fire"" mode, red dot is shown; medium one for ""safe"" mode, this withdraws and locks the firing pin; and the lower one for safe decocking (after decocking safety lever springs back to the ""safe"" position). Megastar also features a magazine disconnect safety which does not allow to fire the gun with out the magazine in the place. Megastar slide and frame are made from the steel, and like other latest Star pistols, Megastar has internal slide rails, instead of more usual external rails. This pistol features non-ajustable sights. Magazine capacity is quite impressive, especially when speaking about the period of the early 1990s, and is 12 rounds of .45ACP or 14 rounds of 10mm Auto.
Overall, Megastar represents one of the strongest designs in auto-pistols, heavy but powerful and built to last forewer. Heavy weight also helps to control the recoil of the powerful cartridges used."

It already had the factory buffer upgrade installed, so it is a recent build.  I had wanted an HK USC but couldn't find 1 so I decided to get this because it took Glock mags that I already had.  I ended up finding a USC this weekend, and as much as I would like to keep both, I have other projects I would like to fund.

The build on this JRC is awesome.  It feels just as solid (if not more) than my Colt LE6920.  I have shot it side by side with a High Point 4545....sure the JRC is more expensive but worth it in my opinion.  I shot a 5 inch group with iron sights at 75 yards this weekend, where the HighPoint was no better than10"" groups.  I also like that it uses AR parts and tools, so it is a dream to work on.  If you haven't played with one and you are in the market for a 45 carbine, you should consider this firearm.

I have out exactly 200 rounds through it.  185 gr HP, 200 gr RN, 230 gr HP, all worked like a dream.  I am happy to answer any questions.  Gun comes with all original paperwork in the original box with one 13-round factory glock mag. Aftermarket sights NOT included.   $950 OBO.  Shoot me an email.  Thanks for looking."

There are no importer's marks other than Sigarms. This pistol also has a removable lanyard loop and a manual thumb safety. This pistol is unfired in its original hard case, with all paperwork and three factory zipper back magazines, one of which is stainless steel. Beside the caliber, the manual thumb safety and the removable lanyard loop were only offered on the Japanese police pistols.
