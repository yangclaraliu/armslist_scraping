If the right deal can be made that is great, if not I have no problem holding on to this rifle as it will only increase in value over time. 

I do think these are a great buy right now if you can find them. With the cost of .223 ammunition going through the roof, the major price advantage it held over .308 is gone. Ammunition is now comparable in cost between the two. For the same price as a higher end AR15/M4 platform you can gain a rifle with significantly more firepower and range, with ammunition that is relatively just as expensive. Although I have never taken a M1A hunting, It would be an excellent rifle for big game.

Glocks

158,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1167158,For Sale:  VLTOR TANGO DOWN MOD POD (BI-POD),"Tri-Cities, Washington, Washington, United States",$ 150,"Listed On: Friday, March 1, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"SLIGHTLY USED, MSRP $180.  The Vltor Modpod utilizes the rail mounting components of the Scout Mount series and the Tangodown bipod. At first, Vltor was originally going to develop their own bipod legs, but instead chose the robust TD legs. Unlike the TD bipod, Vltor bipod legs fold forward and rearward, locking into each 90 degree position. This gives the user multiple mounting options.

Most rail systems will work with the Vltor ModPod, but with a few exceptions, including the 7-inch (Carbine Length) rail system. If mounted at the muzzle end of the rail and with the legs folded, the bipods legs may interfere with the weapons ejection process. So, for the short rail systems, Vltor recommends a mid-mounted position. Mid-length rail systems are a little more bipod friendly; unless they are totally extended (third position) then it may hamper the ejection process. The ModPod was mainly developed for a rifle/SPR type system. With the legs totally extended, the bipod legs work perfectly on any rifle length rail system.

From Kel-Tec:
PMR-30
The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

252,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1167252,For Sale:  VLTOR TANGO DOWN MOD POD (BI-POD),"Hermiston, Pendleton and La Grande, East Oregon, Oregon",$ 150,"Listed On: Friday, March 1, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"SLIGHTLY USED MSRP $180. The Vltor Modpod utilizes the rail mounting components of the Scout Mount series and the Tangodown bipod. At first, Vltor was originally going to develop their own bipod legs, but instead chose the robust TD legs. Unlike the TD bipod, Vltor bipod legs fold forward and rearward, locking into each 90 degree position. This gives the user multiple mounting options.

Most rail systems will work with the Vltor ModPod, but with a few exceptions, including the 7-inch (Carbine Length) rail system. If mounted at the muzzle end of the rail and with the legs folded, the bipods legs may interfere with the weapons ejection process. So, for the short rail systems, Vltor recommends a mid-mounted position. Mid-length rail systems are a little more bipod friendly; unless they are totally extended (third position) then it may hamper the ejection process. The ModPod was mainly developed for a rifle/SPR type system. With the legs totally extended, the bipod legs work perfectly on any rifle length rail system.

The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells).  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.  The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."

 VIP Unconditional Lifetime Warranty
    First Focal Plane Subtensions remain consistent throughout the magnification range.
    Optically Indexed Lenses Delivers optimum image sharpness and brightness with true reticle use for full ranging and holdover from edge to edge because of computer-controlled alignment during construction.
    XD Lens Elements Extra-low dispersion (XD) glass enhances resolution, color, and contrast.
    XR Lens Coatings Vortex XR proprietary anti-reflection lens coatings increase light transmission with multiple coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces.
    30 mm Tube Provides greater strength and wider adjustment lattitude as compared to a 1-inch tube.
    Aircraft-Grade Aluminum Construction from a solid block of 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum delivers increased strength and rigidity.
    Waterproof O-ring seals prevent moisture, dust, and debris from getting inside the tube for reliable performance in all environments.
    Fogproof Filled with argon gas to inhibit internal fogging over a wide range of temperatures.
    Shockproof Lenses are locked in place, fore and aft, with machined locking rings to remain in perfect alignment and resist impact.
    Hard Anodized Finish Type-3 hard-coat anodization is durable; the low-glare matte helps camouflage the shooter's position.
    ArmorTek Ultra-hard, scratch-resistant coating repels oils and corrosive salts on outer glass surfaces.
    CRS Zero Stop Customizable Rotational Stop (CRS) prevents dialing more than one rotation below your zero so you don't lose the zero when dialing large amounts of elevation corrections. Patent pending.
    Tall Uncapped Turrets Make range calculation and shooting adjustments fast and accurate with subtension marks that match the reticle .
    First Focal Plane Reticle Scale of reticle remains in proportion to the zoomed image. Constant subtensions allow accurate holdover and ranging at all magnifications - no shift in point of impact during zoom.
    Single Spring Construction Fully constrains (without over-constraining) the optical system for predictable, improved accuracy throughout the range of elevation adjustment.
    Glass-etched Reticle Protected between two layers of glass (not made from wire) for optimum durability and reliability.
    Illuminated Reticle Electronic illumination aids in low light visibility of reticle. Battery included.
    Illumination Control Can be turned on or off with a single click between each intensity level—allowing access to a preferred illumination setting without having to progress through each intensity level. Positioned at 45 degrees off the left side of the eyepiece for easy adjustment without blocking view of the turret setting or magnification.
    MagView Bar Combines a fiber optics magnification indicator with raised rear-facing magnification references for clear viewing in low light conditions. Patent pending.
    Radius Bar Fiber optic turret rotation indicator provides illuminated and tactile point of reference for turret rotations. Patent pending.
    Fast Focus Eyepiece Allows quick and easy reticle focusing.
    Side Parallax Uses an adjustment mechanism on the left side of the riflescope to fine-tune focus to eliminate parallax shooting error."
