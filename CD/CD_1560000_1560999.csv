The Benelli SuperNova is a completely new modular design concept in pump action shotguns. With the optional SteadyGrip stock, the SuperNova can be transformed into a high-performance turkey gun or tack driving, fully-rifled slug gun for deer. There's even a barrel with rifle sights for home defense, and a SuperNova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight and pistol grip. At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the new SuperNova super light, super strong, and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova isn't just tough on the outside. With its dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel-to-steel inside the barrel, the SuperNova is rock solid to the core. Because the new SuperNova is built tough, it makes no compromises. Chambered for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells and 3-1/2"" magnum turkey loads, this pump gun can do it all."

The great thing about the GEN 4 GLOCK 30 is the flexibility. In GEN 3 you have the 30 and 30SF (with a smaller grip). The GEN 4 has the straps so you can have either. No strap is the same size as the 30SF and the medium strap makes it the same as the 30 (GEN 3)
It also comes with 3 mags and the larger mag release. The 30 is the one GLOCK I think is better in GEN 4"

Below from magpuls website:
Modified internal and external geometry provides greater compatibility and function with a wide range of non-AR15/M16 platform weapons. A re-designed bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine allows increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the PMAG 30 M3 will not over-insert on compatible weapons, including the AR15/M16, HK 416, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others.

Great idea:

April 15, 2013 is the day NY State Police are supposed to make the ""assault rifle"" registration form available.

This link has a preliminary draft of the form:
http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/201...stration-form/

The form can be mailed or filled out online and submitted electronically. You will receive a verification either by mail or email once they've processed your registration.

It's expected that there will be little if any compliance from gun owners.

So I was thinking that instead of using non-compliance to show my contempt for the law, perhaps over-compliance will be more effective.

I thought I'd mail in a couple bogus registrations a week until the one year registration period is over. If every gun owner did the same thing, we could literally overwhelm the database and backlog any verification/disqualification for years.

The preliminary form asks for name, dob, address, last four numbers of your social security number, and your NYS driver license number. I was thinking I'd put ""non-applicable"" in the driver license number box and make up everything else. Maybe pull some names from the obituaries and police blotter. I figured I'd use apartment buildings as the address for most of my bogus registrations, since its much less likely that the post office will get a return to sender notice from an apartment complex as opposed to a single family home.

Even if they get a return to sender notice, or an application with no driver license number, they are going to have to enter it and do their due diligence to ""keep us safe."" I mean, if someone registers a full auto Ma Deuce, or a felon has submitted a registration form, they are going to have to check that out no matter what. Think of it, a couple million fictitious registrations and all the police man hours spent trying to track these illegal guns and their owners down. Gun owners could render the whole thing useless.

I also thought it might be a good idea to fill out a legitimate registration form, photocopy it, burn the original, and put the copy with your guns so you could always claim you mailed one in, just in case.

On second thought, maybe we shouldn't do that. That would be wrong..."

This pistol is in PERFECT condition! No dings, scratches or blemishes! Nothing! I have only ran around 50 rounds through it both FMJ and HP of various grains and brands and have had no FTF or FTE. I originally bought it as my primary carry with my CCL. I take extremely good care of my pistols and clean them after every shooting! I am asking $400 cash non-negotiable only because it is already customized with a great feel and extra extended mag. I can meet anywhere in the South Tulsa or Broken Arrow area. You can call or text me day or night at REDACTED."

This is the best condition Romy G kit I have ever seen

I am also including a Tapco G2 single hook trigger group, a Tapco Slant Brake, and a set of AKBuilder Rivets. 

All this kit needs is a receiver and it's ready to go!

Taurus took the lightest version of the Public Defender and made it even lighter with the incredible Ultra-Lite aluminum frame. This Public Defender weighs a mere 20.7 ounces , yet still delivers the devastating firepower that makes its brothers so famous. It's a remarkable combo gun in the body of a small frame revolver. Nothing could be better for a nightstand gun or as a lightweight pack gun on trips through the backcountry.

A “new in the box” USFA Rodeo II Colt 45 revolver.  
This is a USFA (United States Firearms Manufacturing) Rodeo II model SAA Colt .45 (.45LC) revolver, with a 5 ½” barrel. This gun is NIB, never fired. It is rendered in USFA’s Rodeo II finish and presentation, which is a satin nickel finish with blue accents and checkered US “Burlwood” brown synthetic composite grips. This model is not just for looks or occasional use but was also designed to be used by Cowboy Action Shooting (SASS) enthusiasts in shooting competitions. Its satin finish reduces sun glare that polished nickel throws off and the checkered grips help the shooter maintain a solid non-slip grip while handling the gun. This gun is new in box and was made by USFA, which is now out of business.  In the opinion of many collectors, writer/reviewers, and enthusiasts, the Colt 45 reproduction single action army revolvers made by USFA are the acknowledged “best in class” of the Colt style reproduction manufacturers, including Colt itself, as well as Uberti and other high end repro manufacturers. (*See below for links to articles and sites discussing the superior quality of USFA SAA revolvers.) USFA SAA revolvers are celebrated for their unparalleled adherence to original model 1873 and later model specs, exceeding even first generation Colt originals for quality and detail.

968,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1560968,For Sale:  MICRO SLICK your gun parts!,"Poulsbo, Washington, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 26, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Cerakote™ Micro Slick is a dry-film lubricant that is able to withstand high temperatures and extreme pressures. The Micro Slick coating is able to lubricate, resist wear, and also act as an anti-seize agent while preventing galvanic corrosion or bonding of the metals.  Micro Slick is virtually unaffected by temperatures ranging between 800 and 1200 degrees Fahrenheit  When two adjoining surfaces are coated with Micro Slick it prevents surface-to-surface contact, which reduces friction and wear between the two surfaces. An example of this would be to coat a bolt carrier group on an AR 15 and the inside of the upper receiver. This combination would reduce the amount of friction between the parts and help the firearm to function more smoothly.

Micro Slick is generally applied, but not limited, to internal, moving parts such as engine parts, bolts, bolt carrier groups, trigger groups, rails, etc. This product comes in a dark grey color only. Micro Slick your trailer hitch ball and never have to grease it again! Micro Slick your axe head and it will glide through the wood more smoothly and won't get stuck in any sap! Micro Slick your bicycle chain and gears for a smoother ride with little to no dirt and grime build up on your chain and eliminate having to oil your chain!

We also offer Cerakote services! We can coat any metal, polymer or plastic parts in any color you want. This coating also offers you a hard, durable, ceramic coating.
