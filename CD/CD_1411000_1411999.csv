This gun has had 42 rounds through it since new, I believe. I'm pretty sure I bought two 25 round boxes when I bought the gun and have 8 rounds left. It is in perfect shape. The lock and carry bag have never been used and the gun comes with everything as new, including the spare battery for the Crimson Trace laser, plus 8 rounds Federal Premium hollow points.  This gun is great for concealed carry. It is so lite that you can stick it in any pocket and forget it's there. Being hammerless makes it a breeze to pull out of your pocket without snagging it on the way out. Just gotta sell this one to spend a bunch more on another one. I think you'll see that they are going for a lot more than $550 everywhere else right now. I've seen them sell for over $700 just recently on other sites. Thanks,

Both 25's shoot very well and I also have a pocket carry holster that  I will add to the deal as well as two boxes of Hornady carry ammo.

People constantly back out of deals. I am starting to believe that gouging is now the bs tax. If you want to see fair prices, then maybe it would be worth it for people to start by being respectful and honorable. 

There are four kinds of people here. First there are those who refuse high prices and are too lazy to look for ammo and then complain about gouging. You are adults, if you do not like something, the whole world does not need to know. Then there are those who make deals and back out, even though the seller has put off quality offers to negotiate in good faith. Next there are those that scout every walmart at 6 am everyday, with the intention to sell to those who don't mind paying more aka the bullshit tax. Finally there are the consumers.

A situation has come up and really need the money instead of the rifle. I still have the original box, owners manual, gun lock, etc. I bought a fore grip for it as well. These rifles use the same quad rail style as AR-15's and are highly customizable. The range of accessories for these rifles is enormous. Really a great rifle that benefits from the looks and feel of an AR-15 but is much cheaper to shoot. Currently .223 rounds go for about a $1 a piece compared to .22 rounds that less than $20 for 500. I also have a red dot site that is not shown in these pictures.

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from the highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is in .40 S&W caliber. Aperture rear, Circular hood, Adjustable front Rifle features an internal keyed deployment lock. Rifle can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage. Its a great pack rifle. Opened length is 29.5"". The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools. This is a Kel Tec Sub 2000 in a 40 S&W. This one uses magazines that fit a Glock 22 or 23 ."

By adding the pinky finger grip it makes your grip on the gun much more substantial which increases your control and accuracy.

Also has an extended mag release. The paint is obviously Krylon; will easily come off barrel, but not so much the stock. The grip is also stippled, for better or worse depending on who you are. 

I am not confident enough on the make of the aftermarket trigger assembly to say what it is; I got it from a friend in a trade, and it is smoother and more solid than the factory one. 

The scope is pretty decent for a sub $100 scope; has held zero for the last year that I have used it. 

There will not be a cash price on this.

I used an Aero Precision lower and a Colt upper. The upper is a 20 inch HBAR 1/7 twist. I bought this because I thought about going full auto if they tried to ban these things. If it was going to be illegal to own one than I was probably going to make it really illegal to own this one. They didn't so I don't need this anymore. Colt's heavy barrel is the only one I would trust with sustained full automatic fire. THERE HAVE BEEN NO ILLEGAL MODIFICATIONS TO THIS RIFLE! Just to make it clear, these were only ideas floating around in my head. My name's probably going on a list somewhere now. Anyway, the rifle also comes with 7 new 30 round magazines, a removable carry handle, and a sling. In addition to the above, the HBAR makes this rifle extremely accurate as well. All parts are new with only slight handling marks here and there. This rifle was built to go to somebody's A$$ if the you know what hit the fan. Financial collapse, WWIII, Armageddon, if society crumbles this is the weapon you can truly depend on and would want to be by your side. $1500 OBO"

Perfect and in working order.
The rimmed .30-40 round was also known as .30 Army, .30 U.S., or .30 Gov't. Although the .30-40 Krag was the first smokeless powder round adopted by the U.S. military, it retained the ""caliber-charge"" naming system of earlier black powder cartridges, i.e. a .30-caliber bullet propelled by 40 grains (2.6 g) of smokeless powder. The first use of a smokeless powder round by Winchester was a single shot in 30-40, and it was one of only three rounds chambered for the 1895 Winchester lever action, introduced in 1896.[2]

From the outset, the .30-40 cartridge proved popular for hunting, and was chambered in a variety of firearms. In 1899, a Krag in .30-40 caliber was used to shoot the world-record Rocky Mountain elk. The record stood until the latter half of the 20th century."

One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is a great find for the S&W Collector, it is a First Model K-22 Outdoorsman .22LR Revolver. Made only between 1931-1940, the First Model guns were built on the .38 Hand Ejector (“K”) frame. Serial Numbers for the First Model were between 632124(1931) -682419(1940). The gun is all-correct, it’s a “5-Screw” with a 6” pinned barrel (no rib), semi-round top strap with an adjustable rear sight and a partridge front sight. The pistol has a factory polished blue finish, and checkered factory ‘double-diamond’ grips with S&W medallions. The pistol has a small bit of holster wear on the tip of the barrel, and maybe a tiny service mark here and there. The grips show minimal wear, there is one very tiny chunk missing off the bottom of the left grip. Overall condition is about 90-95%. The pistol has a shiny bore with very good rifling, double action trigger pull is smooth. This is a really nice First Model K-22 Outdoorsman, it will be a great addition to your collection, and it ought to be a great shooter as well.

I took it home, cleaned it, fired 35 rounds through it, cleaned it again and haven't touched it since. The gun shoots the 5.7x28mm cartridge, a very capable cartridge that was designed by FN with the intent of penetrating soft body armor. The gun uses the standard Five-seveN magazines. The standard magazine holds 20 rounds, however, there are 30 rounders made and 10 round extensions to increase your magazine capacity to 30 rounds. The gun has a muzzle brake/compensator, non-reciprocating charging handle, and a picatinny rail on top for mounting a red dot or other optics. The gun utilizes the MAC design which means it is very reliable and built like a tank. It uses a straight blowback design which means that there is very little to go wrong. The gun is also very accurate (For what it is.) because of the low recoil nature of the round. The gun is also very fun to shoot. (I know from experience.) The bolt assembly is all CNC machined, further enhancing the gun's reliability. A hard plastic case is also included with the gun.

Bledsoe was inspired and trained to some extent by Agee, and continued this type of work after Agee died in 1952.  Both men used only brands from the state of Texas and their work is very similar.  This 5 1/2 inch barreled gun, with its combination of gold and silver and steer-head pearl grips with gold and ruby decoration, is one of the more ornate examples we have seen.  Based on the fux book leather casing, it was done on special order for Mr. Ray Kirby, who was a well known Colt Collector during the latter half of the 20th Century.  The casing itself is magnificent and may be unique.  Regardless, it certainly adds to the appeal of this gun.  The bore is as new and the action is in perfect working order and the mechanics are tight and crisp."

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.





(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.










(M)ega-Lock Texture

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 

The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.






XDM TECHNOLOGY

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)elonite

Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 

The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.





(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry










(M)inimal Reset Trigger

The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.




XDM INNOVATIONS

The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.






(M)inimal Error Disassembly


Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.





(M)aximum Reach Mag Release


The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.










(M)ega Capacity Magazine


The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag 
 X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
 .40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.




XDM PERSONALIZATION

Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.






(M)ould-Tru Backstraps


With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.





(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System


A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. 










(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case


Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.





(M)agazine X-Tensions


With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)




XDM STANDARDS

In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that….






Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.





Striker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 










USA Trigger System

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.





Grip Safety

Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol."

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.
