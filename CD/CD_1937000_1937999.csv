It has been carried for two months. Shows a little holster wear, but nothing major. About 200 - 300 rounds have been fired out of this little guy. There are some ""custom"" work done to it. The chassis and some internal parts have been polished to improve trigger pull. As you know, the trigger is double action. The polish job has made the trigger pull smoother, but I haven't felt a difference as far as weight goes. Also, Nano's do not have manual controls...therefore I have added a slide release (just a personal preference). The FDE frame has been modified to work with the slide release. The black and pink frames are stock but can be modded to work with the slide release. Also included is a spare, un-modded slide lock if you choose not to use the slide release. 

Package includes:
Nano w/ 2 6rd mags, box, docs, lock...
1 additional 6rd mag (3 total)
1 8 rd mag
2 Pearce Pinky Extensions (made for Kahr K9/40 but fits the Nano mags)
Black Frame
Pink Frame (for the ladies...or those confident guys)
Un-modded Slide Lock
Lasermax Laser
Trijicon Night Sights
Little Foxx Holster made to fit the Nano w/ Lasermax attached (super comfortable incase you've never tried one...highly recommended)

This is the ultimate Nano carry package with all the bells and whistles and then some. Not looking for any trades, just ""thinning the herd"". Selling for $675. I would like to see your GA driver's license and GA weapons carry license.

I've never shot this rifle but it appears to be completely functional with a nice action and a terrific bore. I saw more than a dozen serialized parts on this rifle and they're all matching. A screw in the buttstock was missing so I replaced it with a modern color-matching reproduction. There is what appears to be a natural crack in the bottom of the forestock. The crack doesn't go all the way through nor does it go to the edges. Like I said, it appears to be a natural feature of the wood. There is a small crack in the buttstock on the grip. It seems to be old and superficial. No cleaning rod, otherwise the rifle looks complete. It even has the spare firing pin stored behind the buttplate. These were imported in the early 1900s and sporterized by various companies (Sears, for example). NO import marks anywhere. A nice, solid example of a classic rifle. Very low reserve. Buyer pays shipping. I accept personal checks (with ID copy) and money orders. Thanks for looking.

The conceal-and-carry hybrid pistol features impressive stopping power consisting of a factory-made 36 slide on top of a 30SF frame. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing in a .45 caliber pistol. The 30S packs 10 rounds of .45 ACP in a package that fits the hands of most any user. The G30S is easy to use, easy to conceal and tough to contend with. The G30S platform has been more than a year in the making. Our original request from the field – particularly from law enforcement – was to have a more concealable .45 that still carries 10 rounds, so we utilized the G30 SF frame after it was thoroughly tested, presented and accepted as the desired frame for the G30S.

In Tennessee, there are no waiting periods or any other BS besides a simple background check to buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer. You just walk into the store, pick out your gun, fill out simple paperwork and wait a few minutes for the background check, and walk out with your gun. Any gun store is a federally licensed dealer and you must be 21 to buy a handgun from them. 18 for a rifle or shotgun.

However, if you purchase your handgun from a gun show or from an ad in the classifieds section or used from an individual that is not a federally licensed dealer, the minimum age is 18 and there is no background check required. So basically 21 to buy from a licensed gun store, 18 to buy in a private exchange/sale.

Also, in Tennessee you must be must be 21 to apply for a Concealed firearms permit.

Have fun.

Why settle for second when you can OWN THE BEST!?! The Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. This device is an integral part of the firearm and therefore, cannot be lost. This same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems alike (two keys come with each gun). A long-standing tool for defense that has passed the test of quality.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

LWRC M6 IC 14.7"" 5.56NATO Rifle Black with welded and pinned compensator making it 16""

The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.
All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.
The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.
The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

I used to be a match director for USPSA matches.  The range got suckered into buying these crappy target stands.  Being the match director, it got really frustrating trying to set up and tear down for matches with those stands.  So I made the V shaped stands pictured.  They are ""collapsible"".  They don't take up much room, so if you wanted to stop off at the range after work and get some practice in, these won't take up much room in the trunk of your car.

They are powdered coated, so they are virtually rust proof.  Because things can get windy on the range, I went ahead and drilled them for stakes, so you can stake them to the ground.  As you can see, they take normal sized furring strips.

I have two sets of 5 stands.  Each set is $145 each, shipped, which averages out to $29 each.

A USPS postal money order is my preferred method of payment.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask."

I recently put a good bit of time into polishing the barrel and the guide rod. Gives the gun a very sharp/clean/intimidating look. I did NOT do mirror finish because I think the brushed aluminum look is very sharp and a bit easier to keep looking clean. The feed ramp has been well polished to a mirror like finish and ammo slides into position VERY easily. Ejects ammo beautifully as well. Has been well cleaned (ask me for pictures of my other weapons and you will see the OCD I have. I am also INCLUDING x2 magazines of ammo which is 26 rounds. This is 230 grain 45 FMJ ammo. I have not experienced any jams, FTFs, FTEs, or any other complications while shooting this gun. Shoots very well and the trigger pull seems even lighter than the 5.5lbs it claims. 

 The XDm features: grip safety (1911 style; I prefer this to the Glock angled grip), loaded chamber indicator, striker status indicator (This feature is NOT on a Glock), MATCH GRADE barrel, Major Grasp serrations (front and back of slide), minimal reset trigger (one of the smoothest I’ve felt on a 45) and fixed dovetail white 3-dot sights. 

 Pistol package includes: (2) 13-round magazines, 26 rounds of 230 grain 45 ammo, molded holster and mag pouch, mag loading tool, cable lock, heavy-duty plastic case, and owner's manual.

 Pricing: This package sells for right around 689.99. Fairly hard to find in the 4.5"". The polishing of the barrel and guide rod is a bit expensive addition @ $50+ from someone and the extra 26 rounds (approx. $10) make this deal very fair. No rush to sell."

MFG Description:
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

 With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

 Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

Tactical Rifle Urban. Custom made for your Urban Rifle. Today's Law enforcement Officers need ammunition specifically designed for use in semi-automatic rifles or ""Urban Rifles"" such as variants of the M-16 or AR-15. Federal TRU ammunition is engineered using mil-quality specifications for ideal functioning in these firearms. Each TRU cartridge is made using select mil-quality low flash powders and the case features thicker brass for added strength. TRU primers are crimped in .223 offerings for added holding ability in this popular cartridge, virtually eliminating backed out primers that can lock-up and render your rifle useless. With TRU ammunition, potentially disastrous situations are greatly reduced. TRU bullets are specifically engineered, ranging from fragmenting designs for tactical entry to deeper penetrating bullets for patrol. This is particularly important in today's urban settings.

I recently put a good bit of time into polishing the barrel and the guide rod. Gives the gun a very sharp/clean/intimidating look. I did NOT do mirror finish because I think the brushed aluminum look is very sharp and a bit easier to keep looking clean. The feed ramp has been well polished to a mirror like finish and ammo slides into position VERY easily. Ejects ammo beautifully as well. Has been well cleaned (ask me for pictures of my other weapons and you will see the OCD I have. I am also INCLUDING x2 magazines of ammo which is 26 rounds. This is 230 grain 45 FMJ ammo. I have not experienced any jams, FTFs, FTEs, or any other complications while shooting this gun. Shoots very well and the trigger pull seems even lighter than the 5.5lbs it claims. 

The XDm features: grip safety (1911 style; I prefer this to the Glock angled grip), loaded chamber indicator, striker status indicator (This feature is NOT on a Glock), MATCH GRADE barrel, Major Grasp serrations (front and back of slide), minimal reset trigger (one of the smoothest I’ve felt on a 45) and fixed dovetail white 3-dot sights. 

Pistol package includes: (2) 13-round magazines, 26 rounds of 230 grain 45 ammo, molded holster and mag pouch, mag loading tool, cable lock, heavy-duty plastic case, and owner's manual.

Pricing: This package sells for right around 689.99. Fairly hard to find in the 4.5"". The polishing of the barrel and guide rod is a bit expensive addition @ $50+ from someone and the extra 26 rounds (approx. $10) make this deal very fair. No rush to sell."

All parts were bought new except the tank within the past 6 months and have receipts for everything. This has a range of roughly 45 feet when used with a mix of half diesel and half gasoline and a range of 55ft+ when used with straight tiki torch fluid. The basic overview of how this works is the 20lb tank is the fuel cell and is pressured via a paintball co2 tank screwed into an asa fitting adapter for the larger tank. The fuel cell is threaded and tapped at the bottom for a pressure washer hose. The pressure washer gun and wand act as a real flamethrower wand would and the propane pilot land is mounted at the end and powered by a small 1 lb propane tank. The unit does come with an alice pack frame ready to wear(not pictured). Also it will not come with the pilot torch for liability reasons. Any serious buyers are more than welcome to come ""test fire"" with water to experiance the range for themselves. asking $900 and feel free to call or text me at REDACTED. Before the safety nazi's chime in yes this is not a toy,the risk for flash backs is very low to the point that is almost physically impossible, and it was built by and engineer(me).  This is perfect for anyone that wants to make clearing or burning brush way more fun

This is a .357 Magnum Mark I pistol from 1985. It has a 6"" Magnaported barrel and Millet adjustable sights  (white outline rear and bright orange front). It comes with one stainless mag and one blued mag. Comes with the original box, literature, cleaning rod, brush and gas system scraping tool. The gun has a ""stainless' appearance and that's where the story gets interesting.

The Desert Eagle serial numbers began at ""3000."" The suffix ""S"" was used for ""stainless guns."" This pistol is serial 309x - S, making it one of the first 100 ""stainless"" Desert Eagles to ever be imported into this country. According to Magnum Research, these old guns that were catalogued as ""stainless"" were actually stainless steel cast frames along with Satin Nickel plated barrels and slides (made of chromoly steel). This one has black accents and it looks sharp. It handles screaming full-power .357 loads like a champ and recoils like a 9mm pistol. It's a ton of fun to shoot; nobody has shot it without having a huge smile on their face afterwards. Someone in the past 30 years ground down the sharp edge inside the trigger guard on the right side of the frame. If you're looking for a solid shooter that looks great, this is it!

It isn't very common to come across the ""stainless"" MKI in .357MAG, let alone one with the Millet sights and Magnaport factory upgrades. In fact, it was several years before I came across this one.
