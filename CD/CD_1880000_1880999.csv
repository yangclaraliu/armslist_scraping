-  Graco Corporation Gracoil recoil reduction system. This is an aluminum butt plate system that utilizes a slide piston with adjustable tension to limit recoil.  Adjusts from 14lb all the way to 70lb. This makes it perfect for the big kicking gun.   These are more typical on large shotguns but Graco made this model specific for big cal rifles. 
http://www.graco-corp.com/products/model-number-gc15r

- Muzzle Break fabricated and installed locally by Rich at High Tech Customs

This rifle is a big gun but shoots with limited recoil due to the butt plate and the muzzle break. I can shoot this all day without my shoulder hurting and I have used it for everything from antelope to big elk and it will take down anything. It's actually a great round for smaller big game like antelope. The high velocity round combined with a light bullet blow right through antelope without leaving a large exit wound like some smaller rounds like .243, or ,270. 

The .300 win mag is a perfect round for all Colorado hunts. I have well over $1300 into this rifle and it is in good condition and shoots great. Reaches out to at least 600 yards.

Out of stock everywhere, but I have one left!! 

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory. Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)®match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots

The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip. The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the .40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

 All XD pistols include the XD Gear System, which consists of a XD Gear belt holster, XD Gear double magazine pouch, XD Gear magazine loader, two magazines and a cable lock. It's more than a new set of features; it's about raising your expectations of what a polymer pistol should be. It's about creating a new standard in value.

Produced at the Rock Island Arsenal(Illinois, USA) in 1917. S/N 247XXX.

Beautiful sporterized Monte Carlo hardwood stock, Lymon peep sight with a 1911 patent date. Tons of character and history rolled into this gun.

Markings were removed from the barrel when it was sporterized(barrel measures 23-1/4"" from receiver to tip). Markings are present and crystal clear on the receiver. Bolt has a stainless finish. Front sight appears to be original design.

Should be inspected by a competent gunsmith prior to use to verify safety and function. It is one of over a million ""low serial number"" Model 1903's that have been the subject of on-going debate since WWI regarding the single heat-treating method used to produce the receivers. They are regarded by some as ""unsafe to fire"" due to incidents during WW1 with fractured receivers and injuries.

Heat treating methods were primitive in the US in the early 20th century and relied on the gunsmith to ""eyeball"" the metal to guess temperature. The result was some receivers that were overheated and became brittle. Combined with bad shell casings or overpressured ammo, the brittle metal receivers exploded like glass on firing. The result was lost eyes and facial injuries.

Out of 1 million guns, 100 or so failed during WWI. Some of those failures resulted from American soldiers sticking captured German 8mm(.32 caliber) rounds into these (.30 caliber) rifles. 

These guns have been the subject of debate since then, with many saying ""never fire them"", and others using them heavily."

Smith & Wesson Corp. unveiled this new handgun last year and announced it was designed to assist with self protection and home defense needs. Chambered in .40 S&W, the new Smith & Wesson SD40 VE™ semi-automatic pistol combines value with enhanced features that deliver top-grade performance into a reliable option for both home and personal protection uses.

The foundation of each SD VE pistol is based on a lightweight polymer frame, designed to deliver in the areas of comfort and durability. On the stainless steel slide, the SD VE pistol features a distinctive two-tone finish along with aggressive front and rear slide serrations for improved firearm handling. Among the key features found on the Smith & Wesson SD40 VE is the Self Defense Trigger (SDT™). Providing a smooth, consistent trigger pull, the SDT design helps to enhance accuracy while providing users with increased confidence. To further aid in accuracy, the SD VE is standard with a white-dot front sight and a white two-dot rear sight.

 For optimal comfort and control, the SD VE pistol has been fitted with an 18° natural point of aim, ergonomic grip with aggressive front and back strap texturing. The Smith & Wesson SD9 VE and SD40 VE have both been built with a textured finger locator, which is placed directly above the trigger guard on the left and right side of the frame. Underneath the barrel, a universal Picatinny-style equipment rail is standard for optional tactical lights, lasers and other popular accessories.

Underneath the barrel, a universal Picatinny-style equipment rail is standard for optional tactical lights, lasers and other popular accessories.

 The small but tough pistol has an unloaded weight of 22.7 ounces and a slender width of 1.29 inches. With a 4-inch barrel and an overall length of 7.2 inches, it is fully compatible for personal protection or home defense measures. Each pistol comes with two magazines and the Smith & Wesson lifetime service policy.

 A number of high-quality accessories are available for the SD series. A partial list of accessory manufacturers follows. Please contact me to inquire about availability: LaserMax®, LaserLyte, Crimson Trace, Galco Holsters, Fobus Holsters & Pouches, DeSantis Gunhide® and BLACKHAWK! I’m particularly fond of the DeSantis pocket holsters.

It comes with everything, the locks, the key to the pistol, the test round, manuals, box, etc! I paid 419.99 plus tax which totals $441.91. I'd sell it for $415 cash or $430 Credit card. I've looked around and the cheapest around is at Fleet Farm for $409.97 by the time you add tax you'd be way over $415.00. If you have interest let me know. Thanks everyone! 

PS. This is a sick, light, awesome carry gun! I got ride of my 642 (hammerless) model and got this one as the single action is so smooth, and increases your range of fire.

I have a new in box Ruger GP100, 357, 4"", six round cylinder. All solid stainless, its heft balances the recoil nicely, of both 357 and 38 special.
This gun has not been fired, and comes in the factory box, with everything it came with. Has adjustable rear sights.

My only reason for parting with this gun is a recent diagnosis of severe arthritis in my shoulders which leaves me in great pain from shooting the higher calibers. So to continue to enjoy target shooting, I am having to switch to 22 caliber. 

So I will be looking for offers of 22 caliber guns, my favorite is the Ruger line, but I will consider others. Anything with a stainless finish goes to the front of the line.
Please be reasonable, these guns are in excellent to new condition, and their market value is listed on Armslist.

I also have five boxes of .38 Special, the perfect target ammo for any 357."

The mauser is Turkish and isn't a German K98 or anything but it is exceptionally clean for its age and it is a very straight shooter.  Wood is very nice and the bore/rifling is excellent, I would guess it was either never issued or refinished at some point.  Has a long heavy barrel and it's very accurate, as far as I can tell it shoots point of aim instead of 2ft high like a lot of mausers do.

I'm interested in trading for a bow of some sort for deer hunting.
I'd primarily like to get a crossbow but I won't say no to a nice compound either.
The only other trade I would consider would be for a snub nosed .38 special +P rated revolver.
Only interested in trading, so please don't ask for a sale price, I have no problems keeping it if the right trade doesn't come along.

Derived from the CZ-36 following World War II, the CZ-45 is currently manufactured by  Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod  as the CZ-92.

In 1945 the CZ-36 was redesigned by Jan Kratochvil to make it easier (hence cheaper) to manufacture and became the Vzor 45 (model 1945) but is generally known as CZ-45. The safety lever which had sometimes appeared on the CZ-36 was eliminated (though a few early model 45s were manufactured with a safety lever). The changes included the addition of a side plate to simplify assembly and a magazine safety. The CZ-36 had a connector from the trigger to the hammer that ran on the left side of the magazine, whereas the CZ-45 has a Browning style stirrup-shaped connector that runs on both sides of the magazine.

The overall design of the receiver, slide, guide rod, and recoil spring are very similar to the earlier Browning .25 design. The barrel mount is also like the Browning, with a single lug that rotates into a slot in the frame. The trigger pivots on a pin.

When the trigger is activated and the hammer is down, the connector is pulled forward, rotating the hammer backward into cocked position. When the hammer reaches full cock, it is freed to fall and strike the  firing pin , which ignites the cartridge. The hammer is not cocked by the slide--technically speaking, this is a self-loading repeating pistol, not an automatic or semi-automatic. Other than the heavy double-action trigger pull, the only safety mechanism is the magazine safety. When the magazine is inserted, it moves a bar which allows the connector to engage the sear. When the magazine is removed from the gun, the bar disconnects the trigger from the sear.

Disassembly is similar to the Browning. Remove the magazine and make sure the chamber is empty. Draw the slide back about 1 centimeter and rotate the barrel clockwise a quarter-turn. Remove the barrel and slide forward off the receiver. Other than the guide rod and recoil spring, there are no small parts that come loose.

The CZ-45 holds 8 rounds in the magazine and has a simple groove down the top of the slide for sighting. Its great merits are its simplicity and reliability, ease of field-stripping, and accuracy--despite its primitive sighting groove and double action only trigger.

It's an older model - the 70P with the wood stock and blued barrel, versus the newer 70PSS with the synthetic stock and stainless finish. 

It comes with the original 7-round factory mag, along with six 10-round factory mags. They're nominally for the 795, but all have been 100% through this rifle. I also have three 25-round ProMag magazines, that have not been 100%, but are about as good as an old Hotlips 10/22 mag. Somewhere I have a Shooter's Ridge 25-round mag that has been 100%, but is not as tacticool looking as the ProMag. I'll find it, and throw it in the deal. The 10-rounders are loaded, and I'll throw in the two boxes of Mini-Mag pictured.

It's in good overall condition. There's a scuff at the end of the stock, and the finish on the receiver is a little goobered from the previous owner mounting a scope on the weaver rail. Front sight was missing when I picked it up, but I replaced it with a factory part."
