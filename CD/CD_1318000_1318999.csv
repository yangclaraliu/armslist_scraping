Brand New FNHerstal FNX .45 ACP Handgun

Included:

1 - Box
3 - 15rd Mags
1 - Streamlight TLR-4 Light/Laser Mount
1 - Original Paperwork
2 - Handle BackStraps

The gun has not been fired yet, pending my local Gun Club membership date, I WILL be putting some rounds down range with this! I will need proof of identity and preferably a CCW with signatures for ""Bill Of Sale."" This transaction will need to be done before the new idiotic laws pass, where we would need to both go to a local FFL Dealer and You would pay the background check.

This is an engineering marvel of a handgun with the capacity of 15+1 in .45 ACP. The provided 2 back straps are adequate for 90% of hands out there, my hands are on the small/medium scale and it still feels great! No scratches or blemishes, just sits bedside and gets cleaned/lubed every week for fun.

^^^ UPDATE:: I have since sent 45 rds. down the tube and WOW was I amazed at the accuracy and ease of .45 firing, the recoil is very minor due to the slide/guide rod/ barrel design.  Also, this was THE LAST FNH FNX-45 to be sold on Colorado Gun Store Shelves that I know of.

I had a few pending offers, emailed them back and have received no response so $950o.b.o.  I would like to sell within the week so email me your offers!"

 About Gen II Tapco Intrafuse AR15 mags (from the manufacturer):

 The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

 We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

PRICEGAUGING TOM in WATERBURY...READ THIS ::WARNING::,"Winsted, Waterbury, Connecticut",$ 95,"Listed On: Saturday, March 23, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"seriously, get a life you moron! No one will pay $95 for a box of 500 CCI .22LR. Especially from someone who probably doesn't even own a firearm! Admit it, you are an EBT junkie who thinks you are the only person in CT with bulk boxes of .22LR ammo and thus you mark up the price because you think people are starving for .22LR and they will have to buy it from you.  Whats next Tom? Going to apply for an FFL so you can buy low-end firearms and sell them at Colt prices? 

I'll tell you what Tom in Waterbury..I'll give you $150 for all the .22LR you have currently listed. And then $50.00 to get the fuck off Armslist! Thats $200.00 more than you have right now. What could you do with $200.00? Get a hooker for a few hours, buy a lot of weed, go on a shopping spree at Dollar Tree, pay some bills, Buy a Wife from Columbia, buy a month or two worth of gasoline. Hell you can probably get a JetBlue flight to Orlando FL for $60.00 and then spend 2 days at Disney! You can put $50 in your Hondas gas tank, go to Mohegan Sun, and go all in on a hand of Blackjack! If you are a smart player there, you could turn the $150 into $500! The chance of that happening is 50000X better than the chance that you will sell your .22LR ammo at $95 a box!!!

I have over 5,000 rounds of .22LR that I've bought over 6 months ago. If I wanted to sell 1,000 right now, I wouldn't be able to sleep if I listed 1,000 rounds for $45.00! 
Everyone should call this Tom guy and offer him $30.00 a box. Hes not a capitalist, hes a vulture who give all gun owners and firearms enthusiasts a bad name.

Magpul MOE handguard and grip. commercial stock tube with an unknown butt stock. accuwedge. oh and the pmags have the ranger plates attached as well. i built this rifle with the help of a buddy. the upper and lower are both made by a company called RGUNS which are getting really big now but it has what i am pretty sure are FN proof marks but it looks llike an old school door lock. the trigger has been hand polished and is assembled by military torque ratings.  i know what i want to get out of this rifle and i have been told by people that know alot more about guns that the number in my head is fair.  any more questions feel free to ask.

""
This premium 50 cal ammo can is manufactured to DOD M2A1 specs and is brand new from the manufacturer!

 Ammo cans are perfect for storing and transporting ammunition. This ammo can features mil-spec seals and is tested by the manufacturer to ensure that it is water and air tight. We conducted our own tests and found the ammo can to be completely dry inside even after being submerged in water for 48 hours. It also survived a 20 ft. drop, and being run over by a four ton pickup truck with no damage to the body or lid. The can will easily hold 700 rounds of .223/5.56 NATO in boxes, or 1000 rounds of 9mm, or 3500 rounds of .22LR.

 When considering how to protect your ammo stockpile investment, an ammo can is accepted by the U.S. military as the most reliable way to protect ammunition from exposure to moisture and humidity. When trying to preserve the life of ammunition, in addition to storing in an ammo can, it is best to keep your ammo in a cool, dry environment with stable temperatures.

The 7.62x51 NATO (.308 Winchester) PMAG 20LR offers impact & crush resistant polymer construction in a lightweight, cost effective, high reliability magazine for SR25/M110 pattern rifles featuring true 20-round capacity.  Constant-curve internal body geometry for smooth feeding, and snap on Impact/Dust Cover keeps dust/dirt out of the mag during storage as well as protecting the feedlips from potential hard impact during transit. 

The PMAG 20LR utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. A textured gripping surface and robust flared floorplate developed for positive magazine handling and increased drop protection.  Designed specifically for military-issue MK11/M110 rifles and mil-spec ammunition (including M118LR), the PMAG 20LR is less than half the weight of standard issue steel magazines and maintains a service life round count approximately equal to the rifle barrel itself.

Optimized for use with 7.62x51 NATO (.308 Winchester) ammunition with an overall cartridge length less than 2.820"", including M118LR.

548,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1318548,For Sale:  Noreen -- Bad news 338 Lapua Semi-auto .338 Lapua,"CONNECTICUT, Connecticut, United States","$ 3,000","Listed On: Saturday, March 23, 2013",Rifles,American Spirit Arms                                                                                ,300 Winchester Magnum                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"338 Lapua !!!! Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots. The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot. This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action. The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action. The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system. The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus. The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA. www.onlylongrange.com Piston-driven semi-automatic action Effective to 1500 yards Accurate, powerful .300 WIN MAG round Modest recoil Weighs just 13 pounds Receiver is machined from a billet of 6061 T6 aluminum MIL spec or adjustable trigger 26” barrel (1 in 10” twist) Full-Length picatinny rail on receiver 5 or 10 round magazine accepts 300 gr bullets Full Custom muzzle brake The finish that Noreen utilizes is not Cerakote, so it may scratch and show wear more easily."

I am looking to buy a gun as a gift for a family member. He lost all of his guns due to a house fire about this time last year. Of all of them he misses his 94 the most so I thought it would cheer him up if I bought him one. Not looking for a show piece or antique. Just a good gun for him to hunt with this fall. Willing to travel up to an hour to pick it up so if you are in the surrounding area please don't hesitate to contact. I also have a friend who is a FFL so shipping could be a possibility. Thanks for looking.

He kept them in his safe and only used them to look at deer in the back yard. My gf at the time mistakenly threw the box away. This is a beautiful pair of binoculars.

X-Bolt White Gold,Ns,270 Wsm Description
The benchmark in bolt-action rifle design.

The bolt-action rifle was forever changed with the introduction of the Browning X-Bolt. The X-Bolt builds on the proven successes of past Browning rifles, and adds numerous improvements that place the X-Bolt at the top of any side by side comparison. Most notable is an adjustable three-lever Feather Trigger™ system that offers the best feel on any Browning rifle ever. A bolt unlock button works with the top-tang safety to offer enhanced safety while unloading. Styling features offer more compact dimensions for a smaller, quicker, sleeker look and feel, and also trims weight. To ensure the stability of optics, scope bases are attached to the receiver using four screws per base. Innovation is the Browning tradition, and the X-Bolt is just the latest example.

Trijicon Reflex with TA51 Mount is dual illuminated and parallax free, the Trijicon Reflex sight was designed for close-quarter battles and is unrivaled in both speed of target acquisition and pinpoint accuracy. The Trijicon Reflex allows soldiers, law enforcement officers and hunters to shoot with both eyes open which is a critical advantage for those who must aim while moving, or in darkness. Accuracy is enhanced with its dual-illuminated reticle. A glowing tritium lamp ensures a bright amber reticle at night or in low-light conditions, while advanced fiber optics deliver ambient light to the aiming point during the day. Batteries are not required.

Surefire X400 X400 Handgun/Long gun weaponlight with Red Laser 2 123A Black 170

The SureFire X400 combines a brilliant white light with a bright red laser aiming device in one WeaponLight. A high-efficiency LED generates 170 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with good reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The 5-milliwatt, 635 nanometer laser sight, located below the primary light, is nearly twice as bright and much more visible than the nearest competitor. The laser's adjustment mechanism uses Nylok screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The white light/laser combination makes the X400 effective in close- to medium-range engagements, ideal for law enforcement, military, and self-defense use. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X400 comes with two adapter wedges permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation, and a mode switch allows you to select white light only, white light + laser, laser only, or system disable. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger. Other switches are available for operating the X400 when attached to a long gun.

.22 Calibre Diana RWS 350 Feuerkraft Pro Compact air rifle is up for grabs.

This rifle seems to like 14.3 gn Crosman Premier pellets best.

Included is the RWS 3 - 9 X 40 duplex reticle scope.

This is a plain-jane, no nonsense break-barrel, spring-powered air rifle. It delivers around 22 foot-pounds of energy at the muzzle, and is more than capable of dealing with small varmints.

The rifle itself is in very good condition. Very minor nicks on the stock from regular use. 

Want $300.00, or will trade for a decent bolt-action rifle that will accept a scope - no .22s. Let me know what you have.

Edit: I switched out the scope that came with the rifle for a Leapers 3 - 9 X 40 scope with adjustable objective and illuminated mil-dot reticle.

Based on the full-size USP models these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ‘two-finger grip’ frame the USP Compact uses a narrow full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20000 rounds.

Easy to shoot simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable safe accurate and highly concealable pistol.

Serial number of the receiver is 5592xxx in case you want to look it up. I'm a gun guy but not a Garand guy -- I am disposing of this for a friend who apparently had this rifle in the family for a while -- so I haven't fired this rifle, but am glad to answer any questions I can about it.
The ammo is 250 rounds of FMJ per can, two cans. One can is quite rusty on the outside, but the the ammo is packed in plastic and is not touched.
The price is pretty firm. I've done enough reading to know what they're worth in this condition. If you are a Garand guy, and you want to check it with gauges and such, you are welcome to do so -- but I'm not interested in being talked down.

Nickel Boron finish. Nodular nickel boron is one of the most durable firearm finishes available.  It offers superior corrosion and wear resistance and significantly higher lubricity than conventional anodized finishes.  Due to the physical structure of the coating it will never chip, peel, or flake off.  The coating's high lubricity almost eliminates the need for conventional wet lubricants."
