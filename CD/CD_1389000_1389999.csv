--Pedestal seats (Attwood 238 series) with multiple different height pedestals, including a tall butt seat for the front deck.
--Mount and transducer installed for Humminbird fish finders 7xx series and lower.
--New carpet throughout
--3/4"" treated plywood rear deck and casting deck.
--Bunk trailer with spare tire, new winch, and UHMW slides installed for easier loading, fenders are off but I have them.
--Navigation lights, bumpers, anchor, etc.

This boat is not very pretty, but it rides smooth and dry. I haven't had it out yet this year, and just don't use it as much as I thought I would. I like it a lot, but I'd rather have the cash or something shootable for how much I use the boat.

$1500 OBO. 

I do have a Humminbird 788ci and Lakemaster chips for MN and Lake of the Woods/ Voyageurs National Park that I can add to the deal. We can discuss the cost to include these if you're interested. The boat is setup so that a fishfinder can be used from the console or viewed from the front deck.

I also have a parts motor and roller trailer for sale, and we can work on a price based on what specific setup you want.

The trailer is a heavy-duty Spartan (rated around 3,000 lbs) with hydraulic brakes, but the master cylinder is dry and I haven’t started in on it yet. It does have new, waterproof, trailer lights as well as some miscellaneous rollers and brackets that will go with it. It could use a new set of tires before loading a boat on it. I’d like $600 for this separately.

The parts motor is a 140hp Evinrude outboard 1983. (This is complete, less reparable block and one holed piston, and the carbs with primers and tilt and trim unit, which I swapped out for the same parts on the '78 motor.) These motors are from the same generation and parts are very interchangeable. As mentioned, I already put the carb setup from the 1983 motor on the boat, as well as the tilt and trim.

From the folks that gave us the Desert Ego. 
Barrel is stamped: Magnum Research. Minneapolis, USA. Lone Eagle Pistol  .243 Winchester.  13” Heavy Barrel. 
Pretty cool gun with the separate loading and cocking mechanisms. Locks up like a bank vault. Fun to shoot but I have no practical use for it so maybe you do.
I’ve had it for about 4 years.
I’ve put maybe 10-12 rounds throughu it. 
The guy I bought it from used it to hunt deer (???) back in Indiana and said he had put about 50 rounds throughu the gun.
Has a Weaver scope on Weaver rings and mount. 
I THINK scope is 2.5X.
I need to see WDL and matching Current CPL. No other paperwork.

Update: I also just stumbled across the original owner's manual, exploded diagrams, allen wrenches and even the original never filled out warranty card."

Survival Slings are gun slings made out of real 550 paracord and can be custom made. Many different options to choose from. The survival sling has some essential tools to surviving in the wilderness. Plain paracord slings are also available.

3 Different End options depending on gun:
----- Quick detach swivels
 ----- Hk style hooks
----- Snap enclosure ends

I designed these slings to incorporate:

-80+' of real 550 paracord
 -over 25' 8lb. mono fishing line (inside off weave #2)
 -3 fishing hooks 
 -1 sewing needle sewn inside patch on webbing
 -5' sewing thread
 -7"" stainless survival knife 
-flint/magnesium bar
 -compass (that works)

These slings include what I consider to be essentials in a wilderness survival application. A fire building method, shelter building tools, a means to catch and/or hunt food, a sturdy knife, navigation tool, sewing kit, and even if the slings paracord is dismantled entirely, a sling can be made using the 1"" webbing and sewing kit included.

Slings are typically adjustable from 33""-43"" (custom lengths are custom priced.)

COLORS: Black; O.D. green; desert tan; charcoal gray; coyote brown; woodland camo; red & black camo; pink camo.

I hunt black powder, so again, I am open to anything as long as the deal is right.

I also can provide graphic design services, network design and implementation and pretty much anything in between.  I repair TV's, game consoles, and other electronic devices using an IR reflow machine if you need anything repaired.  Just trying to help the community here and get a couple new guns!  I am very fair, very easy to work with and have over 10 years experience in the IT field (I can stand behind my work!!!).  Here are some of the things I have to trade:

info on gun... After WWI the newly formed Marlin Firearms Corporation started the serial numbers all over again. If your gun's barrel is marked, ""Marlin Firearms Corporation"" it is made in the mid to late 1920's. If it is marked, ""Marlin Firearms Co."" it was made in the early 1920's. If it has this same Marlin Firearms Co. marking on the barrel, but also has the ""bullseye"" in the buttstock, it is post1924-1930 era. All Marlins marked ""Model '93"" on the top tang were made after WWI. The catalogs designated the change from 1893 to '93 in around 1905, but too many receivers with the early marking were already made up, so the new stamped 93 after WWI"

This set was intended to be a back-up set for my primary IPSC/USPSA competition gun, but never got used. I got about 100 rounds through the gun to test the lightened trigger, sight it in, and play around with it for a bit. It ran flawlessly with stock ammo. It was cleaned right after and placed in the safe where it has just been sitting. So now I decided to let it go and see if I can fund another project.

The gun is an M&P9 full-size 9mm with a 4.25” barrel, average market price of about $600. I’ve had it for less than a year and it’s practically brand new. Just to give you an idea on how new this gun is; the envelope that has the casing from the test fire at the factory is dated 02/20/2012. The gun originally came with Trijicon Nightsights which were replaced with Novak fiber optic front sight and Novak rear sight that are the same as what comes with the M&P Pro model. The gun also came originally with the magazine disconnect safety which has been removed. The trigger has been modified and now has a smooth trigger pull with a crisp break at 4¼ pounds and a short reset. These modifications cost me $180 in parts and labor. The gun is very clean with no scuff marks except minor ones on the Novak sights when they were installed. 

Everything that the gun came with originally will be sent along with it: 
• Original case
• 2 factory 17-round magazines
• Original Trijicon nightsights set
• Original Mag Safety Parts
• 3 interchangeable Palmswell grips
• Plastic chamber safety plug
• Instruction manual
• Test fire casing sealed inside envelope
• Gun lock

The competition set included with the gun are:
• 3 additional factory 17-round magazines that are brand new and have never been used (Current market value of $50 each if you can find them)
• BladeTech DOH ICE holster with Tek-Lok attachment, still brand new (value of $70)
• 2 BladeTech double mag pouch with Tek-Lok and modified with spacers to offset for easier draw, still brand new. (value of $55 each)

This is a ready-to-go competition set. All you need is ammo and you’re good to go. I have about $1110 total and a lot of time put in into completing this set. I’m selling the complete set for $950. No need to go through all the trouble of ordering, back-ordering, and waiting for stuff to arrive, or having to hunt for those hard-to-come-by magazines. Minnesota-resident buyer in the Minneapolis metro area will need a Permit to Purchase or a Permit to Carry and complete an FFL transfer at my expense. For everyone else, I will pay the shipping to an FFL of your choice in the Continental USA where this gun and high-cap magazines are legal. Payment by USPS Money Order, Certified Bank Check, PayPal ""Gift"", or cash if face to face sale..

This is being sold as a set so I’m not setting any prices on the individual items. I’m only going to part this out if the gun sells first and the buyer does not want the other items. First “I’ll take it” gets priority. Messages with low offers will be kept in the order of highest offer and order it came in, and will be answered accordingly if I decide to settle for the price.

The 7.62×39 mm rifle is manufactured at the Cugir factory in Romania, a country that is one of the world’s more prominent manufacturers and suppliers of AK-style rifles. It is imported into this country by Century where it is modified and fitted with U.S. parts for BATFE compliance. Fit and finish of the 8-pound, 5-ounce Parkerized rifle clearly reflects the philosophy behind the design—utilitarian and nothing more. The high-capacity magazines lock solidly and easily into place on this AK variant. Its 161/4-inch barrel even exhibits exterior tooling marks, and parts such as the front and rear sight bases and gas port block have rough shaping impressions. The GP WASR-10 does a good job of mimicking a true AKM rifle and all its requisite updates from the original AK-47 design. Like the AKM rifle, it has a stamped receiver and a ribbed top cover. The fixed stock is also reminiscent of an AKM, as it is made from laminated wood. As of 2008, there are GP WASR-10/63 rifles which are being made from demilled military rifles. Look for a triangle with arrow on the front trunnion. Quality is much better with these.This rifle and all accessories are new and have never been fire. I understand there are “MARKS” on the receiver. These are not wear marks and were obtained by other firearms touching the parkerized finish while in a safe."

I have an unfired 99% mint condition S&W M&P9 Compact for sale or trade. I say 99% because the only rounds through it are ones that were chambered/unchambered when leaving or coming home. Has original box and papers, all 3 original backstraps that came with it and the 12 round and 17 round magazine with the X-TAC grip for the 17 round mag. Also have a Fobus paddle holster that holds it nice and solid. Ammo that I will throw in with it is 50 PMC Bronze FMJ, 20 PMC Starfire HP, 50 Hornady Steel Match HP and mix and match of handloads I got on a previous trade. Price sits at $575 pretty firmly. WILL NOT SHIP. Open to trades/split trades. You make an offer on that. I'm not going to gouge because of everyone trying to push the fear of a non-existent AWB happening, so if you gouge, I will too. Best way to reach me is at REDACTED at any time. If you call and I don't answer, just leave a message. Pics upon request! Will meet FTF and show IN DL and LTCH. Closer to Lafayette the better due to bills I'm getting caught up on."

The PPQ M2 is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns. The sculpted grip meshes smoothly into the hand. The trigger is the finest ever on a polymer, striker-fired handgun. The styling is elegant and trim. What’s more, PPQ M2 has been updated for 2013 with a new traditional reversible mag release button. The leading edge just took another step forward.

This gun is beautiful and in like new condition with a thumbhole woodpattern poly stock. To my knowledge the only scratches that are on it are where the safety and the gas valve levers drag. I traded for this recently, but have changed my armoury goals to concealed carry necessities and accessories for myself and my wife, so after putting an estimated 20 rounds through it, it is for sale.

This is widely considered one of the most accurate AKs out there and it has an integrated siderail for optic mounting. Its receiver is estimated to be at least 50% stronger than the average ak receiver because it is based upon the RPK submachine gun receiver.

This gun comes with a 5 round hunting magazine and a cleaning kit. The design was made to be imported during the original assault weapons ban in America, so it requires a small modification to get it to accept regular AK mags. This really isn't a big deal and I would do it if I were planning on keeping it. There are 20 and 30 round mags out there designed for it specifically, so it is good to go stock if you wanted to keep it simple.

From Cabela's Website:
This new heavy hitter effectively stretches the kill zone with a fine-tuned combination of pattern uniformity, higher density, high pellet count and choke responsiveness. The smooth, perfectly round pellets are more aerodynamic than other non-toxic alternatives, are more uniform in pellet-to-pellet size and are true to the listed shot size. At a density of 12.0 grams/cc, Wingmaster HD's nontoxic tungsten/bronze/iron composition is 10% denser than lead and 56% denser than steel. The result is dramatically enhanced per-pellet energy and extended range penetration, so you can actually use pellets that are three times smaller than steel and get the same per-pellet energy with double the number of pellets on target. In testing at 60 yds., this high-performance ammo delivered a whopping 60% of its payload (155 out of 258 pellets) into a 30"" circle."

This particular model is a czech manufactured rifle with Nazi proof marks. The eagle still remains on the various parts. The swastika has been removed as this was a Russian Capture. It was imported by Century in what I believe to be the 90s when they brought a few of these in. 

The rifle is military surplus and therefore has normal wear and tear for a surplus rifle. The rifle still shoots and is accurate, the bore is immaculate. I was planning on using this as a hunting rifle, but will not be hunting this year. 

Included are the scope rings (the receiver has been drilled) These are reproduction rings that fetch over $150 from the manufactures. The are the high turret sniper style and the iron sights can be viewed with the scope mounted to the rifle. The rifle also has the large rotating safety (reproduction) used on the sniper rifles. The safety is either fire, or on safe with the ability to open the bolt. The traditional mauser ""locked bolt safety"" is still possible with the bolt, but not with this safety. 

Not all parts are matching, as it was a russian capture that was re-arsenal. All parts are the rebuild were matched with electro pencil by the russians (most likely down in Yugoslavia) THIS IS NOT A YUGO Mauser, and all parts have the original German proofs. 

Also includes Redfield steel tube scope (TV box style) 6x zoom (non adjustable)

Also includes 15 round of M75 8mm surplus ammo.

Here is your chance to own a fairly cheap Mauser rifle with some history. The 1944 M44 Mosin nagant also pictured is for sale, it is an izhevsk manufactured."
