I have looked around and couldn't find a decent page for reporting stolen guns to the gun community at large. It's my opinion that gun owners see a lot more in person w/ no idea where they came from & no paper trail. It's pretty much the only way to sell a stolen gun. I see it as our duty to our fellow gun owners to help keep an eye out for each other & help where we can.

It came out of Colt's Custom Shop in 1978 and was in JPL's glass case marked ""Personally Owned Firearm - Not For Sale."" That sticker is still affixed to the well-worn original Colt Box. Of course, since it was marked not for sale I had to try to buy it. It took the trade of two other fine handguns and a cash hand of poker to walk out the door with it. I will be glad to provide a sworn letter to the buyer if desired. It has sat in my safe now for 28 years. In that span of time I've owned a total of four different Pythons, a couple of Trooper Mk IIIs and a couple of Detective Specials, and as fine a revolvers as they all are, none come close to the action on this one. And no matter what angle or lighting is used, the camera simply cannot capture the incredible deep beauty that was Colt's Royal Blue at that time. There are many more pictures available; just email for them.

I'm old now, and I am simply not ever going to take this gun out and shoot it. I suppose there are still some fine unfired Pythons out there, but probably few like this one. How to say this in the most polite possible way: I'll be using the funds to enhance my granddaughter's college account, so please don't waste my time and yours with low ball offers or trades, I am not interested and they will be ignored. I figure I will probably need to list this revolver on Gunbroker to get its value but I decided to try Armslist locally first. If you're looking at Armslist from outside Colorado, yes, I will ship this gun from my dealer to yours at extra cost. Thanks for taking the time to read this listing."

This is a nice one: all original and beautiful.  It has the original  premier quality 8-rnd Kimber ProTac stainless steel magazine.  It has been shot a few times, but there are no scuffs, scratches or handling marks.  This gun looks brand new.

The Special Investigative Section of the Los Angeles Police Department asked Kimber to build them a gun with Kimber's standard build including match barrel, match trigger, wide grip safety, beveled mag well and checkered flat backstrap, and then to add the following extra features:  stainless steel slide and frame, special shaped tritium night sights with square edge for one-handed cocking, flat milled top of slide to cut down on sight glare, ambidextrous safety, checkered front strap for more sure grip, SIS light weight hammer, and the series 70 style firing system (no firing pin safety).  Kimber coated it with their KimPro coating, gave it a nice set of custom wood grips and a stylized SIS milled into the slide instead of cocking serrations.  It was so popular that Kimber made an extended production run for the civilian market for about five years.  Production of the SIS version was discontinued in Jan 2010. 

As the special build configuration for the most elite group of the largest city police force in the world, these have become a bit of a collectible.  When available, this gun sold for $1725 at Osage County Guns, a Kimber master dealer. To enjoy the same features on a new gun, you'd have to step up to Kimber's Super Carry Pro HD, another $1700 gun, if you can get it.

The Pro (4 inch) size is perfect for serious shooting and great for concealed carry.

Response to questions:
If you're reading this, THE GUN IS AVAILABLE.  No registration, taxes or shipping.  I'd like a face to face sale in Tulsa or Rogers County.  If you're in another state, thanks for your interest, but I'm not shipping this gun now.  If it doesn't sell this month, it may be listed in September on Gunbroker.com, and I will take the necessary steps to ship the gun.

This is the SIS PRO (series 70 style fire control system) not the politically correct PRO II (series 80 style).  It is NOT approved by the California state government.  Sorry.

I will trade this gun and $200 for one ounce of gold. 

Yes, my timeline for settlement on this gun is very short, but that doesn't mean I'm growing desperate."

Harrington and Richardson (HRA) Garand 1954, original barrel, comes with one en bloc clip full of ammo. Was told this rifle was a DCM/CMP rifle and have the instruction manual and chamber flag that came with it.
I don’t have any gauges or anything like that but a .30-06 round still fits snuggly in the tip of the barrel. The action is smooth and locking is positive, the bore is shiney, the blueing is strong and the rifle is all greased up and ready to shoot.

Rifle comes with; 
2 40 round magazines (I have one extra 40 round that has issues aswell) 
1 30 round magazine
220 rounds of 7.62x39 tula
The sling as pictured

The rifle shoots great, and is very accurate. I've only put 500 rounds through it, regardless of being used, its still in great condition.

The RPK is like an AK47/AKM, except the reciever is slightly longer, and the barrel is thicker and longer. It will accept all AK magazines and drums. This rifle will accept most AK sights and accessories, and has a standard AK receiver rail.

The PSO Scope that comes with the rifle is a Russian Model 4x24-1 PSO Scope. The crosshair aren't the normal crosshairs, but instead, Mosin Nagant-PU styled crosshairs. The scope is in working condition, except for the 'night time' settings. The bulb that needs replacing is burnt out, but you can buy them online for under 20$, and its very easy to replace.

The rifle comes with 3 different stock sets, one wood SVD style set (gas tube cover is missing bot those are a dime a dozen), one black polymer SVD style set, and the set pictured. 

Trades only please, If you want more photos of the rifle, scope, etc, please send me an email."

I have a brand new, never worn custom leather and suede lined shoulder holster for 1911. It is right handed and has 2 magazine pounces and cuff case as well. This is a hibred holster, you can take the holster off the harness and use it as a belt holster as well. This holster was made by the world famous Samual Andrews from andrews leather. Do your research and you will see he is 2nd to non. He has a 6 month wait list for holster work and the wait is well worth it. His holsters are works of art, the craftsmanship is superb, I promise, you have never seen a holster so nice.   I paid 290 for this holster , will sell for 250 firm. Not a penny less, you will not find a better holster and you don't have to wait the 6 months for the holster. 
The holster is called the monarch, you can read about on his site."

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed. The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine. The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .3oo Win Mag ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots. In the AR tradition, the Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reassembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle virtually seamless. The Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag Ultra Long Range Rifle includes a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for 1 year."

Serial number traces date mfg date of 1980. A 33 year old full size government model .45 with the prettiest bluing I have seen short of a Colt or Kimber. It literally shines. No rust, clean bore. I've owned it 5 years and have never fired it. The man I bought it from claimed he never fired it. Looking at the internals leads me to believe it is true. I know these guns have a splotchy reputation, but I owned several of them in the 1970's that always worked good for me. The picture does not do it justice. Looks and fits better than any of the knockoff govt models out there right now. Nice solid wood grips. 1 magazine. Takes standard 1911 magazines, but my understanding is the internals are different, so no other 1911 parts would interchange. The magazine with the gun is the original made in Spain that came with the gun new.
 I know it's just a Llama, and not a Colt, but it sure is nice. I don't think you would be disappointed, and it hurts my feelings to sell it. New baby needs diapers, and doc bills are rolling in. $500 (the newer ones sell for $475 on gunbroker, plus tax, plus shipping, plus FFL fee, and don't look near as good, so no lowballers)

Also important to note is the use of steel on a multitude of parts that are now machined from alumium. The NH made newer 226 is very common and essentially the same pistol mechanically speaking. The only real difference being the addition of the accessory rail in recent years, the metalurgy, details like grips and markings and obviously the place of manufacture. 

                  THIS IS A PARTS MATCHING ALL ORIGINAL FIREARM. Serial numbers on barrel, slide and reciever all match, function and are good in condition. The only wear to speak or on the pistol is from being drawn nd re-holstered. The slide rails have virtually NO WEAR! incidicative of a very low round count. The bore and barrel rifleing are literally like new.  All other internal parts exhibit typical wear but not excessive.

My Sig comes with one factory magazine capacity of 15rds, one Mec-Gar 14rd mag, pistol belt and holster. Attached please find photos of all included, and close-ups of the pistol."

This is the latest version of the Colt Gold Cup series model 05070X. From Colts site: The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950’s to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealer’s showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National Match® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard. It is your responsibility to know if you are legally allowed to own this gun in your state. I will ship fedex 2nd day air for a flat rate fee of $30. I will only ship after payment has cleared.
