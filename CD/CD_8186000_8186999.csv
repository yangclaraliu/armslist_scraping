It is a stainless version that sports a 28 inch Green Mountain sporter barrel, I call it the squirrel rake. Don't you hate it after you shoot a squirrel and the thing gets hung in the yoke of tree branch? That is where this thing comes in handy, with that long barrel you can reach up and knock it out of the yoke, easy-peasy. I testfired this rifle about two weeks ago and I discovered that the Green Mountain Rifle Barrel on this rifle is a gunsmith version they used to sell. The barrel has a match chamber, very tight, and a 90 degree target crown. It will not load Winchester subsonic rounds but it loves Eley Black Box Match 1070fps.The original Overton walnut stock has been refinished with a seven coat tung oil. It cannot be seen in the photos I posted in this ad but the stock grain has an irreidesent to it when flipped back and forth in the light. The Overton walnut stock came with an aluminum barrel band and butt plate The receiver is the only original equipment, from the aluminum CNC trigger with volquartzen internals, TB bolt buffer, take down screw. On top of it all is a side focus Mueller 8-32x40mm scope with a fine crosshair reticule with a target dot, with glove grip turretts, mounted with x-high weaver 6 hole scope rings. This rifle cannot be reproduced for the price I am asking for it, my loss is your gain. I am asking $887.00 for the rifle and scope or $630.00 for just the rifle. One 10 round magazine included. I will ship this rifle to your FFL for 35.00 to the lower 47 states, NO CALIFORNIA SALES. Thanks for looking."

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.Manufacturer: Taurus 1809041Specifications and features:Taurus Model 809 Semi Automatic Handgun9mm4"" barrel17 round magazineAmbidextrous 3-position thumb safety and decockerAmbidextrous magazine releaseLoaded chamber indicatorSingle/double actionExternal hammer for ""strike two"" capabilityBlack, medium polymer frameIncludes small, medium, and large backstrapsBlack Tennifer finishFixed Novak 3-dot sights8.25"" overall length30.2 ozTaurus 809 PistolTaurus 809 Pistol, 9mm Caliber, Single/Double Action, Hard Rubber Grips, Fixed Three-Dot Sights, 4 inch Barrel Length, 17 round Magazine Capacity, Blue, 1809041Taurus Handguns (Pistols)"

This carbine was brought into existence after careful market trend analysis and soul searching.  Obviously, the Ranger Proof Carbine (RPC) is the flagship, top shelf rifle. However, there is a vast pool of people out there who do not have the means to get into the RPC. So, we decided to offer a very high quality rifle, based on a forged upper and lower receiver that fits in the price point that is accessible to the majority of our supporters. We will also offer an “upgrade” package that can be purchased at a later date, to upgrade the MILSPEC components to bring the ELC in line spec-wise with the RPC.
So, here is a breakdown of the ELC and what you get for the money…
We start with the barrel. This is the heart of the rifle. It will be available in the standard 16” 1:8 twist, mid length gas system, 5.56 chamber, or you can choose to spec a 14.5” barrel… with a pinned / welded muzzle device. This is a 4150 Chrome Moly Steel Barrel, Button Rifled and ISONITE QPQ Coated. we have demonstrated how reliable these barrels are, so you can rest assured that you are getting quality. The Muzzle Device is the PWS FSC556, standard.
Next is the bolt carrier group. This is a standard cut, M16 style “Full Auto” (heavy) carrier, with the same manufacturing specs as the top of the line Ranger Proof Enhanced Bolt Carrier. This ELC carrier is Black Nitride coated (ISONITE QPQ) and features the exact same bolt as the RPC BCG. The only difference is the profile. It is a standard “MILSPEC” pattern BCG.
The ELC will also have the same free floating Key Mod rail that the RPC uses, only the ELC will have a 12.5” rail instead of the 15.5” rail that the RPC has. This cuts down a few grams, and also keeps the price point in line with our vision of the ELC, and offers the same high quality that is demanded of the RPC.
The Upper and Lower Receiver are 7075 T6 forged units, held to exacting tolerances and finished out, hand inspected and blended, which will provide a flawless assembly. The lowers are marked Ranger Proof Arms, and carry the serial number ELC-xxxxx for marking variance. The Ranger Proof logo is engraved on the right side of the mag well. The lower will feature an oversized billet trigger guard, instead of the standard straight MILSPEC trigger guard.
All upper / lower components for the base ELC are MILSPEC. You will get a standard safety selector, standard MILSPEC Take Down and Pivot Pins, but, you will get the most EXCELLENT CMC 3.5 pound flat bow trigger. Ranger Proof written extensively on why we like this trigger, and why we prefer the flat bow. Once you shoot with it, you will understand.
The buffer tube is a six position MILPSEC buffer tube, with castle nut.  We also spec a QD end plate, and the rear selector detent / spring are held in place by a 4-40 set screw. This allows for easy upgrade to the PWS Enhanced Buffer Tube later, if you purchase the Upgrade Kit.
The pistol grip and stock are the same as the RPC… We use the B5 Systems SOPMOD Bravo stock, and the Ergo pistol grip, giving some cross platform continuity.
The ELC ships “optics ready.”  You can add your choice of the numerous polymer style BUIS systems, fixed BUIS or the RDS or optic of your choice.
For the price you are getting one heck of a rifle. Each rifle is assembled by the same folks and with the same care that goes into the RPC, and is 100% guaranteed. This is our way of making Ranger Proof Quality, accessible to everyone."

The trigger has has been slicked up and there is zero pretravel, for the single action pull. The double action pull is typical of Nagants, meaning a heavy pull. The gun is a treat to shoot with the 32 acp ammo, with little recoil and a creep-less single action pull. I am including the original 7.62x38r cylinder, 32-20 brass for reloading this caliber, and a handful of 32 acp ammo. I will also throw in a reloading die set for 7.62 Nagant. The original cylinder does have one chamber where the indexing is not catching. You just have to give the cylinder a slight turn and then it will index the rest of the way. The pawl does not seem to be 100% fitted to the cylinder. A gunsmith could probably get it working or you could replace the pawl. Looking for cash or trades, preferably handguns. Been looking for small CCW guns and other revolvers."
