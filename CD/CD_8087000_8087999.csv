177,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8087177,For Sale:  Western 32 Long Colt Cartridges (99 rounds) w/ 2 boxes,"City, Barre, Vermont",$ 150,"Listed On: Sunday, May 6, 2018",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"One full 50 round box and one incomplete box with 49 rounds of Western 32 Long Colt centerfire factory ammunition...99 rounds total. This caliber has been out of production for many years and boxes this nice are getting harder and harder to find. I wish I had the missing round from the older (bullseye) box but it must have been incomplete when I bought it 30+ years ago. Both boxes have been put away in a drawer since then. The boxes and cartridges are in nice shape for their age. Each box has a price ($4.95) written in pen on one end but they are otherwise unmarked and quite attractive with some shelf wear and expected age tone. I haven't tried firing any, so no guarantees there but the rounds look fresh with bright primers and Lubaloy coated bullets. All the casings look the same to me...stamped ""WESTERN 32 LONG COLT"" but the primers used in the two boxes are slightly different. The newer box has flat primers while the older box has slightly domed primers. Please see the photos for more details on condition and write if you have any questions or need more photos. Don't make the mistake I made 30 years ago and think these are for a ""32 Colt New Police"" chambered weapon...they aren't. The ""32 Colt NP"" cartridge is the same as the ""32 S & W Long"" which is still in production. Those calibers have a slightly larger diameter case than these ""32 Long Colt"" rounds. Confusing I know, but it's why I still have this ammo. There are plenty of vintage revolvers (and a few rifles) around that are chambered for the 32 Long Colt caliber and reloaders can sometimes find custom brass adapted from another case. These are the real thing though...vintage factory loads from another era. I just don't happen to own a gun that will shoot them. Thanks for looking."

The SAINT’s flat top design is optics ready and includes a flip-up rear aperture sight and fixed A2-style front. The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT™ AR-15 features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it. Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT™ AR-15 includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor. The Bravo Company buttstock is rattle-free and complemented by a Bravo pistol grip designed to improve defensive performance. Built for the free and independent, Springfield Armory®’s SAINT™ AR-15 represents the next generation of America’s personal defense rifle. Built with relentless dedication to reliability, it’ll be ready when you are because you can always trust the SAINT™. With the new SAINT™ AR-15 pistol, Springfield Armory brings the same impact of its SAINT platform to a whole new category. The SAINT Pistol is highly capable and upgraded out of the box but in stock-free pistol form. Instead of a rifle buttstock, the new SAINT AR-15 pistol features a rugged SB Tactical SBX-K forearm brace to reduce size, stabilize recoil, and enhance accuracy in one or two-hand shooting. A 7.5-inch barrel with a 1:7 twist makes the SAINT pistol small, fast, and ideal for CQB. The 416R stainless steel barrel is Melonite® treated to be harder and more accurate than chrome, and is chambered for 5.56 NATO (.223) so ammunition is affordable, versatile, and seriously capable."

The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT™ AR-15 features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it.   Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT™ AR-15 includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor. The Bravo Company buttstock is rattle-free and complemented by a Bravo pistol grip designed to improve defensive performance.   Built for the free and independent, Springfield Armory®’s SAINT™ AR-15 represents the next generation of America’s personal defense rifle. Built with relentless dedication to reliability, it’ll be ready when you are because you can always trust the SAINT™.   When it comes time to defend your legacy, turn to the SAINT™. It’s the ultimate refinement of the time-tested AR15 design and represents everything that a defensive carbine should be.   The quality of a rifle begins with its foundation. That’s why the extra-tough Type III aircraft-grade 7075 T6 aluminum upper and lower receivers are joined using the Accu-Tite system. Unlike lesser rifles, the SAINT™ AR15 is rock solid, with no accuracy-killing rattle or shake. On the outside, a hard-anodizing treatment protects your SAINT™ from both corrosion and the dings and blemishes that accompany hard use. Inside the upper receiver is an M16 bolt carrier group machined from Carpenter 158 steel. It’s shot peened and magnetic particle inspected for long-term durability.   The SAINT™ features a 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel treated with Melonite. Because details matter, you’ll even find that hidden areas like under the front sight base are finished with painstaking care and detail. The 1:8-inch twist rate provides the user with complete ammunition flexibility – the SAINT™ will handle heavy 80-grain and ultra-light projectiles with equal aplomb.   While receiver fit and barrel construction represent the foundation of accurate performance, the trigger is the final interface between the shooter and rifle. The SAINT™ AR15 features micro-polished trigger components treated with Nickel Boron. The result is the feel of a competition trigger with the appropriate mil-spec pull weight for a defensive rifle. The SAINT™ is easy to shoot to its full performance potential.   Speaking of performance, the SAINT™ is designed for smooth operation and fast but controlled follow-up shots. The mid-length gas system paired with a heavier carbine “H” heavy Tungsten buffer slows and smooths out the recoil cycle, creating a shooting experience second to none.   Unlike most AR-type rifles that leave the factory with standard mil-spec furniture, the SAINT™ includes meaningful upgrades across the board. The Bravo Company Mod 0 Pistol Grip offers a more vertical orientation designed to support a natural hold when shooting from the modern combat stance. The grip is complemented by a Bravo oversized trigger guard designed for easy reach, with or without gloves. The Bravo Company buttstock offers positive cheek weld areas, a rubber butt plate for traction, and both QD and fixed sling attachment points. Like the Accu-Tite receiver, it’s designed for tight, rattle-free operation in any of its six positions. The all new and exclusive Bravo PKMT two-piece handguard covers aluminum heat shields but offers a super-slim profile. KeyMod attachment points allow placement of accessories according to your personal preference. In short, you’ll feel the difference.   A defensive rifle must also be reliable, and that’s why the SAINT™ AR15 uses a dry lubricant coating inside the bolt carrier group and receiver extension tube that keeps it performing in the worst of conditions.   The SAINT™ is optics-ready out of the box. The flat-top receiver is topped with Springfield Armory® low profile flip-up dual aperture rear sight with ½ minute of angle windage adjustment capability. Up front, the A2-style gas block and front sight features a standard post adjustable for elevation.   The bottom line? When it’s time to protect and defend, trust the SAINT™ AR15."

It will feed any type of 7.62x39 ammunition, I have had very few stoppages utilizing the 52 magazines. It is also quite accurate, the bore is dark but the rifling is strong and deep. A pleasure to shoot. The rifles condition is good for its age. However it is a military surplus rifle, and there are a few spots where dimpling can be seen. I could not get a good picture with my camera. It has been refinished, to include the front handguard, which is original and complete, and in great condition. This one also has a front sight hood. Overall a very nice rifle thats a blast to shoot. I have 2 magazines that will be included with it. Both work equally well. Contact me with any questions, or to get more pictures. Thanks!"
