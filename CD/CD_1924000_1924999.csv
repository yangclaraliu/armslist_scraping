Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

They maintain zero after hundreds of rounds and withstand shock from recoil as well as from minor bumps.  Get the look and feel of an EoTech without handing over your whole paycheck. The most notable difference from the brand name is that these don't have night vision compatibility.  Instead, it switches between red and green reticle colors.  It has 20 brightness settings for the reticle, and is powered by a single CR123 battery.  This model has a single dot reticle.  The photos are pictures of the actual sight that you will receive.

Century Arms O-PAP M70 semi-automatic rifle chambered for 7.62x39mm. The M70 is based on the notoriously rugged AK-47 design, utilizing a proven gas piston system, rotary bolt, and minimal internal parts. The original Zastava Military M70 was the standard issue firearm in the Yugoslav People's Army in 1970. Now relive that look and style with the Zastava M70 O-PAP. The O-PAP displays the original military finish of this fine rifle with oiled wood furniture and noticeable bulged trunnion on the receiver. Wooden handguards and a wooden butt stock with rubber butt pad are installed. The 16.25"" Chrome Lined Hammer Forged barrel has a 1:10"" twist rate and a slant muzzle brake. The receiver has a side mounted optics rail and is dimpled at the magazine well. The pistol grip is black polymer.

Glock 23 Gen 4 Semi-automatic Double Action Only Compact 40 S&W 4.02"" Polymer Matte 13Rd 3 Mags Fired Case Right Hand Fixed Sights PG2350203The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.. GEN 4 Features: The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested ""Safe Action"" system, Durable exterior finish, Cold hammer forged barrel, Durability, Reliability, Light weight, ....that make GLOCK firearms famous! The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. THE PEARCE FRAME CAVITY INSERT FITS BOTH ADJUSTABLE BACKSTRAPS. Features: Gen4 G23, (2) 13rd Magazines, Reversible magazine catch, Rough Textured Frame, 2 Back Straps, Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design"

These shotguns have a well earned reputation for being some of the most reliable semi-autos ever made, right out of the box; and this one is no exception. They ""updated"" the design 2 times but still sell the same model as it was designed 50 years ago. I have made some upgrades to it including: ""Competition Master"" loading gate(much easier reloads - original part comes with it as well), extended charging handle, blued magazine extension to match the finish (7+1 capacity), full length top rail (aluminum and VERY light - only weighs ounces and removes easily if you please), flip up BUIS (not that you would *need* them unless shooting slugs over long range, but they are sighted in and accurate), over-sized safety button, and custom industrial Velcro stock saddle that includes a removable 8-round holder and an extra 6-shot holder. I chose the full length rail as it was the most economical way (both money and weight wise) to have a top rail for a red dot as well as a rail towards the front for a light. The folding sights are essentially place-holders until I got around to mounting a red dot (the most recommended sight being the Bushnell TRS-25). If I had a machine shop I think I could get rich making extremely low profile rail mounted sights for shotguns! None exist. For that matter there are several other platforms that don't need the raised sight picture of the AR-15, to which basically all BUIS are made for. The original wood on the shotgun was in really good condition apart from one spot about 1/4"" wide. It obviously has some handling marks from its years of use, but I took good pics of the worst of it. I decided to keep the wood on it, and it looks very cool with the old/new side by side. It is completely reliable with most every load I have tried; the ONLY exception being some cheap target loads that measured well over 3.5"" shot and un-crimped (supposedly 2.75"" rounds). They simply wouldn't fit out of the ejection port. The blued finish is in excellent shape. The previous owner attempted a gold foil inlay on the decorative carvings in the receiver, but it did not turn out perfect. Some areas are better than others. The bbl is 23.5"" vent-ribbed and threaded for chokes. It dons a Colonial IC choke currently. I have a 25 round Allen bandoleer and 40 rounds of high brass 9-pellet 00 Buck to go with it. I've got just over $1000 in it with all the upgrades, mods, and ammo.

I have had this gun for many years and it has always performed flawless. It has always been kept clean and oiled and about once a year it is torn down and cleaned inside and out completely (which was done 2 weeks ago). This model is from the early 80's and has the brass 18rd feed tube and micro groove barrel. Insides are in perfect working order and is very accurate, outside has some wear (hey, it's over 30 years old).
It is time for something different. I would like to trade for a nice bolt action 22lr rifle or 22lr target style handgun. I will trade with or without the scope(less than a month old, 50. values). If your rifle does not have a scope, I will keep mine, doesn't matter on a handgun. I would prefer a Smith/Wesson 22A or Savage MK11, stainless.
I am looking to trade only please. Call, text or email. 816---804--2928."

This model is from the early 80's and has the brass 18rd feed tube and micro groove barrel. Insides are in perfect working order and is very accurate, outside has some wear (hey, it's over 30 years old).
It is time for something different. I would like to trade for a nice bolt action 22lr rifle or 22lr target style handgun. I will trade with or without the scope(less than a month old, 50. values). If your rifle does not have a scope, I will keep mine, doesn't matter on a handgun. I would prefer a Smith/Wesson 22A or Savage MK11, stainless.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano is extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Winchester Supreme Elite PDX1 ammunition was tested by the FBI to see if it can stand up to real world, life threatening situations, this ammunition has impressive expansion and notable velocities at various ranges thanks to Winchester's proprietary bonding process. The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. Now DPMS Panther Arms has been one of the manufacturers leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The .308 Oracle is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse. This AR10 is fully equipped and brings the power and the precision needed for engaging long-range targets AND the versatility to excel in a CQB role provided by the very wieldy 16” barrel. For long-range you've got the UTG ""IE""  Illumination Enhancing scope. A rugged and ingenious, easy to use 3-12X44 scope with some ingeniously unique features. For short-range or fast moving targets the mighty Sig Sauer laser sight has your back."

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

All three of these loads are flash suppressed, so firing them in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20C utilizes the same 158gr. very soft lead cast, SWC-HC gas checked bullet, we load in our +P 38 SPL ammo. It is designed to expand and then penetrate quite deep. (Approx. 14 inches in human tissue) This bullet is gas checked and will NOT lead your barrel. Note the below velocities that I recorded out of my personal revolvers- NOT TEST BARRELS!"

The electronic key entry is simply powered by a 9 volt battery and in the event of the 9volt battery failing, you can manually open the safe with a master key that comes with the safe. You must know that this safe weighs in excess of 600lbs. You will have to come to me to pick it up and I can assist in loading this safe onto your truck bed. I purchased this safe from Dunham Sports about 18 months ago for the price of $1600. You will also get extra shelves and shelf hooks so you can customize the interior the way you want it. This safe was delivered to my home by one of the employee's who brought the safe to my home via his personal Ford F150. The safe was loaded on it's side and when it was brought to my front door, he removed the bed gate and we slid the safe off via the cardboard box and placed it onto carpet which helped us slide the safe to it's destination my home. You will without question need a truck with a full size bed. I will provide the technical specs at the end of this post taken directly from the manufactures web site. I have also removed the 125lb interior door cover as this will make it much more easy to move and this door cover can simply be reattached to the door via screws that will be placed into a bag. If you would prefer, I can screw this back onto the safe before you get here or I can leave it as is to help assist in making the move and loading of this safe that much more easy. The interior door plate is about 1/2 thick and is covered in the carpet like covering. I will also give you a brand new vinyl tarp which can be used to protect the side of the same when loading it into your truck. This will protect the safe from any scratches as well as your trucks finish and will aid in keeping a slick surface to help the safe slide into position. I also recommend tie downs or straps so that the safe does not slide around. While I do not think a 600+ lb safe will move around much in the bed of a truck, there is always that ""what if' scenario we are all familiar with. This safe is in 100% perfect cosmetic and working condition and as stated, it was purchased about 18 months ago from Dunham Sport in Anderson Indiana. I am firm in the price I am asking and I can promise you that you will not find another safe of this nature for the price I am asking. Being that I am a disabled vet and a substitute teacher, I need the finances right now hence the low price as I need to make a quick sale. If no one answer the phone, please leave me your name and number as well as a good time to call back. I will try my best to call you ASAP and I will also do everything I an to work around your scheduled REDACTED. I live close to Highway 69, off of exits 214 Lapel, or 219 Anderson.

This is a Rare Winchester tube-fed semi-auto .22 rifle. There are a few of these floating around, but not many. They made 210,000 Winchester model 77's in the 1950's and 60's, which is quite a few.. But only 10 percent of those were tube-fed...that's 21,000. This is one of those Tube-fed models. I saw one sell on GunBroker 2 weeks ago for $455.00, without a scope.
This one is in very good condition...very good, and it functions perfect in every way and has every modern feature. They stopped making the Model 77 in the 1960's.
It is grooved for mounting a scope. (same size groove that is on the Ruger 10/22 and all .22 rifles). It has fully adjustable iron sites also. The bolt is on the left side, which is one of the tell-tale model 77 characteristics. It functions flawless and looks great. It will shoot cheap bulk ammo as fast as you can pull the trigger without a hiccup. This is a collector's gun due to it's age and very good condition.. BUT, it is just as much an everyday shooter. It has hardly been shot and has a lifetime of use in front of it.  It looks and feels better than a Ruger. It is a Winchester, back when they were the best. It's not overly heavy and it lacks nothing that a brand new .22 rifle has. You don't feel like your holding an old outdated gun. Model number is 160694"
