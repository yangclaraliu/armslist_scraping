Originally released in 1982, the Smith & Wesson Model 3000 20 gauge pump shotgun is a variation on the popular 12 gauge pump by the same name, which had been in production for a few years prior. Other than superficial damage on the exterior of the packaging from storage and age, this shotgun is in pristine condition and can still be considered new, despite being around 36 years old. Includes 3 chokes and a leather carrying pouch.   ORIGINAL CATALOG ARTICLE: Transcribed by Gjenvick-Gjønvik Archives   Many American scattergunners were weaned on a pump shotgun. And the pump action is still a favorite. But you'll agree that a new dimension has been added when you pick up a Model 3000 pump. First thing you'll notice is the perfect partnership of weight and balance. It feels right. Swings easy. And points naturally. Try the action. Dual action bars provide fast, straight-line pumping. Smooth feeding. Positive ejection. It feels the way you've always wanted a pump action to feel. Run your hands over this engineering masterpiece. Feel the warmth of the richly grained American walnut. See how perfectly the wood mates with the deep blue receiver and barrel. Feel the sure-grip security of the deep hand checkering. Some gun, this Model 3000 pump. Designed and built with pride to exacting quality standards to help the value conscious shooter enjoy year after year of dependable performance. Model 3000 pump shotguns are chambered for 3"" Magnum loads. They'll handle any 23/4"" load as well to provide maximum shooting versatility and enjoyment. Behind the superb lines, functional beauty and natural feel of the Model 3000 pump is solid design and manufacturing engineering.  RECEIVER AND BOLT Each Model 3000 pump starts with a receiver that's machined from solid steel made to demanding Smith & Wesson specifications. The bolt is chromed and polished to resist corrosion and provide years of like-new performance.  MODEL 3000 PUMP SHOTGUNS Operating elements in the bolt have been designed to provide positive shell extraction and smooth feeding. And dual action bars insure smooth, easy, non-binding, straight-line pumping action.  BARRELS Model 3000 pump barrels are cold hammer forged from molybdenum steel to stand up for a lifetime of hunting seasons. Then they're precisely reamed to gauge, polished to near perfect smoothness and choked with exacting skill for optimum pattern effectiveness.  WOOD Both stock and fore-end are fashioned from selected American walnut, specially chosen for deep, rich color and grain. Extensive hand checkering adds to the beauty of the pistol grip and fore-end. Then they're hand rubbed and finished for lustrous, long-lasting beauty.  The cross-bolt safety is reversible, of course. A rubber recoil pad is standard. And the distinctive Smith & Wesson seal is set into the pistol grip cap. Our way of saying we're proud of the quality, performance and value we've built into the Model 3000 pump. AND NEW FOR '82 As Smith & Wesson's Model 3000 pump has gained recognition as an outstanding shotgun, there have been many requests for variations on the basic theme. Here's how we've answered those requests. We've added three new 20 gauge Model 3000 pumps. They're all steel receiver 3"" Magnums that will handle 23/4"" loads as well, built with the same features and painstaking care as their 12 gauge cousins. And the 20 gauge Model 3000 pump is available in 26"" improved cylinder, 28"" modified and 28"" full."

A well designed 16 gauge is closer in weight to a 20 gauge, with a shot payload nearer the 12 gauge, and patterning that bests them both. Like its most revered predecessor, the Browning A5 16 gauge is built on a smaller, lighter receiver for reduced weight and a sleek feel in your hands. It also benefits from the advantages of Total Barrel Dynamics and the Invector-DS choke tube system to extract the most performance from this revered gauge. The humpback receiver profile increases the length of the sighting plane to give you the same advantage the first Auto 5s were famous for. Pick up an A5 Sweet Sixteen and see how sweet it is.  Guaranteed. The Browning A5 Sweet Sixteen is sure to become a modern classic, with a short-recoil operated action that is so reliable we back it with a 5 year/100,000 round guarantee — come hell or high water.    The Kinematic Drive™. In its simplest term, kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The new Browning A5 makes better use of kinetic energy with its powerful, short recoil-operated Kinematic Drive System. Kinematic Drive harnesses recoil energy and converts it into the mechanical motion needed to operate the action. This concept is tried and true, and now perfected by the company that broke ground first with autoloading shotguns. The beauty of Kinematic Drive is the simplicity of design for consistent, reliable function with any load and under the full extremes of weather, temperature, moisture and grime. This gun is designed to work, come hell or high water. Operation is clean because gases are sent out the barrel and away from the action.Come in and check it out in store at Gun Commanders on Cleveland Highway or visit online at www.guncommanders.com"

The stock has been through four sessions in direct sunlight during 100+ degree weather while wrapped in black trashbags, so what little Cosmoline remains is negligible. This rifle has matching serial numbers (23***) on all parts. It comes with the original cleaning rod and a longer 8mm Mauser cleaning rod that is easier to use. This rifle comes with an original milsurp sling (which has seen some wear, unlike the rifle), some loose 8mm brass and several stripper clips. It has had only 50 rounds fired through it.I love this rifle, but I'm settling down and starting a family. Frankly, this gun was just a toy for me and it'll have a better life in the hands of someone who will actually use it.I am asking seven hundred dollars for it. I am completely open to negotiation.

The Echo AR-II Trigger is a ground breaking drop in design that is approved by the ATF. The Echo AR-II trigger does not come with a bolt carrier. You will need a full auto bolt carrier in your firearm for the Echo AR-II to function. If you have any questions in regards to if you have a full auto carrier, please visit echoquestions.com.

The Echo Trigger allows the shooter to select from 3 different settings:
-Safe Mode: Firearm will not fire.
-Semi-Automatic Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled.
-Echo Mode: Firearm fires when trigger is pulled and also when trigger is released.
The Echo Trigger is designed with safety being the utmost priority. When the shooter is in the Echo Mode and depresses the trigger one round is fired, if the target moves, the shooter can move the selector to the safe position and a second round will not fire upon release.

The echo trigger has several distinct features:
-PATENTED Design that gained ATF Approval (Patent # US 8,820,211 B1)
-Technology licensed through HIPERFIRE inside the Echo Trigger
-Light, clean, and crisp pull in Semi-Automatic Mode
-The Echo Trigger is packed full of cutting edge technology
-Reliable function in Echo Mode

It shoots pretty well and will come with a reproduction Mosin sling.This is the version of the Mosin that has the 20"" barrel, with an OAL of roughly 40"", so it's much more comfortable to use than the spear-gun hybrid that is the M91/30. It has a working folding bayonet in case you need to charge the fascist armies, but lacks a cleaning rod.Picture posted was taken off mosinnagant.net. I'll take some better pictures when I have the time on Saturday."

CAI DRACO AK PISTOL 7.62X39 
Draco, Semi-automatic Pistol, 762X39, 12.25"" Barrel, 30 rd Magazine, Steel Frame, Black Finish, Black Grip.  
The Romanian ""Draco"" is a semi-automatic Pistol with a 30+1 capacity detachable magazine. The Draco Pistol, while designed for sporting use, has as its design inspiration of the famous AK-47 rifle designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov of Russia.
Pistol configuration makes this a compact, reliable and highly durable package. This semi-automatic pistol comes with a 30-round detachable magazine.
Chambered in 7.62x39mm with no buttstock and a 12"" barrel. The receiver is identical to traditional AK. The differences are the tang is removed from the rear and a block made from tank armor is pinned in there allowing no stock to be installed.
Also, the gas tube is shorter and connects to a 90-degree combination gas block and sight.
The gun is really cool in that it uses standard AK furniture on the front end.
This is the ultimate truck gun in my state because long guns must be unloaded while in vehicles.
SPECIFICATIONS: Barrel: 12.25""Overall: 21.5Wt.: 5.5 lbs.Stamped receiver Wood handguard Accepts AK style mags. Includes 30-round mag

Manufactoring/assembly has been scattered from Japan to South America with various owners since.  I bought this shotgun new around 2000 and I have only shot it three or four times since I bought it to scare away black birds and one turkey hunt.  I hate to just let it sit when someone can be hunting with one of the, if not the best speed action pump shotguns Winchester ever made in the USA.  So, I reluctantly talked myself into selling it.  It is at least a 9.5 out of ten in condition and function.  There is no rust or scratches.  The shell plug is with the gun as are the three original chokes (Full, Modified, Improved).  It has the plug and softcase included as well.  It has a true glo rear sight and traditional front sight.  It must have a choke installed to not damage the barrel.  Without the plug it holds 4+1 and with it installed, it holds 2+1 shells.  The price is a FIRM $240.00 with all items mentioned above.  Must have full cash price if we set a meet!  First email with cash price gets it!"

We started with the super-reliable 92, keeping the engineering characteristics that make it so accurate, safe and dependable; then, we added some features prized by today’s most demanding tactical shooters as well as by those wanting the absolute best for home defense or personal protection. The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice. Easy Accessorization and Maintenance The most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit. Impressive Firepower, Extra-Durable Magazines Another feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round stainless steel magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance. In addition, the magazine well is aggressively beveled, making it super-fast to change magazines without taking your eyes off the target. Absolutely Reliable, Designed to Last The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features.
