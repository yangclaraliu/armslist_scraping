The gun fits the hand well and has familiar controls found on other Sig models. This pistol is ergonomic, reliable, and in Excellent Condition. Making it a great “Used” gun option for anyone in the market for a semi-automatic pistol. This example, chambered in .40 s&w and from the Sigarms Custom Shop has the DAK or Double Action Only trigger system with a smooth double-action trigger every time its pulled. It also has beautiful grips with a unique half textured, half checkered pattern. While slightly larger than some newer concealed-carry pistols on the market, the all-metal construction will help to make the recoil a little more comfortable and its size allows for a more positive grip. The left side of the slide is marked “Sig Sauer P239 SAS”. The right side of the slide is marked “SiGARMS / CUSTOM SHOP” in diamond and on banner. The right side of the frame is marked “SA4 112 956” and ""-SIGARMS INC.EXETER - NH / FRAME MADE IN GERMANY"". The barrel is marked “.40 S&W”.The front sight is a blade with a single tritium lamp set in a dovetail at the muzzle.

The lamp has dimmed but is still useable in very low-light environments.The grips are laminate wood with the bottom half half-checkered, half-textured and the top half smooth. The checkering and texturing is separated by a smooth border interrupted by ""SIG SAUER"" in an oval. There are no notable flaws to the grips. The gun appears to have been used gently. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition. The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion in the bore.  This handgun retains about 98% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish is found in light operational wear on the barrel as well as light wear on the the knurling of the magazine release on the left side. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. Overall, this handgun rates in about Excellent condition. Mechanics: The action functions correctly. I did not fire this handgun. As with all used firearms, a thorough cleaning may be necessary to meet your maintenance requirements.

Product Description: The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols, but in a more concealable design. The completely adjustable P30 grip feature - consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels - is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user. An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. This model has HK's enhanced double action only ""Law Enforcement Modification (LEM)."" For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a ""light strike V1"" setup - requiring approximately 4.5 pounds-force to pull the trigger."

I know what it's worth. :) Anyway, I've owned Browning, Remington, Weatherby, Mossberg, Winchester, Armalite and just about every American made firearm you can name, but I've not been more impressed with a firearm more than this ATA.  It's a solid gun.  Did I mention, I hate to sell it?!  So, the first good and REASONABLE offer I get for this gun, gets it.  I'm selling for $375 (OBO).   A new one at Academy is $449.00 PLUS tax, which would cost you a total of $486.04.  You're already saving over $111.00.  All reasonable offers considered. Thanks,Ryan8zero1 - eight22 - two5fourtwo"

It features a three position selector - Mode 1 for Safe Mode 2 for traditional semi-automatic Mode or Mode 3 for Binary Mode. In Binary Mode the firearm will discharge one round with every function of the trigger whether a pull or a release. A user can negate the round that would otherwise be fired during the release function by moving the selector back to Mode 2 and then safely releasing the trigger.

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day, snag-free carry.Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.** We accept PayPal, Certified Checks and Money Orders **"

I actually own one of the same model.  Sure some of the the newer polymer .380 pistols are not that much bigger, and are lighter, but there is something to be said for the nice feeling in the hand of an all metal super simple designed pistol.   Designed in Italy, where most of the parts were made.  Due to the Gun Control Act of 1968, assembly was moved to Miami, where the imported parts were installed on a U.S. made frame.   Ultra small, but fun to shoot.   Includes one 7 rd. magazine. Finish about 70%, and has a nice vintage look  This is a very nice conceal carry Mouse gun. Although it's designed for up-close-and-personal work, it is a surprisingly accurate model. Very small and perfect for either pocket or purse carry.  Really needs to be cleaned an oiled (actually found lint in the barrel).  Good bore with nice rifling. Passes function test."

Totally reliable pistol. If you could figure out how to load their mags with beer cans, I bet  they would feed them with no problems  Super smooth and light trigger.   Very managable recoil. Traditional double and single action locked breech semi automatic pistol. Construction is steel barrel, slide assembly, internal parts, sights, trigger, hammer, levers, magazine body and innards, all built into a lightweight alloy frame. Only the grips, Mag safety plunger bushing, and magazine floorplate and follower are polymer. Barrel is 3 1/2 inch Devel type with ball joint muzzle collar that ensures accuracy and facilitates disassembly. Rifling is five groove right hand 1:18.75. Slide is serrated rear, .925 wide at the port; with ambidextrous safety levers that also decock the pistol. Slide also houses the firing pin and magazine safeties: the 6906 will not fire without magazine. Sights are matte blue steel dovetailed front and rear; dot front  These came from the factory with 12 round magazines.  My supplier didn't supply any magazines for them, but each will come with either one brand new flush fitting (with finger extension) 10 round magazine, or a nice used 12 round flush(with finger extension) fitting mag. 15 round mags are available for only $20, which seat well and are for the same 59 S&W series, but extend somewhat past the body of the pistol. I suggest getting it with the one flush fitting  mag, and getting the 15 round mag for $20 more. Its nice to have a 15 rounder for range time anyway.  I will not sell magazines separately without pistol purchase. While polymer frame pistols have their place  there is something to be said for a classic American made fully metal service quality pistol.  This baby eats Glocks for lunch.  This is the type of gun that you could pass on to your great grand kids after 5g rounds and it still will look and function great.   Super fantastic conceal carry pistol.  Smith & Wesson stands by its firearms, so buy with confidence.    J. & G.

With the kiosk, we are able to do the fingerprinting process and take passport photos onsite. The tax stamp will be purchased through Silencer Shop. All you need is an account on Silencer Shop to start. This is a one-and-done process! If you have any other trustees they will need to stop by, on their own time, and do the same process minus purchasing a tax stamp. There is only one tax stamp needed per item.Items sold from our inventory are subject to a $25 fee charged from Silencer Shop or the fee is waived if you select us as the transfer dealer through their website. www.silencershop.comLet us help you ease into the NFA world!! Kiosk Benefits In addition to simplifying the ownership aspect of suppressors, these kiosks offer the convenience of a one-and-done registration process. By utilizing this software, you’ll never need to provide fingerprints again because the unit immediately saves all of your information! (This applies to each trustee, as well.) To that end, swiping your driver’s license during subsequent visits will instantly recall your registration data, which will immediately autofill the screen. Plus, since the kiosk procedure is free (though, some dealers might charge a small fee), your wallet will rejoice. That means more money for ice-cream (and ammunition)! Kiosk Steps   Locate kiosk within Huntington Gun & Pawn's storefront   Tap touchscreen to begin process (select preferred account log-in option)   Scan your assigned Quick Response (QR) code   Follow onscreen prompts/instructions   Submit fingerprints for upload (left four fingers; left thumb; right thumb; right four fingers)   Supply signature with finger   Provide registration information   Answer questionnaire   Choose registration method (e.g., trust, corporation, or individual)   Download mobile app for photo   Complete process   Check text messages/emails for account links and alerts   Treat yourself to ice-cream (and ammunition)   Happy kiosking, and we appreciate you supporting this technology!
