This is the gun that the ATF designated as a machine gun, but did not apply the ruling to those already manufactured, effectively ""grandfathering"" them.

Only 2500 of these were made before the company was forced to cease production in 1982 due to the gun being too easily converted to full auto. Of those 2500, some were legally converted to FA and registered before a 1986 deadline, some were illegally converted and subsequently confiscated and destroyed, and some were confiscated with missing serial numbers (due to the ease of removing the number from the plastic receiver) and destroyed. This puts the number of remaining KG-9s at less than 2500. A definite collectors item!

Now she wants something else as her metacarpal is really starting to bother her... so up for sale this little gun goes. 

This revolver has a little over a 1000rds. through it, so it has a little more to go before she's totally loose. I'm going to say it has normal wear for a .22 SS revolver that's been shot and cleaned a few times, as we all know how dirty some .22 (ahhh hell make that all) rounds can be, which means more cleaning, and thus more cosmetic wear from scrubbing the powder points. See the pics and you'll know what I'm talking about.

Anyway... I'll take $300 for this little plinker. Ya'll know the rules, I'll need to see an AZ ID, or AZ CCW for buyer verification.

This is the hard to find Commander Model. Fired at least 14 rounds through the gun (according to the previous owner). I'm the second owner. Personally, I never fired the gun. Was going to carry or use it for CCW. However, decided not to because it's just too nice to carry. Also comes with a brand new Galco inside the pants/belt holster, and a box (20 rounds) of Federal hollow points ammo. You must be at least 21 years old or older, and have a valid KY driver's License (KY CCDW is okay) to purchase/trade this gun. Thanks for looking.

 Will take multiple low-priced guns on trade (if no boot, just depends?). I'm not going to add boot on any trades. I can throw in some more ammo (at least 100 more rounds) for the right trade. No lowballers or tire kickers please.

455,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1719455,For Sale:  WW II Quality Hardware M1 Carbine,"NW Columbia (Irmo area), Columbia, South Carolina","$ 1,000","Listed On: Sunday, June 9, 2013",Rifles,no type,30 Carbine                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Offered for sale is one of the first 50,000 M1 carbines built by Quality Hardware during WW II.  It is serial number 1595XXX and marked with the Quality name near the serial number.  Based on serial number records that I see on line, Quality built around one million carbines if all of the assigned serial numbers were actually used.  

The barrel is manufactured by Inland and the stock is marked with the Q-RMC in the sling/oiler cutout opening.  This carbine utilizes the low wood design stock front end and the oiler opening is oval cut.  The upper hand guard is the two rivet type and both are intact.  The metal finish is very good with no rust on the weapon and the stock has only very small dings with no major marking.  No rebuilt markings are visible on the stock. The barrel is clean with distinct lands and is very tight.  A field test (inserting 30 caliber carbine bullet into the end of the barrel) confirms the tight fit. 

The magazine release button has the M marking and the back of the operating slide has a number 4 imprinted on it as well as D-7161843-7 HSA on the bottom of the assembly.  The original push button safety has been retained.  The adjustable rear sight and bayonet mount likely were added at a later date but I have no way of confirming that educated assumption.  

This carbine appears to be a very nice weapon that could be considered collector grade.   A correct GI sling/oiler is included with the carbine but no magazines.  An original GI magazine can be purchased separately if needed.  

This is one of the nicest WW II carbines that I have see and is priced reasonably for what you are getting.  It has no visible import marks and likely remained in US service until removed from the government inventory.  High resolution internal and external photos of this weapon are available on request.  Shipping (if required) will be at the expense of the purchaser."

I have a custom, one of a kind complete upper chambered in 5.45x39mm... If you want to shoot cheap ammo with unparalleled accuracy and reliability then this is the upper you want! I only used the best parts money can buy on this build ( for 5.45 anyway :)...... Everything is new, only fired to check function and its shooting 1"" groups at 100 yds! With iron sights! Ballistic Advantage makes the best 5.45 barrels in the world! HANDS DOWN...... They are also Ballistic Nitride coated inside and out so you dont have to OVER-worry about shooting corrosive ammo. Also, this was cerakoted in Burnt Bronze by one of the best in the business. Below is a breakdown of every part used in the build and what I paid.... No panic prices here, I scour the web for the best deals I can find! price includes what I paid with shipping.....

Diamondhead USA 13.5"" hand guard $200
Scorpion Tactical Forged Upper $150
Ballistic Advantage 16"" Custom Mid Length 5.45x39mm med. barrel $240
Ballistic Advantage 5.45x39mm Bolt- factory headspaced to the barrel $85

(4)- 5.45x39mm Mags $80
Cerakote ( Burnt Bronze) $100
830 rds. of 5.45x39mm Ammo $150

As you can see the total of what I spent to build this is almost $1600 with the mags and ammo..... This everything you need to get shooting. Slap it on your lower and go! Im trying to recoup as much as I can for another project. I have 2 of these so one must go. This is not a cheap upper. If thats what you want, there are plenty of $5-600 uppers on here. If you appreciate precision and reliability like I do then make an offer. The one with the offer closest to the mark wins! Oh, and also........ I will not give this away so lowballs will be ignored.

Complete upper with 4 mags and 830 rounds of ammo- $1200
Complete upper only- $1000

Whoever wants the upper gets dibs on the mags and ammo. If the upper sells first, then I will sell the mags and ammo.

The only partial trades I'm interested in are Long Range Optics-  4-16x50mm etc..... Vortex,Leopold,Zeiss,Nikon etc...    or a Sig Sauer P238 or P938"

But guess what..alot of you are upset because of greedy people ripping you off! Here is how to win that battle. STOP BUYING FROM THESE PEOPLE. Walmart and other stores are selling the same ammo for half the price your paying. But if you keep buying they keep lining there pockets with your money and smile knowing that you will keep buying!! Tell them what you think! Some of these people pulled big loans to buy a bunch of ARs and other accessories. Cant find it at the stores..of course not because you keep buying from them and they wake up early to hit the stores with all there gouger buddy's all so they can keep ripping you off. When they are stuck with there ammo because you finally had enough...then by god the ammo will start filling the shelf again. Mean while these people with 10000 rounds of 9mm who cant operate a pellet gun let alone a real gun will be SOL. The people who suffer are those of us who shoot! Even our fine law enforcement officers who practice and train on there own dime cant afford to buy the ammo because of these people. Yet you will expect them to be experts when lives depend on it!!! Or you can stand by and work your butt off each day so these people can keep taking your money ( the money you earn ) while they are acting as a business buying and selling ammo for a profit! And they dont pay taxes on their profits. Your hard earned money just put 22"" wheels on some idiots pinto!"

This started life as a stock rifle. I ended up swapping out the original upper assembly, bolt, buffer tube and stock. I originally was planning to put together an M4 SOPMOD Block 1.5/ Phased Replacement rifle inspired by pics of SEALs and SF boys overseas. 
The barrel is a Bushmaster 1/7 chromed lined gov't profile barrel (unfortunately the front sight is not F marked) that was purchased through PKfirearms a few years back. The flash hider was pinned locally and left with the spot weld in place in order to minimize any ATF headaches should they ever occur. The upper reciever is a YHM with m4 feedramps to match the ones in the barrel extension. The Bolt is made by LMT. Semi Auto Bolt Carrier and small parts are the original Bushmaster parts that I held onto. The stock tube was replaced by a mil-spec tube and fitted with an M4 waffle stock from LMT (nice and tight fit for a USGI style stock); steel sling loop removed but I will include it with the rifle; buffer and spring are original. I have fitted a well-worn KAC M4 RAS onto the rifle in lieu of the old plastic handuards; no rail covers included. The entire rifle was painted in desert colors that have since worn out on all the edges from exposure to solvents and CLP. 
Accessories include: 
-Surefire G2 incandescent in black on VTAC mount in coyote tan 
-KAC VFG 
-Matech BUIS 
-VTAC padded sling in coyote (I had it mounted on the rifle with the intention of putting a QD socket on the stock and looped some 550 cord through the front ala Frank Proctor's slings. 
-USGI 30rd magazine with magpul follower. 

This was just waiting on an EOTech 553 to round out the SOPMOD PR/Block 1.5 setup. Or one could throw on an ACOG/ M68 for a classic Block 1 look. 

I have put about 4000 rounds through the gun over the past 3 years (a very limited firing schedule, no crazy magdumps, only two low round-count classes/clinics) with this upper/barrel/bolt combo with no hiccups. 
Asking 1000 even FTF in Las Vegas, NV area."

During much of it's existence, it was manufactured chiefly in Israel by Israeli Weapon Industries. In June of 2010, Magnum Research was purchased by Kahr Arms, who decided to bring the Desert Eagle's manufacture to Minnesota. The Desert Eagle contains a gas-operated mechanism characteristic of automatic rifles as opposed to the usual mechanisms (direct or delayed blowback) found in other semi-automatic pistols."

I really don't want to sell this as it's a nice gun and these are somewhat hard to find. After talking to the rangemaster at Deerfield, he seems to think that the grip angle of Smith and Wesson semiauto handguns just doesn't work with my shooting hand. I do fine with Springfield models so I am going that direction. 

I paid $549.99 plus tax and background, so close to $600 when it was all said and done. I'm asking $525 FIRM. I don't need to sell it but want to try something else out. I'm not interested in trades of any kind at the moment. Any future buyer will need to have a CCW permit and be willing to sign a bill of sale, no exceptions. The exchange will be done somewhere on the west side of Madison, cash only. It comes with the original case, extra backstraps (3 total that come standard with M&P models), and owner's manual.
