 If you dont want to buy 250 rounds, the box of 250 contains 5 trays of 50 rounds per tray. I will sell a tray for $25 each. No I will not sell them for $20 a tray! 

These large blazer boxes, I paid $100 plus tax at Gander Mountain regardless of caliber, so I am just selling for what I paid and the rifle rounds are below cost. So I will not negoiate at all! The price is the price!

NOT PICTURED:
 I also have some .357 Magnum about 200 rounds I am willing to sell. I have some Remington, Winchester, & Magtech. I will sell these for $35 each box of 50 rounds which is about what I paid.
 I also have some .38 special. Just 1 box of 50 rounds, Federal is the Brand. Also $35

I am selling these because I sold my Browning A-Bolt .270 so dont need anymore.
 40 ROUNDS TOTAL= .270 RIFLE ROUNDS 
2 BOXES OF 20 BOTH ARE 150 GRAIN. 1 BOX IS REMINGTON CORE-LOKT & THE OTHER IS WINCHESTER SUPER X POWER POINT. PAID $25 A BOX SO I WILL SELL FOR $18 A BOX
 These were bought for a Remington 7mm Mag not knowing the difference. So never had a use for these but they are almost $2 a round in stores. BIG Bullets!
 20 ROUNDS= 7mm-08 PAID $38 BUT WILL SELL FOR $20 IF SOMEONE COULD USE.

This price is very fair, considering these are going for close to $80+ a case on ebay (after shipping costs.) Save shipping and get them locally!! (You also get to inspect them prior to purchase!

Don't get scammed on buying the civilian knock offs or ones that were stored improperly or just came back after sitting in the desert in 100+ Degrees for two years!

Inspection date on them is 06 /2013, Packaged date is 06 / 2010 These have a shelf life of up to 10 years, if stored in the proper conditions. So they have a good 6+ years left in them.They have been stored in AC / Climate controlled area.

They have the TTI stickers on them (TIME and TEMPERATURE INDICATOR). Completely in tack and show they are still in great condition!! (for those of you who don't know what these are, it is basically a sticker the government puts on each case, the sticker is sensitive to temperature, humidity, and changes with age, It lets you know if the MREs are GOOD TO GO!) DONT BE FOOLED BY PLACES SELLING THEM WITHOUT THESE STICKERS!

Each case has the chemical heaters that will heat the chow piping hot in just a few minutes. Just add 1 1/2 cups of water and voila', hot food

If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750 (If you want the ""Holo-sight"") If you want to save yourself $100 and have your own sight you can have it for $650."

I am selling 2W-3W high powered 445nm blue laser. The laser will be built to your wants. This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and this must be treated as a gun, If it hits you in the eye directly or from reflection YOU CAN LOOSE YOUR VISION PERMANENTLY. This laser will cause things to burn within a 10' distance and can even catch things on fire. It produces a blue visible beam the resembles a light saber. You can not purchase a laser like this in any store! 

I have one picture showing different colors of lasers I can make. This laser is the second beam from the right.


This laser has a safe run time of 45secs-1min, then it needs to be turned off to cool for 1 minute. This insures the diode does not overheat and prolongs the life of the laser. 


With the laser you will receive 2 pairs of safety glasses w/hard case, which blocks this wavelength of light. These must be worn inside due to high risks or reflection and the dot's welding arc brightness. You will also receive the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and the charger for them."

It was imported and sold through herter's when they were in business from the late 1800s  up till 1981 when they filed bankruptcy. This one is in 22lr caliber. Has steel hammer, trigger, pins, screws and barrel inset into the casting. Not thin liners like a lot of the new derringers have but actual steel barrels inset into barrel casting. 

Has the eagle over N proof marks for nitro proofed. For smokeless powder. Also has the ULM proof house mark which is the stag antler and date of 68 next to it. Meaning it was proofed in 1968 when it was made. 

For anyone not familiar with the ulm proof house they are the ones who HK exclussively goes through and walther uses them as well as far back as WWII. They are a quality proofhouse and proof quality firearms in return. 

Marked Western Derringer, Made in Germany. Not made by rohm either. It has the Kaschie factory stamp under the grip and Kaschie manufactured lighters from 1923 to early 60s. Look up their lighters on ebay. 100 plus for alot of them.  They made lots of metal goods for the german military during WWII. Just as their lighters are quality and collectible so are their derringers. 

This derringer has nice grips, black plastic checkered, nickel plated finish, nice steel barrels with shine and crisp rifling. Locks up tight, fires great. Has a safety as well. Basically a copy of the Old West Remington model 95 derringers in 41RF.

Reliability, versatility, and value make the Model 2000 the ideal semi-auto shotgun. Inside the Stoeger Model 2000 semi-auto shotgun is the Inertia Driven operating system, the heart of the world's most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt, the inertia spring, the bolt body, and the rotating locking head, for more reliable operation. The operating system is mostly contained in the receiver, giving the Model 2000 a trimmer forend with better balance. The Stoeger Model 2000 fires everything from 1-1/8 ounce field and target loads to the heaviest 3"" waterfowl loads without adjustments. Plus, with no propellant gas venting into the operating system, the Model 2000 stays cleaner. The bolt assembly includes an inertia spring and a rotating locking head and a cavity is designed into the butt stock of the Model 2000 to allow installation of an optional, mercury-filled recoil reducer. The Defense version of the 2000 features a matte black synthetic stock with a pistol grip and a blade front sight.

The Geco is made in Germany and was imported into the US in fairly limited quantities in the early 2000's. Sportsman's Guide and several other retailers sold them inexpensively then. However today they are nearly impossible to find. In my opinion the Geco is the highest quality, strongest and most interesting of all of these type pistols brought to US during the last 20 years. Many feel that the HK is a better pistol however I've owned both and unlike the Geco - the only steel part on the HK is the barrel as the entire frame is plastic.

This Geco is in original UNFIRED condition. Also included in this package is:

26.5 mm to .410/.45 Long Colt adapter that allows 2.5"" & 3"" .410 shotgun ammo or .45LC ammo to be safely fired.

26.5mm to 12 gauge adapter that allows the less expensive 12 gauge flares to be fired. This adapter cannot be used with regular 12 gauge shotgun shells and must never be attempted as the results would be catastrophic.

Original German flap holster that is weather resistant and has room to store the pistol, cleaning brush, 26.5mm ammo, .410 or.45 ammo & one or both adapters. Holster also has a shoulder carry strap attached.

26.5mm cleaning brush and nylon lanyard strap for pistol

(3) 5 round boxes 2.5"" .410 rifled slug ammo. (1) 25 round box of 3"" - 00 buck with 5 pellets per shell, & (1) 25 round box 3"" #7.5 shot (devastating close range defense load).

(2) 26.5mm white parachute illumination shells, (2) 26.5 mm Red Rain shells & (2) 26.5mm orange smoke shells.

(1) sealed 4 round package of Orion 12 gauge super red flares - expire July 2016

The last Geco I saw on Gunbroker was before Christmas and it sold for over $200 without accessories similar to what the HK's do when they come up for sale. So if you investigate and price everything included in this set - you'll see that my asking price is a bargain.

Price: $350 obo. This is a pickup item as shipping live flare shells is a hassle and it's costly. Also because this flare pistol becomes a real firearm when the .410 adapter is inserted you must be at least 21 to purchase."

I have 562 rounds of .380 ammo that I am interested in selling. I would like to recover the money that I have put into them at least. I paid about $18-$25 a box for this ammunition.

I have;
4 boxes Fiocchi (brass) 95 grain FMJ (one in missing 12 rounds for a total of 188 rounds)
2 boxes of Blazer CCI (aluminum) 95 grain TMJ (100 rouds)
1/2 Box of Blazer (aluminum) 95 grain (25 rounds)
2 boxes MFS Premium Quality (brass) 95 grain (100 rounds)
3 boxes of Remington UMC (brass) 95 grain (one box is missing one round so 149 rounds)

I have around $300 tied up in this ammunition, not even including the rounds I've already fired. You and I both know that the price has increased dramatically since then. I'm not looking to extort you, but I am looking to get as much as possible for this high quality, new ammunition as it is worth a great deal. I would be surprised if you could find this (if at all) in any store for twice that much money. I'm looking for around $350. Other posters on here are trying to take absolute advantage of the ammo shortage and and are asking absolutely ridiculous prices.  Please call me at REDACTED (or text) to discuss the price and where you would like to meet.

Thank you!

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges.  The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.  . Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger."

Caliber: .308
Barrel length: 20""

I bought the rifle approx 2 years ago, and have put 400-500ish rounds through it. I have every box I've shot through it, I just don't want to dig them out and count. The rifle has been babied, never taken out in worse weather, and cleaned and wiped down constantly. Its in brand new condition.

It has been upgraded with a Bell and Carlson A-3 stock, and a Tactical Operations bolt knob. The Bushnell 3200 Elite Tactical fixed 10x scope sits atop a 20 MOA U.S Optics base via Burris XTR rings. The base has been bedded to the action to ensure reliability with every shot (zeroed in at 100 yards). The stock has also been bedded to the rifle. The stock fully floats the barrel, and the stock has an aluminum frame inside of the fiberglass for strength. On the stud of the stock is a Harris 6-9"" swivel bipod, and on the rear is a Tactical Operations cheek pad. The stock trigger guard and magazine has been swapped in favor of a Wyatt Detachable Mag system. These are single stack steel mags with a 5 round capacity, 3 mags total. FYI, that is duct tape on the bottom of the mags. the steel is a nice, but slightly slippery finish, so I added some grip! 

Also thrown in is a Sniper Central Log book, a pair of good Simmons binoculars, and a kit with rags, tools, oils, the original trigger guard/magazine, and the drag bag. 

This is a complete kit with everything you need to maintain and store the rifle, as well as hit targets reliably out to....well, I've only shot it to 550 yards, and made cold bore hits every time on a 6x6"" plate. This rifle is an excellent sub MOA rifle, and many builders seem to think remington has something going for them with these heavy barrels they manufacture. I've shot .5"" groups at 100 yards with every well made factory ammo, FGMM, Hornady TAP, Black Hills Match etc.. The rifle likes it all, and I'm sure it will respond better to reloads.

I don't need to sell this rifle. I WANT to sell it, to help fund a 69 Camaro restoration. I will be glad to keep it rather than lose too much money selling it.

The M9 is the civilian version of the US military issued pistol. It is almost exactly the same as the M92 except it has distinctive military markings on the slide. Otherwise, it has an open slide design, so the barrel shows through. It has an external hammer that when cocked back changes the trigger pull from a double-action (long pull) to a single-action (short pull). An ambidextrous safety positioned also acts as a de-cocking lever and when pushed down it rotates the firing pin out of alignment. A second safety feature is its visible automatic firing pin block, which prevents the pistol from discharging if accidentally dropped.

The updated model, M9A1, has interchangeable back straps, so the grip can change for comfort or ease-of-use.

The KSG alone is hard to find as is, but the coyote tan variant is nearly impossible. I’ve only shot a couple dozen rounds through it. I wouldn’t even consider that “broken in” yet. I’ve sighted-in the sights with slugs @ 50yds. It’s dead on every time (rounds touching bullseye), as long as you do your part. And I’ve shot some birdshots through it both slow and rapid fire to test its’ abilities using cheap birdshots. They all cycled flawlessly. Great compact shotgun for home defense/personal protection or just to add to your collection due to its’ rarity. 

The firepower you get from this very compact shotgun is very impressive. 14+1 rounds of regular 12ga shells, or 24+1 rounds of Aguila mini-shells. That’s comparable to a full mag of an AR! On a shotgun nonetheless. While testing it, I also got a good look at how well made the KSG is. Very well built and durable. Looks like it can withstand some major abuse. Here’s a couple of good videos showing how durable these KSG’s are: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAcYErAoVP0

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-cUJ-w-yjo

Another thing I love about the KSG is the trigger. If you’ve ever shot a bullpup before, you’ll know 1st hand how horrendous and heavy the trigger is. The KSG is by far the best bullpup trigger I’ve shot. Very crisp and light trigger. Enables the shooter to shoot faster and more accurately.

The reason I’m selling my KSG is because I recently found out that I cannot use this gun for the purpose I bought it for. This has nothing to do with the gun, but the agency I’m with. So sadly, I have no use for this gun. If I was a collector, I’d keep it just because of its’ rarity. But I’m more of a shooter and tend to get rid of guns that I don’t/won’t use.

Here’s what you get with this sale:
Kel-Tec KSG (factory coyote tan)
Magpul (MBUS) Rear sights (tan)
Magpul (MBUS) Front sights (tan)
Magpul RVG (vertical grip) (tan)
Kel-Tec KSG Kydex cheek rest
Kel-Tec KSG Handstop (tan)

My asking price is $2500 FIRM for everything listed above. Serious inquiries only please. Not interested in any trades. Must meet face to face in Sugar Land area. CHL holder preferred, but not required.

I am wanting to sell my tricked out assault rifle.  All I have assaulted with it are pigs though!  

I had this gone through and prepped out to be the ultimate pig rifle.  It has... 
1) A folding Russian bayonet.  Let em charge! 
2) A 30 round mag.  Let em charge! 
3) A shell deflector to protect the fancy scope on it. 
4) A fancy illuminated scope that lights up in either red or green depending on whether you are hunting at twilight or sunrise. Let em try to sneak up on you! 
5) It has the original open Russian style night sights. They need recharged every year to keep them glowing in the dark though. 
6) It has a recoil diverter on the muzzle to allow you to stay on target for rapid firing. 
7) It has some internal upgrades as well.  For example the valve that switches the op rod on and off has a custom machined SS valve in it. 
8)  It has a custom fitted Tapco adjustable stock upgrade with the pistol handle on it. 

This is the Yugo version of an SKS. I know you can find cheaper ones around... but try finding a SKS like this.  I am not a dealer, this is my gun set up specifically to destroy Texas pigs! You will only need to put ammo it and go hunting! 

Now if 30 round mags are illegal in your area... I can substitute a 20 rd by request.  It must be shipped to a ffl so be sure you know whether its legal or not to own this magazine. 

As you know the normal terms are that you need to take it to a gunsmith and check it before shooting it... 

No checks..."

I'm selling my CMMG .22lr complete upper (ran only about 200 rounds at the range once, then cleaned and stored away). It is in excellent condition.

It has a 16"" M4 Profile Barrel, WASP Treated 4140 Chrome-Moly Steel, 1:16"" Twist, standard M4 Hand Guard, and low Profile Railed Gas Block.

About Gen II Tapco Intrafuse AR15 mags (from the manufacturer):

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."
