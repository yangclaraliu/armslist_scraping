It has the stainless barrel but it is fluted, crowned and floating,
pretty standard for accurized weapons, weapons that shoot less than a
minute of angle (MOA). It has a trigger job to die for (no pun
intended). It is crisp and very light, which you want; you want to be
surprised when the ""hammer drops"" so you don't flinch or ""pull"" when
firing. It has a custom made walnut stock that is both beautiful and
designed for perfect ergonomics for the right shot. Mauser actions
are the desired system for long sniper shots due to its simplicity and
accuracy (it holds three plus one rounds in the well).

The gun has fired very few rounds, probably less than 100.  The action is a  roller delayed blowback action which is also used by CETME and Heckler & Koch German military rifles.  It produces very little barrel climb and recoil.  It is quite reliable. The ejection port is out the bottom so it is totally ambidexterous.  This model was made years ago, long before modern design plastic guns were in style.  It was way ahead of it's time in both  design and function, to say nothing about the capacity.  This unusual, rare gun can be part of your collection.  It's sure to be a conversation piece.  It's a trip to shoot.  It is shown with the 50 round magazine attached.  The NIB 100 rounder that is right above it is available.  I also have additional parts available that were just bought, smoke covers for the 50 and 100 rd drums so you can see the shells in the loaded magazines, an additional 100 rd. drum, a 50 round loading tool that quickly loads the magazines  Parts are available from Calico Light Weapons Systems.

I heard the manager began cracking down on this but they still let their buddies know when they're in stock. They'll also only sell you one but sell their buddies 3+ at a time. Saw some kid walking out with 3 ar's. No one needs 3 dpms's at once when you could buy a bushmaster or colt. Also they're huge pricks at the store. Have to stand in a 30 minute line until they're done picking their butts in back or having a heart attack for being too obese. Recommendation to bass pro: Don't hire bolingbrook high dropouts, don't hire employees that can walk, talk or answer a phone (the gun department is not a charity job), treat your customers with respect answer the damn phone so I don't drive to the store for you to tell me you don't have any ammo.

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

If you want just the FNX Tactical without the ammo, $1100 firm. Thanks

 The pistol is the finest tactical pistol made period and I am forced to sell it after owning it just under two weeks. The FNX and ammo are $567 below market price.  These are very difficult to find and the demand is insane.  They shoot like a $4000 dollar match pistol and with 15+1 they are stacked. The precision and quality surpasses anything on the market. Do your reasearch and you will see what the FNX Tactical is all about as well as the cost. Worth every dollar!

The price is firm and I will not consider any trades, cash only face to face. No more out of state and I will not hold it again and get burned. I am only selling it to pay for damages from an accident.  Lesson learned."

  I have for a sale one hell of a pistol.  This is a Colt M1991 Compact .45ACP  I bought this brand new years ago, it has been my carry as well as home defense weapon.  It is as rock steady and reliable as anything I have ever owned or even shot.  I never ever thought I would sell it but here it is.

   It has Crimson Trace Laser grips, comes with the original box, 2 Colt factory magazines and an Uncle Mikes holster for it.  The only real wear is visible in one picture, where some of the parkerizing has worn off when I had an under slide laser mounted.  Other than that, she is in pretty good shape. I would judge 85-90% but I will let the pictures do the talking.
   As for value, honestly I really don't know the value so I am going to say $1100.00 for everything. 

  No sales to Crook County or any other place that would dare ban such a fine shooting iron.  All rules must be followed and wait time does apply."

Trust me, I'm no price gouging ammo hoarder, but if I want to buy factory ammo now, I'm going to pay the price or wait.  Just like gas - no one who  bought gas at a dollar a gallon is going to sell it for that price when it is four bucks a gallon.  Obviously, everyone has thier price, but if you want old store prices on ammo, then you better be willing to take old store prices on the gun you are trying to trade.  Seems like too many people are trying to turn a fair deal into one that will profit themselves.  Sure, that's business, but its disappointing when our ""community"" has sunk to the level of the corporate profitability mentality, instead of treating each other as equal members (brethren) of the shooting community."

I have for a sale one hell of a pistol. This is a Colt M1991 Compact .45ACP I bought this brand new years ago, it has been my carry as well as home defense weapon. It is as rock steady and reliable as anything I have ever owned or even shot. I never ever thought I would sell it but here it is.

It has Crimson Trace Laser grips, comes with the original box, 2 Colt factory magazines and an Uncle Mikes holster for it. The only real wear is visible in one picture, where some of the parkerizing has worn off when I had an under slide laser mounted. Other than that, she is in pretty good shape. I would judge 85-90% but I will let the pictures do the talking.
As for value, honestly I really don't know the value so I am going to say $1100.00 for everything.

No sales to Crook County or any other place that would dare ban such a fine shooting iron. All rules must be followed and wait time does apply"

I can make coke cans dance at 100 yards without even trying and I hit 3"" groups at 150 yards pretty easily.

I've taken down rabbits, squirrels, and even raccoons with this air gun. It has some serious takedown power for small game. It is very accurate and can take down a rabbit at 100+ yards with good shot placement. 

Secondly, it is extremely quiet. If you're looking to do some squirrel control in the city, or maybe just do some backyard plinking, this is your gun. Your neighbors won't even hear it! Depending on what you're shooting at, many times its louder when the bullet impacts the target than when it leaves the barrel. 

The gun is a break action - like a breech-loaded shotgun, kinda. Opening the breech also pumps the gun; no need to pump after you load it.

Mounted on the gun is a fixed magnification Center Point scope that I've been more than happy with. A better scope might be nice if you're going to do some serious hunting, but I've been nothing but happy with this one so far. 

It shoots .22 caliber pellets, not the typical .177 ""BB caliber."" These have more takedown power than .177. Although hollow point ""hunting pellets"" are available, I prefer round nose pellets. These seem to maintain good penetration past 50 yards, without over penetrating at closer distances. I will include some of each with the sale. 

I bought the gun for small game hunting and used it extensively until I bought my 10/22. I'm selling to buy some parts to trick out my 10/22. 

This would make a great first gun for a kid, but kids of any age (including middle-age!) will have fun with this."

This is the pre-64 Model 94 Winchester 30-30 with 20” barrel.  The serial number is 2100744, which slates its manufacturing date to 1955 (http://www.proofhouse.com/win/index.html).

It’s in fantastic condition.  At least 95% of the original bluing remains.  The only places I can see wear to the bluing is on one side of the hammer and the part of the lever assembly that slides against other metal components when cycling.  There are two small dings in the metal, each only 1/16”: one is on the top next to the hammer and the other on the bottom end of the magazine tube (see pics).  The beautiful wood is in great condition with no cracks or gouges, but a few modest, small impressions and handling marks (see pics).  The bore is clean and bright with crisp rifling grooves and well-defined lands.  The rifle fires and cycles flawlessly.

Here is your chance to own an original, unmodified Winchester Model 94, with pre-64 solid internal manufacturing.  Will last for another 100 years if cared for.

Looking for a FTF, local (Salem) cash transaction only.  $750.  Includes plastic rifle case and vintage Pachmayr slip-on recoil pad.

Excellent condition.

This is an almost brand new Sig Sauer P938 Nightmare edition.  I've put less than 100 rounds through it.  This gun is very high in demand and is a very accurate shooter.   I decided to go to a larger caliber for my personal carry, so this one needs a new home. This gun is great for concealment. 

Included with the sale are:
- Sig Sauer P938 Nightmare (9mm)
- Original hard case with all paperwork
- Original magazine 
- Cable lock
- Also included are an additional set of Hogue molded rubber grips with finger grooves.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine is available separately.

The P938 Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents.

This gun is ready to go. Local Face-to-Face Cash sale only. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale and show Colorado ID or CCW. I'm in the Castle Rock area.

This number is stamped on the yoke cut (REG.845). The serial number is stamped on the inside of the barrel shroud and on the butt of the frame. There is a small SW logo on the left side plate. With the serial number, registration number and the small logo, this is one of the early production models, mfg 1936. It has a 6” pinned barrel, a King front sight and adjustable rear sight. It is a six shot with a counter-bored cylinder. It is a 5 screw, square butt target frame, and the finish is bright blue. Does show some holster wear on the end of the barrel and some handling wear, but overall the original finish is very good. The grips are original diamond checkered walnut type grips for the .357 Registered Magnum. They are not original to the firearm, but are correct for this model. Locks up tight and has a good bore. This model has a spring-loaded ball bearing in the yoke to assist locking the cylinder open. The topstrap and barrel rib are finely checkered. The top of the hammer is also finely checkered. The backstrap and forestrap are serrated. I have sent a letter to Smith & Wesson requesting the history on the revolver. It has been confirmed over the phone that this is the real thing, but I want to get the letter from Smith & Wesson so there will be no doubt. There is some history on the revolver, but only when the owner used it to pay his lawyer. In East Orange, New Jersey, in the late thirties, the owner used it to pay his lawyer for services rendered. The lawyer did not like guns, so he put it away until the middle 1960’s when he gave it to his daughter. She did not like guns either so she put it up until around 2002, when she gave it to her sister. This sister kept it and finally married a man who did like guns. The story ends here because the husband sold it to me in January 2013. There is no box or paperwork. Must ship to an FFL. Shipping is $75.00. Will go USPS Priority-Insured. I can accept a credit card with no additional fee. I can send additional pictures if requested. I could only put 10 on Gun Broker."

795,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1383795,For Sale:  SWD Cobray M-11,"West, Evansville, Indiana","$ 6,000","Listed On: Tuesday, April 2, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"S.W.D. M-11 Sub machine gun, 9mm.  Bought new by me around the year 2000.  I have fired precisely 100 rounds of Winchester 147 gr. ammo through this firearm and it was then cleaned, oiled and stored.  There you have it's complete history.  No modifications.  No further exchanging of hands.  No movement to different parts of the country.  That's your whole story.  It failed to feed roughly the 10th round of the first mag run through it, but has functioned perfectly ever since.  Included is the original box, original manual, unmolested firearm along with 6 factory 32 round magazines; 4 of which come in their own carrying sling.

Bring lots of ammo, look up to make sure there are no low flying aircraft (oh, it will climb, no doubt) and be prepared to wear that grin for the next several days.  I am not interested in trades.  Sorry.  If I become annoyed with rude people like I did around 5 years ago, I'll simply remove the ad, put it back in my safe, and maybe advertise it again in another 5 years.  If you know these pistols, you know they run well; especially when unmolested with ill-fitting aftermarket parts.

Just to be clear, the transfer of this weapon has to be made via a class III firearms dealer and you will have to pay the government $200 for a nice pretty stamp that goes with this firearm.  If you buy it, it is yours.  If you do by chance not get approved, it is between you and your class III dealer how you will sell it to a buyer who can get approved.  As most all class III dealers will tell you, it really isn't all that hard to get approved to own this sub machine gun; it just takes a bit more time.  Payment will be due at the time of the sale.  If you have any questions, just ask.  Probably the biggest question now is, if I put it away again for another 5 years before listing it for sale again, will you, as a law abiding citizen, be able to purchase this firearm then?  Thanks for looking!"

- Speed Loader.

Production Date: JAN 2013.
Ejector Code: 30274.

Gun was purchased in FEB 2013.
Night sights were purchased and installed a couple weeks ago.
Only 50 rounds fired. Functions perfect! No erratic ejections or brass to face.
Gun is still in immaculate condition and you can't even tell its been fired.

Want to trade only for:

Glock 17 Gen 4. Must come with original box and 3 - 17 round Glock magazines (no Korean KCI mags), the backstraps and extended rear pin, and of course the original contents (papers, speed loader, gun lock, cleaning brush).
Must be of recent production, between OCT 2012 - present. Models that were produced before OCT 2012 had the 336 ejector. The 336 ejectors were causing erratic ejection issues like brass to the face, FTF, FTE, stovepipe, etc. Glock noticed the problem and started putting in 30274 ejectors into their Glock 17 and 19 gen 4 pistols, as well as gen 3 pistols.

I have 3 extra 15 round Glock mags that I will be willing to trade for 3 - 17 round Glock mags. That means I have 6 total 15 round mags that I would like to trade for 6 - 17 round mags. If you only have the 3 - 17 round mags, I will only trade the 3 - 15 round mags that originally came with the gun. The extra 3 mags, I can sell for $40 each, which is the price I paid for them. 

I will throw in the new night sights for free. I will not charge anything extra or need anything extra for the night sights. I just want to swap my G19 for a G17 and you will benefit with getting a new set of night sights. If your Glock 17 already comes with night sights, then of course we'll just simply swap pistols and mags. Glock 17 must be in new or like new condition and not a used police trade-in. I prefer to have the full size frame that is why I am wanting to trade.

The pistol has a few tint service marks here and there, and there is one little spot of finish wear on the right side of the receiver, just behind the barrel – and this looks like it might polish out nicely. The grip medallions have tarnished a bit to a copper color, these, also, will polish out, and the grips themselves, show almost no wear. The pistol rates just below 95% overall condition. The pistol’s bore is crisp with great rifling, and trigger pull is very smooth.

Not really in a rush to sell however if and when I do get to it, it will remain in my gun cabinet and probably be fitted into the new Archangel Stock AA9130. All else is mechanically fine. Over all condition of rifle is still really good. Numbers all match. Original furniture was removed and fitted into an $80 ATI Monte Carlo Fiberglass Stock. I found this to be more accurate.
