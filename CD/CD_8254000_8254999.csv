The Benelli SuperNova® is an innovatively designed Pump-Action Shotgun made from the most advanced materials. The SuperNova is an ultra-reliable, nearly indestructible pump shotgun that's ideal for all-round rugged use. This SuperNova is finished with the Realtree MAX-4® camo pattern, designed specifically for waterfowl hunting. Filled with cattails, swamp grasses, and cane, MAX-4 blends in with marshlands as well as corn stubble and other agricultural cropland. The SuperNova comes with Benelli's ComforTech® recoil reduction system that tames recoil from magnum loads considerably and reduces muzzle rise for fast follow up shots. A shim kit enables adjustment of drop and cast; integrated sling attachments allow the shotgun to be carried with a sling. Benelli constructs the SuperNova with corrosion-proof polymer over-molded on a skeleton framework to form single-piece receiver and buttstock for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Exterior metal parts have a non-glare, anti-corrosive finish. The polymer forearm pushes a rotary-head bolt back with dual-action bars. Aggressive ribbing on a contour-tapered forearm provides a secure hold while cycling the action under any circumstance. A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine, to quickly load another round via the ejection port in the event that a different shooting situation suddenly presents itself. The premium steel barrel features a ventilated stepped rib with a mid bead and red-bar front sight. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place; the shotgun can be fieldstripped down to basic components in less than a minute. The Benelli 12 gauge SuperNova Pump-Action Shotgun handles all 2-3/4"", 3"" and 3-1/2"" ammunition. The 3 included screw-in choke tubes (F, M, IC) enhance the SuperNova's versatility for hunting a variety of game over a wide range of habitats.

This is a 9mm AR-15 PCC (pistol caliber carbine) assembled with components from the boutique shop Quarter Circle 10. Most 9mm ARs use Glock or Colt profile magazines, but this one is built using QC10’s proprietary MP5 magazine lower. Meaning it takes standard HK MP5 magazines. Why would you want to use MP5 magazines over the inexpensive Glock mags, or more conventional Colt mags? Because it looks cool? There really isn’t any practical reason, it’s purely aesthetic.The upper, lower, bolt, and barrel are manufactured by QC10, you can find the relevant product info here:Receivers:https://www.quartercircle10.com/products/receivers/receiver-sets/qc5-s-w-qc5ru-s.htmlBarrel:https://www.quartercircle10.com/products/barrels/quarter-circle-10-ar15-barrels-9-mm/9x19-mm-barrels.htmlBolt:https://www.quartercircle10.com/products/quarter-circle-10-ar15-bolts/quarter-circle-10-ar15-bolts-9mm/clt9mm-bolt-assembly.htmlThe trigger can be swapped out for any AR-15 mil-spec compatible.

I have a Battlelink MFT stock and Magpul Grips, and a GST M-Lok 15” handguard at the moment.I have run about 500 rounds through this gun without an FTF or FTE. Suppressed and unsuppressed, subsonic and supersonic. The blowback action seems to be very tolerant of changing conditions.The upper receiver has some dings in it due to me being an idiot. I have circled these in the pictures below.Comes with two magazines and no optic. Looking for around $800. Send me an e-mail if you're interested.FAQ:Q: Does the bolt hold open?A: No.Q: What kind of buffer does it use?A: The overpriced heavy 9mm kind. Do not try to use normal AR-15 buffers with it, it won’t cycle. https://www.brownells.com/rifle-parts/receiver-parts/recoil-parts/recoil-buffers/pistol-caliber-ar-15-buffer-sku100REDACTED4-48715.aspx?sku=100002513Q: Is the barrel threaded?A: Yes, 1/2 x 28 thread pitch.

Glahn (1888 -1951) represented the last of the family dynasty of German engravers who were to influence America’s preference for finely embellished firearms. His work helped to set a very high standard for future engraving artists. Wilbur did many of Colt’s special projects through 1950, including a pair of fancy .45 autos for General Douglas MacArthur who held up the invasion of the Philippines until he received them. Among his other many spectacular special projects, Glahn also engraved two High Standard pistols for Ted Williams and a shotgun for the King of Greece. Glahn continues to be a major influence in the world of fine firearms and his work commands increasing respect from collectors. “This new Colt Special Edition series 70 design was inspired from a Glahn Colt pistol and retains some period factory trademarks.  Colt’s O1070A1T slide is embellished in period Glahn style pattern and border, then bead blasted and antiqued. The frame is etched with Glahn style elements, rebrush polished, and antiqued. The slide stop and thumb safety are brush polished to match. The grips are unique fancy checkered ivory-lite material to emulate the grips used in period pistols but updated with the serpentine Colt logo.  “Thank you to Larry Wilson’s Colt Engraving Book, Vol II for information on Wilbur A Glahn.”  -Colt Mfg."

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. “The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).”–CZ USA"

So please dont low ball offer me.Thanks for looking and if you have any questions feel free to ask.Product page at larue.com/products/larue-tactical-eotech-qd-mount-lt110/LaRue Tactical EOTech QD Mount LT110MSRP $135.00Converts low-profile EOTechs to lower 1/3 cowitness, and provides a better cheekweld too.The LT110 is another mount designed ""by request"". The LT110 raises the EOTech by .275"". This extra height sticks the irons low in the EOTech's window...you can still see the irons if push-comes-to-shove.The response has been outstanding. The extra height is just what the EO has been needing. The design had room for a piece-of-picatinny on the back, so we put it there and now you can mount a PVS-14 or Aimpoint 3X Magnifier in perfect co-witness.Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and matt black anodized to provide a durable non-reflective surface finish. The locking LaRue Speed Lever provides outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.Comes complete with locking lever instruction card and 1 LT2005-B box wrench.NOTE: The LT110 EOTech Mount will work correctly with 511, 512, 551, 552, XPS-2, XPS-3 and similar models. It will NOT work with the EXPS2 or EXPS3, it also will NOT work with 516, 517, 553 or 557 models (or any EOTech with a built-in riser). The LT110 is not compatible with an EOLAD installed.The LT-133 (PVS-14 Mount) and LT-602-1 (fixed Aimpoint 3X Magnifier Mount) attach on the rear of the LT-110 and correctly line-up with the LT-110-mounted 511, 512, 551, 552, XPS 2, XPS 3 and similar models. The LT-649 ""Tall"" Pivot Mount (with Aimpoint 3X magnifier), mounted on the receiver rail will work on all models, but may interfere with rear sights.Available with LaRue QD Speed Levers or VFZ mounts (see pull-down to the right)About VFZ Mounts:VFZ is a new theory in the concept of clamping accessories to MIL-STD-1913 rails. Instead of using a horizontal cross-bolt, the VFZ uses a vertical bolt that draws up a clamping foot against the lower angle of the rail, seating the mount similarly to a fully-closed LaRue lever.Once installed on the firearm, index marks allow the user to remove the mount, then reattach to the same tension, providing unprecedented return to zero for a non-QD-levered mount. The unique vertical alignment of the clamp allows components that are structurally stronger than traditional cross-bolt designs."

America’s first true celebrity, Buffalo Bill was a self-made man, master of his own destiny, who transformed himself many times through his long career. Now, collectors, sport shooters and fans of the history of our American Western culture can now own this unique revolver.  Cimarron’s Buffalo Bill Signature Frontier is a loving tribute to the World Famous Colt Peacemaker revolver with a 5 ½” barrel. It was popular with both lawmen and outlaws, hence how the nickname “Peacemaker” evolved. Cimarron’s Buffalo Bill version with a nickel finish features a backstrap engraved with Buffalo Bill’s signature, exquisite 90% coverage laser engraving and a handsomely checkered walnut grip.   Born in the Iowa Territory in 1846, Buffalo Bill started his career in the Pony Express at age 14 carrying messages on horseback from the firm’s office in Leavenworth, Kansas to a telegraph station. He served with the Union during the American Civil War and became an Army Scout during the Indian Wars, where he earned a Medal of Honor Buffalo Bill earned his nickname from a contract to supply the Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with buffalo meat. Barely 23 years old, the young Buffalo Bill met a writer who published a story loosely based on his adventures. More stories and books followed making Buffalo Bill a household name through the popularity of the western dime novels."
