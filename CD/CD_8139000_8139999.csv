It's a .22 LR, 9 shot capacity. There's some slight wear on the muzzle and frame. it appears to be normal holster wear from being carried in a holster. There's also some very light scratching on the frame right above the grip where the shell ejector stops. The gun is extremely accurate and from what ive read factory sighted to 100 yards. The sights do have adjustments but I've never touched them.Action Arms has a few listed for around $250 which appear to be in similar condition. The bore is nice and bright as are the chambers. Despite the cosmetic holster wear this gun was well maintained before I got my hands on it in 2005. I've always been sure to clean and lubricate meticulously after every range trip, often firing 400 rounds in an afternoon.There's no way of knowing how many rounds I've put through it but it should last another 60 years easily."

This is a de-banned Norinco NHM90 that started life as a pre-ban 56S (Triangle 56 Factory rifle. Polytech Factory). The rifle was caught up in customs at the beginning of the import ban in 1990 hence the birth of the post ban NHM90. (Norinco 56S xxx'd out NHM90) The NHM90's still possessed a threaded barrel that was covered in a barrel cap and came with the hideous thumb hole stock's. This rifle has had the furniture swapped with the correct Chinese wood and the barrel cap has been removed and correct slant brake has been added with the detente pin still intact. Comes with one magazine and original Chinese sling. The rifle was a 56S built rifle and shares the 1.5mm thick receiver and heavy chrome lined barrel. Just like the Mak 90's and Polytech rifles. You will never get closer to the real thing.

I don't have gauges to measure throat and muzzle erosion but it passes the bullet test and the rifle shoots very well. The barrel is a SA replacement barrel installed in the 60's with a DOD mark on it. It also has a leather reproduction sling on it at the moment.  The barrel also has a indiscernable import mark on the barrel that is too lightly struck for me to decipher. I've had no problems with this rifle.  I also have a bayonet I could include along with some en blocs for the right trade or price.I also have a 50s HRA Garand also in good shape.I'd trade for other military surplus rifles,  1911s, H&K, maybe other firearms just ask"

It did not come with the 22 long rifle cylinder.  Comes with factory birds head grips,  and neither has had the cross bar safey installed. I talked to Seth at Ruger to order a factory manual and he told me the single six I had was kind of a hard to find one beings it is a factory 22 mag and has the fluted cylinder where most 22 mag cylinders are smooth    Both have very tight lockup and are very sound mechanically.  Asking 650 for the super Blackhawk and 500 for the single six.  Thanks for looking"

Stock / Grips:Original wooden stock and forearm are installed.Both are securely in place and do not have any cracks. There are various small dings, marks, and scratches to the wood, from normal use and handling. Bore Condition: Very good condition – no rust or pitting – strong rifling. Mechanics: All of the functions are operating correctly. Overall Condition:The lever action is very smooth – it does not bind or stick at any point. At the muzzle end of the barrel (top side), there are some scratches to the bluing. Some of these scratches do down to the metal, but they are not excessive. A couple of other small areas of worn bluing to the barrel and magazine; overall both are in good condition.The left side of the receiver has multiple small spots to the finish, from previous surface rust. The rust did not cause pitting to the receiver. Near the trigger guard area of the lever, there was rust that did cause small amounts of pitting. There is no damage to the crown or rifling. Based on an online database, this was produced in 1983. The barrel is stamped JM, so it is definitely pre-Remington days. Magazines & Accessories: No magazines or additional accessories are included.

I installed this on my Glock 17 and used it one time at the range. I’m sell the mount since I bought a Glock 34 MOS.  I paid $150 with shipping for the mount, front and rear suppressor sights.  I have the original box and everything it came with. Will sell for $100 cash FIRM price, since I do not have to sell. Do not ask for a lower price! If the ad is up it is available so please don’t ask. The mount is very easy to install.  The optic is not included. Information:Will accept Trijicon RMR, Vortex Razor, Viper, Venom, Burris Fastfire, Shields, Insights MRDS, and any other red dots we haven't thought of.The original ""L-Mount"" was a great unit, but we knew we could make it better. Specifically customers loved the super secure mounting and the ability (unlike other mounts) to zero rear sight and red dot independently of each other. The two things everyone asked for were to be able to disassemble the slide without removing the unit, and to be able to mount a wide variety of red dots to the unit. Truly, many guys that wanted to buy these were using red dots other than Trijicon.So we upgraded and improved the product. This universal red dot mount provides the benefits of the co-witnessed red dot, any red dot, but without the need to modify a ""company gun"".The unit is tall enough to clear most suppressors and there are no modifications required to your slide. It mounts in the factory rear sight dovetail just like a traditional rear sight, but an additional contact point using the rear slide cover plate is created, giving an extremely solid and immovable base. Unlike other similar units on the market with integral fixed iron sights, our unit allows for the use of any sights made for the Glock pistol of any height. The unit has capability to accept any sights made for Glock pistols in the correct positions (forward and behind the Trijicon RMR). Unlike other more costly products, the L-Mount allows the iron sights to be zeroed to coincide with the red dot.
