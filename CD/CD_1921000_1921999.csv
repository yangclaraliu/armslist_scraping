the interior needs some love and attention. it needs new carpet, headliner (found online for headliner and carpet $250 tax and shipping included) a piece of the dash needs replaced. the transmission on the first start of the day has to warm up before it will catch gear. the transmission shop told me the seals are old so it takes the warming up to swell the seal and catch gear. the rest of the day you can turn off, crank and catch gear all day. 
its a great car, but not what im wanting anymore. i want a harley vrod, or bagger, v8 mustang, trans am, etc. or cash would work. make offer. will do guns and cash, alot of guns, etc.

It began as a Palmetto State Armory Premium M4 and was upgraded to the following specs:

5.56 NATO
1/7 twist
Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel
Forged 7075-T6 upper and lower receiver
Dust cover
Forward assist
Full auto bolt carrier group
Dry film lubricated buffer tube
Combat trigger group
Midwest Industries aluminum quad rail
30 round magazine
Vertical grip with spring loaded bipod
Eotech 512.A65 holographic red dot sight

The entire rifle has been had a high temperature ceramic Cerakote finish applied to it - all of the polymer (plastic) pieces, the roll pins, controls (mag release, bolt release, safety, take down pins, etc) barrel, buffer tube, magazine, front sight, and gas block have been done in Graphite Black.

The upper and lower receiver, and the hood of the Eotech have been done in Burnt Bronze. This is my absolute favorite color finish that Cerakote provides. It is so difficult to capture the life in the color with a camera - the same way I imagine a jeweler has a difficult time photographing a diamond. In direct sunlight this gun really pops!

The Cerakote finish is the best available on the market for protection from corrosion and the elements as well as superior resistance to wear and use. You would really have to abuse your rifle in order to damage this finish.

As for the quality of Palmetto State Armory, I'd put it just above top echelon Colts and Rock River Arms - far, far above DPMS, Bushmaster, Windham, and other entry AR manufacturers. Their attention to detail in the quality of their build and refusal to allow anything with a blemish to enter the market is second to none.

My price is $1600 (LOWERED FROM $1800, retail price of over $2000) for the rifle and the optic. I am not interested in any trades and will not part out the rifle or sell without the Eotech.

Black Powder or Pyrodex - you choose the propellant. The bolt-action Model 10ML-II is the only muzzleloader versatile and strong enough to give you that choice. It's also the only .50 caliber muzzleloading big game rifle capable of producing velocities exceeding 2,300 f.p.s., delivering more than 3,000 ft. Ibs. of knockdown power. Accuracy is a strong tradition with Savage and the Model 10ML-II will only enhance this tradition. Plus, by using smokeless powder this unique muzzleloader is practically maintenance-free without the messy clean-up normally associated with black powder. Features include easy-to-prime hot No. 209 primer ignition, patented removable breech plug and vent liner, a receiver that is drilled and tapped for easy scope installation and adjustable fiber-optic hunting sights.

 Black Powder, Pyrodex or Smokeless- you choose the propellant. The bolt-action Model 10ML-II is the only muzzleloader versatile and strong enough to give you that choice. It's also the only .50 caliber muzzleloading big game rifle capable of producing velocities exceeding 2,300 f.p.s., delivering more than 3,000 ft. Ibs. of knockdown power. Accuracy is a strong tradition with Savage and the Model 10ML-II will only enhance this tradition. Plus, by using smokeless powder this unique muzzleloader is practically maintenance-free without the messy clean-up normally associated with black powder. Features include easy-to-prime hot No. 209 primer ignition, patented removable breech plug and vent liner, a receiver that is drilled and tapped for easy scope installation and adjustable fiber-optic hunting sights.

We have plenty of PMAGs available and at a great sale price of only $12.95! (Rebuild kits also available)

Like its predecessors, the PMAG 30 M3 is a lightweight 5.56 x 45 NATO / .223 Remington 30-round polymer magazine for the AR15/M16 platform, but with a number of new features which improve its durability, compatibility, and overall performance for the most demanding professional shooters. By combining the knowledge gained from years of PMAG production, extensive research and development of materials and manufacturing processes, and incorporating feedback from a broad range of end-users, the PMAG 30 M3 pushes the envelope of magazine performance one step further.

The PMAG 30 M3 features a corrosion-resistant stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower, pop-off Impact/Dust Cover that snaps onto the floorplate when not in use, and easy tool-less disassembly for cleaning and maintenance. Low-profile ribs and aggressive front and rear texture provide positive control of the magazine while helping ensure compatibility with common double and triple magazine pouches. The easy to disassemble standard flared floorplate provides drop protection and aids extraction from magazine pouches, but can be replaced by a PMAG Ranger Plate for improved handling, or the new M3 Slim-line floor plate to minimize bulk (not included). A paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the magazine body for easy marking by the end user for magazine identification."

2008 Tomberlin Emerge E-4 LSV (Low Speed Vehicle)/ Electric Car. It is black in color and only has 1085 miles. It was just serviced at Palmetto Custom Carts in Mt. Pleasant, an authorized Tomberlin Dealer.  All batteries tested at 100% with regards to state of health and charge, with the exception of one, which tested at 97% (I have printout of test results).  They are all re-conditioned Trojan batteries, with 4 being 2011, and 4 being 2009.  The vehicle has a custom full enclosure with matching seat covers (cost approx. 1k).

This vehicle can be tagged and registered through DMV as a LSV, having met all of the guidelines of the DOT. This would allow you to operate the vehicle anywhere there is a 35mph speed limit or under. It can also be registered as a golf cart, which would allow operation on streets 25mph or less within a certain distance of your registered home. This vehicle will literally pay for itself over time, as it will save you in gas expenses ( See SC Laws pertaining to LSV's/ Electric Cars/ Golf Carts). Below documentation was taken from Tomberlin's Website. For inquiries or to set up an appointment, please call 8four3-44two-20one9. Thank you.

The E-Merge E-4 is an aggressively styled, four passenger, street-legal, electric car that can charge overnight on a standard 110 volt outlet and have a range in excess of 30 miles. It is targeted to individuals in local neighborhoods and communities for running errands, commuting and general recreation. Its powerplant will generate almost 11 kilowatts making it capable of a top speed of 25 mph and giving it the ability to aggressively climb hills. The Tomberlin E-Merge™ has 4 wheel braking, seat belts, tip-over-bar, lights, and is street legal.

GLOCK introduces revolutionary design changes in Gen4 to the gun commonly known as the ""BABY GLOCK"". The G26 has been the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994; a market once dominated by the 5-round snub-nose revolver. Standard with a 10 round magazine, it’s highly accurate firing characteristics explain why the G26 is a mainstay backup firearm among security personnel and agencies worldwide.

Kimber Solo
9mm
Carry Stainless

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

Hornady 366 Auto Progressive Shot Shell Reloader

I have not personally used this machine but it all seems to be here. It has been stored for about 5 years. It has a little bit of surface rust on a few places but nothing that will effect function. There are a few videos on line for set up and function instructions. For the full asking price I will include a pair of Coleman cabinets/benches that it is mounted to, a handfull of hulls, a handfull of unknown loaded shells (not knowing--- I recomend they be dismantled), a few pounds of shot in a coffee can, and a brand new 25lb bag of 7 1/2 lead shot.

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

Compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles. The eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of many full size scopes, but because of their short length they have to be mounted further back on the receiver to maintain proper eye relief. 

We have a Picatinny rail top mount for the Ruger 10/22 rifle that mounts further back on the receiver to accommodate mini-scopes in obtaining a full field of view. This four power scope, with it’s Range Finder reticle, can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope kit is an economical and functional accessory for Ruger 10/22 rifles and especially for the Ruger Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled and stored.
