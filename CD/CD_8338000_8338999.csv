Has a 24in. heavy octagon barrel, shiny bore. I was hitting 5in plates easily at 60 yards with the iron sights, using CCI standard ammo. These go for $600 everywhere, in worse condition, but I'm listing mine a bit cheaper because of the scope mount holes drilled in the receiver. They're small and a gunsmith told me they could be easily filled in for around $50 or so and would be unnoticeable. I didn't think it was worth it as it doesn't bother me, and the vintage Weaver scope is fun to use sometimes. Thanks for looking. Firm price."

This gun has the crescent moon shaped buttstock. The gun is 95% blued, and the wood is also around 95% condition with no scratches and one tiny gouge/dimple. Also a plus: it's a great shooter. Has a 24in. heavy octagon barrel, shiny bore. I was hitting 5in plates easily at 60 yards with the iron sights, using CCI standard ammo. These go for $600 everywhere, in worse condition, but I'm listing mine a bit cheaper because of the scope mount holes drilled in the receiver. They're small and a gunsmith told me they could be easily filled in for around $50 or so and would be unnoticeable. I didn't think it was worth it as it doesn't bother me, and the vintage Weaver scope is fun to use sometimes. Thanks for looking. Firm price.Can send more pics if desired."

491,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8338491,For Sale:  German Steyr Bnz45 Rare Vk98...Ww2 Last Ditch Nazi Volksturm Rifle...Matching & Original...C&R,"Mississippi, Mississippi, United States","$ 1,500","Listed On: Thursday, May 10, 2018",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Here's a very rare German rifle that was manufactured close to the end of the World War Two. Manufactured by Steyr-Daimler-Puch using much forced labor, this is a ""VK98"". It is a ""last ditch"" variation of the Mauser K98 service rifle that was intended for issue to the German Volksturm. The Volksturm was a last-line defensive force cobbled together of old men, young boys, and other individuals that had been previously deemed unfit for regular military duty. Armed largely with second rate weapons, their mission was to essentially sacrifice themselves in a last stand in defense of the Third Reich. According to records, there were something in the neighborhood of 9500 of these rifles manufactured. They ran in their own serial number range from approximately 1 to 9460 (this is serial number 7021). They are chambered in the 7.92x57mm (8mm Mauser) German service cartridge and feature a largely standard K98 Mauser action. There were several short-cuts made in order to speed production and lower costs and there is some variation within these modifications. The standard barrel-mounted adjustable rear sight was eliminated and in its place a simple fixed V-notch rear sight set into a dovetail milled into the top of the receiver ring. The front sight was crudely welded in place atop the barrel. The left side of the receiver rail lacks the ""Mod.98"" marking found on the standard military issue, and the military inspection stamps were never applied. The barrel is the late VK98 ""thick"" variation...a K98 barrel blank that was left largely unfinished with a very noticeable step in diameter about 5-1/2"" from the muzzle. The barrel bores were also characteristically counter-bored at the muzzle, perhaps to eliminate distortion or heat-treatment issues from the welding of the front sight. The bolt is also unique to the VK98. The bolt handle is straight, the bolt body had the guide rail milled away, the gas vent holes are round (not oval), and the rear of the bolt body was V-notched to receive the tip of the cocking piece which eliminated the need for the bolt sleeve detent and spring. The rear of the bolt handle root was stamped with the German Eagle/Swastika test proof. The forend of the stock was made intentionally short, eliminating the need for barrel bands (this gives the rifle a ""sporterized"" look which is completely correct). The stock was decidedly crude and was roughly shaped from a beech wood blank. It had a milled recess for the ""blind"" internal magazine which had no floorplate. The recoil lug had hollow ends which served as a replacement for the stock disc and was used for bolt disassembly. A rudimentary wire sling attachment was mounted at the front end and a sling slot milled through the butt. There was no buttplate installed, the rear of the stock was left unprotected. The trigger guard was a simplified piece of stamped steel.This rifle is in very good overall condition and is guaranteed to be an authentic VK98, not one of the fakes. It retains almost all of the original phosphate finish on the barrel and receiver. The serial number is stamped on the left side of the barrel and is correctly matching on the original blued bolt. There is no rust or pitting and there are NO import markings. The stock has been sanded but is guaranteed genuine. It has some non-standard grasping grooves cut into the sides of the forend and there are some natural cracks in the wood from hurried drying (these cracks are no caused by damage or abuse and in no way affect the integrity of the stock). The washer is missing from the sling attachment mount on the right side of the forend. This rifle functions properly although I'm not sure it would be a gun that I'd want to fire (the crudeness does not instill a lot of confidence!). The bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. It comes with a dried and somewhat worn leather K98 pattern sling.The VK98 is not a particularly handsome rifle and would have been overlooked by most trophy seeking GI's. Because of the relatively low numbers produced and high attrition, the VK98 is a very scarce rifle today and authentic examples are highly sought after. Without any doubt, this is an interesting piece of history that clearly illustrates the dire straights in which the Germans found themselves as the war drew to a close.Buyer pays $25.00 shipping.

I'm new to the long range game but long range for me is 500 yards. I bought this rifle due to a good salesman and not doing my research. This is a mile gun. It has about the best b.c. there is for it's kinetic energy. This round out performs the .308 and 7mm and pretty much everything else in a short action. Muzzle velocity with factory loads is up to 3100/fps and at 500 yards with a 142 gr bullet it has less wind drift and drop than a .308 or 7mm while having more kinetic energy 1605 ft/lbs. The .308 has 13.3 inches more drop and 4 inches more drift and only 1239 ft/lbs of energy. Like I said, it's a mile gun. But I just don't shoot at those distances. I bought 5 boxes of ammo with the gun a year ago and I've only shot 18 rounds just to zero the scope. The remaining four boxes of ammo along with the spent brass and the scope bases and rings are included with the gun. The scope and bipod can be included for a higher price.

If you've carried a shotgun in the field for any amount of hours, you'll appreciate the thinking in aluminum receivers. The Maxus has a trim forearm and a close radius pistol grip. The drop and cast can be adjusted to your personal specs with the included stock shim kit. It makes it your shotgun because it fits you better. Take the low rib. It lies low to the top of the receiver and barrel. The Speedlock Forearm eliminates the bulky, knurled cap at the end of the forearm. With the Speedlock, simply lift the latch and remove the forearm. The Maxus' Power Drive Gas System helps a great deal. The piston design has oversized gas ports, dumping excess gases faster on heavy loads and a 20% longer stroke travel. The Inflex Technology recoil pad is very, very soft. It actually directs the force of recoil downward and away from your face with every shot.          Similar Items"
