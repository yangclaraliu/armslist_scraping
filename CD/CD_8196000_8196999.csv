Not interested in shipping this will be face to face only cash sale.  Buyer MUST have permit to purchase, carry permit and MN DL; no exceptions.  Will complete bill of sale at time of transaction which will include a photo of DL and Permit.
Not much interest in much for trades except for something in a .454 casull lever gun, rifle in 460 sw mag, entry level OU 12ga trap gun, coonan 357; i have no need for more ARs or low end semi autos.  I dont forsee any trades being something I would be interested in but if it were can add cash on either end to amke it work.

Unlike most ""copies"", many experts believe this version was in-fact a better gun then the one that inspired it. Very well built and durable design. Excellent grips. Feels good in the hand, with smooth trigger.One of the worlds best enduring conceal carry firearms. Until the 1980s most European law enforcement used the .32acp round as the standard cartridge.  Very good mechanics and bore. Finish is pretty much shot.  Would be an excellent gun to refinish or just to use for conceal carry.  Doesn't really have pitting or rust.  Finish looks like it flaked off off (suspect bad cosmoline). Needs to be cleaned in and out before range time.   More pleasent to shoot, and much less recoil than 9mm or .380acp, yet readily available. Small enough for most purses/bags. The Vz.50 (commercially sold as Cz-50) is an all steel semi-automatic pistol made in Czechoslovakia. It is chambered in the plentiful 7.65mm ( .32 A.C.P. ) caliber. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is traditional double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed and the magazine is single stacked with a capacity of 8 rounds. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger."
