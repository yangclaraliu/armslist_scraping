Description of the firearm below is directly form the website. If you need more pictures of information. Please feel free to ask me for them.Cash price is $680.00.  “Introduced in 2008, the P30L (for Long), has a slide and barrel that measure approximately a half-inch longer in length. Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30.
Like the P30, the P30L was designed as a modern police and security pistol and combines optimal function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user.
Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers, and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame (for applicable variants). A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt. The standard P30L is a 9 mm “Variant 3 (V3)” with a conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with a serrated decocking button on the rear of the slide.
P30LS models have the features of the “L” model with the addition of an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. LS models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with decocking button (“V3S” 9 mm and .40 S&W) and with HK’s enhanced double action only “V2” Law Enforcement Modification trigger. A special “V1” lightweight trigger pull model of the Law Enforcement Modification is also available.
Extensively tested, P30L and P30LS models have been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.”"

This gun has NEVER been fired and has been stored in a climate controlled safe for the last 2 years. I'm originally a hunter from Northern Wisconsin who received this as an upper management gift for a company I worked with and am now looking to slim down my collection. I just can't stand to put down my .270 so I'm deciding to let my .308 go at an incredible deal because I'm looking for cash. I'm asking for 550 but the price is negotiable (don't be afraid to make an offer) depending on travel and how willing the buyer is to meet me. The gun is in absolute perfect condition and has only been handled by a single person (myself) and has not had a single round put through it outside of factory testing. I understand I can't sell this as Brand New or NIB but it doesn't get any less used than this. You'll spend $700+ on a gun of similar quality from a retail store so take advantage of this great deal! I'll be willing to travel up to an hour to meet someone for an FFL transfer outside of the Greeley area which I will cover. Please contact me at 715-367-9224 if interested or if you would like to see any additional pictures.

Caliber: .40 S&W   Action: recoil operated semi-automatic   Trigger: double-action only (DAO)   Safety: internal, passive striker block   Magazine: 7-round   Frame: stainless steel   Grip: Hogue PAU FERRO wood   Sights: 3-dot, MMC night sights   Notes: model KT4043A     About the Gun Kahr pistols are striker-fired locked-breech designs, relying on a modification of the Browning dropping-barrel system with a lug above the chamber locking the barrel into the roof of the slide. Although the trigger is designated as double-action only (DAO) by the manufacturer, its operation is actually similar to the Glock, Springfield Armory XD and S&W M&P. True double-action only triggers are designed to completely cock and fire a pistol, allowing for a re-fire operation on a miss-fired round without without racking the slide. Like the other models mentioned, Kahr triggers use a slide-assisted cocking action which removes much of the weight and length of the trigger pull. As a result, the trigger cannot cock the striker on its own, which is functionally much more like a single-action trigger."

Shot approximately 100 or so rounds through it without a single issue.Did a complete tear down of it and it has been completely cleaned, oiled, etc. All internals have been polished and the feed ramp as well. Just put it back together today. I've never seen one of these BM's chromed. I had assumed it had been polished until I tore it down, but it's actually chromed. Beautiful pistol and still has the factory Star pearl-like grips. It has lots of little scratches on it from over the years but still looks great!Includes the pistol and two magazines (8 rounds)I live in Spring, close to Kuykendahl and Highway 99 to give you some idea of my location.

These are among the finest single-stack non-polymer guns out there -- very slim profile, rugged, accurate -- great carry guns. If you do a search for 3913 / 3914s, you'll see that these are well-loved third-generation Smiths. This blued version is rarer than the silver-toned 3913. This one comes with a Milt Sparks Versa Max 2 (receipt included - totaled $168 and took months) in horsehide, one of the all-time best IWB holsters; also comes with a DeSantis Sof-Tuck IWB holster which has a slightly slimmer profile. Pistol comes with two flat-plate magazines and one finger-rest-extended mag as shown. Also comes with grippy Hogue rubber grips (on it in pictures) as well as a couple of the original Smith hard plastic grips. Pistol shows wear as shown but functions flawlessly, and bore is bright. Read up on these (posts on the smith-wessonforum.com were what sold me on it) and you'll see that these are prized and getting harder to find, particularly in this finish. Feel free to e-mail for link to imgur album with more pics as Armslist doesn't let me post more than one. Buyer must have valid ID and sign bill of sale. 10% discount if active law enforcement, military, or have Maine concealed carry permit."

Bore Condition: Very good condition – no rust or pitting – strong rifling. Mechanics: All of the functions are operating correctly. Overall Condition:The slide was painted black at one point. The previous owner sanded down most of the black finish, along with factory markings on the slide. Left side of the slide was left with a bit of texture, on the center area. Right side of the slide was sanded down more and the face is not perfectly flat. There is still some paint on the slide serrations, along with the areas around the sights.There are some scratches throughout the frame as well, some of which are a little deeper. Cosmetically, the slide doesn't look great, but it does affect functionality – just cosmetic blemishes. The internals on the slide and frame where not modified.
