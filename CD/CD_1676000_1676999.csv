Im the 3rd owner IIRC, I bought this about 5 weeks ago and had planned to take it out of state (I'm not a WA resident,just here for work temporarily) but havent been able to get the time off work to get this inspected and registered at home so I'd like to sell it rather then deal with paying late fees when I finally get it home. The WA tabs are currently expired and I was told it needs to be emissions tested to be registered here. 

It's in decent overall shape for a '93, some dings and scratches in the paint, nothing major though. Has typical older Chevy issues with the driver's door being hard to close unless you shut it hard. Ive replaced two of the worn out bushings/pins but couldn't find the 3rd one at the auto parts store the day I did the replacements. The power locks and and windows all work. The windshield wipers only work on high, I assume the switch is worn out inside, but they work great on high. Just installed new wipers last week. Ive put 300 or so miles on it and havent had any issues with it.

Built for the Egyptian military the Rasheed was based off of the design of the Swedish Ljungman and Egyptian Hakim rifles.  Less than 8000 of these rifles were ever made and out of those produced only about 2000 were imported in to the united states, making this a very rare and collectible military surplus rifle. 

  The Rasheed I am selling here was produced in 1968 and is in better condition than most of the ones I have seen pictures of on the internet.  The gun has all it's original parts with the same four digit serial number written on the bolt, bolt carrier, receiver and butt plate.  The stock has never been removed and still has the locking wires in place on the three receiver screws.  There is a working adjustable regulator for the guns direct impingement gas system, and a detachable 10 round box magazine that can be loaded using SKS stripper clips.  A folding blade bayonet is attached to the underside of the barrel, and a sun bleached sling that is correct for this rifle is also included.  

  These guns don't come up for sale very often and when they do they usually sell for $800 or more.  I would like to keep this gun in the state so I would prefer a face to face sale with a local Vermont resident only."

This one is in solid shape, and yet it shows just enough honest use that you won't worry about shooting it. These are great guns, among my all time favorites. Bluing is in great shape, there is very minor freckling on the left side of the receiver, and a couple minor marks on the right below the ejection port. Stock is excellent, no cracks or chips. There is one small ding on the left of the buttstock, and one on the right. There are a few more significant scratches on the underside near the bedding screw, please see pictures, they tell the story better than I can.Barrel is excellent, bore is bright, and I have fired 100 rounds through this gun to test it and it ran flawlessly. Nylons usually do. This gun is very light, just 4.16 pounds, and very quick and handy. I have owned and shot Nylon 66's for over 40 years and am obviously a big fan of them. Woods rifle, trapping gun, truck gun, boat gun, whatever, the Nylon 66 is a great .22.

first is a AR15, its a RRA lower with magpul badlever and pistol grip.
upper was a unfired S&W sport upper, however had the upper receiver switched to one with dust cover and forward assist capabilities.
have not gotten the dust cover or forward assist for it yet. the resy of the upper arts are S&W, bolt,barrel, ect ect
The upper reciever is unfired. lower has a few hundred rounds through it from a different upper.
Gun is complete and functional except for the dust cover and forward assist that still need installed [very simple to do]
comes with 4 magazines, 1 pmag and 3 BCM mags.
Surefire 6P in a vtac mount, forward grip [not pictures. standard plastic mil style forward grip]


next is a Springfield stainless Mil spec, has about 200 rounds through it. took the first two notches off the spur hammer to prevent slide bite and it has not bitten me since.
everything else on the pistol is stock,
It comes with extra 18.5 wolff recoil spring.
7 magazines
crossbreed holster and double mag carrier
also have a galco leather holster for it if wanted.
3 sets of grips, black [pictured], stock wood grips and double diamond wood grips.
Box ect ect
This pistol was 100% for those 200 rounds fired.
does have slight handling marks and an idiot scratch most of which will polish out but have not cared enough to do it.


Looking for a pair of cz readheads or similar O/U shotguns.
Ideally I would like a readhead deluxe reduced length in 20 ga with 24 in barrels
And a redhead deluxe 12ga with 26 or 28 inch barrels.

It's manufacture date is June 12 2012, and was purchased October 2012. This is no safe queen (which I personally believe is crime for any gun to be), it is a duty weapon. Thus it has been holstered and unholstered numerous times, had approx. 1,500 rounds through the barrel and has been inpspected by firearms instructor at last requal (Febuary 2013). It has slight holster wear on top of slide (as pictured), but wear is only on nitron finish, there are no dings or nicks. There is wear on the barrel indicitive of round count (again, it is no safe queen). However, the pistol functions flawlessly and was inspected for function (per duty regulations). Pistol is extremely well taken care of and was rigorously cleaned after every firing session, and is oiled and lubed once a week, every week. If you are not completly familiar with the specs of the Mark 25, here they are: http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p226-mk25.aspx 

Include with pistol, is a follows:
*Original case with paperwork and factory inspection card (as pictured)
*Safariland 6378-774-411 paddle holster (comparable to Blackhawk SERPA holtster, just better manufacture quality, retention system and belt paddle/loop)
*Houge Rubber grips (with gentle duty wear)
*Three original Sig Sauer (Mec Gar) magazines, phosphate coated.
*One 18 round Mec Gar magazine, Anti Friction Coated.
*One 20 round Mec Gar Magazine, Anti Friction Coated.

Aside from the light holster and barrel wear, the UID sticker is no longer on the pistol. After first training day with the pistol the sticker disappeared. After looking for a while, it could not be found (to bad the sticker and adhesive weren't as well designed as the pistol...) Aside from that, the pistol could pass for brand new.

Just don't insult me, please. This is a premium pistol, that is part of limited production run. I don't want to hear about the guy selling his 1990's west German SIG for $600.00 (hence, why it's still for sale). Parts will not be taken off for a lower price, this is a package deal.

Fun little reflex sight.  I had one on my Glock 10mm and is a real blast on pistols.  It's like cheating, it makes it so easy to hit targets.  Great as a back up on an AR style set-up or even shotgun.  Manufacturer details as follows:

The Sightmark Mini Shot Pro Spec Reflex Sight is an improved version of the most compact, lightweight reflex sight in the Sightmark reflex sight line. Its compact size improves the shooter’s field of view of the surrounding environment. Featuring five brightness settings, double-paned glass and a red reticle, the Sightmark Mini Shot Pro Spec is designed for users to keep both eyes open during use, which allows the user to maintain peripheral vision and depth perception.

The Mini Shot Pro Spec also features a front-mounted, digital  on/off switch for easy activation for right and left handed shooters. Perfect for shotguns, rifles, and pistols the Sightmark Mini Shot  Pro Spec is able to withstand heavy recoil with two locking screws that lock in windage and elevation adjustments.

The Mini Shot Pro Spec comes standard with a removable base and weaver-mount with additional pistol mounts sold separately. Protected by a protective hood, the Mini Shot Pro Spec is more durable and can withstand hard impacts."

I had all the stuff stashed from before the scare, and I decided since I wasn't using it all it was a shame that new shooters who just got into guns in the last year couldn't hardly shoot their guns.  So here's the deal.

What you see in the picture is 3 525rd boxes of blazer (it is brass, like all .22, not aluminum like blazer centerfire), a remington golden bullet 550 back, a federal 550 pack, a 500 round winchester wildcat pack, a 500rd box of remington cyclone (hollow points) and a 500rd box of remington thunderbolt. 

 I was at a local gun shop Friday that literally was selling bulk federal 22 BY THE SCOOP (supposedly a scoop was 50 rounds, yeah right) for $10 a scoop.....and it made me so mad that I decided to put these up for sale.  Please note, limit 2 boxes per person, and please only ask if you are either a NEW SHOOTER or are buying this ammo FOR A NEW SHOOTER.  I know there are some people who are stacked deep like me who always want more, or there's people who want to flip it at a gun show....please leave these for the new guys.  These prices aren't like pre-scare, but just enough to compensate me for my time to dig em out and meet you locally here in Blanchester.  The thunderbolt/cyclone stuff was nearly $30/box pre-scare anyway.  

Blazer:  $35/box
Golden Bullet/Federal $40/box
Winchester Wildcat $45/box

751,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1676751,For Sale:  Very rare Naval contract Potsdam Model 1809 .75 Cal musket (percussion conversion),"Midwest City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 600,"Listed On: Saturday, June 15, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Model 1809 .75 Cal Potsdam musket (percussion conversion), ultra rare Naval/Marine contract.  Thousands of Model 1809 Potsdam muskets were imported by the Union during the US Civil War.  Although they were converted from flintlocks to percussion in the 1830s and 1840s, they were still considered obsolete by the time of the US Civil War.  Despite their obsolescence, the Union still purchased thousands of them mainly to keep them from falling into the hands of confederate agents who were also trying to buy weapons in Europe, and because the price was right.  Many of these weapons were issued to militia units early in the war, and some found their way to Western theater battlefields where they were put to good use until the Northern industrial machine could catch up with weapons production for it's quickly growing armies.

The Naval contract gun is the rarest of the Potsdam 1809s and differs in several ways to the standard infantry model.  I've included the infantry model in some of the photos just for comparison sake, but it is not for sale.  As you can see in the photos, they use the exact same lock plate, butt plate, brass nose cap, and barrel (.75 cal x 41 & 3/16"").  Overall length of the naval contract gun is about 1/2"" longer than the infantry model with all the extra length in the butt.  Naval contract gun also differs in the following ways, starting from muzzle to butt.

1.  No bayonet lug nor evidence that it ever had one.  In early 19th century military thinking, the bayonet was to defend against cavalry, not ship to ship fighting.  
2.  Steel ramrod replaced by wood ram rod.  Wood was lighter and is one less thing that will rust in the salt sea air.
3.  Fore end of the stock shortened by about 2 inches bringing the brass nose cap/band back about farther from the muzzle. 
4.  Omission of the 2nd and 3rd barrel band.  These weren't removed from the gun, they were just never installed in the first place.  So the stock has a smooth taper instead of abrupt step downs where the infantry model would at the bands.  Also since the bands were never installed, there are no insets for the barrel band springs.
5.  Use of blackened brass tubes under the stock to keep the ramrod in place since there were no barrel bands.
6.  No sling swivels.  Since it did not have the second barrel band, there was no forward sling swivel.  The trigger guard has the hole for the rear swivel because this was a standard cast brass piece, but no evidence that the swivel itself was ever installed.
7.  Omission of the cheek cut out on the left side of the butt stock normally seen on the infantry model.
8. Shellacked stock from end to end, to better seal and protect the wood from the ocean environment.
9.  Blackened barrel.  I'm not sure exactly what they used but appears to be a semi glossy black type of paint.  It is scratched but retains about 90-95%.  I have done nothing to restore it.  This is exactly as I found it.

The action works as it should with good strong spring, and trigger pull.  Half cock (safety position) also works as it should, not allowing the hammer to fall when the trigger is pulled.  Nipple is in good condition and I actually have test fired this gun with powder only, not with actual ball ammo.  I fired it a total of three times with a charge of 60 grains of powder and paper wadding each time.  It functioned flawlessly with a good little pop each time, and I did give it a gentle but thorough cleaning after the test shots.  I've been shooting black powder for about 20 years, so I know the importance of cleaning a musket and how to do it properly.

As often seen with many of these old Model 1809s, this one has had some damage to the stock just above the rear of the lock plate.  Fortunately they saved the piece of broken off wood, and glued it back into place.  Because of this damage, I have not tried to remove the barrel, so I cannot tell you the exact date when it was converted to percussion which should be stamped on the underside of the barrel.  If you want to give it a try after you buy it, feel free, but I did not want to risk damaging it to find out.  

There is also a small chip out of the wood just at the front edge of the lock, but this piece is long gone, and is NOT a fresh chip so this happened probably when the musket was in service.  Other than that, there is no other major or even minor damage beyond the normal small handling dings on the stock, some light surface rust pitting on the butt plate, and tarnished brass.

Makers mark on the plate is Neisse.  Yes it looks like Neifse, but that is just the styling of the font.  So this musket, or at least the lock plate, was manufactured at the arsenal in the town of Neisse which at the time was in Germany (or Prussia), but due to the shifting borders of Europe over the past 200 years, is now located in current day Czech Republic.

Well enough history lesson.  I've taken several photos, but I'm limited to posting 3 here so e-mail if you need to see more, or if you have any questions."

This unique trigger system attaches to any existing AR-15 platform. It replaces both the pistol grip and the stock with no permanent alteration to the firearm. The advantage to this set up is that the weapon is no longer classified as a rifle (nor pistol, shotgun, or AOW), which means that it cannot be considered an ""assault weapon"" by any existing assault weapon bans. It is simply an ""Other"" firearm and doesn't carry the restrictions that other traditional firearms may. In CA that means that an AR-15 pattern firearm with the CSW can use a standard magazine release instead of a bullet button as well as any legally possessed high capacity magazines! The CSW is a Spade Grip design that boasts independent triggers on each grip. The original fire control group is retained and the linkage attaches directly to the trigger so the rate of fire is not artificially increased. This design aspect is intentional to prevent being classified as a ""multi-burst trigger activator.""

Pistol Description

Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the GLOCK 21SF delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 Auto round with a 13 round magazine capacity.

The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control—especially for shooters with smaller hands.

The handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection, while the muzzle compensator reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures. The upper has all of the standard features such as a forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover over the ejection port. Additional specs that differentiate this AR from the others-16 inch government profile barrel with M203 notch, 4150 chromoly vanadium steel, A2 bird cage flash hider, 1/7 inch twist ratio, M4 feed ramps, individual magnetic particle inspected bolt and not batch tested, individual high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected barrel, H marked buffer, F marked front sight base, Mil-spec buffer tube, mil-std 1913 picatinny top rail.
