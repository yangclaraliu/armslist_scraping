The bore is spotless and the bolt face does not have any marks on it. If it has been fired, it can not be any more than 1 or 2 rounds. Most likely this was someones home defense gun and was bought but never fired.  And on that note, this would make a perfect home defense gun. I am just wanting to sell it for what I have invested in it, which is $350. Just price new ones and you will see this is a good deal. I am pretty sure this is a model 81212, which the best price I found online was buds gun shop and it was $436 cash price. I am located in cullman not far from I65."

It comes ready to defend your castle. I have customized it by adding quick detach mounts and rails on the front and back of the gun. It is sling and weapon light ready. I am including a 28"" barrel and regular buttstock in case you want to take it out for skeet shooting or hunting. I will also include several chokes. I will also include a hard case. I love this gun but have decided to sell it to fund my .308 AR-10 project. You can pay cash or PayPal. Local pickup only.REQUIREMENTS:- You must be a legal resident of TEXAS- You must be willing to sign a bill of sale MOSSBERG DESCRIPTION:The 930 SPX 8-Shot has a full-length black synthetic stock with a pistol grip. The 18.5"" barrel is perfect for close quarter situations. Mossberg 930 SPX shotguns feature a self-regulating gas system that vents excess gas to aid in recoil reduction and eliminate stress on critical components. Mossberg 930 SPX autoloaders chamber both 2 3/4 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease from target loads, to non-toxic magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo. To complete the package, each Mossberg 930 includes a set of specially designed spacers for quick adjustment of the horizontal and vertical angle of the stock, bringing a custom-feel and fit to every shooter. Safety and safe handling is of paramount importance in special purpose firearms, and the 930 was engineered with that in mind. The receiver-mounted safety is convenient for right or left-handed users; simply push the button forward to take the weapon off safe. A protruding chrome cocking-indicator button is strategically placed in the front inner-edge of the trigger guard, making it easy to see and feel when the weapon is cocked or un-cocked. Unloading has been made easier too, with the Mossberg EZ-Empty system. By depressing the bolt release, the carrier can be pushed up and the first shotshell in the magazine removed. Simply repeat until the magazine is empty. 930 SPX models conveniently come with a factory-mounted Picatinny rail and LPA/M16-Style Ghost Ring combination sight right out of the box.

Disclaimer: I am not an expert on this type of firearm, all information presented below is what I gathered from some basic online and blue book research. Of course some contradictory information was found, I am just going off of what made the most sense. I do not mind questions or information shared upon your own research/knowledge. I will be accepting offers, please make serious offers, these are fairly rare and valuable firearms. I will be posting on gunbroker individually soon, so if interested please make offers sooner rather than later. Top in pics: Browning Auto-5 16 gauge grade 2, serial number 91*** with an ""H"" stamped below it. I believe this dates it to the early 1930's. Barrel reads ""BROWNING ARMS COMPANY OGDEN UTAH,"" ""FULL 16 SPECIAL STEEL"" and ""MADE IN BELGIUM"" with several proof marks. This was produced before the sweet 16 moniker came along. Receiver reads ""FABRIQUE NATIONALE D'ARMES DE GUERRE HERSTAL BELGIQUE"" and ""BROWNINGS PATENT DEPOSE""Condition is good overall considering the age. Metal is in good condition with minor scratches here and there. Bore and chamber look good. Blueing overall is very good, one small spot on barrel where blueing has rubbed off. Wood is decent, with typical handling marks. The biggest flaw of the gun is there is a crack on the bottom side of forearm where it meets the receiver. Appears to be in factory condition to me. Bottom is pics: Browning Auto-5 ""SWEET SIXTEEN"", grade 2. Serial number puts it in the ""X-Series"" dating to 1953. The ""X-series"" are some of the more rare serial numbers of the sweet 16's, also has the vent rib running along barrel, which adds to the value. Takes 2 3/4"" shells. Setup up more for shooting with a recoil pad and adjustable choke installed. The metal and blueing are in excellent shape, no flaws to speak of, even the screw heads look untouched. The wood does have handling marks but nothing I would consider damage. I can send additional pics if desired as armslist will only let me load a couple. I prefer cash but would consider a partial trade (see below). All laws apply of course, prefer to do transfers at East County Guns in Elma, but that can be negotiated depending on deal made."

There is nothing wrong with this rifle I just can't stop using my 1968 Remmy ADL in 6mm even though there are fewer bullet choices.This rifle was bought by a young marine right before he shipped out on a tour in the Middle East. I only purchased it when I knew he needed the money and it was bought new just a couple weeks before. It is basically brand new and he sighted it in meticulously. I verified that when I got it home. I have used the same deer rifle since 1989 and just bought this to have it as a backup or for my son to use. The .243 has quite a few options as far as factory loads go. I believe in accuracy and have killed many deer and other critters with a 6mm Remington and a .243 Winchester. I will ship this rifle if you pay the FFL friend of mine to do it, 20.00."

Typical SIG quality, AND the traditional 1911 slide.  Some ask ""why would I want a 9mm 1911?"" ... that's easy... 9mm is 40% less expensive than 45, so if you really like to shoot as opposed to just ownig the gun, you get to shoot 40% more. PLUS it's a really sweet recoil... something that you can shoot hundreds of rounds at a time and not have it take a toll on you.  800.00. must have FL DL and prefer CWP. If you're prohibitted, don't bother."
