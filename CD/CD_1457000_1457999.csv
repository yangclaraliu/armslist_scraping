91,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1457091,For Sale:  LNIB Sig Sauer 556 SWAT Patrol,"Highland, Shreveport, Louisiana","$ 1,650","Listed On: Sunday, April 14, 2013",Rifles,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Model #R556-16B-PS-RD . This rifle is extremely new, manufactured on 2/24/2013 and purchased by me on 3/8/2013. I took it out to Long Range Alley one time and fired 120 rounds through it. As expected, not a single problem. This was my dream rifle for the longest time and I'm glad I got to own one but I'm selling it because I'm trying to get my family into a new house and would like to put the money towards that. I figure now is a good time to sell since Washington is working on the background check legislation and the time is now to buy any guns people may want without a paper trail.

This rifle is amazing. Sig hit the nail on the head with this one. For those that don't know, it's the ideal hybrid of an AK and an AR.  I just read that the Philadelphia SWAT team just adopted this as their standard rifle. It uses a bolt thats basically identical to an AK47. Uses a two position piston system so when the gas port gets gunked up, you can change the position and keep on rockin, if the both get gunked up you can turn it completely off and have a bolt action rifle. Its quite amazing. It uses AR15 magazines and shoots both 556 and 223. This gun is extremely easy to clean and will make you hate cleaning your AR. 

The only thing I did to this gun is remove the A2 birdcage flash hider and replace it with a Stryker Comp from 556 Tactical here in Shreveport. It's a really cool compensator that's extremely effective and attractive. It comes in the box it shipped in with all the paperwork, blank warranty card, coupon for 20% off on Sig's website, unopened 3 pack of Ergo rail covers, small bottle of lube, and one 30 rd NHMTG magazine (scratched up but came that way, it's aluminum what do you expect). The gun features Sig's own RDSS (rotary diopter sight system) that is very much like HK's. It has 4 aperture's, CQB, 100yrd, 200yrd and 300yrd. The top rail of the receiver also has an internal rear sight that flips down and is concealed within the rail.

Any questions please ask. I'm looking for $1,650 or best offer. Like I said, I'm not hurting for money, just trying to give a boost my dream of moving. I am flexible and I have some 20 round PMAG's that I may be willing to either sell of throw in to make a deal work.

I'll entertain offers for trades but I'm mainly looking for cash. Making an offer couldn't hurt, I might bite. Partial trades would be a Lucid HD7 red dot (preferrably in tan), INFORCE WML light, JP silent captured buffer, PWS enhanced buffer tube, maybe a Kahr pistol in 9mm or 45, quality firearms. Anything really, worse I can do is say no."

149,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1457149,For Sale/Trade:  remington 721,"westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Sunday, April 14, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The history of those rifles is interesting. From 1921 up to WWII, Remington made sporting rifles (the Model 30 and variations) using Model 1917 receivers and parts left over from WWI production. They made only such parts as they had to. At the end of WWII, they decided that the M1917 ploy had about run its course. Even though they used some tricks to disguise the origin of the rifles, customers were aware that they were buying what was essentially a warmed over military rifle.

So they turned their engineers and designers, including the famous Mike Walker, loose with blank sheets of paper. The result was not one, but two rifles, the standard length 721 and the short action 722. The 722 was released with a brand new cartridge, the famous ""triple deuce"", the .222 Remington, from which came a whole slew of cartridges, including the military 5.56mm, aka the .223 Remington.

The 721/722 rifles were made to be affordable, a contrast to the Winchester 70, famed as the ""Rifleman's Rifle"" but quite expensive. The result of the desire to keep the price down was that the rifles were plain. While special treatment, even engraving and inlay, was available, the standard rifles had no checkering, trigger guards were stamped steel, and so on.

But they shot and shot well. A lot of owners wanted to upgrade, and for a while gun shops had bins full of take off stocks, replaced by better grade custom stocks. Eventually, Remington got the word and, using the same basic action, produced the Model 700, now I believe the best selling CF sporting rifle in the world.

There is a sad sidelight to the Remington success story. Winchester (Olin) was unable to admit that it was losing sales to Remington and began to focus on military surplus rifles as the source of their economic woes. So they persuaded Senator Tom Dodd, of CT, father of the current CT senator Chris Dodd, to include a ban on military surplus imports in his Gun Control Act of 1968, not hard to do after JFK was killed with a surplus rifle. In a nasty example of special interest lobbying, Winchester's attorneys even wrote that part of the law. There were hints that Dodd received more than thanks and campaign support, but nothing was ever proven.

The gun buying craziness that started back in Dec is long over!!! Wake up and stop paying stupid prices. I work in a gun shop and for the most part things are back to normal, we have ammo, we have guns, and about the only thing that we don't have are customers who are looking for the modern sporting arms we do have in stock. It's understandable that you or people you know may have bought an AR for above market value b/c you were afraid of the gun control they were trying to pass, but now that  the AWB is dead we don't have to worry about it. It's also understandable that you want to get the money you spent back out of your AR, however you aren't going to sell that ""like new"" AR for 1500 when you can buy it in my shop for 500 less.

This auction is for a brand new FNH SCAR 17s in FDE (everything from the factory - paperwork, lock, FDE mag) w/ four (4) extra mags and two hundred and fifty (250) rounds of quality .308 ammunition. 

As you can see in the pictures this batch of anodizing gave the upper a beautiful shade of Olive Green which has been a bit harder to find than the lighter anodized colors. 

This has only been taken out of the box to verify the serial number and to take these pictures. The serial number has been blurred in the pictures. Unfortunately the 4 extra mags are black but you can easily trade them, paint them yourself, or have them cera/durakoted - the plus side is that all 5 mags are 20 rounders which have been relatively hard to find but keep popping up here and there if you're lucky. The ammunition is split into 3 50 count boxes of Magtech M80 and 5 20 count boxes of Winchester. 

I would prefer FTF w/ FL ID & CWP but will ship at buyer's expense to any FFL where this is 100% legal to own. 

If you have any questions at all please feel free to contact me and I will respond within 10 minutes - questions sent through here go directly to my phone that is on me at all times. 

Price is 4500 or best offer, I am open to trades especially for a new black 17."

It is the Combat Commander length unit, but I have installed in on Government Model frames and it works just fine. Since it is an older unit, it comes with their older aluminum magazine instead of their new plastic one. 

If you look at the photos, there is only the slightest bit of wear at the upper feed lips of the magazine. It was only taken out to the range one time, then cleaned and put away. It is more than accurate enough for plinking and other kinds target practice. Like most conversion units,  it prefers  certain kinds of ammo. It  does work best with hotter loads like the Mini Mags or Winchester M-22's. Lighter loads, like the Remington Thunderbolt's don't have enough umphh to overcome the spring pressure to cylce it properly.

The Interdynamic KG9 pistol was made in Miami Florida for a short time in the 1981-82 timeframe by Interdynamic of America, Inc. ATF decided in January 1982 that the gun was too easy to convert into a machine gun, and therefore decided that an unmodified open bolt semi-auto KG-9 was a machine gun. ATF exempted unmodified semi-auto KG-9 pistols made before this ruling from the scope of the ruling, so there are so-called grandfathered KG-9 pistols available in the USA. The KG-9 was based on a Swedish designed machine pistol, the MP-9. After the ATF ruling the gun was redesigned into a closed bolt, striker fired pistol, the Interdynamic KG-99, which was sold in the 1982-83 timeframe. After that Interdynamic went out of buisness.

334,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1457334,"For Sale:  Mossberg OEM 16"" 5.56mm Nitrocarburized Carbine Barrel","Marietta, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 185,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 24, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Mossberg OEM 16"" 5.56mm nitrocarburized (Melonited) barrel. This barrel is made by Mossberg & Sons for their own line of rifles (until now) and features a Melonited surface on both the inside and out. This finish is harder and more pit resistant than chrome so gas port erosion and chamber and rifling wear will be considerably less than a lined barrel. The exterior is also less prone to surface corrosion and has a darker and more lustrous finish than a typical parkerized assembly. It has all the other common features of this barrel type including a 1:7 twist rate, a carbine length gas hole position, a 0.750"" shoulder for gas block or FSB mounting, a barrel extension with feed ramps, and 1/2x28 threads. Barrel markings are as-pictured, there is no Mossberg name or logo markings so the barrel will look good on and match any brand you choose to use it on. These barrels should be great shooters and retain their accuracy over time. Many of the finest match barrels made offer Meloniting as an available option. Please feel free to ask any questions before you buy."

 The run on assault rifles and AR style rifles has calmed down since Pesident Obama and the Senate finally realized that their push for a ban on assault rifles was going to far and not popular with the majority of the US population. As a result people are realizing that they are not going to get inflated $1500 + prices for their AR's as they have over the last few months. 

 This AR 15 that I am selling is reasonably priced to sell and a great buy with the many extras that are included. I could have gone much further fitting this AR with sights and a scope or a red dot sight but I will leave that up to the buyer who can choose from the many styles of optics that are out there on the market.

Serial A07XX - chambered for .308, this monster of a battle rifle will eat surplus steel ammunition and put a grin on the face of anyone fortunate enough to get trigger time with it.  These early PTR's were built heavily upon surplus HK parts and are generally regarded to be on par with actual (and substantially more expensive) HK's in terms of build and accuracy.  This gun will laugh audibly at all of your friend's panic-buy tactical operator AR builds while shooting with enough recoil to bruise the shoulders of the mall ninjas brave enough to look down the classic HK diopter sights.  Standard appointments - steel trigger pack housing, three pin takedown, leather quick-detach sling, wide foregrip to accept original HK folding bipod, four surplus German olive drab dual-mag pouches, four surplus German flecktarn dual-mag pouches, eight surplus German steel 20 round HK G3 magazines, nine surplus German aluminum 20 round magazines.  Mags range in date from as early as 1960 to as late as the 1980's, and in condition from 'well worn' to 'unissued surplus'.  I've only ever used the one aluminum magazine, and it's functioned flawlessly despite it's 1963 date code.  It pains me to consider the sale of this rifle but work has been slow, money is getting tight, and bills keep coming.  As such, cash is king, no trades will be entertained.  Buyer must be 18+ and willing to sign an affidavit stating that they are not prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm."

- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud

This light weight over/under won’t break your back or the bank! Weighing in at just 6 lbs, it is a full 2 lbs. lighter than similar steel-framed models, making it one of the lightest in its class.  This gun is ideal for long days in the field. The metal is coated with a non-reflective, weather-resistant matte finish and the stock is sport-styled.

The Upland Ultralight operates with clockwork precision and consistency due to CNC-cut aluminum alloy frame, allowing the inner mechancial parts to work flawlessly. On the exterior the most noticable differing characteristic is the lack of a mid-rib between the barrels.

Looks like a custom match gun. Has a Safari Arms / Olympic Arms Matchmaster Frame, not sure about the trigger and hammer, slide is unmarked (no brand or numbers), barrel is an older National Match, rear sight is a Novak with no dots, compensator / barrel bushing. I bought Pearce slim rubber grips for it and a Kimber KimPro Tac Mag 8 round magazine also. The slide and bushing were painted black with auto paint, I took it off and polished them the best i could.

This is my first 1911, but I can't afford to keep it and work on it OR buy ammo right now. VERY accurate and would make a great custom gun for someone with more experience than me. Have more pictures if interested.

I will also accept trades, just let me know what you have.

Myotron Checkmate personal defense ""Stun Gun"". This was given to me, but I have a CCW, so I would never use it. The battery is about 50%, so it should be replaced. Rated at 25,000 pulse watts, which is designed to ""scramble"" somebody's brain; ""FBI preferred"". This would be great for someone who doesn't like guns. MSRP around $200 (5 easy payments of $40 on TV). ---$40

Bianchi Professional 100 IWB Holster Size 12. I used this for my SR9, but do not carry it anymore. Fits full size Glock 17,22, and other full size guns (check the Bianchi website). Still in good shape and thick leather, not flimsy like other old leather holsters. IWB is the best way to conceal IMO. ---$30

CDM Gear MOD-C. This is an awesome mount for the Mossberg 500, I got it a while back, but now I have a Surefire on my mind. This may fit a Remington 870, but I do not remember. Fits any 1"" flashlight. ---$20

Pressure pad for flashlight. Interior thread size of about 23mm. Beyond that, I really don't know/ can't remember. Bring your flashlight to test it. ---$5

Muzzle Break for Ruger 10/22. This slips on over the factory sight, and tightens down with a screw at the bottom. --- $10

Barrel mounted Quad rail. I got this for my 10/22, but never really used it. I put it on, disliked it, and took it off. Good for a bipod or flashlight/ laser. ---$10

UTG quick disconnect Picatinny rail rings. I got these for a scope, but they were too wide. I got a compact scope that these just won't work for. ""Law enforcement"", but UTG. Fits 30mm scopes, with a 60mm objective diameter. Medium Profile. ---$20

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents.

http://www.cmmginc.com/product_p/55ae1bb.htm

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

From what I understand these pistols were only manufactured for three years in the mid to late 60's. Scaled down clone of an actual DWM Luger. Comes with original plastic case with original serial number sticker affixed, 2 magazines, and original owners manual. Must use high velocity cartridges (CCI mini-mags work best). Haven't shot it much and don't have much use for it. Cheap shooter if you are looking for an alternative to a spendy German Luger pistol. Asking $375 or trade for equal value in guns or possibly ammunition (.380 or 9mm). Shoot me an offer if you are interested. I am looking to purchase a couple conceal carry pistols and want to offset the cost by getting rid of a few unused firearms on hand. Must be able to present permit to purchase or permit to carry at time of transaction. Located in NW MN but travel from time to time and can arrange to meet up somewhere.
