Plan to Attend and Make Your Voice Heard!

On Thursday, March 14, at 6:00 pm in Room 15 of the state Capitol, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hear state Senator Ron Latz’s (DFL-46) anti-gun omnibus amendment to Senate File 458.

The Latz anti-gun omnibus amendment, once introduced, will certainly mirror some of the provisions in the other omnibus amendment to be added to House File 237,previously reported by the NRA-ILA.  Specifically, this legislation would criminalize private transfers of firearms with limited exceptions, impose new fees (taxes) for transfers and transferee permits, limit the ability of the carry permit to function as a transferee permit and create a possible thirty-day waiting period to verify an individual’s identity during the application process for a transferee permit.

Under the private transfer ban provisions of these bills, you will be forced to undergo a criminal investigation if you wish to purchase a firearm from certain family members, friends and co-workers.  This system can only be enforced with gun registration.  And, as we know from experiences in California, Australia and Great Britain, gun registration enables gun taxation or even confiscation — but only from honest citizens since criminals don’t register their guns or submit to background checks.  It is perfectly clear that these bills are intended to criminalize and outlaw the private transfer of firearms between family members, hunting buddies, and co-workers.

Please attend the hearing this Thursday, and contact members of the Senate Judiciary Committee TODAY and urge them to OPPOSE SF458.

Additionally, the NRA is working on alternative legislation that seeks real solutions to Minnesota’s crime problems instead of blaming responsible gun owners.  The NRA-supported alternative bill will be introduced in the Senate this Thursday.  This alternative bill and its House companion HF 1325 are REAL solutions to punish criminals, not feel-good measures that would only target honest citizens.   For more information on the NRA’s alternative solution, click here.  Please contact your state Senator TODAY and tell them to OPPOSE the Latz anti-gun omnibus bill - SF458 - and SUPPORT the NRA-supported alternative.

The Ruger LCP-CT features the Crimson Trace LG-431 Laserguard with an instinctive front-activation button, which allows shooters to project the laser wherever the gun is aimed. This ""instinctive action"" provides immediate feedback and gives shooters confidence their shots will hit their target.

The Ruger LCP is a compact .380 Auto from the industry leader in rugged, reliable firearms. From backup firearms for law enforcement to licensed carry for personal protection, the LCP is the perfect choice.

Designed with both male and female shooters in mind, the LCP is as affordable as it is reliable. At just 9.40 ounces (with an empty magazine), the LCP is lightweight and ideal for all-day carry - ensuring you have it when and where you need it.



Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR), is proud to announce the Ruger LCP (Lightweight Compact Pistol) will now be available with a Crimson Trace Laserguard and pocket holster.

""The popularity of the LCP has been overwhelming,"" said Chris Killoy, Ruger Vice President of Sales and Marketing. ""When consumers told us what they were looking for in a small personal protection pistol, we delivered, and the results have exceeded our expectations. Now with the addition of the Crimson Trace Laserguard, the performance of the LCP as a personal protection firearm has been enhanced.""

The Crimson Trace Laserguard helps LCP owners get on target quickly and assuredly through the use of the easy-to-find red laser dot. When gripping the pistol normally, the instinctive front-activation button allows shooters to project the laser wherever the gun is aimed. This provides immediate feedback and gives shooters confidence their shots will hit their target.

The Ruger LCP, a .380 autoloader with a 2.75-inch barrel and an overall length of 5.16 inches, offers legendary Ruger reliability and quality in an ultra-light, compact carry pistol. Winner of the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence 2008 Handgun of the Year Award, the LCP also delivers superior ergonomic design and handsome styling. It incorporates state-of-the-art polymers, aircraft quality aluminum alloys, and high-grade precision steel components engineered for strength and maximum weight savings.

The 9.4-ounce LCP pistol has a capacity of 6+1 rounds. With a height of only 3.6 inches and a width of .82 inches, the LCP is a reliable back-up or carry pistol. The high-performance, glass-filled nylon frame is topped by a through-hardened blued slide.

When size and weight savings count, the LCP is a natural for personal defense carry. The LCP with Crimson Trace Laserguard comes with a pocket holster, one magazine, external locking device and instruction manual.

I understand the economy is rough and y'all are trying to make some extra cash, but y'all are hurting the pockets of everyone out there! Price gouging is ridiculous, y'all are making yourself no better than this worthless government we have. And everyone out here buying this ammo, if you get up early and check your local Walmart or sporting goods store then you can get ammo for half the price that these people are selling it for. If you refuse to buy this WAY overpriced ammo then the prices will come down so the people selling it can get rid of it and make a profit while they can.

Help out your neighbor, quit charging double the price for these cheap bullets. Spend $25 on bullets and make like $10 profit. Enough with this overpriced garbage, this economy is too rough for all of that mess. Some people need this ammo for practice so they can keep their certifications and some  people need this ammo because they live in a rough neighborhood and need to protect their family, property, and their own lives."

Aggressive horizontal ridges provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions.  Molded of reinforced composite, our magazine has a 30 round capacity.  It is made in the U.S.A. and is backed by our lifetime warranty.  Fits the AR15, M4, and M16."

With the country, and our gun rights, going down the toilet, we should stick together as gun owners instead of trying to rip each other off.

5 shot 44mag snubbie, ported barrel, fiber optic front sight, includes chest holster rig for backpacking.  Very few rounds put through it, I would say less than 50.  Fairly lightweight and not much hand shock, it has a good grip that helps with recoil.  Taurus doesn't make this particular model anymore but it still has the Taurus lifetime warranty and is in excellent condition.
Holster is a Westwoods Landing chest holster. Made in Colorado. They are out of business now but this is the best system I've found for backpacking/hunting applications. Comes with suspender setup and the means to attach it straight to your backpack straps. Distributes weight well and keeps the weapon in a convenient spot for easy access when wearing a backpack or fishing."

High efficacy: Consume 43 watts versus 100 watt for HID

Easy to experience
Lowers site maintenance costs by reducing re-lamp frequency
Will not fade colors, avoids inventory spoilage

The Rapid Reticle Action-4 is not your typical red dot system. It was designed and built with the same rigid specification as the SOPS-33mm but with several unique features of its own. The Action-4 can be used with any type of firearm including handguns, whose shooters have won many accolades and competitions. With its 4 different reticles, users can be more versatile with the ability to adjust to different conditions and ranges without a second thought and on the move as proven in the 2009 Bianchi Cup. Rugged and versatile, the Action-4 comes with a set of sunshade extension, protective lens covers, and 33mm aluminum rings. Its stainless steel threaded drop drum turrets are strong and will never move from zero making it the best red-dot option on the market.
