Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

In case you are not familiar with Windham Weaponry. A company with deep roots to Bushmaster, Before Bushmaster was bought out and started cutting corners.
When Richard Dyke started Windham Weaponry last year, he gave his assembled employees one order: Build the best AR rifle in this country. Dyke was the original owner of Bushmaster Firearms and sold the company over five years ago to the Freedom Group, a conglomerate that owns a number of other firearms manufacturing companies. Manufacturing for Bushmaster was moved from Maine to New York, and that left a lot of experienced Bushmaster employees unemployed. Dyke still owned the manufacturing facility, and when his non-compete agreement ended last year he decided to ""get the band back together.”

He is not interested anymore and this has been sitting in the corner of the safe for 2 or 3 years.  I would rather get something else with the money that I will use.
This shotgun has only been shot on one outing (clays).  Cleaned immediately after use and is in near mint condition.  Beautiful laminate stock.
I do have the original box.
This is the youth model (which is identical to the adult version except 1"" shorter stock).  It is actually comfortable for me to shoot as is, but especially when wearing thicker jackets in winter.

The following is from the Remington web site:
""Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. The 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years.""

I am asking $330 (Price is fairly firm, as I don't have to sell).  I may take something firearm related in trade or partial trade.  Please don't offer game systems, electronics, etc...not interested.  I may be interested in reloading equip, but I prefer cash.
Also, I will not drive half way across the state to meet.  If you want it, you will have to come to Mansfield, or POSSIBLY meet in Columbus if I am heading that way.  FTF transaction only.  CCW preferred.  Must show Ohio ID."

I've fired approx 200rds thru this rifle.  

Here are the details from the manufacture:

Gas Piston systems operate cleaner then the direct gas impingement operating systems. With the piston system, the propellant gases that are being diverted at the gas block are now vented at the gas block, instead in the operating system of the upper receiver. Since the fouling from the gas system is not being vented in to the action of your firearm, it stays cooler and cleaner. Our system is designed around the short stroke piston operation. The piston pushes the anti tilt one piece carrier, which unlocks the bolt and allows the piston to return home while the bolt carrier continues to cycle independently. 

The upper is built off of our standard forged A3 receiver with M4 feed ramps. The chrome plated gas piston is mounted in a solid one piece steel gas block attached to the barrel by pins. The dedicated, piston specific, anti-tilt bolt carrier is one piece, machined with the piston impingement key(not a bolt on). The carrier uses our standard bolt or any after market 5.56 bolt. The barrel is our 4140 steel, M4 profile, 5.56mm chamber and bore, 1/9 twist ratio and 1/2x28 threaded barrel and our proprietary WASP surface treatment. The upper is finished with M4 handguard caps, M4 handguards and an A2 flash hider installed with a crush washer. Our piston rifles utilize our standard forged mil-spec lower with mil-spec fire control group and take-down pins and mil-spec 6 position ribbed, reinforced stock. 

The piston gas block has a gas shut off setting for use with a suppressor to allow for maximum noise reduction. You must replace the crush washer with a peel washer if you plan to mount your suppressor on the original flash hider. All rifles have been factory head spaced and test fired. 

2 x 30rd magazines are included. One is a NIW Black PMAG and the other mag is a used Parsons Precision Products.

Please email with any questions.  I have more pictures I can email.

Located around Scott AFB.  Buyer must have a FOID card and will have to sign a Bill of Sale.  Must abide by the 24 hr wait period.

I will only travel in the Belleville/OFallon/Scott AFB area

Trades considered...but please no Hi-Points/Jennings/Shotguns/black powder/hunting rifles

This is a complete CMMG M4 LE conversion kit. The only thing that is keeping this from a complete upper is an upper receiver. Even CMMG doesn't offer a conversion kit this complete. Only selling because I converted to a 5.56.

-Anti-jam Charging Handle with Ambidextrus Tactical Latch
-Stainless Bolt Group
-Forward Assist Bolt Adapter Assembly

-3x CMMG .22LR Bolt Hold Open Actuated 25+ Round Magazines with Magpul Magazine Assists. (These have been modified to use a thumb lever to assist in loading, see pictures. This makes loading A LOT easier and faster. 2 loading levers included, but you could use anything that will fit.)

Great Condition and beautiful wood and blue finishes. This Italian-made handgun is both entertaining, attractive, and useful. It is compact, and dead-accurate in my experience. I love this thing, and am a little sad to see it go--problem is, I have too many and just don't shoot it often enough to justify hanging onto it.

Polymer Tip

The polymer tip increases the ballistic coefficient and also initiates dramatic expansion upon impact – even at velocities as low as 1600 fps.
Higher Ballistic Coefficient

Hornady® combines the sharp, pointed polymer tip with the most aerodynamic profile for a high ballistic coefficient. The V-MAX™ profile also provides the maximum bearing surface for added in-flight stability.
Swaged Lead Core

The swaging process allows for precise formation of the core up and around the tip, with a cavity under the tip's stem. This allows the tip to build up energy before smashing into the core, causing dramatic fragmentation of the core and jacket.
Precise Boattail & Flatbase Designs

Utilizing the proper base design provides incredible in-flight stability for long-range shooting. I have 500 bullets total if interested contact me REDACTED"

All parts are new except for slide and barrel. Includes one 10rd mag and one 15rd factory glock mag.  Glock Tupperware box, paperwork and lock are included.  

The frame has a new serial number due to the replacement by Glock. All this affects is the collect-ability of the gun. The ATF  doesn't care if the slide and barrel are serial numbered or even match, since these are on the guns for sale in other countries that require it. All that is required is the fame serial number in the States, and it has already been reported to ATF by Glock when they swapped the frame out last year.

Upon converting the rifle was then shortened to 14.5 inches and then a stainless RED-X compensator was permanently attached via pin. Due to this device and shortening the barrel has reduced the muzzle movement and felt recoil to almost nothing.

The rifle is supplied with three 20 round mags and one 10 round mag. This is a very nice rifle and gives you a bit more punch than the 7.62x39, .223, or 5.45 ak variants.

Not advertising it as perfect, could use some restoration, and in the long run would preform better than the new Wingmasters (God forbid an express?) without having that ugly gold colored trigger they started adding to all of them.

(I'll take an older fading and scratched Wingmaster over a new Express any day, ask around why, I've left the bluing as it is rather than strip the blue and redo it since factory bluing is irreplaceable in quality and durability, whether you DIY or professional)

 These rifles were originally built on the basis of German WWII designs which culminated in the famous Heckler & Koch G3 rifles (known in the civilian world as HK-91s). The original G3 rifles were all select-fire, meaning optional full-auto mode. Indeed, the current Century Arms CETME has a position on the safety for full-auto mode that has a stamped-steel stop to prevent travel to that position. With a good bipod, and a heavier barrel, they might have been decent select-fire weapons for expedient duty as a light machine gun, but the overall design is all wrong for that role. They are surprisingly light weapons, and were built as an infantry battle rifle. Without the ability to easily change the barrel, they were almost never used as an automatic rifle in combat."

I purchased this pistol new 20 years ago, in 1993. It has NEVER malfunctioned and has been totally reliable with a large variety of full metal jacket and hollow point ammunition. The Interarms version of the Walther PPK is highly desirable compared to the current S&W version (which I've owned as well and had nothing but problems with). These Interarms versions are going for a premium on Gunbroker right now, but I'd prefer a local sale if possible. I have quality holsters and ammo to sweeten the deal as well (and you know how hard it is to find ammo right now). With my entire package, you'll be completely set up and ready to go. The pistol is freshly cleaned, lubed, and ready for use. I have additional, more highly detailed photos of the pistol that I can email to you if needed. Here is everything I'm offering:

- Walther/Interarms PPK .380acp in original box with paperwork and factory test target
- (4) factory magazines with flat base installed
- (4) finger rest conversions for the magazines
- (1) set of extra factory grips
- A-Zoom snap caps for dry fire practice

 The Lancer Systems L5 Magazine is a polymer and steel hybrid that combines the best features of each material. The one-piece steel feed lip unit is permanently fixed to the polymer body. The steel is hardened so the dimensions will not change in long term storage or rough use. The PTFE coating ensures the steel will not rust. The polymer body is designed with an internal dimension that is a constant curve, combined with a no-tilt follower for maximum reliability in feeding 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition. The exterior texture of the polymer body is aggressive for improved grip when changing magazines. The steel feed lip assembly and the polymer body are corrosion and chemical resistant. The translucent smoke body allows you to see how many rounds are remaining in the magazine.

Original owner. 50 rounds fired through each cylinder. Would make a great camping/hiking/fishing companion, but it is also just plain fun to shoot. The longer barrel gives it better velocity than typical NAA mini revolvers. I chronographed 1300 fps out of the magnum cylinder. Snake shot would also hold a tighter close-range pattern with this gun vs. the typical 1 5/8"" barrelled NAA revolvers.
