The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the 

pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

My Take:
 I've had it for about four months, shoots well, I've been to the range 3 or 4 times, put about 200 RDS through it, it's never jammed, never had one single problem with the pistol. Plus, 40 is cheaper than 45, so it's cheaper to shoot at the range.

The lower is a Special Forces commemorative made by US Autoweapons. The lower has the Special Forces logo engraved and is black anodized aluminum.

It also came with a nice certificate from the Special Forces Foundation which I will pass on to you.

Both the upper and lower were bought new from the manufacturers two months ago. They go together very well. This rifle has had about 150 round put through it. It shoots really nice and functions very well. It is very clean and has been well maintained. 

I will include one Magpul PMAG 30 round magazine for free. I will also include a standard carry handle that is not pictured. I will include that as well so you can have rear sights. I also have a nice quad rail handguard and some ammo that I might be sell/trade as well.

The KSG is KEL-TECS first entry into the shotgun market.  The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward.  The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as SHORT and compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells) for a toal of 15!!!!!.  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.  The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

Right boot has slight wear, like someone had tried one on for size but not all day. The left boot is unworn, like brand new or pretty close. Never polished but should take a glossy shine if you know how (or I'll spit shine them to professional standards for an additional $10). No scuffs that I can see. All the hardware is still blackened. Presumably, these were part of a store display or just unsold until I acquired them. These typically sell for $125-$160 totally new and about $75-85 used, in worn but wearable shape. I'd say these are more new than used. Either way, you're getting a real bargain. I normally wear a size 9, so they're too big for me. 

If you think $80 is too much, check ebay and the internet and make me a reasonable offer. Local pick-up recommended to skip the S&H charges."

I'm no sure I want to sell it, but the right offer may change my mind.  It comes with factory box, 3 30 round magazines, 2 20 round magazines, 200 rounds of ammo, a Galco otw leather holster, and 2 leather Galco magazine holsters.  The picture shows it with a Trijicon RMR sight and a lazer max rail-mount sight, but I will be taking those off and putting on the factory adjustable rear sight.  I also have the factory fixed sight setup as well which comes with an extra slide cover as well because the fixed and rear sights require different slide covers.  I'm testing the waters, like I said.  So if the right offer comes in, I would most likely let this go.  Keep in mind though, this comes with 4 boxes of ammo, which sell for about 50 dollars at the moment, not to mention all of the other accessories.  This gun sells new with only 3 20 round magazines for over $2K and is impossible to find."
