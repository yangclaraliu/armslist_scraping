SRU-15/P 
59D3988. 4/each
 
Bag is manufactured by Barclay Home Products in Cohoes, NY. The bag is rated to +10 degrees Fahrenheit. This sleeping bag was a component to the Air Force survival kit that pilots had once they had bailed out of their plane.
 
I got these bags when I was stationed at Grand Forks AFB, ND in the early 1990's.  These were attached to the seat of the parachute assemblies and were carried on our KC-135 R/T Stratotankers for hundreds of missions.  They had to be rotated out periodically according to some regulation that listed ""expiration"" dates for survival items on the aircraft.  I have five, but I had to open one of the two I always carried in my truck for emergencies.  I got stuck overnight in a snowdrift during a bad blizzard and it really saved my bacon!  The photos of the one I opened is shown.  There are several small holes in the bag where the screw was pierced through the container to vacuum seal it to make it as small & compressed as possible.  My bag has three holes on the front and seven on the back.  I covered them up with duct tape to ensure no down was lost.The holes are very small and the down probably wouldn't have escaped anyway, but I am a little obsessive. The bag holds it loft really well after all these years. The bag weighs 4 1/2 lbs.
 
These are great as collectors pieces or would make a great addition to your survival kit or bug out bag."
