This is the most accurate 7.62x39 AK-type rifle I have shot. The bi-pod is aftermarket and  removes quickly as it is a barrel clamp-on style. The barrel is hard chrome lined and the muzzle brake is pinned on at the factory. It has a factory-made Choate styled thumbhole-type stock. This rifle feels extremely solid. It has less than 300 rounds total through it and is pleasingly accurate and 100% reliability. I have owned it since 1999 and have enjoyed every trip to the range and acquired admirers. I hate to sell this rifle but it is too nice to let it grow old in the safe!! Give it a good home."

Night Vision Goggles, AN/PVS-7C, is a self-contained night vision system worn on the head or hand-held, providing  improved night vision capabilities using available light from the night sky (starlight, moonlight). They may be used with or without the standard battle helmet and chemical-biological mask, and provide capabilities for reading, forming manual tasks, patrolling, walking and surveillance. The AN/PVS-7C is submersible. 

The goggles can be used in cloudy starlight to bright moonlight. They can be removed quiclky from the facemask with automatic shut-off. They can be detached from the facemask and used as a hand-held viewer. The goggles are held in their normal lowered position by a spring-loaded detent. In extreme darkness, the goggles have an infared feature that allows viewing at close range. 

Night Vision Goggles, AN/PVS-7C, have an eye span adjustment that permits the eyepiece lenses to be moved in line with an operator's eyes. The adjustment is made by moving the eyepiece lenses apart or closer together until a single, clear, circular field of view is obtained. The eye relief adjustment permits the goggles to be moved in or out on the facemask carriage to a position approximately 2.5 cm (one inch) from the operator's eyes without losing a field of view. Thei permits the operator to wear a protective mask or most eyeglasses while wearing the goggles. 

They have a quick release feature and automatic shut-off. the goggles may be used on or off the facemask. To use the goggles on the facemask, mount the goggles on the carriage, insert the slide into the carriage and press firmly until a click is heard. To release the goggles from the carriage, press the button on the top front of the carriage and pull the goggles away from the face. If the goggles are removed from the facemask while turned on, the automatic shut-off feature will turn off the goggles. The goggles will operate if the rotary switch was not turned on to another position while they were on the facemask. 

Operates on 2 “AA” or 1 ea. BA5557/U Battery (Up to 40 hours continuous run time on 2 AA batteries) 
Automatic Brightness Control (ABC) 
Built-In IR Illuminator (acts as a flashlight that can only be seen through the NVGs)

The is an Volunteer Open Bolt 45acp in all its glory, all original, open bolt. Shit on those 1500.00 Mac 10's, 9's bullet hose pistols. This is serial numbered 0392. This makes it the right near the starting gate of the round open bolt Volunteer series. Through some studies of serial #'s I figure only a few thousand were made. Too, there were a lot of these guns that over the years have been lost,destroyed,broken, etc. After all, back in the 60's you could have one for less than 200.00 JUDGE FOR YOURSELF, AN EXTREMELY PRETTY GUN. ALSO LIKE THE EAGLE MK I&2, THESE CAN TAKE A FULL AUTO GREASE GUN BOLT WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT EXTRACTORS BREAKING Thank god the government never went after the above mentioned class's of guns. They did grab the Spitfire which was also produced as a semi open bolt gun and reclassified it as a SMG. This was due to the ease of conversion for one. This gun and the Spitfire SMG are identical guns both inside and out. Anyway getting back to the gun, it has been shot but by its looks is in remarkable shape. Few handling scratches here and there but a well built shooter for the rest of it's life. Takes .45 M3A1 grease gun mags which are everywhere. Besides the M-16, the Grease gun mag was probably one of the most manufactured US military mags. Is this the gun for You? No? Well take the stock off and shoot it. YES!! YOU CAN LEGALLY TAKE THE STOCK OFF AND STILL HAVE A RIFLE WITH AN OAL OF 27 1/4"" THIS GUN IS HISTORIC NOW AND WILL ONLY GAIN IN VALUE, SHOT OR NOT. Has not been made since the 60's which puts it at 50 years old or so. AND remember, Open Bolt Guns can no longer be produced and have not been for decades Thanks for looking.

This was made to pass the last import and assault weapons ban. This rifle can only accept the 10 round magazines made for this rifle and includes all 3 magazines sold with the rifle. This is the most accurate 7.62x39 AK-type rifle I have shot. The bi-pod is aftermarket and is fast to remove as it is a barrel clamp-on style. The barrel is hard chrome lined and the muzzle brake is pinned on at the factory. It has a factory-made Choate branded thumbhole-type stock. This rifle feels extremely solid. It has less than 300 rounds total through it and is very accurate and 100% reliability. I have owned it since 1999 and have enjoyed every trip to the range. I hate to sell this rifle but it is too nice to let it grow old in the safe!! Give it a good home. Can make a GREAT deal of ammo with sale!!

If you're paying .15, .20, .25 cents per round you are a fool.
If you're charging .15, .20, .25 cents per round you are a LIBERAL piece of trash. Only an a-hole would buy up all of the ammo from local stores and then turn around and rape people just looking for some rounds to shoot for the weekend with their kids.

If you need .22lr ammo, please do not buy from people selling it at a 3x and 4x markup, you are only contributing to the problem. There is no ammo shortage. You don't have to pay outrageous prices. Call your local Walmart or Gun shop and ask when they get their ammo shipments, then show up early that morning and you'll see all the a-holes lined up to buy and sell the ammo on Armslist for stupid prices.

The EOTech 557 Law Enforcement and Military Night Vision Holographic Red Dot Sight is ideal for use with magnifiers or night vision devices.

The base of the sight is designed to clear the delta ring and handguard on M4 style weapons which reduces the amount of rail space needed for mounting. Making this sight even more appealing is the fact that it runs on easy to find AA batteries."

361,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1353361,For Sale:  223 REMINGTON/5.56 FACTORY CRIMP DIE BRAND NEW 90817,"Henrietta, Rochester, New York",$ 30,"Listed On: Thursday, March 28, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Lee Factory Crimp Die 223 Remington. Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

The bullet engineered with the competitive shooter in mind. Hornady began with a bullet legendary in its accuracy - the Hornady XTP - and redesigned it as the perfect competition projectile. While the XTP uses folds and a cannelure to aid in expansion and increase terminal performance, expansion is meaningless in competition. So, the folds and cannelure are gone from the HAP (Hornady Action Pistol) bullet. 

Because jamming can cost a competitive shooter the match, Hornady placed the HAP's pure lead core inside a copper jacket that protects the nose, ensuring smooth feeding. And like the XTP, the core of the HAP bullet is cold swaged from pure lead to give it amazing consistence, balance and stability in flight. This is not loaded ammunition."

Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and helps to stabilize the bullet in flight. It also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles. The 53 grain bullet features the same ogive as the 75 Grain Hornady V-Max bullet. A 1 in 12"" twist rate or faster is recommended for optimal performance. This is not loaded ammunition."

The Regent R200S comes equipped with the same quality as the R100, but with a stainless finish, serrated slide, ventilated trigger, and hammer, a beavertail safety, combat 3-dot sight system and an extended thumb safety. It is an affordable semi-automatic 1911 pistol built with a level of quality that you can customize. This reasonably priced, high-quality .45 ACP caliber M1911 is one of only a few guns of its style and quality that retails for around $600.

Along with the R100, the R200S is a rendition of the M1911A1 that is visually faithful to the original design. It has a spur hammer, M1911A1-style grip safety, and arched mainspring housing. Offered in .45 ACP only, the R200S has a stainless finish and comes standard with Hogue® rubber grips. The slide is manufactured from CNC machined bar stock with a low-cut ejection port, the frame is steel investment cast, and the barrel is hammer forged stainless steel—all manufactured to ISO 9001 and NATO AQAP 120 quality standards.

The Regent R200S accepts virtually all aftermarket parts made for M1911-style pistols, giving you the ability to customize your pistol. Also, almost all aftermarket accessories designed for M1911-styles can be added, whether it be specialized custom grips, added sights, tactical enhancements, or other customizations.

Don't let these people fool you by saying there is an ammo shortage. There is only a shortage because everyone one is buying it up and reselling it for an outrageous price. This price gouging won't stop until people stop paying these crazy resell prices. Use ammoseek.com or gunbot.net to find good priced ammo. Code3tactical.com is also a good one to use. Ammo is not going to go away and neither are guns so the panic buying and reselling will eventually die down. Ammo is starting to show up more frequently at stores its just people are bringing their friends and family to buy it all off the shelves and resell it at crazy prices please don't buy it if its not a reasonable price. I know this will get flagged just because sellers of high priced ammo don't want people to know they don't have to pay a high price.

If the ad is still up, I still have it.
First of all, I love this gun. Been my bedside gun since I got it. But I got another 686 in a trade that had more gunsmithing work than now had, and I am now divorcing my older model for a new girl.

The ""-1"" means its a first generation 686, without the lock, but with the problems that came with being the first model.
But don't fret, the ""M"" means it was sent back to the factory, and fixed. Collectors pieces from just that.
I bought it used from a retired Army guy who bought it new, fired a few dozen rounds to get a feel, and kept it at his bedside until he traded it to me half a year ago.
I've fired 75 rounds from it. A 30+ year old gun with close to 100 rounds fired.

It's also had some smithing done to make the already great S&W trigger even better.

I'm selling this with a shoulder holster, speed loader, 4 speed loading strips, and 94 rounds of .38 Special. So you can get a feel for it, and protect yourself after. (Ammo is different from pictured ammo)"

I have a brand new set of Energizer E90BP-2N batteries for it that I just take out when im not using it. Other than that it works PERFECT. No problems with it what so ever.

This is a rather rare version of Sig's modular P250 in 9mm that includes a threaded barrel for use of a suppressor or other muzzle device. It also comes in All Terrain Digital Camo. Also included are the 3 factory magazines (this is the only Sig P250 that ships with more than one magazine). I'm also including a Sig Sauer STL-900L rail-mount laser/tac-light. 

Here's the description from Sig:

The P250® Tactical takes the P250 Compact in 9mm and adds All Terrain Digital Camo, threaded barrel and three magazines. The pistol ships with a Holster and Double Mag Pouch in Flat Dark Earth in a matching pistol case. The P250, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250’s innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism (the frame) and place it into the polymer grip of choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact and full), and after any change, the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also theres a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

This is an awesome AR 15 that shoots an awesome, yet affordable round. The heart of this build is the barrel from Ballistics Advantage, who specialize in 5.45. This barrel is ballistics nitride coated which is perfect for holding up to corrosive military surplus ammo. 5.45 is arguably more effect, and more accurate than .223 and 5.56, yet it can be found for about 19 cents per round during the madness that we call the current gun market. 

I will include 1 - M2 Windowed Pmag, which works with 5.45 up to 15 rounds. ASC and Cproducts mags can be found for 15-35 each and will work flawlessly with 30 rounds.  I will also include 90 rounds of 5.45x39 surplus ammo. I have more of this ammo and I would be willing to give a deal for more 5.45x39 ammo for the buyer of this AR15.

I also would be willing to swap out the Todd Jarrett Free Float, for a cheaper Yankee Hill Lightweight Specter Length Free Float if the buyer wanted to take $100 off and I could also remove the magpul irons for $100 off.

I have several albums of pictures that I can provide upon request!

You can load these m2 windowed pmags up to 15 rounds of 5.45x39, which also makes this round awesome, because you can use these mags for 5.45x39, and your 223/556. I feel that this is a more than fair price and I pride myself in not price gouging during the madness ;)

Now I am transferring the scope to my LR-308 Build.

This rifle has only had the 34 rounds shot through it, 20 of which were a proper break in. I shot and then cleaned after every round with MPro7. I have yet to gather proper DOPE on this rifle, but after my 20 rounds that I shot breaking the barrel in, Which I also used to Zero and confirm from 100 to 300 meters, I took the rifle out a second time and shot 14 rounds to confirm out to 1,000m. 

My groups went from touching to less than half an inch at 300m and hits on steel out to 1,000m at 200m intervals.

If you buy a rifle for $170 I'll throw in 140 rounds of milsurp ammo for $35 while it lasts. The rifles have bayonets (numbers match), tools, and oil canteen. The price is FIRM and cash only.

I am doing this for fun, as a hobby. I am not a gun store just a lover of Mosins. All emails that do not include the phrase I LOVE MOSINS in them will be deleted (anti spam protection).

*** Again (just so you understand), all emails that do not include the phrase I LOVE MOSINS (or something identifying you as a real person) will be deleted. I DO NOT answer emails that only say ""Do you still have the rifle?"" because I only end up with and inbox with 100 ads for generic Viagra. My personal assistant (pictured below holding a Mosin) can vouch that I do not need any. ***

Thanks..."
