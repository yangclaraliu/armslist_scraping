This is the Carry SAS Gen 2 nitron, with 7 mags and all the original goodies. I am interested in getting a G21, only the Gen 4.  You probably paid $579 for your G21, so I'll give it a trade value of $600. My Sig220 for $1049 new, and the extra mags were about $300.  Obviously I don't expect to get that much out of it, but I'd like to get a little more on top of the G21.  Maybe cash, maybe ammo? If you want to add another gen 4 Glock to the pot, such as a 19, 17, 26, 22, 23, or a 29, I will make up the difference with cash or ammo.

This here is one for all you H&K fans. Has been fired only once with 200 rounds of factory ball ammo. It comes in the H&K factory soft case with three mags (two are 10 round and one is 12 round),cleaning kit,manual,fired case and extra ""O"" rings for the barrel. Here are the specs straight from H&K: The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole! The Mark 23 is available in .45 ACP Features: • Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile •Match grade trigger •One piece machined steel slide •Frame mounted decocking lever and separate ambidextrous safety lever •Can be carried “cocked and locked” in single action mode with the safety lever on •Patented HK recoil reduction system •Corrosion resistant blued finish •Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame •Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves •Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories •Ambidextrous magazine release lever •Extended slide release •Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator •Patented Lock-Out Safety device WOW!! That's quite a handgun! It has become a favorite in movies and video games as well..Shipping is $50.00 inside the continental U.S. to your FFL.

I live in the far west suburbs of Chicago in a town called Geneva, but am willing to meet up with buyers. Will not ship ammo and buyer will need a FOID card to buy ammo. Cash at time of transaction or PayPal before with 3% added to cover fees.

This is a great way to get lots of ammo all at once and not have to worry about sales tax, shipping, availiblity or limits on the amount you buy!"

 The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
 FACTS:
 You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
 We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
 The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
 The permit is valid for 5 years
 We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
 Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
 Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

I am the original  owner and I have shot exactly 12 rds thru this rifle while test firing it when I first purchased it. I am approaching retirement and relocating; this rifle is in a gunsock properly stored in my climatically controlled safe and it has never been used beyond the test shots in my backyard when I got it home from the gunshop; I really have no use for it, maybe you do. This Ruger is a high quality rifle that looks, feels, and shoots the way a good rifle supposed to. The Bushnell scope is a current production model Trophy XLT and is made in South Korea, the optics are brilliant and the controls are smooth and positive in operation. I will meet FTF in a public place for a cash transaction. I will only sell this rifle to Maryland residents who are not prohibited from owning firearms.

I will try to find other walmart grade ar's and sell them here again for the same price.

Thats crazy and these are the same people who complain about Obama and the ""liberals"".  Dont buy these kinds of weapons for sale, they are WORSE than any anti gun politician out there!  Also, keep searching the walmarts as the DO get them in stock more often than you think!

I have a brand new DPMS AR-15 that I found luckily at a walmart for about 600 + tax.  It was going to be a gift, but they already found one at a greensboro walmart.  A gift card was used, so I'd rather have cash than get another gift card I wont use. Asking $650 because I dont need to rape you like some of the posters here.  IF the ad is up, its still for sale.

The Bushmaster facility in Windham was closed and the employees were laid off. Soon afterward the original owner stepped back into the picture. He still owned the facility as he had been leasing it to Freedom Group since selling Bushmaster in 2006. He also had a 5 year non-compete agreement that was expiring soon. He must have felt as I do, that no one can make these rifles better than the folks in Windham, Maine so he decided to put another company together and put the workers back in business making these fine rifles. The new company was named Windham Weaponry and commenced manufacturing operations over the summer of 2011.

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016
