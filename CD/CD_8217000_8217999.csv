The blowback operated design results in a platform as reliable as an AK47, but in a smaller package with minimal recoil. Its lightweight and 11.14” barrel make the Draco NAK9 an excellent choice for your next truck gun, CQC or a fun day at the range.

 In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off. When Taurus made the first PT-92, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans. They even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. Beretta’s and Taurus’ designs have evolved in divergent ways since 1980, and the two pistols now share very few parts in common. But they still share the same lineage and (almost) the same manual of arms. Other innovations include a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked and locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

I’m selling my brand new (made this January) AK47. It was a special order made by I.O. Inter-ordnance, Palm Bay Fl USA. 100%made in USA !! Not a parts kit ,all USA made parts. It’s patterned after the original Polish schematics AK. It has a lifetime repair warranty to gun as per customer service. The quality control on these AK47’s have come a long way from few years back when they first came out, and using parts kits with USA receivers etc. . The fit and finish is great,a flawless gun. I fired a newer one before buying mine . I’m the original owner never fired it. It came new with 1 30 round IO polymer mag ( which is patterned after the Bulgarian waffle style)I special ordered a package that includes as follows: IO padded black lockable hard case,nice new cleaning kit in new olive green canvas pouch,3 30 round IO polymer mags,and a period correct surplus brown leather sling.(mags also lifetime warranty, and are about $20 each ). I’m also adding 6 more 30 round IO mags ( total of ten mags), 3 boxes of ammo(enough to fill 2 mags and get u started) last but not least a period correct nice bayonet with sheath. Nice for its age. Yes AK has bayonet lug. I’m asking $800 obo . This is a great deal. Frankly , honestly I found an older more collectible AK and just can’t do both. This is a great daily shooter or a SHTF gun. Just the extras are valued at over $200. Buyer must be 21,legal to buy a gun ,Florida DL and CWP, willing to sign a bill of sale, protects both of us. I’m in Psl and willing to travel a little for right deal. Make me an offer the worst that can happen is I say no. Do the research all the newer reviews give IO thumbs up(they hired NASA engineers) Discount to anyone that can prove they served our country in the armed forces !! You can text me direct at 772-201-2547. Thanks again for looking. God bless America!"

Taurus PT92AF (Beretta 92FS) DA/SA 9mm w/Rail & Decocker
 
 In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off. When Taurus made the first PT-92, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans. They even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. Beretta’s and Taurus’ designs have evolved in divergent ways since 1980, and the two pistols now share very few parts in common. But they still share the same lineage and (almost) the same manual of arms. Other innovations include a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked and locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

 In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off. When Taurus made the first PT-92, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory with its machinery, parts and plans. They even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. Beretta’s and Taurus’ designs have evolved in divergent ways since 1980, and the two pistols now share very few parts in common. But they still share the same lineage and (almost) the same manual of arms. Other innovations include a three position frame mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked and locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

The result is the most operator-safety focused striker duty pistol on the market today. Taking into account the concerns of military and police training officers, the P320 provides an enhanced level of safety not found on most modern service pistols. Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance. Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by Sig Sauer, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well. With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. Featuring the Sig internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. SigLite night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.VERY NICE P320 FOR SALE: Two mags, carry case. This SIG can be converted to multiple calibers off this one platform. This is for the 9MM Compact Medium P320. Any questions please ask. Retails for $579 asking $475"

This is a list of what everything cost so you get n idea of the value.1) The Rifle itself: $1100 (suggested retail is almost 1400, the site won't allow me to include the link to the manufacturers site but if you go to Smith and Wessons website and search the model 811008, it will come up)2) Federal Ammo: $5003) Blackhawk Trigger Guard: $104) Hogue Grip: $205) Tango Down Vertical Grip: $806) Magpul Tactical Stock: $407) Magpul Pmags: $100If you do the math, you'll see it's over 1800 for everything without even adding the tax.

Kel-Tec's small, lightweight P-11 has perceived recoil and practical accuracy comparable to much larger guns. Its barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel, heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free-floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. It has an ultra high impact polymer grip, made of DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. It is supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine. The P-11 is available in a black parkerized or blued finish with a 9mm 10-round magazine.

It was made in 1982 and is chambered in .223 (but to my knowledge will shoot 5.56 as well, being H&K). I have only shot 25 rounds of .223 through it since aquiring it, and man is it a sweet shooter. It includes the folding bipod, two 25-round magazines, and a sling. The gun is in good condition but has a tiny bit of rust on the exterior of the charging handle and the middle left sling mount. There are some scratches on the top of the receiver where a scope mount wasn't mounted tight enough.   This gun is an amazing piece and is certainly a weapon you can trust your life with. Would also be a great addition to a collection, since the original HK 93 is a difficult to find gun.   I'm asking $2,700 for this highly-sought rifle. Have to sell it due to a financial need that came up. I may be interested in a partial trade for cowboy action guns in .357 or cowboy action shotguns.   If you're interested in this fine weapon then send me a text at   417   eight-4-ate   21seven6   (anti-spam numbers) or give me a call after 5pm."

Will ship to your FFL after clearance of payment and receipt of signed FFL copy.  Please email me with questions.Here is the way it will work if you want it shipped (No negotiation on this). -You send me funds for the agreed upon price plus shipping/insurance, nothing more, nothing less-Funds MUST clear prior to shipping, period, this may take 10-14 business days.  Funds in excess of the agreed upon amount will not be cashed and will be returned to sender or destroyed.-Your FFL sends me a signed copy of their license, I verify it with ATF AND I contact them to verify you have gotten approval for the shipment-I send the item to your FFL and you are responsible for it from thereNo sales to California or other severely restricted states without prior approval.
