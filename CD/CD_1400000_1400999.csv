It's a pre-lock, meaning it doesn't have that ugly key hole lock seen on newer models. It's .38 Special, also rated for .38+P. Manufacture date was 1996. This was the year S&W started making these in the magnum frames. They're called  ""mini 686's"" as they look very similar, only smaller. It's all stainless steel, J-frame, 5-shot revolver with a 2 1/8"" barrel. Kept clean and very well maintained. Really dependable firearm for conceal carry. If you're looking for something that won't weigh you down and handles recoil better than the polymer or aluminum airweights, this would make a great piece. Comes with black Hogue Monogrips. I put a little orange paint on the front sight to help with aim. You can take it off with nail polish remover if it bothers you. I'm also including a small leather holster with it.

The trigger pull on this one is just amazing. Really smooth. You'll have to dry fire it to see for yourself.

I'm asking $445, which I think is fair. You can make me an offer but I couldn't find one at this price even two years ago. I've owned for several years and bought it at a gun show in case anyone wants to know.

Please be local or close to my area. I won't be driving more than 30 miles to sell. Also Important!!: You must have a North Carolina CCW license or a pistol purchase permit. No exceptions. We'll both sign a bill of sale of which I will provide. I'm trying to be as detailed as possible here, so if there are any questions, contact me. 
If ad is up it means it's still for sale. God bless!"

I already own a Glock 17 & am looking for something different & SMALLER, but not tiny (Compact or larger sized Sub-Compact).
  I'M ONLY interested in firearms that have a capacity between 13-20rds (maybe 12rds), I'm trying to get it now before the Oct. hassle starts!
To give an idea, I'd be interested in a Ruger SR9c, XD 9mm Compact, S&W M&P Compact, CZ-75 compact, Baretta PX4 StormCompact/sub-compact, (would consider Sig, Taurus, Kahr, etc. or any decent company or model I haven't thought of as well) (Not-Interested in a Ruger LC9! LC9 to small capacity, especially with new stuff unfortunately passed:-(
  The Ruger SR9c (esp. in Stainless) seems to keep calling my name, so if you have 1 in very good/great condition & are looking for a quick sale at a Reasonable price, definately contact me, (I'd very strongly consider it in Black as well).
While not a ""Compact"" the Ruger P95 looks interesting & I'd consider as from what I read it's closer to the G19 & noticeably smaller than the G17.
Must be in New, Almost New, Excellent condition.
Must have a minimum of 2 standard, Brand name mags, (I.e. if was buying my Glock 17 would have to have 2 17rd mags, the more mags the better even in 10rd.), ok if Pistol comes with 1 larger capacity (under 20rds, thanks Maryland) for HD & 1 smaller 1 for carry i.e. Ruger SR9c) 
I think you get the idea what I'm looking for, it doesn't have to be a gun I listed but if it does Not fit these parameters (mainly size & 9mm, though if the right .40 came along in right size & price, I'd look into), please Don't respond.
I'm a serious buyer and can have cash, money order, certified check, credit card ready on a moments notice.
Obviously, I will pay fee to do transfer, preferably at MD State Police if Seller is MD resident, if you insist on FFL, & MSP is fairly close by, we'll work it out. Of course out-of-state will go through FFL.
Basically, if I want it, money (or anything else) won't be an issue.
Looking forward to hearing offers (offers without a price will not be considered).
I hope don't seem like a harda**, but if your looking for a quick sale, I'll work with you to make it happen. Thanx for reading & your time!

I'm trying to keep it short but need to mention a few things to hopefully avoid more annoying emails.
A. 9mm=9mm Luger/Parabellum/9x19 ONLY. B. Please only offer gun brands that a casual gun user knows. No crazy Russian (or anywhere else) names that even I never/barely heard of, basically, imagine a time when there was no gun shortage, if your average gun store didn't carry it, I'm not interested. C. I'm looking to Buy another gun in ADDITION to my Glock 17, while everything is for Sale/Trade, what I would want in return is so outrageous that it definitely wouldn't be worth your while, & if you still want to make an offer to buy mine, please don't offer less then $1,200 at which point I May consider it, offers under that won't be replied to (Basically, I have no interest in getting rid of my Glock)."

Weapon includes a Hogue grip,  2 original 10 round mags, 4 new Mec-Gar 15 round mags and 2 new Promag 32 round magazines. I will NOT  separate the gun and magazines. Gun is in great condition but does have some light holster wear and light wear from overall use. There is a small blemish on the back of the frame and hammer from when the weapon fell off a table while being cleaned. I appologize for not having pictures up, but I have photos on my phone and I would gladly send them to you.

Description:	This unique example of a Detective Special Colt revolver was subsequently remarked as a Crewman revolver. Although this example is outside the standard USAF serial number range, the Colt factory letter verifies that it was sold in 1951 to then Colt VP ""J.M.McNally"" and was charged to ""Arms Engineering Expense"" at the Colt Factory in a shipment of 2 guns. Guns charged to this department were usually intended to be presents or prototype/sales examples for pending contracts. The back strap has been spuriously remarked ""PROPERTY OF U.S. AIR FORCE"". A U.S.A.F. style property/serial number (AF NO. 21) on the butt with ""21"" stamped on the edge of the left grip. Grips feature silver Air Force medallions. Matching numbers on crane and frame, small spurious ""Ordnance Bomb"" and ""P"" proof located on cylinder. Accompanied by an even more rare/unique combination belt/shoulder holster specifically designed for the aircrewman's revolver. The holster is an extremely well made and has attributes of both the standard 38 hip and shoulder holster with those combined into one holster. Very interesting and unique holster that is not shown in any of the holster books.
Condition:	Fine as assembled and remarked with 99% black anodized finish on the frame and blue finish on the steel parts. The grips are excellent with nice checkering on both sides showing minor handling marks from carrying. The holster is as new showing the original unoiled leather with tight stitching."

I bought two of these to have a backup.  One I will keep as I have already broken it in and it is flawless. I love it.  This one I will sell because I want cash right now for other things. To get money for this BCG, I have two options:  Return to Midwayusa where I will get a full refund, OR offer it here on Armslist and maybe someone local who has been waiting forever and ever for a BCG like this to come back in stock will have the opportunity to buy it.  If there are no takers, I will fill out the returns form and mail back to MidwayUSA.  

So please don't harass me if you don't like the price of this BCG.  It's very simple. If you want a 300 dollar BCG, then you pay for it.  If you don't, then don't. THANK YOU PATRIOTS AND BELIEVERS IN CAPITALISM. COMMUNISTS, TRAITORS, AND DIMWITS NEED NOT REPLY TO THIS POSTING! THANK YOU!

Imported from Czechoslovakia and manufactured D-Technic. 
- Built on milled receiver
- 7.62x39 caliber and take all standard ammo corrosive and non-corrosive)
- Czech made cold hammer forged chrome lined barrels. 


Advantages of Sa vz. 58 over AK47 rifles (cited from Richard Rich Chris)
- All vz. 58 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK47s utilize stamped sheet metal receivers and are not as rigid as the vz.58 receiver.
- Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK47.
- The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired – the shooter immediately knows the firearm is empty and allows for quicker reloads.
- The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
- The vz. 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
- The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58. Unlike the AK safety, the vz. 58 safety can be operated by just a forefinger with the hand remaining on the pistol grip.
- vz.58 has no need for an ejection port dust cover as the receiver is completely enclosed. A cover (on the safety lever) must be used on the AK47 to prevent debris from entering the receiver through the reciprocating charging handle slot.
- The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 58.
- The vz. 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
- The alloy magazine of the vz. 58 is half the weight of the steel AK47 magazine.
- The vz. 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.

They had gotten a shipment of ammo in, and there was a line waiting to buy whatever came out. As I was also waiting, I overheard quite a few people in the front of the line calling the salesman ""Uncle Steve"", or just Steve. Seemed strange, but I paid it no mind. After listening a bit more, I realized the first 10 people in line were Steve's family members. They each bought 6 boxes of .22lr(limit is 3), including 1000 round packs for $48. The 9mm was gone before I got to the front of the line. ""Steve"" was paying for it out of his pocket, I overheard one woman saying how much money they were going to make online. ""Thanks Uncle Steve!"" was heard several times. My wife and I managed to get 6 boxes, the last 6 boxes. 

This guy ""Steve"" is working at Walmart, and putting the ammo on the shelve. Before he does, he gets all his friends and family there, and the ammo is gone as soon as it gets there. I wouldn't be surprised if he's selling it on here, and reading this right now. 

So if anybody is wondering why they can never find ammo at Lake Geneva Walmart, now you know. Greed has gotten to the employees. Not sure if there's anything ""illegal"" or against the rules, but it sure pisses me off. I called and left a complaint. Anybody who buys ammo there, I suggest you do the same."

FROM VIKING TACTICS SITE BELOW:
 Unlike any sight on the market, the Revolutionary design of the Viking Sight will enhance your ability to close with and destroy the threat, day or night. The Viking Sight from Viking Tactics, Inc. features a tapered front sight that will draw you immediately to the correct aiming point. This sight is not only tapered for speed, but to help with accuracy at distance when needed. The tapered sight leads to an indestructible fiber optic that will help to drive your focus where it is needed. These sights are extremely fast. The rear sight notch has also been cut lower than normal to not only enhance speed, but to allow the shooter to see the tritium vials that have been inserted below the fiber optic. The Viking Sight will allow you to have the fine aiming point that you want and need, coupled with fiber optic to help draw your attention. If the sun goes down you are now able to use the tritium that is slightly below the fiber optic.

This is all factory. The trigger has had some work done. It is crisp and clean with almost no travel. The stock is grey laminate and in near mint shape. I can't find a mark on it. The metal is in the same condition. It has weaver style bases. The scope, rings, and bipod do not come with it and are not included in the price. There is a 7 round and a ten round magazine included. I am looking to trade this on a 17 hornet either ruger or cz. I have cash to put with it or maybe another gun. It also comes with two boxes of ammo. Both areCCI one is fast and furious and one is varmint. I also have a lot more fastn furious ammo that I could throw in on a trade. I would also be willing to throw in the scope and bipod on a trade.

FROM VIKING TACTICS SITE BELOW:
 Unlike any sight on the market, the Revolutionary design of the Viking Sight will enhance your ability to close with and destroy the threat, day or night. The Viking Sight from Viking Tactics, Inc. features a tapered front sight that will draw you immediately to the correct aiming point. This sight is not only tapered for speed, but to help with accuracy at distance when needed. The tapered sight leads to an indestructible fiber optic that will help to drive your focus where it is needed. These sights are extremely fast. The rear sight notch has also been cut lower than normal to not only enhance speed, but to allow the shooter to see the tritium vials that have been inserted below the fiber optic. The Viking Sight will allow you to have the fine aiming point that you want and need, coupled with fiber optic to help draw your attention. If the sun goes down you are now able to use the tritium that is slightly below the fiber optic.
 Tapered Front Sight; Serrated Front and Rear Sights; Fiber Optic Speed Sight; Tritium Night Sights."

The gun is used but I have not put anymore than 250 rounds down range. I clean/maintain all my firearms, so this gun is in almost new condition. The only sign of wear is at the disassembly pin. Reason being, is that it must be turned in order to field strip. This gun is striker-fired and hold 7 rounds, 6 + 1. It comes with 2 six round magazines, and i will include a 50 round box of winchester hollow point defensive rounds.

Heres when the price gougers try to take advantage of the scared and misinformed or DUMB panic buyers. Heres a free lesson for u all. This law goes into affect OCT 1ST. which means u can still buy AR15's on gun broker for $1000 or stripped lowers from $70 for polymers or a forged aluminum lower for $150. And high cap mags...the existing law and new law DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE POSSESION OF A 30 ROUND MAG OR HIGHER. it just means u cant buy, sell, or transfer one to another MD Resident. So in other words u can go to PA OR VA to buy your high cap mags and its perfectly legal! Now some people dont have a $1000 or more to buy a AR15 right now so most people are buying stripped lower recievers because thats the part of the gun thats regulated. There fairly cheap now and u can buy as many as u want if u have collector status in md and if u dont u can only buy 1 regulated firearm in md every 30 days. Ammo is a whole other story but just be patient and u will see that settle back to normal by summer time."

The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The Daniel Defense, V5-300 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly.

It is informally referred to as the Yugo M70 or Yugo AK.

My rough conversions (pre-inflation):
I used to buy the 500 rnd bricks of CCI for $25 = .05 per bullet

The .223 steel I paid .30 per bullet so same as above
The .223 brass I paid .45 per bullet so 9 to 1
The 12g I paid $6 for 25 so .24 = 4.8 to 1

I'm looking for a DMR (Designated Marksman Rifle) type firearm. It can be on the AR-15 or 10 platform, M-14, FAL, the AK platform, or, even preferably, a PSL platform.

I'm not looking for any ""tricked out"" SKS type firearms.

This is not the prettiest rifle on this site, nor is it a very valuable piece, but for someone, it will make a great little squirrel gun or a nice one to throw in the back of the truck. 

First, the bad parts--the camo is coming off of the stock, there are deep scratches in the receiver, and there are no sights on the gun to speak of.

 Now, for the positives--I have a 30 round mag for it, it has scope bases already mounted, I don't want that much money for it, there's a limbsaver recoil pad on it and it is accurate with a scope mounted to it--if you totaled everything up with it, you're looking at about 210 dollars plus tax.

Colt’s new LE6920 shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel. With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip, MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine.

I bought this brand new in 11/12. It is unfired and in perfect condition as it has just been in my safe. It has everything that came from the factory still sealed. This includes 2 magazines, sling. manual and cleaning tools. This is a perfect gun that is made by the industry leader and not pieced together by a novice. The only partial trade that I would be interested in is a Ruger LCR in 38 or 357. Please call, email or text any questions that you may have. (Five Eight Zero) 647-0972
