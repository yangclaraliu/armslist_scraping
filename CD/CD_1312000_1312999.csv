KEL-TEC RFB .308. Mint Condition W/Box. Serial # t0Vxx.  KEL-RTEC RFB, chambered for .308 caliber. What better wat to describe this unique firearm than to directly “borrow” the description from KEL-TEC’s  first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths."

Compliments from Syracuse.com

By staff writers Sistina Giordano and Tim Knauss

Syracuse, NY – Turn Albany Upside Down, an organization that grew out of Republican candidate Carl Paladino's campaign for governor in 2010, obtained a permit to hold a protest opposing the NY Safe Act on Saturday at Syracuse’s Inner Harbor, according to Syracuse City Hall.

The rally is a prelude to a ""March on Albany'' to be scheduled next month, according to the online announcement. Besides Turn Albany Upside Down, sponsors include several Upstate Republican Party and Conservative Party chairs, and gun advocacy groups including Women for the Second Amendment (W2A) and The Oath Keepers of NYS.

State Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long will be the keynote speaker. Paladino also will speak. Tom Dadey, Onondaga County Republican Party chairman, said he will attend.
AP060213017704.JPG Mike Long AP  
The rally is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. although organizers have invited the public to start gathering there at 10 a.m. It is expected to end at 2 p.m.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also been invited to give his views on passing the Safe Act. ""You are the governor and as such, you should face the people directly to explain both the reasoning for this law as well as the history of how it was drafted. You will be given the floor and as much time as necessary to justify your reasoning,"" the release states.

Cuomo defeated Paladino for governor in 2010, 61 percent to 34 percent..

Former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, a nationally known gun rights advocate, will speak at the rally against the ""tyrant named Cuomo,'' according to a press release Mack sent today.

Mack rose to prominence in the mid-1990s when he sued the Clinton administration over the Brady gun control law, which resulted in a Supreme Court ruling that the law violated state sovereignty by requiring local officials to conduct background checks on gun buyers. Mack has called the federal government ''the greatest threat we face.''

The Safe Act was the first state gun control law to be passed following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn. The new law, which Cuomo signed Jan. 15, sets a seven-bullet limit on magazines used outside of competitions or gun ranges, tightens the definition of illegal ""assault weapons"" and requires owners of formerly legal semi-automatic guns to register them.

Cuomo has said the new law ""will limit gun violence through common sense, reasonable reforms that include addressing the risks posed by mentally ill people who have access to guns and banning high capacity magazines and lethal assault weapons."""

You're scared of prosecution and the chance of prison time for exercising the rights that millions of men fought and died for. Sure you may face the possibility of being forcefully anal raped in prison but that is much more dignifying than living life on yours knees and permitting someone to fuck you. To those of you that plan on registering your assault weapons if this shit is not repealed, you might as well destroy them or sell them to me. Take a look at what happened/is happening in Canada, Australia, Cuba, Russia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Bermuda, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Britain, Scotland, Jamaica, Italy, Poland, Bosnia, Soviet Georgia etc. There are many more on the list but all of these governments passed legislation for background checks, registration, etc. Once they knew where and who everybody was they confiscated the firearms. It's even already happened within the united states in Illinois, California, and Louisiana. Currently in Ontario Canada gun owners homes are being barged into by police without warrants to check if firearms/ammunition are being stored to their standards. if not they confiscated or to put in more correct terms STOLE them!!! If you're scared now just wait until only the police and military have access to sufficient small arms and have armed drones patrolling our skies. It's time to draw the line and take a stand people. Don't use your job, family, wife, kids, etc. as an excuse to obey this law because you're afraid that you will be prosecuted and unable to provide for them. Their safety, security and freedom is at much greater risk than you going to prison or losing your job for a weapons charge."

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

373,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1312373,For Sale/Trade:  Quality .22 LR & DEFENSIVE 9mm HP : sell/trade,"Miami, Miami-Dade, South Florida",$ 18,"Listed On: Friday, March 22, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"UPDATE 3-22-13 :

All remaining .22 LR Value Packs were SOLD a ways back.  CCI Stingers now down to 5 boxes left.  Other .22 LR lines have a respectable number of boxes available as do the defensive 9mm lines.  Note to the 9mm... mall ninjas seem to think standard 9mm 115 grain FMJ (range ammo) is the same as 9mm 147 grain HP and/or bonded HP (defensive ammo)... and that somehow the two have congruent cost.  Two totally different animals, folks.  Stop comparing base model Hyundais to fully loaded top of the line Hondas.  While you're at it, go online and compare ammo retailer's 9mm HP cpr to what I'm offering.  C'mon, I dare ya.  I double dog dare ya...

Moving on, my .22 LR overflow I'm willing to part with has dwindled from where I was comfortable and yes, I marked them up a bit because of that.  If they don't sell, oh well.  My investment was still a wise one.  For the quick trigger types out there who fire first and ask questions later, turn off your glaring prejudices.  I'm no flipper, I've simply invested so heavily in ammo the last few years, I'm looking to transfer a portion of that common sense endeavor into some new iron.  I could be asking plenty more.  Try looking online and see what the cpr is for even 'cheap' .22 LR ('Golden' Bullets, Centurion, etc.).  At current inflated rates (often much higher than mine) that cheap studge is still easily selling (and selling out in minutes flat). 

As mentioned via last update, I have a new interest in trades for a Zastava PAP M92 PV Pistol - 7.62x39mm (and still the other prior trades mentioned/any decent offer will be considered). M92s are still readily available online for under $800... so I have no interest in offers above that.  Just picked up some greasy Chinese 53s and they are tasty so I'm lookin' for more of those or of course the M44's by way of Putin. 

Please don't waste time for both sides by making emphatic and/or repeated inquiries... if you're just going to flake out like the typical standard issue Floridian.  I had a few of those early on (and lately too...) and I'm not impressed.  This is a first come first served operation.  If I say I can get a line of ammo your way, I will... but what I won't do is wait around for flakes to make up their minds or take nearly a day to respond and expect the playing field not to change in the interim.  Be adults, it's not hard. 

The world does not revolve around you or me.

Unlike many folks selling their ammo you will see I'm actually offering high QUALITY products at a premium... vs all the entry-level products at ridiculous mark-ups. Am I charging more than I paid?  Yup.  I'm fully justified to do so due to the fact that I had the foresight and will to plan and ACT accordingly. I jumped through plenty of hoops to get what I have. I don't make it a habit to give away any of my labors for nothing in return, at least in this instance.

It's hilarious that die hard Obama bashers drill that cheap suit for giving handouts to lazy folks (corporate welfare is cool though?  WTF?)... but when it comes to the ammo needs of a particular stone throwin' crowd... those fragile little snowflakes demand to be treated special... while sulking in their glass houses of complete and utter hypocrisy. 

Stings, don't it?

Thank Charlie Bronson I'm neither an angry elephant nor a silly donkey true 'believer' who falls for either of those sick dog and pony shows.  My apologies to dogs and ponies, they're awesome.

Some folks also naively think the AWB is dead and done with... and that sheeple 'laws' like UBC no longer pose threats to our way of life, LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.  Oh, and supposedly the ammo shortage is over too...

Sell that crap to the tourists. 

Keep dreamin' and ignoring history (some of it rather recent).  That always turns out well, huh?  I'd love the ammo shortage to be as dead as ridiculous jokes such as GOP predictable picks ala dear ole Mittens... but I'll let the cupcakes at Starbucks slurp that sugar water down along with Biden's double barrel shotgun.

Are you receiving my signal?

The handles is made of a contoured Micarta which glides its way to the flat-ground blade. The Spyderco FB18 Woodlander is made in Italy.

Slide internals are; polished striker, titnium plunger, custom cut to length tungsten guide rod running non-captured springs(have several springs to go with).  Factory glock barrel, lone wolf 6.2in threaded barrel with EFK firedragon Compensator, and lonewolf 6-port barrel made specifically for the G34.  Slide has been drilled and tapped with Burris Fast Fire mounted on top infront of the rear sight.  Gun still has fixed sights as ""backups"".  Frame internals:  Zev-tech fully adjustable fulcrum trigger, adjustable for overtravel and pretravel.  Zev-tech 2.5lb race connector fully polished.  Custom ejector housing with over travel adjustment screw. Zev-tech titanium ejector, LW hardened extractor.  Reduced power striker spring with ghost cups, heavy comp trigger spring.  All pins have been replaced with titanium pins.  Zev-tech ext large mag release. Frame itself has been modified as well: double undercut trigger guard and front of guard has been rounded.  The backstrap of frame has been slightly reduced in girth to flatten out the grip.  The frame was then stippled and the whole gun was then cerakoted black.  A dawson precision ICE magwell was then installed.  I have alot of money in this gun, ALOT!  This is not a gun for someone who just wants a bedside gun for home protection this a shooter than runs, runs well, and runs fast.  With the lightened slide, fulcrum trigger, and ported barrel or threaded and comp setup this gun functions lightning fast. Asking price is $2,300 with everything, I know its the price of 3 or 4 glocks but I know its not for everyone but if your interested text 704-902-nine two eight zero and ill send pics.  If someone wanted the slide only I could part with that and build next project off of a new slide and keep my frame, just let me know if your interested.  The slide will fit a 17, 22, 31, 34, or 35.

Ammo is returning to shelves, guns are returning to displays. I have been on Cabela's website and ordered 250 rounds of 9mm ($70 including shipping), 100 rounds of .22 ($13 including shipping) and 100 rounds of .308 ($70 including shipping). That was 3 different days this week alone. 
People are hoarding ammo and selling portions here to break even or turn a profit. Don't overpay. This is a sight where you are supposed to get good deals from the gun community, not to get ripped off by people jumping on the bandwagon to make a profit. 
If you can wait a couple days for buying ammo, buy online through stores, or check your local shops periodically. Shops are limiting sales due to the hoarding assholes who are selling on here. This is why you are seeing more and more people on here selling a single box of ammo instead of 1000 rounds. 
Let these hoarders be stuck with ammo, do not buy until prices are back to normal! Believe me, the market is stabilizing, ammo is not the thing to overpay for. Nor are guns. I walked into Dick's Sporting goods, they have some of the rifles like the 10/22 in stock, and its for $250, not $350-400.

North American Arms mini-revolvers are equipped with a unique safety giving
its owner maximum protection against accidental discharge. The safety
cylinder feature allows the gun to be carried fully loaded. There are
halfway notches between the chambers. After loading, the hammer is lowered
into one of these notches. When the hammer is pulled back to the firing
position, the cylinder rotates to the next chamber. The traditional
half-cock position is to be used for loading and unloading only.

NAA HGM 22 Holster Grip 22 Mag 1.62"" 5rd Black Holster Grip SS

The Mini-Revolver series by North American Arms is available in 22 Magnum
or 22 Long Rifle. With a barrel length of 1-5/8"" or 1-1/8"", both calibers
offer a lightweight concealed carry pocket gun with a 5-shot capacity.
Using the half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely
away from live or empty chambers without chance of accidental discharge.
The steel frame is fitted with a handy locking black holster grip with a
pocket clip and fixed blade front sight. The holster grip unfolds and locks
to become the handle of the gun. Press the release button and the
mini-revolver folds back into the grip. For added safety, when the holster
grip is folded, the trigger of the gun is completely enclosed making it
virtually impossible for the gun to be fired.

Cash only - I'm not interested in trading unless it's for a Colt 9mm AR - Nothing else. And the price is firm. 
The Sig and the Colt are considered the best factory AR-15s you can buy, hands down.
This AR shoots both 5.56mm NATO as well as the typical .223 rounds. It has a 1 in 7 inch rifling instead of the typical 1 in 9 inch. The 1 in 7 leads to better accuracy and is military spec. That's one of the things that sets Sig apart from others in its class.

You're scared of prosecution and the chance of prison time for exercising the rights that millions of men fought and died for. Sure you may face the possibility of being forcefully anal raped in prison but that is much more dignifying than living life on yours knees and permitting someone to fuck you. To those of you that plan on registering your assault weapons if this shit is not repealed, you might as well destroy them or sell them to me. Take a look at what happened/is happening in Canada, Australia, Cuba, Russia, China, Japan, New Zealand, Bermuda, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Britain, Scotland, Jamaica, Italy, Poland, Bosnia, Soviet Georgia etc. There are many more on the list but all of these governments passed legislation for background checks, registration, etc. Once they knew where and who everybody was they confiscated the firearms. It's even already happened within the united states in Illinois, California, and Louisiana. Currently in Ontario Canada gun owners homes are being barged into by police without warrants to check if firearms/ammunition are being stored to their standards. if not they confiscated or to put in more correct terms STOLE them!!! If you're scared now just wait until only the police and military have access to sufficient small arms and have armed drones patrolling our skies. It's time to draw the line and take a stand people. Don't use your job, family, wife, kids, etc. as an excuse to obey this law because you're afraid that you will be prosecuted and unable to provide for them. Their safety, security and freedom is at much greater risk than you going to prison or losing your job for a weapons charge"

It also comes with a slip on 2 inch rubber butt-pad that I added to improve eye relief of scope and to reduce felt recoil. I currently own 2 sks's and I will be keeping the other (my first rifle).  :-) $725.00 OBO.

I told the guy I could meet him that day to pay him, he said he couldnt meet, but would the next day.  Later in the day I noticed the ad was taken down, and I sent him a follow up email regarding it, he told me he agreed to sell it to a guy in Milford and ship it to an FFL.  I said that was bogus because he already agreed to sell it to me.  He said if I paid him via paypal he would sell me it, so I did.  then he stopped answering my emails, the next night he told me he didnt get to ship it, but would the next day, the next day comes and he says he wants to refund me, but cant because paypal put a hold on his account.  I am now going through the dispute process with paypal.  Paypal has tried to contact him to verify that he wont be shipping the item, but he will not answer them or myself.  All he has to do is tell paypal hes not shipping it, and I'll have my money back.  Instead he wants to make me wait out the entire dispute process, which means it could be 45 days before I get my money back.

DO NOT do business with ""Joseph J""  he said he was a registered FFL, and his email is phonedrj@gmail, DO NOT do business with this dude, super shady, and is making it 10x ahrder for me to get my money back than it needs to be.  I located what I think is his FFL listing, so at one point he may have been legit, but not now for sure."

I have had it priced for sale at a price point that is basically the msrp with tax included.  So all in all the gun is below what you would pay for it at the store.   So here is my next attempt to sell the rifle.  

I am willing to part with rifle either MSRP vs MSRP or Wholesale vs. Wholesale for the following....  I am sure some Lawnmower dealer is sitting on a lawn mower that is a nice brand that would be willing to trade a brand new Lawn Mower for a brand new DPMS RIFLE...    I had a Honda.    If you know anyone who is a Lawn mower dealer and may be looking for a rifle, Send them my way....  Till then, the rifle is still for sale.

800.00 dollars is the total price...  TAX included.  

I am also looking for the following....  Brand new Springfield XD/m 9mm 3.8   
I have a customer looking for one so I am willing to swap gun for gun and cash difference.  Again cost for cost.

I shot 10 rounds. For some reason they are set about 0.003 inch too long.  They fire great when single loaded or two in a mag.   Again, they shoot great.  They are Lake City brass cased.  Thanks,"
