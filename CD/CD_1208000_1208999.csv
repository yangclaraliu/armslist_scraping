The flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms J.A. Nine is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range.

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM®) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups or charging handles.

As a note:  BCM® barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly.  Prior to shipping, all BCM® upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy.  As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistent with these quality control procedures.





M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 

T-Marked Upper Receiver 
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber 
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

5.56 NATO Chambers 
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

Government Barrel Profiles 
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels 
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

 The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

My $1495 price for everything is probably the best price you will find anywhere for a SIG M400 AR-15 rifle with these extras that was basically test fired only. 

This gun is very much sought after as a quality AR15 platform for functionality and accuracy right from the factory. After all it is a “SIG.”

As seen in pic it is shown with a SIG scope and mount, with manually illuminated graduations both in red and green from 100 to 500 yards, and a 6 position collapsing stock and sling. 

Also comes with several EXTRA's $$$. (1) is a full four sided Picatinny rail replacement for front rounded hand guards,(2) is a tactical light with picatinny mount, (3) is a tactical laser with picatinny mount and (4) is a Magpul forward folding handle grip attached with a picatinny mount, manual and one (30) round mag and gun lock. 

Gun has less than 70 rounds through it, and it was shooting about 1MOA at the gun range at 100 yards on a sand bag, with white box ammo with 100% reliability.

THE SIG M400 SERIES TACTICAL RIFLE, is designed for use in law enforcement, military operations, or the sporting field as well as competitive shooting. 

The SIG M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle. Provides unparalleled accuracy, with a 16"" chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel that provides maximum durability and corrosion resistance. A 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability.

This gun is tighter and more accurate than a stock COLT LE6920 that you will pay way too much for.

I have more than 4K rounds of 7.62x39 ammo for my AK's and have decided to stay with the AK platform for the Zombie Apocalypse. 

So I'm selling or trading off this fine AR-15.

When responding with offers please include your name and contact number and pics of what you have to offer, otherwise you will not get a response from me.

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a
standard picatinny rail.

This gun is in great shape and has never had any issues. I bought it almost one year ago brand new. This is the higher end model from RIA as it has the upgraded trigger and hammer; you can see these in the pictures they are slotted trigger and silhouette hammer. The gun came with the wooden grips but i changed them to the Hogue black ones shortly after purchase. 
Here is everything that comes along with the gun:
-hard case
-original wood grips
-Hogue molded rubber grips
-2 extra magazines (hardened and coated like the one that came with it, not cheap aluminum)
-box of Hornady Critical Defense FTX hollow point rounds
-100 round box of Winchester brass FMJ rounds
-all original paperwork from time of sale
I have always taken care of this gun, it is my everyday carry weapon. It has been cleaned within 3 hours everytime I've shot it and still looks new. I've decided to switch to lower caliber to get higher mag capacity; but I'm not desperate to sell so any low-ball offers will just be ignored.
I may be interested in trading for:
-Smith & Wesson M&P .40 or 9mm
-Springfield xD in .40 or 9mm (prefer 17/19+1)
-Saiga 12
-most models of AR-15 which i would include some cash with it
-other hi-cap 9mm or .40 handguns
Please send trade details in email or cash offer. Thanks for looking.

According to them the government or big corporations should set the price of items. I guess they should also dictate how much ammo you can own too, right? Because in a free society prices go up when supply goes down. So from now on you can only own 2 boxes of ammo so the government can keep prices at their set amount. I bet those cry babies believe the government should also shut down all private sales like auctions, free marketplaces, swap meets, jockey lots, farmers markets, etc because they can't control prices in those areas. Chuck that!
Thank God we live in a place where we have the right to buy or not buy however much guns and ammo we want. A place where price is dictated by the people not government. I thank God that I live in place where people can ask $500 for a Twinky, $50,000,000 for a Rembrandt, $2,000 for an AR!

No other semi-automatic rifle has captured the imagination of the shooting public like the SG 556 series rifle. For years this legendary Swiss made rifle has been restricted to law enforcement and military sales where it has continuously built on its reputation for outstanding performance, accuracy and durability. SIG SAUER offers the U.S. produced version as the SIG556, which is available to the general consumer and law enforcement markets. The SIG556 features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by SIG's sister company Swiss Arms and marries it to a trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle's weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines."

The roller frizzen spring was broken and the mainspring weakened so I have
commissioned a pair of replacement springs from the gun smith.
This is a really fine and rare pistol and deserves quality work. The cost of the new springs
is included in the price.

I had been thinking about having this pistol restored for some time but probably
left it a bit late. In view of the cost incurred I have reluctantly decided
to recover my expenditure and offer it for sale"

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters alike.
Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents. $750"

Because in a free society prices go up when supply goes down. So from now on you can only own 2 boxes of ammo so the government can keep prices at their set amount. I bet those cry babies believe the government should also shut down all private sales like auctions, free marketplaces, swap meets, jockey lots, farmers markets, etc because they can't control prices in those areas. Chuck that!
Thank God we live in a place where we have the right to buy or not buy however much guns and ammo we want. A place where price is dictated by the people not government. I thank God that I live in place where people can ask $500 for a Twinky, $50,000,000 for a Rembrandt, $2,000 for an AR!

Make: Winchester

Model: Model 71 Deluxe

Serial Number: 2427

Year of Manufacture: 1936

Caliber: .348 Winchester Center Fire

Action Type: Lever Action Rifle

Markings: The barrel is marked ""Winchester / Proof Steel / Model 71 / Winchester / Trade Mark / 348 W.C.F."". The Winchester proof mark is on top of the barrel and the frame. The underside of the frame is stamped ""2427"". The left side of the rear sight is marked ""100"" and the right side if marked ""U.S.A. Pat. Pending"".

Barrel Length: 24""

Sights / Optics: The front sight is a beaded blade, on a ramp and under a hood and the rear sight is an interesting peep sight mounted to the bolt. The rear barrel dovetail is filled with a blank.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are original finish, pistol grip and checkered wood. There is age darkening at areas of high contact. The checkering has worn a bit, primarily at the wrist. There are a few scattered marks and dings, please see the photographs. There are two or three small chips to the finish on the right side of the stock. The wood is very well preserved for a field used 1936 rifle. The LOP measures 13 1/4"" from the front of the trigger to the back of the checkered steel plate. The stock rates in about Fine overall condition.

Type of Finish: Blue

Finish Originality: Factory Original

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp and deep. There is no erosion.

Overall Condition: This rifle retains about 85% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows thinning on the lower tang and lever from use. The loading gate has a thinned and mottled finish. The barrel has a few marks and patches of thinning from rack storage. There are a very few patches of freckled erosion, especially on the frame flats. This erosion is definitely over the finish and there is no doubt that the finish on this beautiful rifle is original. The screw heads are slightly marked, but sharp. The markings are crisp and even raised, especially the serial number. Overall, this rifle rates in about Fine condition.

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We have not fired this rifle.

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None

Our Assessment: This is practically the pistol gripped version of the Model 1886 - a proven action capable of firing large caliber smokeless rounds. The gun is strong (it needs to be to handle the .348 WCF). It is beautiful, comfortable to hold and aim, reasonably light weight and rapid firing, a DELUXE and a 2nd year Production Pre-64 Winchester. Chances are you already know what you are looking at, but if not, this is one of the best hunting rifles you could buy, that will take down just about any trophy in North America. The collectability of this rifle probably surpasses its usefulness, but for either purpose, you'd be hard pressed to do any better.

791,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1208791,For Sale:  1948 Ishapore Enfield No. 1 Mk. 3* SMLE: Transition Rifle,"Westside, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 525,"Listed On: Thursday, March 7, 2013",Rifles,no type,303 British                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is a beautiful 1948 No. 1 Mk. 3* (not Mk. III*) manufactured by India's Ishapore factory. Details below: 

* The rifle is in overall excellent condition. Nose cap, sights, barrel, receiver, and magazine all match. While the bolt does NOT match, this is very common for Indian rifles, often stripped of the bolt before being stored. 

* The nosecap is correct; aside from having matching numbers, the stacking swivel lug remains undrilled, as all Ishapores were. 

* Original 2000m sights, numbers-matching.

* Ishapore screw is present, this isn't one of the later hex bolts. 

* The buttstock bears the ""TDE"" stamp that signifies post-Independence manufacture. 

* The bore of this rifle is, simply put, fucking gorgeous. Seriously. I put 50 rounds of Partizan through it after acquiring the rifle a while back, and it's been cleaned and oiled ever since. The lands and grooves are razor sharp, almost brand new. 

* Brass buttplate and the buttstock show signs of regular use, very nice condition. The wooden furniture is in excellent condition overall; the only damage is a little bit of missing wood on the upper rear hand guard, like somebody tried to pry it up too aggressively and chipped a small bit off. 

* The stampings on the action's wrist really mark the rifle as special: They read ""GRI 1948 No. 1 Mk. 3*"". Prior to August 15, 1947 India was still a British colony; as such all rifles would be stamped GRI for ""Georgius Rex, Imperator"". Post August 15, 1947 rifles should be stamped RFI for ""Rifle Factory, Ishapore"". As such, this is what's known as a ""transition rifle"" due to it's being manufactured post-Independence on British tooling, by workers that were British-trained. This isn't a sloppy 60's .308, it's just as good as a BSA or Lithgow made during the Interwar years. 

* Chambered in .303. 

This is an awesome rifle that's in amazing shape and has a great history. It's all-original save for the bolt, but aside from not being numbers-matching the bolt is a proper Indian example. I'm selling to generate money for a nice Enfield .22 trainer that I've got a line on. 

I have more pictures available upon request. 

$525 is pretty firm. I might be willing to consider negotiating or trades a bit if the buyer's serious. Face-to-face meetings preferred: I will ship the rifle to an FFL, but The buyer pays shipping and transfer fees, tacked onto the final cost.

6 position tactical stock
Has never been fired and is brand new with the packing oil still on it.

The bore is chambered for either a 5.56 Nato round or the standard .223 round and comes standard with a 30 round clip.
I found this weapon shoots very accurate and long ranges and is enjoyable to shoot over all. The only downside is cleaning it correctly can take up to an hour if you take your time and do it right.

The recoil is very minimal and the accuracy of the weapon is outstanding. You could shoot his gun all day long and not get tired of it.

Pictures are of the ar-15 you will be buying.

I have 2 available and both have different sites

Va residents must do a transfer with me at my ffl for 30 dollars. Active duty military will not need to goto my ffl. Just bring your orders and military Id and willing to sign a bill of sale.

Dear Coloradan, 

Thank you for signing the petition opposing the Democrats’ gun control package currently being debated in the Colorado General Assembly. On Monday, hundreds of Coloradans showed up to testify against these extreme measures. 

While they passed committee on a party-line vote, the battle isn’t over. These bills will be debated in the Senate, this Friday, March 8th, and the vote is going to be close. This is why we need you to act immediately! 

Please take a moment and contact these members and respectfully ask them to vote NO on the proposed gun control package.

FN 66946 FNS FNS-40 40 Smith & Wesson 4"" 10+1 Polymer Grips Black Finish

The FNS 40 is the result of years of research incorporating the most
precise engineering and product development to bring the most
highly-advanced striker-fired pistol to the American law enforcement and
personal defense market. The FN FNS is a true double-action pistol with a
pivoting hinged trigger featuring an exceptionally crisp break and a short
travel to reset. The matte black polymer frame comes with four
interchangeable backstraps to customize grip fit and is designed with a
low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced control. The
fully-ambidextrous controls are shaped for easy access without snagging on
holsters or clothing. The contoured frame-mounted manual safety is ideally
placed for positive operation by either thumb. The FNS-40 offers a
hammer-forged stainless steel barrel. The slide features front and rear
cocking serrations and is topped with three-dot fixed combat sights or
night sights. The FN FNS also is equipped with steel frame rails that can
be easily replaced.

ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points
more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile
pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore,
further enhancing accuracy, and the Wonder finish features a polished steel
slide.

The 45 is a Remington Rand. According to the serial no 1016319 and what I have been told it is a sand cast model.
