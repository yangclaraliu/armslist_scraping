It was my brothers and I took it on trade but being I have a 1187 that I hunt with just never shot it. It has set in my brothers gun safe the last 13 years. He had used it during the time he owned it to Turkey hunt but probably had less than 20 shells thru it. The gun was mfg in 1991. The wood in in very good condition. The only thing I can find on it is there is one small corrosion spot on the receiver and a couple along the grooved rib on the receiver. I think this probably happened because it just set in the back his safe and he didnt realize that his dehumidifier rod has quit for about a year and being his safe is in his garage could see this happening.

The SCAR® is the semi-auto only version of the newest service rifle of U.S. special operators. Light, fast-handling and quick shooting, the SCAR® 16S is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO (223 Rem.) and features a free-floating, cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel with chrome-lined bore. The SCAR® 17S is chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO (308 Win.) and features a free-floating, cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel with chrome-lined bore. Fully-ambidextrous operating controls on both models instantly adapt to any shooter and any shooting position. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail and three accessory rails enable the mounting of scopes or electronic sights, plus tactical lights and lasers. The telescoping, side-folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length-of-pull, and is available in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) or matte black.

Excellent condition, with less than 400 rds fired. Comes with 420rds of african battle pack, and another 80-100rds of assorted 308, and 15 20 rnd mags. This is an A-4xxx serial number ( one of the best ones). If you dont know about hear rifles a little research on hkpro will show you they are extremely high quality built on hk tooli g using the hk blueprints(jld purchased from h&k). This rifle runs perfect and is very accurate. Hangs with and in some cases it will out shoot my remington 700. I really enjoy this rifle but I just don't have the money to shoot 308 or the range.

The M9 Semiautomatic is a 9x19mm Parabellum pistol that was adopted in 1985 as the ofﬁcial sidearm of the United States military after winning a competition in the 1980s, beating out many other contenders. The 92F survived exposure to temperatures from -40°F to 140°F, being soaked in salt water, being dropped repeatedly on concrete, and being buried in sand, mud and snow. Additionally, the 92F proved a MRBF (mean rounds before failure) of 35,000 rounds, the equivalent to ﬁve or six times the pistol’s service life. It ofﬁcially entered service in 1990. The Chiappa M9-22 is a replica of the US Military sidearm chambered in .22 rimﬁre.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm)
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness

I picked this one up for $1,077.00 and called a friend of mine who owns a gun store in the area for current pricing. He is selling this gun for $1,249.99 plus tax. I am not the guy putting guns on here to try and make money. I bought this one to sell to someone who wants one and cannot find one for a reasonable, fair price. I am asking $1,100.00 for it which gives me a profit of around $23.00 to help with the gas I have burned looking for them. This is the 5.56 version but will shoot .223 as well. Serious buyers only, and I will not negotiate as I will not lose money on this gun and I do not have to sell it and will gladly keep it if no one wants it. It does come with 1 30-round magazine.

Price is firm so no low ballers please! I am however open to equal value trades, or might even add to more valuable trades. Firearm trades only!!

I was planing on doing two AR builds but just can't afford it so I'm selling one of my stripped lowers. I bought them from www.countrysidewalk.com for $215.99 each but I think there main website is www.hamrickenterprises.com and they have them for $199.99. I'm selling it for $250 cause I had to pay for a backround check and shipping and handling so I'm just charging what I paid. With the other lower I'm using i am loving it I put about 1500 rounds through it and its been great. plus the look and feel of it is different then other polymer lowers. It dosent have that plastic look and feel. The lower I'm selling has no rounds through it The photo with the upper is just to show how it looks really good. if you are interested just contact seller or text me at 7two0-5two3-8five03  oh ya I'm gonna through in the basic ar pistol grip.

This rifle comes with two stocks, and the original one doesn't have a pistol grip or telescoping butt stock, so you aren't obligated to register it and you can transfer it and sell it whenever you want.

It has two 10-round mags and one 5-round mag. It comes with both the wood stock, and the ATI black stock. The ATI stock is made for the Mini 14 5.56, so I took a dremel and widened the magazine well to accommodate the Mini 30 mags. It could use some sanding here but it works just find.

It has a mounted Accu-Strut for increased accuracy. It also has a 4x scope and a detachable flash suppressor. All the accessories, but the case is not included. I also have some ammo. This rifle has zero issues with steel cased Soviet ammo, and Soviet ammo is cheap and plentiful. Eat eats up Tula and Golden Tiger.

You won't find a more complete LEGAL rifle like this somewhere else.

Features of LEUPOLD GOLDEN RING VX-7L 4.5-18x56mm LONG RANGE RIFLESCOPE:
•The Leupold Light Optimization Profile delivers the light transmission and light throughput benefits of a large objective, yet mounts like a riflescope with a much smaller objective lens for a better cheekweld and more comfortable shooting.
•The Leupold Xtended Twilight Lens System optimizes the transmission of low-light wavelengths, so you see the details of low-light scenes in greater, brighter detail than with any other riflescope available.
•Low-profile SpeeDial adjustments smoothly slide up and open for adjustment.
•The finger-adjustable 1/4-MOA click adjustments are easy to zero.
•A more generous eyebox than you'll find even in premium European optics.
•Blackened lens edges reduce light diffusion, so more usable light reaches the shooter's eye, for a brighter image with higher resolution.
•Available with the Leupold Ballistics Aiming System for more accurate long-range shooting, including the Leupold Boone and Crockett Big Game and Varmint Hunter's reticles.
•Lead-free glass lenses offer the excellent optical properties such a precision instrument deserves, with greatly reduced weight. They are produced without the hazardous environmental byproducts common to standard glass production.
•Leupold DiamondCoat 2 lens coatings on exterior lens surfaces provides the highest level of scratch resistance Leupold has ever offered.
•Leupold Dual Spring, 4x erector system is designed to withstand the most devastating recoil. It virtually eliminates erector system backlash and stress on the internal workings of the system, for longer life.
•Includes Leupold Alumina flip-back lens covers.
•Internally threaded, extreme fast-focus eyepiece with Leupold Alumina rubber eyepiece guard.
•Tactile power indicator identifies your magnification level with a touch.
•34mm maintube crafted from 6061-T6 aircraft quality aluminum alloy increases the body strength, and allows for the necessary windage and elevation adjustment travel.
•Comes with Satin Black 34mm PRW rings
•Available in Leupold exclusive satin black finish.
•Incredibly rugged, with absolute waterproof integrity.
•Covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee and the Leupold VX-7 Custom Care Package.
