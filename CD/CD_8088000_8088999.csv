You can read more about MO marking here: http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinMO.htmSerial numbers are force matched, as is glorious way of Motherland. CAI import mark. Bluing is pretty nice but not perfect by any means, has nicks and  scratches from being an occasional shooter for the last handful of years. Some bluing is rubbed near the muzzle / front sight. There are two areas of concern in regards to the condition of the pistol that I have highlighted in the photos:1) Micro pitting / surface rust on the top strap. This looks like possibly a poor spot in the original finish from the factory, but you can see a hint of rust forming there on the surface. 2) A dark spot on the muzzle.Mechanically excellent and a great shooter. Bore is bright and the rifling is clearly defined. I tried to take pics... sorry for the quality. I also have a holster, lanyard, cleaning rod, and original screwdriver tool. Also have the CAI Owner's Manual.Also have roughly 300 rounds of Russian surplus 7.62x38R that I've been sitting on for a couple of years. This is the stuff that actually seals the chamber and is noticably more potent than modern production ammo. It's been stored in a metal ammo can with dessicant the entire time.Prefer not to split up. $475 OBO for the lot."

Comes with 1 7 round blued removable magazine, 10 round stainless mags are readily available, Fleet Farm sells them for $16.00. 3 x 9 scope included. Very accurate gun and very quiet to shoot with the long barrel, when at the range alone I didnt feel hearing protection was needed, I was asked more than once if it was internally suppressed. I just dont shoot it much, my 10-22 gets more attention.Low ball offers will be ignored, open to reasonable trades, all I can say is no. If the ad is up its still available."

Built on a Remington 700 action. 28"" Shilen 9 twist barrel that finishes at .960"". Shilen competition trigger. McMillan M40A1-htg stock, professionally bedded. Talley lightweight rings. Burris XTR312 3x-12x tactical scope with illuminated Ballistic MilDot reticle. The scope has been recently gone through by Burris. They rebuilt the objective lens pack, rebuilt the parallax adjustment, resealed and nitrogen purged, then recoil tested. Also included will be RCBS standard dies, brass, remaining hand loads with 175 grain Nosler Accubond Long Range over H1000 (G1 bc of .672 at 3150 fps).  A few factory loads. (Nosler 160 grain Accubond at 3280 fps). Will also throw in some component bullets if purchased for the full asking price. I had the barrel scoped at my gunsmith and he said: ""It looks good, definitely not shot out."" I bought it used, so the exact round count is unknown to me. My smith said that the work appears to have been done by Shilen, given the markings on the barrel. Due to the weight of the rifle, around 14.5 pounds, the recoil on the bench is more pleasant than an 8 pound 7mm Rem Mag. Asking $1000. No low ball offers. This rifle shoots 1/2"" groups with Nosler factory ammo. Also shot a .75"" 6 shot group with the ABLR with 6 different powder charges while doing a ladder workup.  Let me know if you have any questions. You would be hard-pressed to find a better deal on a ""turn-key"" 1000 yard rig. This is an excellent long range elk rifle.I may consider trades for higher end or multiple pistols. (i.e. Beretta Centurion Tactical, CZ Shadow 2, CZ75 SP01 Tactical, P01, better grade 1911's, HK USP40c, USP45c, HK45(c), P30 V1, P7, Gen 4 or 5 Glock 19 or 34) Plus cash as necessary to balance value.Price has been dropped $200 from the previous listing. Would like to sell this weekend. I will not go any lower."

For a long time this was our only model chambered in 7.62×39 (now joined by the 527 Youth Carbine), it combines low recoil with effectiveness on medium-sized game such as deer and wild boar, making it ideal for younger shooters. Both chamberings offered in the Carbine are economical to shoot given their service rifle heritage and the availability of surplus ammunition.Built to CIP specifications, our 7.62×39 chambers are ideal for shooting steel-cased surplus ammo. Designed to shoot .311 bullets, some American brass ammo may not perform as well as the imported steel-cased variety because of SAAMI brass dimensions and varying bullet diameters."

There are two and one was made several decades earlier than the others. Each is a thick wool shirt, thicker than a Pendleton shirt that you can buy today, and was built to allow some customization for size. If it is a bit small, there are seams on the sleeves and I believe the back that one can rip out, then press flat. This has the effect of allowing the shirt to be sized slightly larger. These were issued starting in the 50's. It is size large for men with chest sizes from 41-45. I measure the sleeve length at 33.5"", which means it can be lengthened to about 34.5"" by ripping out the seam and pressing the fabric flat.    The older shirt lists the pattern date as JAN 1951.  $20 Each

It's was painted once upon a time and it's wearing off rather heavily now, giving it kind of a battleworn look, or ugly depending on how you look at it. It comes with the BSA Platinum 6-24x44 scope with glare shroud on weaver scope mounts, and the adjustable leanable bipod for unever surfaces.

I purchased the kit originally for around $225 and had numerous failure to feed and failure to eject issues. I installed the $30 TACCOM reliability kit (TACCOM Pressure Plug, Extractor and Firing Pin) and it worked flawlessly after that! Also included are two black 25 round Blackdog AR-15 .22 Sonic Weld X-Form Magazines as well as the original 25 round CMMG mag. I have around $300 into this setup and mainly used it on a suppressed AR to slow our armadillo population. I've run around 500 rounds through it after the reliability kit and it has performed flawlessly! Asking $175/CASH and must be picked up in College Station, TX. Thanks! Great for training and practice, this 22 LR conversion kit allows inexpensive target shooting through your favorite firearm. Shoots and functions like the regular AR-15, except the slide doesn't remain locked open after the last shot, with no significant change in weight and balance. Assembly is incredibly simple and only requires replacement of the original bolt carrier. No permanent modifications are required for use. Note: Rimfire conversion kits are NOT compatible with gas piston equipped AR-15's. The piston will not allow conversion to fit in the receiver."

Includes a De Santes pocket holster and a factory pinkie extension on one magazine. The pocket holster looks like a joke but man, it sure is neat. I carried it this weekend in shorts and jeans, the combo is very concealable and very easy to carry. I fired 10 rounds of 147 grain Browning BXP out of it, very controllable and very accurate. This gun came in on trade and appeared to be fired very little if at all. Like new! Sold new for $610, sells uses now for $540. Subtract the value of the laser and your buying the pistol for $390. wow. $540 and 4473 preformed at my premisis upon purchase.

One of the first Tasers developed by Dr. Cover, Dr. Cover found the Taser a hard sell because BATF labeled the Taser a handgun because the electric projectile was fired by gunpowder. All later models didn’t require gunpowder and Taser sales took off because a FFL wasn’t required to sell. This is a piece of firearm history that would be a nice addition to any collection. Excellent condition includes Taser gun, holster, charging cord, two new sealed cartridges and paperwork. Because BATF still considers this a firearm all good guy ID’s required.
