Been cleaned and kept in the safe ever since.Comes with everything from the original purchase: case, manual, two keys, two locks, and two 17-round magazines.In comparison, it has the grip and magazine of a Steyr M9-A1, but with the slide and barrel closer to a Steyr S9-A1.Price is firm. The only thing I'm willing to trade for it is a Sig P365.Thanks for looking!"

Chambered for the 7.62x39mm, this rifle has a 16-1/4"" chrome lined barrel with threaded muzzle brake and bayonet lug. The Chinese AK's are highly respected and are among the best available but thanks to the Clinton era import ban, they have been getting harder and harder to come by. The thicker 1.5mm stamped receivers are more durable than many of the 1mm thick Eastern block rifles, and the Chinese guns really are built to last. This rifle is in excellent original condition and I'd grade it about 99% overall. There is no rust or pitting. The stocks are in excellent condition with just a few tiny handling marks (these rifles seemed to ship new with a few handling marks). This rifle was a relatively early Sile import and has a blued bolt and the /66\ arsenal marking on the left side of the trunnion. The serial numbered parts are all properly matching, including the bayonet! The mechanics are in perfect working order (AK's are good for that!) and the bore is excellent. Internal inspection confirms that this rifle is absolutely unfired since it left the factory! It comes in the original box that numbers to the gun and includes all three 30-round mags, cleaning rod, bayonet with scabbard, sling (still sealed in plastic), buttstock cleaning kit, port cleaning tool, oil bottle, and owner's manual.
