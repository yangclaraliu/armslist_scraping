The cold hammer-forged barrel has a polygonal profile while the slide is made from a solid bar of nitro-carburized steel. Following recent trends in modern pistol designs, the P2000 makes extensive use of impact-resistant polymers to reduce weight and production costs.
As with other recent Heckler & Koch pistol designs, the P2000 is modular to suit individual needs. For instance, the grip is modular with exchangeable backstraps to adjust to individual grips, allowing the user to customize the pistol's grip size. There is an interface for accessories built into the frame in front of the trigger guard; the universal accessory rail on the dust cover that allows for the use of tactical lights, laser pointers and other accessories. Attachment is positive and does not require any tools. This is in contrast with the USP series, which uses a proprietary H&K mounting rail that limits the types of accessories that could be used with the pistol.
The P2000 is a hammer-fired pistol with an exposed spurred hammer; a bobbed hammer is optional. It has ambidextrous slide locks and a fully ambidextrous magazine release installed in the trigger guard, on both sides. Various trigger and cocking systems offer the possibility of converting the trigger firing mode from one type to another. Several variants are available based whether the LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) trigger (H&K's double-action only) mechanism is used versus a SA/DA trigger. Comes with 3 mags,box, and manual.  The picture is not of actual gun.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm)
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification

This gun was bought new as a 700 vls, but the barrel wouldn't group. I sent it back to Remington and they found the barrel defective and replaced the barrel with a 20"" tactical barrel per my request. This gun now shoots .5-.75 5 shot groups with quality ammo most days. After learning about the accuracy benefits of a 20"" barrel with 308, I specifically asked for the tactical barrel so that's why it's configured the way it is. It has a 3.5x10 40mm Field & Stream scope on it.  This gun is in nearly new condition. I've put about 200 rounds through this gun, mostly federal gold match 168gr Sierra match kings.  I am wanting something different now, so it's up for trade. I am open to most guns, no glocks though. I just don't care for them, never have never will. I like wheel guns in 357 mag, 1911's, ar's, bolt guns, ect. Let me know. Thanks.

Hands down the best AK made. Completely imported and customized by Arsenal Las Vegas. I wanted the best AK Platform, and this is it. AR's have already made a comeback in stores, but this rifle is not in any store across the country. Go look for yourself. This is the only TRUE Arsenal sgl-31 94 I have seen on armslist in the sate of NC. This is a highly valuable platform, made for a firearms enthusiast that understands what he is getting. It is not for your typical guy looking for a typical AK. Please look else where is you want a bargain, or an entry level CAI piece of junk. This rifle has only been touched by the best AK builders in the US, Arsenal Inc. You get what you pay for guys!! If you want to spend $800 on a CAI Romanian POS that was built from used parts and has canted sights and twisted receivers, then be my guest. But if you want a true AK that has been built by the best, then this is it!! This is a rifle you can trust your life with, a rifle that will increase in value over time, and a rifle that will make you happy every time you look at it. 

I'm going to be honest and straight forward, just so there is no misunderstanding. I will probably not negotiate much at all, nor will I even consider Low Ball offers! I can't even decide for sure if I want to let it leave my possession. I am honestly just seeing what kind of interest I get and any offers I receive. I have no problem hanging on to this beautiful rifle. 

Okay, now that you have an understanding from where 
I'm coming from. I will gladly talk about the rifle itself. First off, the rifle is in like new condition. I have only shot maybe 6-7 magazines through it. Perfect working condition!
I have upgraded this thing to be an operators dream! and it features:
**Ace Push button side folding stock (skeleton model)......................$200
**US Palm Battle Pistol Grip............................................................$25
**Midwest Industries Rail...............................................................$140
**XS Night Sights..........................................................................$120
**Magpul Angled Fore Grip (AFG)...................................................$30
**Tapco G2 Trigger.......................................................................$35
**Krebs Custom Hammer and Trigger Retainer Plate.......................$15
**Famous AK74 Muzzle Break........................................................$00
I will include 8 Bulgarian Circle 10 magazines if the offer is right. These are $50 each, straight from KVAR. That's $400 worth of magazines alone!

I also have a full spam can of 5.45x39 ammo (1080) rounds!

So, with the upgrades and the magazines, that's a total of $965 just by themselves!
Now you can see how much I have put into this rifle. Like I said, I will be just fine keeping this rifle and letting it increase in value. 

Like I said, it has been upgraded to an AK Enthusiasts Dream. 

I'm not putting pictures up, only because I want people to respond that are genuinely interested. If you think you want to fork up the cash, or have an item I have listed below, please let me know and I will text you photos. I will only send pictures to those who have either the cash, or the items I want. I'm not wasting my time nor yours! Leave your number in your email and I will respond ASAP."

This is a Ducks Unlimited edition version of the gun. I'm not sure how many of these were made, but it is essentially the same as the standard model but it has the DU logo engraved in the receiver.

Good all purpose shotgun for any hunting from dove and quail to duck or deer. I have had this gun for the last two seasons and has been a great dove and quail gun when I feel like going with the side by side double barrel. Sometimes its just fun to go with the old timer guns! I have to many shotguns and need other things, so I'm getting rid of it. It functions perfectly and is fun to shoot. The gun is clean and in good condition.

The only problem I have had with it was some minor stock damage. I hit the ground with the butstock and broke a small piece of the wood off. I glued the piece back on, sanded it down, and stained it and now you can barely tell.

I thought someday it may become something unique following the expired assault ban. I have noticed through the years several other types of the AR pistols have become available on the market. 

The latest Type 97S offered by Bushmaster has a ribbed hand guard, whereas this one is smooth. There are other variants of the Bushmaster pistol without hand guards, and one without the lower rails. These were offered for less money.

Before posting this Bushmaster for sale I searched Gunbroker to see the latest offerings and prices. I searched other websites offering these Bushmaster pistols for sale and haven’t been successful. Not in stock and no back order. My best guess is if you want a Bushmaster 97S pistol like mine you are likely to buy one here on Armslist or another auction.

I believe I priced this one $100 below all other listings for a quick sale. I am asking $999. If you can find one in stock at a lower price please send me the link to verify and I will let the Bushmaster go for that price once verified.

I will include 5 new 20 round magazines with the 30 round factory magazine for the right price. Again this is new unfired and flawless.

She don't even know I bought the Ruger LCR 357magnum, ah f**k my life I tell ya. Any way this is a stainless Ruger sp101 357 magnum with badger boot grips. I am the 2nd owner and I shot this thing 20 times at the range. The original owner is a friend of mine and he shot it a few times and that is it. You can have it for $500 and not a penny less.

As usual, you must be a Illinois resident with VALID foid card and sign bill of sale. NO CHICAGO SALES, any other town in Cook county is fine. I will sell all day long to any town in Cook county except for Chicago. I do not trust any politician or law enforcement officer or any powers to be in Chicago.

Colt Government rimfire models are dedicated .22 L.R.s, but they're engineered in true replica form with fully functioning thumb and grip safeties and the 1911's authentic half-cock mechanism. Grips and sights can be interchanged with a skeleton trigger, combat-style sights, beavertail grip safety, extended thumb safety, and a commander-style hammer.you can reach me here my cell phone number is 6317147157 and my email is jennysieting54@live.com

The lower is a Colt Match Target that was bough during the AWB in 2004 and I have been the only owner. The lower has been stripped apart and put back together again using 100% magpul Furniture. The stock and butter tub are commercial spec with a H3 buffer and spring. The lower has the following items on it, BGV-MK46 adjustable pistol grip (with all the extra parts), ASAP® - Ambidextrous Sling Attachment Point, B.A.D. Lever ® - Battery Assist Device – AR15/M16, MOE ® Carbine Stock – Commercial-Spec Model, MOE® Trigger Guard, Polymer – AR15/M16. 
The lower has minor handling marks, couple very minor ""chips"" by the magwell, these hardly be seen unless you are looking for them. 

The upper is a LWRC M6A2™ that is 16.1 inches in length in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories 

The upper has 1500 rounds though it, there is minor wear on the upper rail where a ecotech was mounted and on the dust cover. 

Included in this is 2550+ rounds of virgin unfired brass. Both ammo boxes have over 1000 rounds in them, I did a rough count and there was 1100+/- rounds in each box. This is a mix of 55 and 65 grain PCM ammo (65 grain has a green strip around it). There is also 500 rounds of American Eagle 5.56 x 45 64gr Tracer (two boxes are opened due to being loaded in mags). One 50 round (50 grain) ballistic tip Ultramax. 

7 various condition GI mags 

Due to the current political climate this weapon has to be transferred through a FFL. 

If local I will pay for the transfer. 

Shipping is $40 for the rifle to your FFL, the ammo will depend on where and how fast you want it. 

I will accept personnel check and money order (needs 10 days to clear for both). If local 

I will accept cash.

This is a full sized .22 revolver with a 4 inch barrel.  It is in excellent condition with all bluing intact.  Many years a go, the nylon block that pushes on the hammer broke.  It sat for many years.  Finally, I got a new strut-spring-block assembly from Numrich Arms and fixed it.  It works well now.  This is a good revolver for new shooters as it handles easily and is safe.  I got it so I could shoot anything from BB caps to long rifle stingers.  It is more versatile than a .22 automatic.  You can shoot shorts, cb caps, or  bbcaps quietly for practice just about anywhere (except the living room).  You could also use .22 birdshot in it on small fast pests.  It would be good for concealed carry training or for someone uncomfortable with recoil or noise.  It shoots double or single action, meaning you can simply pull the trigger or cock the hammer first to fire.  

Would consider trade for small .22 auto with cash or Nano, Glock 30SF, S&W M&P or Springfield XDS (not in .40) and I'll add cash."

The gun has night sights and Hogue grips. The gun comes with all of the original booklets, hard shell case, and 3 - 8 round stainless magazines, and 20 rounds of full metal jacket ammunition.

I bought the gun a year ago off of the original owner (My Brother) and have only fired about 100-150 rounds through it. I am in absolute LOVE with this firearm but my job has done away with allowing us to carry a .45 cal on duty. I don't have the money to buy a new gun so I need to sell or trade the one that I have, unfortunately.

The P220® ST is the all-stainless version of the legendary P220 - one of ""the most accurate 45s right out of the box."" The added weight of an all-stainless frame provides greater recoil reduction and a quicker return to target between shots.

The P220 Stainless features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and stainless frame with an M1913 Picatinny rail. The P220 Stainless also features the SIG SAUER® four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector.

Up for sale here is one of my Glock 26 Gen 4's... Ended up getting one that already had some aftermarket work done on it, so this stock one is up for grabs.

It HAS been a carry gun, and as such does show some wear... Nothing horrible, but I wanted people to know this was NOT a brand new gun. Please look the pictures over.

Pistol has had around 150 rounds through it.

Will include everything pictured... 2 Magazines, Backstraps, Lock, Box, and Paperwork.

No Trades @ this time...

Price is 525... But I'm open to reasonable offers.

Beretta 92F Compact 9mm with (1) 13rd mag and (1) 10rd mag. Extremely reliable self defense/conceal carry firearm. Both mags have the finger extension. The 92 Compact will accept standard high capacity mags as well. High capacity 92 mags will stick out of mag well approximately 1/2"". This compact has the short 4.1"" barrel/slide and the short frame (approx. 1/2"" shorter than full size frame). This handgun does not have a mark on it. I do not know the round count. By it's condition, I would guess less that a few hundred rounds, if that. I acquired it used and it has been a safe queen since I purchase it. The blue hard case is not the original for this gun. It is a Beretta USA hard case and this is an Italian manufactured Beretta. These original Italian manufactured 92 Compacts  do not come around to often. So if your collection lacks a 92 compact, this one warrants serious consideration. Please review the photos and email me your questions.

My safe is out of room so I have my .22 pistols at my cousins. Unfortanately the pic you are seeing is my 992 and my sr22 but I will get the one for sale up in a pic soon as he was confused or lazy since he just sent an old pic of my guns. The one for sale is a 4 inch barrel brand new and of course looks just like the one in the pic minus 2 inches. My wife is just not into it. It is heavy so there is no felt recoil and it shoots exactly like a regular SA/DA revolver. The Cylinders change out in a matter of seconds and shoot perfect with magnum or LR. 9 rounds is a lot easier to load in this than the sr22 although the SR is a great pistol you cannot load it nearly as fast and you cannot shoot magnum rounds or snake shot out of it. As has happened with me this will become your favorite plinking gun you own. Ok got the pic of the real gun for sale as I he could not send a pic I remembered I had one. Oregon ID and Bil of sale or trade required. Prefer you have a concealed permit as I am not good at cropping pics you can see I have a washington county oregon concealed handgun license. Prefer the same but Legal Oregon DL ok.
