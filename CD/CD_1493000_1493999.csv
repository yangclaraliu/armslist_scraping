- Close quarters work requires split second target acquisition and aiming. The AR-332 delivers on both fronts with its unique Ballistic/CQTM lighted reticle which can be adjusted to match any lighting condition day or night. For daylight operation, choose the high contrast black reticle for precision aiming out to 600 yards, or switch to red or green for better contrast and faster targeting. Like all Burris optics, the AR-332 is waterproof and built to last. Multi-coated lenses reduce glare and ensure brighter images. Lightweight and compact, it comes with integrated lens covers and a Picatinny rail mounting bracket. It also easily mounts on an AR carry handle. This Close Quarters reticle performs at long range with proven Ballistic Plex style drop compensation. It includes integrated lens covers, multicoated lenses and a Picatinny rail mounting bracket.

I built a damn nice rifle with these, put 3 or 4 mags through it, and then it just sat. Ended up buying a AR10/Mega Maten so parted this out for cash to buy a good set of optics. I don't care what the MSRP for these are, good luck getting your hands on them anywhere! These are made of billet, and are some of the best on the market. Lastly, don't show up pick them up and try offering me a lower amount. It happened on my last meet, and I'll just leave you standing there empty handed.

Don't expect a new gun here. It is accurate, in decent shape, zinc frame, and just a cheap fun revolver.  Not a safe queen, it has been shot, but is still pretty accurate and loads of fun.  No recoil at all.  Lockup is as tight as it was from the factory, which is not very.  22 mag is the more accurate cylinder.  This gun is perfect for a beater gun, fun gun, first gun for your kid, or to teach your wife how to shoot.  Single action, 5 inch barrel and laminated birds head grips.  Has both cylinders.

The first 500 models produced were stamped on the frame with 1 of 500.

I bought this new in 2011 for $1050 + tax/shipping then I added Crimson Trace Grips ($350)

I have put 20 rounds though it exactly, then I cleaned and stored it.

As expected with this quality of handgun, it functioned FLAWLESSLY.

This is built on a forged slide and forged frame, with a stainless steel match barrel, and the parts are to the same level of detail as Springfield’s TRP and Trophy Match models. 
The slide, frame and barrel are fitted as their high-dollar match pistols, but with an absolute level of reliability.

Comes with everything you see, original papers, box and magazines (ammo not included)
Also including the ""Sight Mark, bore sight system that I bought to perfect the alignment of Crimson Trace laser sight.

I would take: 
Part trade and cash; two handguns that would equal my value, or all cash!
This 1911 is worth MORE than I have in it which is ~$1500...so if you are not 
interested in my value...please don't respond...buy one somewhere else. thanks...

A Charging Handle for the 21st Century Gun Fighter
A NEW Charging Handle and Extended Latch System
Charging Handle Machined from 7075 T6 Billet
Hard Coat Anodized per Mil-A-8625F, Type III, Class 2
GFH - Mod3 (large latch) and Mod4 (medium latch)


When the AR15 system was first introduced to and fielded by the US Military in the 1960s, the manual of arms for an infantryman was significantly different than what currently exists today.  To charge the rifle the shooter released their hand from a firing grip, grabbed each side of the charging handle with the thumb and forefinger or the first two fingers , (while applying pressure to the latch) pulled the charging handle all the way to the rear, and then released it to charge the weapon. 
Like everything else in the last 45 years, tactics and weaponry have undergone a continuous evolution.  Red dot optics get the shooter on target quicker, shorter barrels allow the operator to more quickly negotiate tighter urban areas, and operator’s manipulations of the weapon system have become much more efficient and faster.  The current manual of arms has the operator maintaining a firing grip almost continuously while manipulating the weapon with the non-dominant hand in an effort to more quickly get the weapon ready to fire.  With that premise, most weapon manipulations are done only with the shooter’s support hand; to include operating the charging handle. 
In order to perform an immediate action or charge the carbine, current CQB techniques have the operator racking the charging handle to the rear using their support side hand only.  This is done in one swift and strong movement.  With the operator’s firing grip maintained, the weapon again has a loaded chamber, and the shooter can immediately bring a hot weapon back into the fight.

The current use of extended tactical latches has made this movement much more efficient.  The only drawback to this type of manipulation is all the force used to rack the charging handle rearward goes into the extended tactical latch and is then transferred into the roll pin.  With this scenario, the entire operation becomes contingent on the sheer strength of this tiny 1/16” roll pin, and its’ ability to take continuing blows.  Repeated and forceful support hand only racking of the charging handle eventually can lead to breaking the roll pin and loosing the latch completely.  With the latch blown out, the charging handle will not stay secured to the receiver as the bolt is moving back and forth during each cycle of the weapon’s action.  Not a good situation on a two way range.

We have been very fortunate to receive continuing feedback from trainers and operators alike for several years now regarding these issues.   Internally we have seen this many times while in the course of continually test firing weapons before sale.  Initially we matched up a couple prototype solutions, but in conversations with Eric at VLTOR, he was able to develop a better design at a better price for the consumer.    (VLTOR patent pending)

Introducing the BCMGUNFIGHTER™
(VLTOR Patent Pending)
The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle and extended latches feature internal redesigns to direct the force off of the roll pin and into the body of the charging handle during support hand only manipulations.  This new design has a built in backstop engineered into the extended latch and into the charging handle.  As the latch is opened up, its’ travel is limited by these flat surface backstops.  With this travel limiting feature, the stress is taken off the roll pin, and is now redirected into the entire body of the charging handle.
The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages. 
1.  Since the tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point - it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation.
2.  With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side.  A much smoother operation.

On the cutaway computer drawings you can see the inside machining of the latch.  It shows the 3 inside contact surfaces.  (The 2 semi circular cuts are to aid in the removal of dirt and debris that can get inside the handle.) 


On the bottom view you can see the outside of the latch itself.  It is actually as thick as the handle.  This provides 2 additional contact surfaces to insure the force is maintained inside the handle and offers the operator more contact surface to manipulate the handle."

A Charging Handle for the 21st Century Gun Fighter
A NEW Charging Handle and Extended Latch System
Charging Handle Machined from 7075 T6 Billet
Hard Coat Anodized per Mil-A-8625F, Type III, Class 2
GFH - Mod3 (large latch) and Mod4 (medium latch)


When the AR15 system was first introduced to and fielded by the US Military in the 1960s, the manual of arms for an infantryman was significantly different than what currently exists today.  To charge the rifle the shooter released their hand from a firing grip, grabbed each side of the charging handle with the thumb and forefinger or the first two fingers , (while applying pressure to the latch) pulled the charging handle all the way to the rear, and then released it to charge the weapon. 


Like everything else in the last 45 years, tactics and weaponry have undergone a continuous evolution.  Red dot optics get the shooter on target quicker, shorter barrels allow the operator to more quickly negotiate tighter urban areas, and operator’s manipulations of the weapon system have become much more efficient and faster.  The current manual of arms has the operator maintaining a firing grip almost continuously while manipulating the weapon with the non-dominant hand in an effort to more quickly get the weapon ready to fire.  With that premise, most weapon manipulations are done only with the shooter’s support hand; to include operating the charging handle. 
In order to perform an immediate action or charge the carbine, current CQB techniques have the operator racking the charging handle to the rear using their support side hand only.  This is done in one swift and strong movement.  With the operator’s firing grip maintained, the weapon again has a loaded chamber, and the shooter can immediately bring a hot weapon back into the fight.

The current use of extended tactical latches has made this movement much more efficient.  The only drawback to this type of manipulation is all the force used to rack the charging handle rearward goes into the extended tactical latch and is then transferred into the roll pin.  With this scenario, the entire operation becomes contingent on the sheer strength of this tiny 1/16” roll pin, and its’ ability to take continuing blows.  Repeated and forceful support hand only racking of the charging handle eventually can lead to breaking the roll pin and loosing the latch completely.  With the latch blown out, the charging handle will not stay secured to the receiver as the bolt is moving back and forth during each cycle of the weapon’s action.  Not a good situation on a two way range.

We have been very fortunate to receive continuing feedback from trainers and operators alike for several years now regarding these issues.   Internally we have seen this many times while in the course of continually test firing weapons before sale.  Initially we matched up a couple prototype solutions, but in conversations with Eric at VLTOR, he was able to develop a better design at a better price for the consumer.    (VLTOR patent pending)

Introducing the BCMGUNFIGHTER™
(VLTOR Patent Pending)
The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle and extended latches feature internal redesigns to direct the force off of the roll pin and into the body of the charging handle during support hand only manipulations.  This new design has a built in backstop engineered into the extended latch and into the charging handle.  As the latch is opened up, its’ travel is limited by these flat surface backstops.  With this travel limiting feature, the stress is taken off the roll pin, and is now redirected into the entire body of the charging handle.
The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages. 
1.  Since the tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point - it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation.
2.  With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side.  A much smoother operation.

On the cutaway computer drawings you can see the inside machining of the latch.  It shows the 3 inside contact surfaces.  (The 2 semi circular cuts are to aid in the removal of dirt and debris that can get inside the handle.) 

On the bottom view you can see the outside of the latch itself.  It is actually as thick as the handle.  This provides 2 additional contact surfaces to insure the force is maintained inside the handle and offers the operator more contact surface to manipulate the handle."

CTR® Carbine Stock – Mil-Spec

COLOR: Black

The Magpul CTR (Compact/Type Restricted) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

Made in U.S.A.

The MP40 is in fact a simplified MP38. It was never the idea to create a complete new model. Most parts of the MP40 were modified during its four years of production. I feel that, from a design perspective, the MP38 is far more interesting than the MP40 however the MP40 is from a production perspective far more interesting. Basically the production methods of the MP40 were revolutionary in the arms industry. Never before subcontractors were used at such a large scale as with the production of the MP40. Apart from this revolutionary production concept also the methods of production changed dramatically. Where the larger parts of the MP38 consisted completely of machined parts the larger parts of the MP40 only had the barrel and the bold machined."

CTR® Carbine Stock – Mil-Spec

COLOR: Flat Dark Earth (FDE)

The Magpul CTR (Compact/Type Restricted) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

The sporting tradition, American history and good ol’ fashioned quality craftsmanship come together in this big-bore rifle built to celebrate a legacy that began in 1871. Modeled after the Frank Wesson tip-up rifles that were first made in Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1850s. Chambered for the 45-70 Gov't. cartridge, this rifle reflects true 19th century styling with antique color case hardening on the frame and a crescent butt plate. Its handsome American walnut stocks and fore-ends are accentuated by cut checkering.

Traditional styling and aiming stability were foremost in its design. Offered in 45-70 Gov’t., its 32"" midweight barrel helps this big-bore cartridge develop full velocity and accuracy potential. It also provides the necessary sighting radius for long-range matches. The Williams receiver sight is complemented by a traditional globe-style target front sight with eight aperture inserts.

Classic Feel, Modern Design. No other 22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger® 22/45™ pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol.

In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting, the 22/45 is available in a variety of configurations and barrel lengths, each with the same trusted reliability that Ruger has delivered since 1949.

I currently have two AR15's (Both 5.56) and I am looking to get rid of one for a really nice CCW.  I am only looking to get rid of one and I am willing to include any accessories I have to get the deal done.  First of all the guns:

I have a brand new in box FACTORY DPMS AR15 never fired with everything it came with from the factory.  Still has its $999.99 price tag on it.  It has an ERGO grip, chrome lined 16"" barrel, picatinny rails, 1:7 twist, A2 flash suppressor, brand new 30 round clip (will not seperate this clip from this gun), lock, manual, box and plastic bag.
$1000 (Still has the $999.99 pricetag on it)

Second is a custom made DPMS Upper with a Liberty Tactical lower.  Chrome lined 16"" barrel, Trirail handguard, 1:7 twist, A2 flash suppressor.  Less than 300 rounds through it.
$1100

Acc's I have 
 - Foregrip/Bipod
 - UTG Red/Greed dot in box
 - NC Star Green laser with lanyard
 - Sunoptics 4x scope with trirail
 - Tactical Flashlight
 - UTG Tactical Bag 
 - 1 Brand New PMAG
 - 6 Steel Mags 
 - Speed Loader
 - Army Belt with 2x clip holders (Hold 3x 30 round clips)
 - Couple hundred rounds steel ammo

I am only interested in trading for a Kimber .45 compact, or $1200 cash.  No my guns aren't worth $1200 but with acc's we can get to the $1200 mark.  I am also open to an XDM but it will take cash or another gun on your part.  These are really the only deals I am open to as I need a new CCW.  I'll take the $1200 as a friend has what I really want but hes not open to trades and needs $1200.  If you have the right Kimber I am willing to throw money in but not more than $200.  Also NOT willing to trade both guns.  I am super easy to deal with.  If I'm not interested, I will politely let you know.

I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK MY GUNS ARE WORTH OR WHERE YOU CAN GET THEM CHEAPER!!!!!  SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME YOU WON'T GET A RESPONSE!!!"
