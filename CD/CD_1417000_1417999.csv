This .45 is latest to be added to Glocks conceal carry line. This is latest glock to come out and very hard to find (it took me along time to hunt this one down).This glock has been in the works sonce gen 3 but was completed after the release of gen 4 so it has a gen 3 frame with the new gen 4 recoil system . i switched from the Glock 23 3rd gen to this new 30s. This glock is the size as the compact slim frame G36 but with now with a higher capacity of 10rd instead of 6 rds. I have 100rds of target ammo and 2 boxes of top of the line self defense rounds (the self defense rounds are roughly $2 a round before this ammo insanity, no lead 100% copper and 2,000sq ft per sec). This pistol has only had 30rds threw it, a 3.5lb ghost trigger, 3-10rd glock mags and 1-22rd extended mag. So I am looking for a quality .40 caliber semi auto pistol. Mine is excellent condition with extras and would like the same please. I've got over $1000 in this pistol so please no low ballers with lower end pistols. If u have a glock I would need roughly the same extras or cash ur end to compensate. I'd really like a HK USP 40 straight across if one is out there. . Best response please text REDACTED I only check my emails once a day, if this ad is still posted the glock is still available. Thank u"

Ruger Mini-30 7.62x39 Semi Auto rifle. It's like an M1 Carbine that shoots the AK round.

Comes with both the factory original wood stock, and a modified ATI stock. The ATI stock is made for the Mini-14, which has a smaller magazine well. I had to use a dremel to shave and widen the stock's magazine well to fit the Mini-30 stock. It could use some smoothing down but it accommodates the magazines fine and works without a hitch.

I also have a 4x scope with its own rail, a detachable flash suppressor, a mounted Accu-Strut, a 5-round Ruger magazine, and two 10-round after market magazines.

It's a great rifle, light and handy, and very modular. I travel to New York a lot where the ATI stock and the flash suppressor are illegal. The flash suppressor is detachable, and it's easy to swap the stocks back to the factory stock, which makes it legal to have there and in other communist states. This rifle is legal in all 50 states and in Washington DC.

I would prefer face-to-face deals. Just show me identification and sign a bill of sale and it's yours.

I'm open to trades, but at this point I'm only really looking for an AK or AR, preferably an AK seeing as I already have the correct ammo. I don't have any photos right now, contact me and I'll send you some."

For sale is my practically new Colt LE6720.  These are the hard to find lightweight barrel versions of the Colt LE6920.  Lighter and more balanced than a standard Colt AR and very fun to shoot (if you can afford to these days).  This rifle has had only 90 rds shot thru it...when you see it in person you will see it is like new.  I have the original box, Colt manual and standard stuff it comes with (cleaning rods/bore/barrel brushes, sling, (2) 20rd NIP black P-Mags w/dust covers, buttstock sling attachment).  Also comes with the following upgrades:

- Troy Industries FDE 7 inch 2 pc quad rail
- Troy Industries black ambidextrious bolt release (like the Magpul BAD, battery assist device)
- Fab Defense FDE magwell grip
- Magpul FDE MIAD adjustable grip w/storage
- Magpul FDE polymer MOE enhanced trigger guard
- Magpul FDE mil-spec MOE adjustable 4 position carbine buttstock
- Magpul FDE MOE MBUS rear back-up sight
- Otis multi-caliber cleaning kit w/tan case (7.62/5.56/9MM/.41-.45 Cal & 12 GA)
- Midwest Industries ambidextrious single point sling adapter plate (slides over buffer tube, can be removed w/allen wrench)
- Sightmark Sure Shot Reflex Sight, matte black, rail mount
- Black rubber rail covers in various lengths for quad rail
- Sight adjustment tool for front sight post
- Plano model 10586 Double Gun hard carrying case with foam
- 17 additional magazines as follows:
  -- 5 NIP Magpul black 30 rd P-Mags, Gen M3, w/dust covers
  -- 1 NIP Magpul black 30 rd P-Mag, Gen M2, no dust cover 
  -- 2 new, not in package FDE 30 rd P-Mags, w/dust covers
  -- 6 used black 30 rd P-Mags, windowed, no dust covers
  -- 3 NIP RMB polymer 30 rd magazines w/dust covers
- 806 rounds of 5.56/.223 as follows:
  -- 680 rds of boxed PMC 55 grain brass FMJ .223
  -- 40 rds of boxed Independence 55 grain brass FMJ 5.56
  -- 40 rds of boxed TulAmmo 55 grain steel cased FMJ .223
  -- 36 rds of loose Lake City stamped green tip 5.56 mil surplus penetrators
  -- 10 rds of loose Winchester 55 grain brass FMJ .223

I have original boxes/packaging and receipts for just about everything.  Includes all stock parts I removed as well (stock grip, buttstock, plastic handguards, rail mounted 200-600M flip up rear sight).

I paid well over $3600 for everything listed/in pics....best REASONABLE offer gets this package deal.  I need the money to fund a motorcycle project.  

Please don't bother w/unrealistic offers, they will be deleted....the stock rifle alone was over $1800 w/tax.  This is a factory Colt rifle, not a garage build or low end DPMS/Bushmaster.  

I will only sell to CO ID card holders or military w/orders (CO Concealed Handgun Permit holders preferred).  You must be willing to sign a bill of sale for my records that states by signing it you are legal to own a firearm in CO.  This is a cash only deal, I need the $$, not your trade.

The 3X Magnifier screws into the internal threads of the PVS-14 or PVS-7 objective lens or snaps onto the objective of the MUM when coupled with the MUM/ MiNi-14 Magnifier Adapter.

The USGI 3X Magnifier is a great accessory that increases the versatility of your night vision monocular. We recommend using the magnifier when the monocular is employed in a weapon-mounted or hand-held surveillance mode. It can be run while head-mounted, but we do not recommend this for several reasons. First, trying to negotiate terrain while maintaining situational awareness with a magnified night vision optic on your head is difficult at best and dangerous at worst. Secondly, the added weight and cantilevered distance will more quickly fatigue your neck and back. However, the 3X Magnifier excels in its other roles and should be a staple accessory for anyone employing a night vision monocular. will take trades for it.

323,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1417323,For Sale:  Sauer 38H / Nazi marked / RIG,"Santa Cruz, CA, California, United States",$ 800,"Listed On: Monday, April 8, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"All OEM item.  Gun, holster, two clips.  One broken Bakelite plate.  This single part can be purchased for around 100.00  All else in in great shape considering this item is over 75 years old.   Detailed info about the rig from Wikipedia : The Sauer 38H or often just H was a small semi-automatic pistol made in Nazi Germany from 1938 until just after the end of World War II by J. P. Sauer & Sohn, then based in Suhl, Germany. The ""H"" in the model number denotes ""hammerless""—the pistol uses an internal hammer.
Development

Sauer developed the model 38H from their earlier semi-automatic handguns. It was necessary to compete with companies such as Mauser and Walther in the commercial market. However, with the outbreak of the war, most pistols went to various German police agencies. These pistols were stamped by those agencies and some can still be found with the holster and additional magazine with which they were distributed. Sauer 38H pistols presented to Nazi officials often featured custom engraving, ivory grips, and often gold inlay as well. For example, in September 2004, the Rock Island Auction Company sold a Sauer 38H, serial number 363573, that belonged to Sepp Dietrich for $43,125.00.

The Sauer 38H was produced in three basic models. Generally, the slide of the first model says ""JP Sauer und Sohn"" on the left. The second version says only ""CAL 7.65"", and the third version omits the safety and the cocking/decocking lever. Towards the end of the war, weapons produced were simplified for quicker, cheaper production. For the 38H, this meant simpler markings, rough finish, and the elimination of features like the slide-mounted safety. So-called ""late-war"" models were still fully functional though. Final examples, produced until April 1945 when the factory was overrun by the Allies, feature mismatched serial numbers and poor fit and finish.

The spirit of the Sauer 38H lives on in the SIG Sauer P232 and its predecessor the P230, which also feature a fixed barrel, decocking lever, and similar internal design. As a testament to their fine design, many Sauer 38Hs are regularly used by owners to this day, albeit usually with replacement grips.
Design details

The ""H"" in the model number indicates this pistol uses a shrouded hammer as opposed to striker style firing of earlier Sauer models. Other features included a traditional double action trigger, single-column magazine and an action spring surrounding a fixed barrel. A revolutionary feature was the first use of a lever that either cocked or decocked the hammer safely. The hammer on the Sauer 38H could be lowered for safe carry at any time. The cocking feature was necessary due to the shrouded hammer and the decocking mechanism was a safety feature. A hollow space on the trigger indicated if the concealed hammer was cocked; if completely exposed, the hammer was lowered. A small pin protruded at the rear of the slide as a loaded chamber indicator. Another advanced feature for its time was the magazine safety, a device that deactivates the trigger when the magazine is removed from the pistol. Almost all modern pistols manufactured by SIG Sauer today feature a decocking lever, including the highly successful SIG P226 family. Most modern SIG Sauer pistols feature controls in almost the same place as on the Sauer 38H.

The grips of the pistol were constructed of Bakelite. Age often results in the cracking and crumbling of the grips on surviving examples. All original grips featured ""SUS"" lettering standing for ""Sauer und Sohn"" which could be found on the same side of the pistol as the magazine release though many reproduction grips have copied this logo. It is unusual for a present-day example to have original, undamaged grips.

The Sauer 38H was produced mainly for the .32 ACP cartridge, however some rare examples were also made in .380 ACP and .22 LR. The model 38H was used by German armed forces such as the Luftwaffe, as well as police forces in numbers nearly equal to the Walther PPK. The Sauer 38H was produced for military, police, and the commercial market."

1. Weapon fires, but does not extract brass *most* of the time.

Easily mounted on the magazine tube of most popular 12-gauge pump shotguns, the Tri-Rail takes up under 1.5 inches of space ahead of the forearm. Made of tough aircraft grade aluminum with a matte black anodized finish, the Tri-Rail attaches in minutes with two machine screws.

info off web site:
The Safariland Model 6280 holster is the base model of Self Locking System (SLS™) series of holsters. It includes a unique rotating hood design. This holster also features a Universal Belt Loop that mounts on a 2"" or 2.25"" Duty Belt. With no snap, the Safariland 6280 holster’s SLS™ design allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The 6280 holster features a tensioning device, which, when firmly adjusted becomes a Level III Retention™ holster.

They are not going down anytime soon. Ammo is back ordered for months. 
The big retailers are selling it for .20 cents around and up for .22 lr and it last online for 2 minutes if you are lucky. 
Gunbroker prices are .13 cents a round and up plus shipping. Cases of 5000 are hitting $700 plus shipping on there. 
Its like everything else no one wants it when its cheap but when it goes up everyone wants it. And you want to bitch about the people that planned ahead?
Take gold for an example in 2005 it was under 600 a oz then it went to 1000/oz then 2000/oz. So someone bought it in 2005 at 600 today its worth around 1600 so the people that invested in it should sell it for 600? I dont think anyone is that stupid. Same thing with stocks and other goods. Are you going to sell your house for less than its worth because someone wants it for half price?
 Ammo is going to keep going up. Starting in january 2014 you will have to do a background check to purchase it and your purchase will be put in a state data base.
 Do you think a dealer is going to spend time doing a check and not want extra for his time? Not gonna happen. 
 You wont be able to order online unless it gets shipped to a dealer for a background check. And at $3.80 a gallon for gas are you going to drive out of state to look for ammo? It will cost you more than most prices on here. Unless you live on the boarder and places in PA are already not selling ammo if you are from NY. And they dont have it in stock. The whole east coast is out of stock NY to Florida. 
lets face the facts this country is going down the drain. We lose rights everyday by the people some of us voted in. It was all about ""CHANGE"" Yeah the change to a non free socialist country.
I dont like the prices either but Im buying when I can. For a little extra I know I have ammo to protect my family. 
 What are you going to do when the food supply gets cut off because we dont do what big brother wants? You going to stop looters with a empty gun? You going to stand by and watch criminals  take the stuff you earned and assult your wife and children? Possibly die bitching and being stubborn about a few cents more a round?
 Most of the sellers here are offering life insurance at a little higher price than normal. Whats the cost of not having it?
Wake up people the america we knew is no longer here. Its only getting worst. If they get the 2nd they will take the rest from us. 
Sorry to rant, but the ammo price crying is getting old. If you dont like the prices of the ammo ads dont read them.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench. [It is currently priced at $899 MSRP from ATI]

ANECDOTAL:
Broker—While I liked the smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy – I thought the stock and grip too small and a bit awkward.

Mac—The good news for my friend is that Xtreme is designing a completely USA crafted AK with an adjustable stock (that’s a story for another day).

Deacon—The all American AK has been a long time coming. Since enactment of Bubba’s infamous assault weapons ban, perfectly good weapons have been mutilated overseas, stripped of the essentials and imported piecemeal to be rebuilt with selected U.S. components to make superior or inferior rifles depending on what side of the argument you choose to take. Having fired Soviet Bloc milled units in the past, I was pleased to see this rifle introduced by Xtreme Mfg.
The inherent greatness of the AK has been its low cost of manufacture, the simplicity of the machines needed to stamp out the parts by the score and readily field a combat ready weapon. Tolerances are loose by design and while this built in “rattle” provides us with a weather proof rifle, it also leaves us wanting for accuracy. The 7.62 X 39mm round has been badly maligned as being inaccurate. It ain’t the round, it’s the marriage of receiver, bolt and chamber that seats the round, properly spaces the projectile and preps it for our hands to send on its way. I have a friend in the North East who has been hunting deer for years

Broker: While I liked the Xtreme's smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy, I thought the stock and grip were too small and awkward.

with what he calls “Russian rounds” from a Savage bolt action with a Douglas Barrel he had chambered for the 39mm. He takes a ribbing for using the stuff but everyone enjoys his venison stew and that’s where the laughter stops.
It seems from all objective results that Xtreme has tightened tolerances and given us a solid receiver that will shoot on par with any AR upper chambered in the same round. If they pass on importing foreign furniture and sights and build entirely from U.S. components we’ll all benefit.
Made in America. You have to love that. Sure there is room for improvement but the folks at Extreme are listening to the guys in the field and tweaking as I write.Gun Reports Home >> Special Reports

I have a lightly used New PSA 16'' M4 Style AR-15 Carbine for sale. It is in amazing condition and has been upgraded and slightly modified for ergonomics, increased shootability, and increased ascetics. Many people have been trying to sell their PSA that cost around 900 bucks for 1400 with nothing but a booklet saying it’s new but that is a bit of a rip off. I am not trying to make money here as after you read everything listed here you will see that I have ACTUALLY invested quite a bit into this! This has seen a very low round count and the bolt carrier group has been kept quite lubed and clean. Only brought to the range once and put around 90 rounds through (3 mags worth). I love the gun and I have had it for a couple months but unfortunately there is a baby on the way (even have to get rid of the corvette!!), so I am not selling it to just get rid of it.
I got a bit of enamel Flat Tan/Beige and did some letting fill in on the lower receiver. I also did the coloring for the safety/fire selector pictorials. Came out fairly well and gives the gun a great look. I have had several compliments about it but that is mainly a personal preference when it comes to ascetic additions like this.

Included upgrades/mods:

- PA-15 5.56x45 AR-15 Rife + Factory 30 Rd Green Follower Mag (More spec below – FN Barrel!!)
- x5 Extra New C-Defense Stainless Steel 30 Rd Orange Follower Magazines
- Upgraded Charge Handle Lever [Extra Wide Lever to aid in pulling handle – Big Difference]
- Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 3-9x40 Riflescope w/3.3 Eye Relief [Great Scope + Awesome Ratings and quite clear when on high power]
- Warne Scope MAXIMA Series Rings
- Blackhawk AR-15 Flat Top Riser Rail to accommodate Scope mounting due to front sight
- Caldwell AR Prone Bipod [Looks great, Low Profile, and Pivots as well]
- AB Arms AR-MOD1 Hand Guard [Extremely Unique and Very Ergonomic for standing shooting – Never seen anyone else with one but the reviews are quite great – Check out Youtube] **Also comes with MIL Spec picatinny rail inserts that go into any of the slots you see in the pictures below. Quite nice so if you want to add a light 45 degrees you can. 
- Handmade Paracord Sling [Fits Well and Very Adjustable/Comfortable]
- Upgraded to Double Oval LT/RT Sling adapter on AR-15 Buffer Tube
- Decent OD Green tactical style padded case [Was inexpensive but lots of room for mags and quite the amount of soft cotton style padding]
- RARE TO BE INCLUDED – 300 Rounds of 5.56/.223 ammo that is preloaded into nice plastic 100 RD Cases.
- Magpul upgraded trigger guard in FDE color to match the lower receiver lettering [This was ordered a few days ago so it is in the mail – Thought I was going to be able to keep the weapon]
- Strike Industries Suppressor STYLE Barrel Shroud [Not real but this is the best one that is avail. Includes factory threaded end to put a muzzle brake on the end as well. I choose to just keep the threaded barrel cap on the end – This does not add any suppressing functionality or any length to barrel. Very sturdy and quite well made]
- Factory Muzzle Brake included [Can easily be put back on]
- Gun Stock extra Mag Pouch [This does fit well on the AR adjustable stock – Just recently took off]

**I have all the original boxes except a couple that I purchased online that had no box. I am slightly OCD about my stuff so I typically keep everything very tidy and in excellent condition.

More about the PSA AR-15 – **Side note** This gun is fairly inexpensive for a complete AR-15 compared to some companies out there but it is very underrated. In particular, a lot of people do not realize that the barrel has all the higher end features that $1300+ ARs have like the chrome lined parts, FN Manufactured Barrel [Their Quality control is amazing and the fact that they make a lot of military grade weapons right down the street in Columbia], front gas block pinned/staked site and other internals that are easily overlooked for the price. More specifics below:


This is an M-4 style AR-15 semi-auto rifle with a 16"" chrome molly vanadium FN 5.56 (.223 ) cal Mil Spec barrel The  Barrels on these rifles are made for Palmetto State Armory  by FN Herstal using a proprietary blend chrome molly vanadium.
In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO (.223 compatible), with a 1/7 twist, and a carbine gas system.  Bird cage style comp, collapsible stock and bayonet lug are standard.  This is a flat top optics ready rifle with a forged upper and lower increasing durability.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench. [It is currently priced at $899 MSRP from ATI]

ANECDOTAL:
Broker—While I liked the smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy – I thought the stock and grip too small and a bit awkward.

Mac—The good news for my friend is that Xtreme is designing a completely USA crafted AK with an adjustable stock (that’s a story for another day).

Deacon—The all American AK has been a long time coming. Since enactment of Bubba’s infamous assault weapons ban, perfectly good weapons have been mutilated overseas, stripped of the essentials and imported piecemeal to be rebuilt with selected U.S. components to make superior or inferior rifles depending on what side of the argument you choose to take. Having fired Soviet Bloc milled units in the past, I was pleased to see this rifle introduced by Xtreme Mfg.
The inherent greatness of the AK has been its low cost of manufacture, the simplicity of the machines needed to stamp out the parts by the score and readily field a combat ready weapon. Tolerances are loose by design and while this built in “rattle” provides us with a weather proof rifle, it also leaves us wanting for accuracy. The 7.62 X 39mm round has been badly maligned as being inaccurate. It ain’t the round, it’s the marriage of receiver, bolt and chamber that seats the round, properly spaces the projectile and preps it for our hands to send on its way. I have a friend in the North East who has been hunting deer for years

with what he calls “Russian rounds” from a Savage bolt action with a Douglas Barrel he had chambered for the 39mm. He takes a ribbing for using the stuff but everyone enjoys his venison stew and that’s where the laughter stops.
It seems from all objective results that Xtreme has tightened tolerances and given us a solid receiver that will shoot on par with any AR upper chambered in the same round. If they pass on importing foreign furniture and sights and build entirely from U.S. components we’ll all benefit.
Made in America. You have to love that. Sure there is room for improvement but the folks at Extreme are listening to the guys in the field and tweaking as I write.Gun Reports Home >> Special Reports

The magazine can either be recharged with a Mosin-Nagant's 5-round stripper clips or swapped with another that's fully-loaded.  They were rare, as the Soviet's preferred to equip their grunts with the Mosin.  However, SVT-40s were treasured captures and re-deployed by both Finns and Germans in the wars which saw their use.

This particular SVT-40 was manufactured on the Tula arsenal's machinery in 1943.  A historical curiosity - This manufacture probably occurred at the Izhevsk arsenal, as Tula's machinery had been moved there prior to its city coming under siege by the Germans in 1941.

In 1944, this SVT-40 was put into a beefier AVT stock during a re-arsenaling.  This improvement was common to most of the SVT-40's that have longevity enough to be in our hands today.  Thereby, the rifle I am selling is one of the finest of its kind that I have seen and fired.

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

This is not bulk plinking ammo and isn't priced as such.  Slower speed for better accuracy.  It MAY not cycle as well in your tacticool rifle due to less energy to cycle the bolt (I have not tried this other than in my 10/22 which shoots everything).  It will shrink your groups, however.
