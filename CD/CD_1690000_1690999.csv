And the most I have spent lately was $35 at Vance's for a bulk pack several weeks ago, so that's what I will pay. I've never been so frustrated at something in my life!!!!! I see a guy brag about 1k packs at Walmart, then I see them listed for $100 a piece!!!!! Jesus, a 60+ dollar profit. Stop doing this to fellow shooters.

At the very least could someone let me know if there is some in stock somewhere or when a store stocks it so I could take a day off (wouldn't do it unless I knew for sure I could get it) I'm not even sure where to look anymore. Sucks!!!!!"

The gun shoots either 22 Long or 22 Long Rifle and is in great working order, VERY ACCURATE! I love this gun and hate to get rid of it but I bought a few new guns in the past few months and did agree to sell one to get the new one. ...well I got by now about 2 months and got rid of 1 now I have to get rid of this one. I bought this gun when we first moved here a few years ago and have probably only shot 300 rounds through it since I've had it. I saw it online for $170 and was able to pick it up by itself for $160 which is probably a little more than I should have for a little 22 to go plinking but I do not regret it one bit. I used to shoot one of these when I was younger and like the fact that it is has the wood stock, heavier feel and just reminds you of when you used to shoot as a kid, not like all the new cheap feeling poly stocks. It has a few scratches where it looks like somebody had rested the rifle to shoot and few random scratches here and here but overall is in good shape for an older gun, they were manufactured between 1974-1980. Anyways, I will include the soft case I paid $25 for and 200 Rounds of Ammo- 100 Rounds Winchester T22 and 100 Rounds Remington Target Rounds.

Students should bring a modern functioning handgun with 50 rounds of factory new ammunition and appropriate cleaning supplies for the firearm. Don’t have a handgun, ammo, or supplies? No worries! Get in touch with me and we can work out the details. There is also a $60 fee divided between the state and local police that is normally paid 2-3 weeks after the completion of the course. A criminal background check will be done by the Kentucky State Police after the completion of the course. Due to high volume, it is currently taking up to 5 months after the class for the actual license to be issued by the Kentucky State Police.

Original tacpacl Sig Case, (large, with room for holster, light, extra mag, etc.   
Lock, 
alternate sized replacement grip!  
And More.  

This kit contains every optional SIG goodie anyone could want!  Features the Black Nitro slide.  Has been carefully handled, perfect condition.  Less than 100 rounds fired.  

The SP2022 is a DA/SA with decocker.  No safety, external hammer.  The Sig sp-2022 is said to have the best single action trigger of all the sigs.  This is the same configuration used by military and security professionals around the world.  
This has the larger 12 round mags -- With one in the pipe, and nightsights for when the sun goes down.  

Many SP2022s ship with 10 round mags -- don't get stuck with 10 rounders!   

This is a ready to go Sig Package!  Full tacticool Rig – Ready to defend your own personal homeland, for when the zombies come, or go compete in the shooting sports.  Everything you need except for a belt!  Hell, if you need one, I’ll throw in a belt!  

Sig is renowned for making the finest weapons for mission critical adventures.  Here is your chance to get some!  

I believe you can also change the barrel for 9mm, too.  (this gun doesn’t have the silly “loaded chamber indicator”, so you can use aftermarket barrels.  357Sig?  Maybe! – the magazine are marked 357/40 – I’ve heard you can use the same mags for 9mm, too – but you can do that homework)  

I just purchased this new, took it to the range one time.  I’m really much more of a revolver guy.  I’m not totally desperate, but I really could use the money -- I'm trying to sell some other stuff if, so if that sells, and this doesn't, I may keep it.  Act quickly if you are interested.  Anyway, this gun is a beauty! You have to see it to appreciate.  

Will entertain offers – No offense taken… Want the gun?  Make me an offer!  If your offer is silly-low, so what?  

This has the latest version STL 900L genuine SIG Light/Laser (still BRAND NEW, Still In Box, still sealed in it's little SIG baggy, with a brand new battery) has a built in strobe function, you can select light alone, strobe alone, Laser alone, Light and laser, or strobe and laser.  Finger tip activated momentary or switched on positions.  Pissa!  

Three of the 4 magazines are BRAND-NEW, STILL IN BOX.  One magazine (and gun) has less than 100 rounds thru it.  This is essentially a brand new gun -- If it weren't missing the little SIG wrapper around the grip, you couldn't tell its not a new gun.   

I have several hundred rounds of ammo for this, I originally listed as included, but I removed it to help keep the price appealing.  Maybe 5-600 rounds... if you want it, I'll sell it with the gun for a fair price.  

Local deals only, Cash on the barrel head.  Might consider partial trades, (Maybe a side-by-side, over&under, 22LR/22WMR revolver, reloading goodies, competition stuff, antiques, black powder revolver, sks or ak?) but I do need some cash.  

You will need a NC pistol transfer ticket, or your concealed weapon permit.  Bill of sale.

The stock is really great! It drastically reduces the recoil to a comfortable and manageable feel compared to any other pistol grip. In fact, I have Knoxx's on all my shotguns. Just an excellent product! 

I am the original owner and it has been very well maintained. The gun is coated in Mossberg's Marinecoat. It holds 6 shells and has only 1 box of plastic game loads shot through it. Then like all my guns, was cleaned, oiled, and put back into my safe. The finish is strong, durable, and still in 100% perfect condition!! it has no rust, pits, or scratches. You will be hard pressed to find another ""used"" shotgun in this condition.

1 of 25 Original NSG (Navy Seal Grey)Sage Int'l Dot Matrix Hand Engraved Logo EBR MK14 M14 Stock. 

The butt pad of this stock has a plastic plate in it that is broken and the butt pad will not stay mounted to the stock. The stock itself is not damaged. You will also receive the butt pad plus the 3 screws required to mount the stock to the gun. 

The story isn't 100% clear but there were 25 stocks made by Sage Int'l around 2004 that were similar to the civilian models, which were anodized black at the time not grey. The NSG Dot Matix stock seems to be a variant of the the civilian stock and some of the differences are that the NSG Dot Matix stock was anodized grey which, at the time, only the military versions were anodized grey, there were possibly some extra cuts made to the stock which lightened the stock and the rear of the stock was beefed up by machining it instead of welding it like the black civilians models were at the time. There were 25 of these stocks made but before the company logo could be machine engraved the stocks were pulled from the line. Apparently Sage was going to toss the stocks but last minute decided to hand engrave the logo and sold the lot to Clyde Armory and from there the first ever Navy Seal Grey stocks were sold to the public. It seems that some believe the front end of this stock was shortened from 13"" to 11.25"" and that is not true. The Dot Matrix stocks still retains the full 13"" length at the front of the stock. The stock is referred to as the ""Dot Matrix"" style because of the hand engraved information on the side of the stock. 

I am willing to ship this stock. Payment via certified check or paypal or cash in person only. Payment must clear before I will ship the item. 

$150 includes insurance and shipping via Fedex or UPS ground only.

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!

This is must have for any serious Walther collector. Be one of the lucky few who have this rare firearm in their collection.
To commemorate the great occasion of the millennium turn, Walther made a special P99 year 2000 commemorative pistol which was limited to just a few special edition pieces worldwide. The high polished blued slide is elegantly lasered, outlined and engraved with the special serial number and ""commemorative for the year 2000"" on the side.

A favorite of shooters around the world for years, the Walther P99 Pistol is a great choice for everything from home defense to duty carry. The P99 uses an internal striker, as opposed to an external hammer, with a red-painted striker tip that protrudes from rear of the slide when the gun is cocked, as well as a chamber loaded indicator on the right side of the slide. A decocking button, four internal safeties, tool-less takedown, accessory rail, and sights adjustable for both windage and elevation are other important P99 features. P99’s are also known for their interchangeable grip back straps of varying sizes for different user hand sizes and an ambidextrous magazine release incorporated into the trigger guard."

It was the manufacturer's salesman show piece.  After it's show duty, the weapon was returned to the factory for reconditioning [my understanding of that process is that is was COMPLETELY disassembled, inspected, cleaned and reassembled as if it were a brand new unit].  I have owned it four years since & put (maybe) a couple hundred rounds through it.
I've used it as a personal defense-carry weapon.  I recently decided that I want to switch to a 40 caliber.  As the XD reputation stands, I have had no issues with this firearm!
I took it into the new mega retailer that moved into town.  They took it in the back for inspection and offered 60% of the $499 that they would resell it for.  That is where I came up with my fair market price of $450.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles."
