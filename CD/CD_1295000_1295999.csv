For those of you who may not be familiar with the 1911 pistols, this is a warning that this ad is for a ""Frankenstein"" 1911. Colt NEVER has made a high capacity 1911 pistol. The only part of this gun that is of Colt production is the slide, and because of it being a series 70, we can guess it came from a Colt manufactured prior to 1983 when its production line was cancelled.
The frame and parts of this gun that you can see in the picture are not of colt manufacture, but instead this ""high quality and rare"" gun is a home-built collaboration of cheap and mismatched parts. The rear sight is not even for a 1911 pistol, and hangs out over the back of the slide. The front sight is what appears to be a ""glue on"" home job of some type or another. The beavertail safety does not match the frame, and considering how low it is sitting in the frame, is probably disabled or does not work at all. You can see by examining the pictures that the seller has ""rubbed out"" the marking on the barrel so you cannot see its stamping, and the manufacturers label on the frame has been edited so it cannot be read as well. I am guessing that it may be an older Caspian high capacity frame, but it could be one that was bought unfinished such as this one:
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=333040302. or possibly an el-cheapo RIA frame from the Philippines.

I would steer clear of this obvious scam, but if you are desperate, please do not pay more than a couple hundred bucks for the sum of its hashed-together parts, as it is quite likely that most have been damaged beyond use. Better yet, report obvious scammer's like this one and get it removed before an un-knowledgeable buyer gets ripped off.

DSC has joined forces with the Samson Mfg. to bring you their 9” Evolution handguard.  This lightweight, sturdy aluminum forearm allows the shooter to place their accessories anywhere on the handguard without having the extra weight of a full rail system.  The 9” length extends of the carbine low profile gas system and gives the shooter a little extra real estate.  DSC chose the lightest stock sister company Ace Limited offers for this build.  The 7” Ace AR-UL-E is standard, but may be upgraded to the 9” AR-UL version for a longer trigger pull at no extra charge.  Both models also include a 1” or ½” buttpad that can be added for additional comfort and length of pull.

Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that a proposed ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons has no chance of passing the chamber, but he wants to ensure a vote on it will take place.
The proposal to update a similar 1994 ban that expired a decade later was one of four measures passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to the Connecticut school massacre in December.
Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters he won't keep the proposed ban in gun legislation heading to the full Senate for consideration because including it would guarantee the measure would be blocked by a Republican filibuster."

What I have is a completely ready to go shooters package. The rifle is a norinco Mak 90 ak47. I'm gonna put a value around 2k for the whole rig (hard case not included)

Understand that if you put a $600(Pre panic) value in the base rifle I have $1,128.00 (I just added up invoices). That being said if you have a quality ar-15 I am looking for a close to straight trade (I am negotiable).

So no your bushmaster, dpms, delton etc is not what I am looking for in a straight trade. And if you have a PSA it will need extras. Pre panic or post panic values won't matter both rifles have gone up in value. My rifle is worth a 1k before the panic, stock psa is 800 so know that before you offer. 

The rifle is outfitted with the following parts, 

Ar 15 6 position stock adapter 
Magpul Moe stock 
Hogue pistol grip 
Krebs custom safety selector 
Krebs custom peep sight 
Solar tactical magwel adapter (makes for very fast and way mag changes) 
Midwest industries quadrail milled for micro red dot 
Magpul angled for grip 
And spikes tactical Dynacomp 

8- 30rd mags 
1- 5 rnd mag 
1600 rds of 7.62x39 

This is the smoothest, and softest shooting ak I have ever ran. Runs 100% and is in good condition. If you look up these parts you will see everything is of the best quality. It will come with all the original furniture pictured, nothing permenent was done, everything can be take off to revert it back to its original state.

Ok... Most places still sell ammo at reasonable prices. 380ACP $15-$18   9mm $12-$16   .40 $15-$18   .45 $20-25 (per 50 and all at brass prices.)
Why are people posting ammo for so much? Your only hindering the supply and causing the price to temperamentally to jump. Ammo is coming back in stock slowly and soon all of you that just went out and bought hundreds in ammo hoping to make a buck soon will have to take a hit. I work for a major retailer and ammo just hit our shelves this past week. I was able to get some 9's for 12 dollars a box. A box of .40 for $15 and just last night was able to get some 22's 100 packs for 8 dollars! There was and is no ammo shortage. Just stupid people trying to make money off stupid people. And for the people buying this ammo... Why not just shop around? Are you planning to go to the range in the next day that you have to have ammo now? The dumbest people are the ones who justify this stupid buying as ""My rights might be taken away and that's why I'm doing it."" Why? Ammo was never the cause of concern. They are and always will be targeting the guns. 
   Don't take it from me... All I can say is I have ""enough"" ammo and never spent more then 18 dollars on a single box and that was for my 45's. All my ammo acquired during this ""ammo scare."" I know no one will care but figured I should let people know that ammo is coming back. Go ahead and keep stock piling. People like me will only keep buying ammo before you can and selling what I don't need/want to people who need it at the cost to me and not 10 dollars over. 9's Should never be over $15 unless they are +p or JHP and for 22's if its not match ammo it's not worth more then $10 for 100. We want our freedom to own firearms in peace but sites like this prove that ""we the people..."" are just as greedy as the fat cats in the capital. Please show respect and show your fellow shooters respect. If ammo is this expensive people will stop shooting. Less shooters = less support when it comes to gun rights.
   Go ahead and flag this. This is just a friendly wake up call to everyone trying to make a dollar and for the ones getting soaked. Let the stores recover. There will be ammo. Only people who should be scared is congress when we stand up to them if they try to take our guns away in the future.
   Another thing I keep seeing is bulk ammo. For example, the bucket of 1400 Remington 22's ran me $80 at Cabelas! Not $100+! The 500/525 packs run about 30-40. Anything more is a scam. Also federals in the red box (The ones that have a WMxxxx number on the side) are walmart exclusives and only cost $14.
   I've actually gotten alot of positive feedback for my post. I will say though I'm not mad at people trying to make money. This is their right in a capitalistic society. But there are other places to make even better money."

The History... 
The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied. 

Today... 
I.O. Inc. redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the triggerguard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol.

I've had this gun for years. It's taken rabbit, squirrel, dove, quail, and pheasant. Shoots nice and straight. The stock was shortened but was rejoined and refinished. you can see a slightly darker line at the joint after refinishing. If your looking for a learning gun or just a good gun with light recoil this is it.

LWRC M6A2
Patriot Brown

Brand New & Ready to Ship!! NO credit card fees!!

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

Just got this thing all decked out and had to pay or a truck repair. I digress....Frosty ain't doing so hot
anymore because this thing works AWESOME!!!

-Strikeforce Desert Tan Folding Stock
-40 round Tapco magazine
-Sun Optics receiver mounted see through SKS scope mount.
-Sightmark Holograph Sight with 4 reticle selection ($160 one, not one of the $40 economy ones)
-100 rounds of ammo
-The piece of mind that you can fight off the ""zombie invasion""when TSHTF
-The piece of mind that all the stores that I know of have plenty of cheap ammo for this IN STOCK
-A few stray ""Dremel"" marks where I modified the stock to accommodate the scope mount.
(not ugly-but then again, no one ever claimed an SKS was pretty to begin with)
-Shoots great! (did I mention Frosty?)
-The nice warm feeling of knowing that this isn't in the hands of a pinko commie anymore and is
now owned by a PATRIOT that'll use it for whatever he feels he/she must because the 2nd Amendment says it's your RIGHT!
If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750. If you don't like it....you're free to write ""hate emails"" from yer mommy's basement because THIS IS AMERICA!!! I can then delete them and laugh at your sad, poor self.
Seriously....,if you want this, email me stating your intention to buy, a number that I can call or text, and be prepared to show a valid form of ID and sign a Bill of Sale, because I'm ONLY SELLING to a LEGAL, law-abiding CITIZEN!
