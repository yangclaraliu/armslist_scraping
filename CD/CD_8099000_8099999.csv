Also featuring a proprietary patent pending mounting, indexing and lock up system that mitigates 12:00 rail movement under heat generated from the barrel nut. Handguard alone weighs 6.2oz! 1.3” Inner Diameter 1.5” OUTSIDE flat to flat. Handguard flares forward (towards muzzle end) at the 3 and 9 O’clock positions approximately 1/4″ Actual length when measured to flare is 10.5″ Mounting hardware, 2.4oz, for a total of 8.6oz on a 10” rail. The KMR barrel nut will fit over all mil-spec diameter barrels (max of 1″) The KMR Alpha is hardcoat anodized for corrosion resistance as well as to maintain a non-reflective finish. The KeyMod™ interface system was developed by Eric Kincel (now the Director of BCMs’ product development team) to work in parallel with the current picatinny system. In many applications it will advance modularity past the current 1913 rail system. The BCM KMR Alpha also allows for a larger range of modularity offering 4 different offset mounting positions between traditional 3,6,9, and 12:00 positions. In the most basic of applications the KeyMod™ system allows for universal modularity between various manufacturers of accessories, and accessory rails. A big win for the trigger puller. As the industry advances the modular accessories will mount directly to the KeyMod™ instead of picatinny, allowing for a lighter, cleaner, and less bulky weapon system. *Includes BCM® KeyMod™ Sling Mount . “Please note: Nylon/Polymer Picatinny rail sections are for NON-load bearing accessories only. For load bearing accessories, we recommend aluminum Picatinny rail sections. Do NOT exceed 20 in/lbs. when securing KeyMod™ Fasteners on Polymer accessories. Aluminum Picatinny rail sections may be torqued to 30 in/lbs”"

This beauty has tons of mods, and could def be a competition gun. I started with the BCG and installed the Voltquarten ""Talon"" ejector wich has a stronger spring, I changed out the ejector pin to Voltquartsen as well as spring, then installed the Tandemcross titanium firing pin and upgraded heavier striker spring, which removes the worry of misfires due to a light strikes or offset contact... I also installed the Voltquartsen accurizing kit which comes complete with their CNC Machined Disconnector, Target Hammer, Hammer Bushing, Target Sear, Target Trigger with steel plunger and properly adjusted spring weight. It also comes with pretravel and overtravel adjustments. Then instead of using to curved Volts trigger I installed the flat Tamdemcross skeletonized trigger to allow for a better trigger feel. Honestly, you have to feel this trigger to believe it, it is a joy to shoot. But I've only put 50-100 rounds down range with it and I believe this would be the perfect .22 for the rivht person. I'm so busy that when I do go to the range im practicing with conealed carry. Oh yeah it has the wooden grips for target shooting (i have originals) and an extended slide release on it to make it easy to reach with fat grips. It feels great in the hand. Comes with 2 mags and I'd give you some ammo but I'm all out of .22 rounds. Lastly i got rid of the pesky mag ""safety"" outfit, so no fussing with that. I'm asking $500. I figured that was fair for a Nearnly brand new Mark 4 Target with all the upgrades and time I put into it. Please don't come to me saying I'll pay 300 today, I will happily entertain reasonable offers but crazy lowballers will be ignored. Hit me up on here also my number is REDACTED text plzl. Thank you for taking the time to look at my offerings!Oh yeah and it comes with the optic in the pics, it's actually very accurate for a sightmark. It can run a bunch of different reticles and has 5 brightness settings in red and 5 in green. If you decide to go open sights or put some real cash in to an optic this thing is lethally accurate with it's big bull Barrell. CheersAlex"

A 4.25"" bushing barrel allows field strip anywhere, and keeps the weight down when compared to pistols of comparable size with tapered cone barrels. Already loaded with options,you find that most customers want it just the way it is. When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in.Gun was designed to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands and thousands of rounds. The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius. Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol. Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. This feature also helps prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats that checkering often causes. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare. A Nighthawk Custom lightweight aluminum trigger that has been blacked-out using Cerakote breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs with no creep. When you put all of these features in one package, you come up with the finest carry gun you can own. All you add is practice."

It does have some minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that the rifle was previously owned, and saw an average amount of normal usage. This rifle is free of all major flaws/defects, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, nicks, cuts, staining, rusting, pitting, or discoloration. It does have some minor scratching and scraping in a couple of different places. However, they are shallow marks only, and have no effect on the rifle's performance. This rifle features an adjustable AR-Style stock, as well as a full black, synthetic stock, and 3 tactical rails near the end of the rifle's forearm. This rifle does not have a scope, or scope mounts, however, it does come with the original level sights in front of the receiver, as well as at the end of the barrel.
