These are known as the best quality and most accurate Mosin Nagant rifles ever produced as well as the most RARE variant. The wood is amazing! This one is in excellent condition and shoots great for an old surplus rifle. This Finnish M39, like many others, appears to be counterbored likely by the Finnish military to restore the accuracy after they were captured from the Russians. That being said, it's a shooter's gun rather than just for collecting. I will include both the sniper rifle case pictured and the Brass Stacker pull ring. I also have about 140 rounds of brass cased Sellier and Bellot 7.62x54R I will throw in. This is NOT a cheap Mosin. These are selling right now on Gunbroker for $675+ and that's without the sniper rifle case, brass stacker ring and the ammo that I'm giving with the rifle. I'm NOT desperate for money so no low ballers. SERIOUS BUYERS & CASH ONLY! DON'T WASTE MY TIME. $650 OBO for the whole package. Make me a reasonable offer. I'm also willing to sell the gun separately so make a reasonable offer.

This is the version WITH night sights, not the three dot white ""contrast"" sights. The gun will come with everything it originally came with, which is two 17 round magazines, a SIG branded OWB holster, and the plastic SIG case. I bought this back in late 2016, and it has been back to SIG for the voluntary upgrade since. This gun has had about 200 rounds through it if that, probably less, and has been VERY well taken care of sitting in my collection. I'd almost go as far to say it's pretty close to like new.I'm interested in either selling it outright or trading, with potential to add cash on either my end or your end depending on what is offered. I'm listing the firearm at 400 (current lowest price I could find brand new via gun.deals is 579.99, which must be SIG's MAP because it's consistent everywhere), but this is negotiable if need be.If you're interested and not in the Erie County area, I'm willing to meet you halfway at a public location (Walmart, gas station, etc). I'd prefer to sell to someone with a VALID and CURRENT Ohio CCW, but if you don't have a CCW, please bring a photocopy of your Drivers License which we can use as a bill of sale. I am relatively firm in this, so I'm sorry if that's not okay with you. I think this also goes without saying, but I will only sell this handgun to someone 21+. If you are not legally able to own a handgun, I will not be the one selling it to you, I hope you understand. Thanks for looking."

As for the gun itself, if you don't know much about the USP, it has been contracted by both numerous international and stateside agencies because it is known to be extremely reliable and accurate, along with being a very smooth shooting handgun. If you Google ""HK USP9 LEM,"" the first result will be an ad from Buds gun shop, who is extremely fair with priced, for $953. There is also an aftermarket Jet funnel mag well installed, two factory 18 round mags, and the original factory case with the manual.I cannot stress this enough, the only reason why I'm selling is to fund a more carry friendly handgun. I might be open to trade for one, if it's worth less please add cash. Trade and cash value are of course going to be different. No Taurus, highpoint, etc. Serious offers only, for faster response leave a phone number. Looking forward to doing business with you!"

It is built on a Compact frame, which is mated to a 5” barrel and full-size slide. The Compact frame will allow this pistol to be carried more discreetly than a gun with a full-size frame. However, throw in an X-Tension™ magazine, and the XD® 5” Compact takes on the feel of a full- size pistol. The XD® 5” Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line. The longer barrel and slide result in a longer sight radius and faster recoil recovery. The Compact frame will help keep the pistol concealed when it’s carried with flush-fitting magazines. If you need more capacity, X-Tension™ magazines let you go from 10+1 to 13+1 rounds of .45 ACP with a simple magazine change. The XD® 5” Compact includes everything that makes Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block give you the safety and usability that you expect in a Springfield Armory® XD®. If you’re looking for a concealed carry .45 ACP pistol that delivers a little bit more, try the XD® 5” Compact. You will be surprised at how easily it carries, you will enjoy how it handles and you’ll appreciate the firepower it offers."

And like I said, it may be gone already, but I'm looking for someone that would want to be next in line because I need to fund another buy before I lose the oppurtunity. This is the Sig Legion P229. Smoothest handgun that I have honestly ever fired. I hate to get rid of it, but I have an obession with retro firearms unfortuanetly, and one is calling my name. It comes with 3 mags, a Sig hard case, a Sig Legion soft case, and the Legion coin. I also have around 50 rounds I would be willing to give because I don't own another 9mm at the moment. There is a tiny spot on the trigger guard that you can see in on of the pics. It isn't down to the metal. I think for $400 off of retail, anyone could live with that. Not that it's at all necessary, but a light or lazer attachment would cover it easily. Internals have the normal wear you would expect any firearm to have. You can text me at 4two37one70342."

The original spring and guide rod from Kimber are included. The Wilson combat flat wire recoil spring is good for 40,000 rounds vs the standard 800 to 1000 round life of a standard Kimber 22 pound recoil spring. The upgrade is built to shoot +p ammo while reducing wear on your firearm. I have shot 150 rounds of standard 230 grain Sig Sauer jacketed ball ammo through this gun and it’s great and very accurate, however it’s more of a carry gun and I would prefer to get a 5” barrel version for the range. All the original paperwork, receipt and box come with this firearm. This gun retails for $850-$900 at cabelas. With the Wilson combat upgrades and 3 additional Kimber KimPro tac magazines this whole kit would run you well over $1000.00. I’m asking $850 and you get a perfectly tuned firearm with all the correct upgrades and extra magazines. No trades or offers under the asking price accepted, honestly you won’t find a better equipped gun with all the goodies that’s only shot 150 rounds for less. This is for all intensive purposes a brand new firearm. All sales will be done in at an FFL near my house in the Highlands area of Denver or in Arvada. All transfer fees and any other background fees are on the purchaser."
