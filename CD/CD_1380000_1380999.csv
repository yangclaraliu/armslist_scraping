Crimson Trace presents the MVF-515 Green; a revolutionary, patent-pending concept that combines three tactical tools for your AR style rifle into a single modular package. With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a green laser sight and a 150/200-Lumen LED light module. The MVF-515 Green leverages advanced technology to ensure long battery life and rugged durability through a wider range of conditions than consumer grade green lasers. Hot or cold, light or dark, the MVF-515 Green readily provides the most complete sighting and target identification system available anywhere. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light. Call Jason REDACTED"

Currently have 25 boxes left (5625 rounds total). Price is $30/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .22lr ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales.  Minimum order of 3 boxes for orders I have to ship.

I have achieved 2 inch groups at 25 yards with this weapon a few times. Eats any ammo you want to feed it. Loves 147 grain PPU, and 124 grain UMC the best. Most accurate with this ammo in my experience, but will feed anything all day long. I bet it would feed 9mm rabbit turds, if the reload press could handle it. I've never shot +P ammo through it, as I find it unnecessary, but it is rated to handle it. It also loves to eat hollowpoints, from Silverbear to Corbon. I have CC'd this weapon effectively, even though I am slim framed, and it is mid sized. The only reason I am parting with this weapon, is that I have too many polymer pistols, and want more all metal pistols. This weapon is fully broken in, and I would trust my life and the lives of my children with it, and have carried it to do so. I will not part with ammo, as I have other 9mm's to feed.

Rough Rider ... the very image conjured up is of the rugged men led by Theodore Roosevelt up Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill over 100 years ago during our war with Spain. That same image of ruggedness might also be applied to the newest Big Bore Rough Rider revolver from Heritage. Almost the ""spitting image"" of the Single Action Army still be carried by some troops during the Spanish-American War, this latest six-shooter comes chambered for the legendary .45 Colt cartridge, .44-40 and .357 Magnum. This fine handgun can be had in the traditional 4.75"", 5.5"" and 7.5"" barrel lengths, just like the original. Blue, nickel, stainless and blue/color-case hardened finishes are available and each gun is fitted with attractive one-piece cocobolo grips. The action features a frame mounted inertia firing pin and transfer bar for added protection. Old World gun maker Pietta of Italy start certain parts for us. They are a family run operation, just like Heritage Manufacturing. Then those certain parts are finished by Heritage, then plated then fully assembled by us in the good old US.

Perfect for the exciting sport of western action shooting, the Big Bore Rough Rider embodies the flavor of the Old West and will also serve anyone who wants an accurate and reliable sidearm for other outdoor activities. As with all of the Heritage handgun line, this new six-gun offers both quality and affordability...an American Tradition!

In 1956, they introduced the Model 56, the first of an entirely new class of Marlin leverguns. These rifles had a very short 2"" lever-throw, allowing for very speedy reloading, and were named the Marlin ""Levermatic"". The Model 56 was chambered for the .22 Long Rifle, and was fed with a box-magazine. Shortly thereafter, a tubular magazine version was introduced (named the Model 57), along with the Model 57 Magnum, chambered in the .22 Magnum round. Winchester was making news with its sleek, new Model 88, chambered in hunting rounds like the .308 Winchester, and in 1962 Marlin entered the centerfire market with a version of it Levermatic, tailored for short centerfire rounds. Thus was born the centerfire Model 62, chambered in .357 Magnum, .256 Winchester Magnum, and .22 Remington Jet (and later on in .30 Carbine). The Marlin Levermatics were not popular sellers and were dropped from production by 1973.

Up for sale is an early model 62 {No serial No.}. Along with it is 142 loaded rnds. ,42 once fired brass,m and 2 mags, and scope base.

Trade interest: Marlin leverguns/.22 mag., quality revolver in .38/.357 4"" barrel, good .270 bolt gun, Big bore BP single shot cartridge rifle, ammo, or $600 cash. Offers accepted"

It has German Proof Marks from the Munich Proof House dated to 1992.  Since these were manufactured in Brazil, I suspect that it was imported to Germany where is was proofed and then sold to someone who brought it into the US (military personnel?).  I've never seen one with these markings before.  I asked around on the Taurus forum -- and no one there had ever seen one with German proof marks either..."

The 139gr is a partition spire-point boat tail hunting bullets from unknown manufacturer. They are .263"" diameter (6.5mm) for 264 Win Mag, 6.5mm Rem Mag, 6.5mm Swedish Mauser or other .264 cal cartridges. These are a ""2-diameter"" bullet. When Winchester brought out the 264 Win Mag they reduced the diameter just ahead of the case mouth so the bullet did not engage the rifling when the round was chambered. The reduced measurement is .255"" diameter. These are from an estate, circa '60s, where the heirs could not provide additional information. They are separated into two groups, normal and notched. The notched bullets look like someone marked them with a wire cutter (see photo). Most notches are minor. Also a few of the exposed lead tips are slightly deformed probably from bulk storage.
