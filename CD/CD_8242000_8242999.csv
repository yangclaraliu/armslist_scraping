It has a round 26” barrel and shotgun butt stock. The bore is somewhat rough but shootable with visible rifling and even, shallow pitting from black powder. The case colored receiver is lightly and evenly pitted from rust, with no case color remaining. The barrel and magazine are evenly rusted overall with some slight blue remaining visible. The action is tight. The lower tang shows a lot of blue, and may be refinished or came on another gun. I would speculate that the butt stock is a replacement as well as the magazine retaining band - also probably several screws. But all metal appears to be original Winchester, whether or not it was all born together. The good news is it old enough to be an antique, so no FFL is needed to ship. No letter or box accompanies the gun. That's all I can tell!"

The stock has 4 position adjustable pull length and a 7 position adjustable cheek weld riser.  I purchased a SKS for a build and this was the stock it was in when I bought it. It is in excellent condition and has almost zero signs of previous use.  IT IS MISSING THE RUBBER RECOIL PAD that fits on the back of the stock.  You can purchase a replacement for around $12 at a number of online retailers. I took this into consideration when pricing the stock.   I will also include a unbranded folding stock. It looks like a Tapco but I think it's a cheap knock off.  Also included (if wanted lol) will be a blonde SKS stock that DOES NOT have the top hand guard piece or the butt stock plate.  Thanks guys!

This gun has never been fired. I purchased it new to replace my other two P226 Legion SAOs that I previous owned. I’ve owned a few of these, and this last one I purchased and built up to be my nightstand gun, but has long been replaced by my HK USP 45. So it’s been sitting in my safe inside the carry case with the coin. Of course, with the magwell, and the extended mags, they don’t really fit perfectly inside the carry case or the original case. I keep them inside the soft foam.  The pistol and magazines are in brand new condition. No wear, no marking whatsoever.
 
I love this gun, and I thought I’d be keeping it forever, hence why I got a brand new one to be a safe queen. But, I just moved here and well—-regardless of my reason, I’m probably looking more so for cash, or if upgrade for something more, or combination of cash and -ish. Trade value is expected to be more then my asking. Not looking for any shotgun or rifle, with the exception of a 300 black out 9.5-10.5” upper plus cash. Would like a Wilson Combat or Ed Brown, preferably in stainless steel. High end 1911s always a plus, but no Kimber.  If it’s something higher, I can add some trades (maybe an STI or brand new Sig red dot) or cash from my end.  Don’t mean to be an *ss, but I will probably say no to a lot of trades, especially polymers, or guns that have been beaten or used more than used. I’m picky with my collection, so I’ll be picky with what I will want to trade.  And, you don’t have to tell me, based on my asking price, I do seem to love this gun so much that I want to keep it.
