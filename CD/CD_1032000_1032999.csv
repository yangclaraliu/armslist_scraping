This converted Saiga 12 has just what you need -  a 20 round drum magazine,  rail mounted red dot optics, pressure actuated front end laser, Tri-rail foregrip, 19"" barrel, and a folding stock. I like to call it ""Mr. Destructo"". 

I haven't shot it a lot, but when I do it leaves you realizing that it's ONE POWERFUL WEAPON, and a lot of fun to shoot!  To see this shotgun in action go to YouTube and enter ""Saiga 12 Pallets"" and watch this baby do it's thing. I laugh everytime I watch that video.

If you don't know about a Saiga 12, basically it's an AK47 shotgun. This 12 Gauge Combat Shotgun, made in Russia by Izhmash, is from the same company that produces the Kalashinikov series of assualt riflles - the original AK47's. Looking at the Saiga 12, you might even think that it's an AK.

To get the most out of your Saiga 12, you convert them by moving a new improved trigger assembly and firing components forward to where the trigger was originally designed to be by Kalashinikov . They come to the US with the forward trigger hole already cut out ready for conversion so no new cutting of metal is required, only changing out parts to bring them into 922r compliance so that you can legally attach the 20 round drum mag setup in its original AK configuration - that's when the fun starts! With all that said, the result is that this gun is 922r compliant and legal, and ready to Rock N' Roll. 

Now that you have read all that, have you watched the video yet? It's the clencher that makes you say ""Hmmmm, he's right, I should have one of those around the house"".

With all the talk about weapon bans, I am almost certain that this gun will be one of the top guns to make the upcoming ban list! I'm sure that Obama and Feinstein would love to see this one off the market!  But for now, it's still available and this is your chance to get one. 

I hope you enjoyed the video, it always makes me smile............. in an evil sort of way.

Might want to buy ahead of the much-discussed assault weapon ban, because if it goes into effect as written this version of the venerable SIG556 will no longer be available!

I have only fired around 100 rounds through this rifle since I bought it new. This rifle features a collapsible folding stock, a flip-up rear sight and I have also installed the Sig Sauer Red-Dot sight, which co-witnesses perfectly with the fixed sights. I have also installed a Grip-Pod fore-grip that converts to a bi-pod with the push of a button. 

Everything you see in the photos goes with the rifle, including the SIG hard case, lock, and owner’s manual.

You can’t find any SIG556s on the shelves right now, and if the ban passes there may not be any more available. Get it while you still can!

Gen.4 Glock 23 in .40. Shoots like a dream, I am the second owner and it had under 100rds when I got it in trade from a Glocktalk member. I have put under 100 into it myself, and the Gen 4 soaks up the snap amazingly well for a lightweight gun. Gen 4 has the upgraded guide rod assy for recoil control and removable backstraps, and also has a larger mag release button. I run it with no strap, which I believe is equivalent to a SF frame feel. All inserts are included. Best Glock I've played with.

I have all OEM kit, including the tupperware container, 3x mags and the gun has been upgraded with Meprolight night sights (green front, orange rear) and a grip plug. Shows as 99% - no rash or wear, no disappointments.  When I say 99% I mean that the frame and slide are flawless, barrel is superb with the finish only now starting to show wear on the forward edge of the chamber where it unlocks from the slide.  That's it.  I can get pics but this gun is as nice as they come.  Never carried (People's Republik of IL so that's a no-go) or abused.  I will include a nice IWB leather holster with belt loops.

New pics will be taken this weekend.  Please serious inquiries only.

I'm a bullet collector and I'm looking to add some of the PDW rounds into my collection. I do this with my son as a cheap way to collect firearms type items, I am looking for single rounds only, sorry but if I could afford $50+ for a box of the stuff I could afford to collect the whole gun and not just single bullets from them. 

We are looking for a 5.7x28, a HK4.6 (4.6x30) and there is also a few others. 

This is what I'm looking for right now but were always interested in ANY CALIBER single rounds, doesn't even have to be considered ""rare"", if we don't have one we want one, even of the most common stuff.

About the only thing were not interested in is your pre-existing collection, WE are putting this together, we don't want to buy yours.

this is the information i could find pertaining to the ""BLACKJACK"" edition.

2HBCT= 2nd Heavy Brigade Combat Team
1CD = 1st Calvary Division
11-12 = DEC 2011

Also on 15 Decenber, exactly eight months to the day they cased their colors, Soldiers with the 2nd ""Black Jack"" Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division assembled again on Cooper Field and uncased their colors, marking one of the last units to leave Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn and allowing Soldiers to be home just in time for the holidays. The Brigade had operated primarily in the Northern Iraqi Joint Operations area.

Being home for the holidays came as a surprise to the Black Jack Soldiers. They didn't know until a couple of weeks ago that they would be back before the Christmas holiday, and they were very fortunate everything worked out.

Many Black Jack Soldiers agreed that being one of the last units to leave their footprint in Iraq made their numerous deployment rotations, loss of comrades and countless holidays away from loved ones well worth it."

Not advertising it as perfect, could use some restoration, and in the long run would preform better than the new Wingmasters (cream of the crop for the 870 series) without having that ugly gold colored trigger they started adding to all of them.

The bad:
The Wingmaster needs a new ejector spring, it broke, and is keeping it from cycling (the pump works great, the spring is just in the way).. I tried to get the pictures to show the fading, and scratches on the blueing, it certainly is not new, but it's defiantly more valuable than the finish on an express, and remains rust free.

Here's a link for the replacement part, cost $5 (if you know what you're doing) If not, have a smith fix it.

This M193 NATO 55 gr FMJ round is manufactured to mil-spec and offers great accuracy for your AR-15 with the added benefit of being more cost effective than many of the American manufactured brands.

GET IT BEFORE THE BAN!  THIS IS A TRUE M4 & NOT AN M4-GERY!  Designed specifically for lightweight mobility, speed of target acquisition, and potent firepower capability - the Colt® Law Enforcement Carbine delivers. This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military Colt M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30.5 in (77.5 cm) in length and weighs only 6.8 lb (3.08 kg).  Colt's Law Enforcement Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. The handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection, while the muzzle compensator reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures.
The upper has all of the standard features such as a forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover over the ejection port. More notable is the detachable carry handle—complete with A2 sights—and the 1913 rail giving you the option to mount optics or rear-sights.  
 Additional specs that differentiate this AR from the others-16 inch government profile barrel with M203 notch, 4150 chromoly vanadium steel, A2 bird cage flash hider, 1/7 inch twist ratio, M4 feed ramps, individual magnetic particle inspected bolt and not batch tested, individual high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected barrel, H marked buffer, F marked front sight base, Mil-spec buffer tube, mil-std 1913 picatinny top rail.  A good video detailing the many specs of this firearm and a video definitely worth watching could be found on www.youtube.com; search mixflip Colt LE 6920 M4 Carbine AR 15.  Shoutout to MIXFLIP!
SALES TO CALIFORNIA PERMITTED.  Again, this is for a BRAND NEW IN BOX, NEVER FIRED & IMMACULATE IN APPEARANCE & CONDITION.  As an added BONUS, I will include a brand new MAGPUL handguard and brand new MAGPUL pistol grip.  Keep it classic or turn it up for that ZERO-DARK THIRTY appearance.

The rifle has had about 800rds through it and has been cleaned after every trip to the range. When i bought the rifle I had the in shop gunsmith install a Timney AR-15 competition trigger that breaks right at 3.5 pounds(219.95 upgrade) Then once i got the rifle home I installed a magpul bad lever and a magpul ambi sling mount aswell as magpul moe polymer rails on all 4 sides of the hand guard.

Asking 1800.00 OBO for everything listed above. For some reason i cannot get my photos to upload so if you want photos i can email them to you.

It's a 22 lr. and has one mag.  A local collector and I were discussing the pistol and I asked him if he would rate it at about 95% and he replied ""oh ya definitely"". There are no cracks, chips or pry marks on the grip pieces, screws are good, no pry marks or indications of damage on the screw heads typical from over tightening. I became aware of the value and history of the piece and began looking for general prices on the internet, the five or six pistols that I've seen since I've had this pistol were clearly in worse condition than the one I have. The mag, in the lower front, looks like it struck something chipping and slightly indenting the pinky hold in a very small ""V""."
