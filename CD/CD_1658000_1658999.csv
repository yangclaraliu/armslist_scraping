Wolff springs (main spring and rebound spring) have been installed and the trigger rebound slide has been polished. Trigger pull is nice and smooth. It has an internal hammer and disappears when worn IWB or in a pocket holster. This gun is perfect for concealed carry. Comes with the original S&W stamped Hogue bantam grips. I love this gun, and wouldn't be selling it if I didn't have other .357 Mag. revolvers and I wasn't looking to fund a new purchase.

The gun comes with a brand new Remora IWB holster ($30 value). I'm asking $600 for the package (you're basically getting the gun for $570). Like I said, I'm looking to fund a new purchase so I'm really looking for a cash sale, but I would consider trading for a new/newer S&W M&P 9c or M&P 45c."

These are the rare MK 262 rounds used by US Special Operations for long-range stopping power (600 yards).

Item (In Sock): 500 rounds NEW (not reloads) Summit MK 262 5.56 77 grain Sierra MatchKing Boat Tail Hollow Point (BTHP) in new Lake City military brass with sealed primers.

Shipping: Free ground shipping to the 48 contiguous United States.

MK 262: From Wikipedia: 5.56×45mm NATO Improvements:

Recently, advances have been made in 5.56 mm ammunition. The US military has adopted for limited issue a 77-grain (5.0 g) ""Match"" bullet, type classified as the Mk 262.

The heavy, lightly constructed bullet fragments more violently at short range and also has a longer fragmentation range.

Originally designed for use in the Mk 12 SPR, the ammunition has found favor with special forces units who were seeking a more effective cartridge to fire from their M4A1 carbines.

Commercially available loadings using these heavier (and longer) bullets can be prohibitively expensive and cost much more than military surplus ammunition.

Performance of 5.56×45 mm military ammunition can generally be categorized as almost entirely dependent upon velocity in order to wound effectively. Heavy OTM bullets enhance soft tissue wounding ability at the expense of hard-target/barrier penetration.

Accuracy: This is match grade ammunition, which means it's highly accurate and consistent because it's manufactured with precise, low tolerances.

In addition, the MK 262 has the toughest accuracy specification of any small arms ammunition issued by the U.S. military and requires a 1:7 or 1:8 twist to stabilize the 77-grain OTM bullet.

Range: 600 yards+

Bullet: Sierra MatchKing 77 grain (heavy) Boat Tail Hollow Point (BTHP). A boat-tail hollow-point bullet is a match grade bullet design that uses the concept of a teardrop-like shape to give it a lower drag coefficient and make it produce less turbulence in its wake. Only the base of the bullet has a boat tail-like shape — the meplat is still pointed.

Brass: New Lake City 5.56x45mm MIL-SPEC, unfired, heavy duty brass with a Lake City headstamp (not polished/shiny like commercial brass). It is the same brass supplied to our fighting forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and offers outstanding performance in AR-15 type rifles.

Primer: Sealed

Packaging: 1 Master Pack (5x 100 round boxes). 

Availability: In Stock (Limited Supply) - Available for Immediate Delivery."

Wood is nice, except for a small very shallow scrape (not a ding) on left side, near receiver. This could be gently sanded and re-sealed with poly. One of the neatest stocks I've seen apart from this scrape. Rifling/bore appears good. Blueing is notably very good. Bolt looks like it's brand new, suspect it's never been used. Machining is lovely on this on too. Stock has refurbishment marks, as they all seem to have. Crown not counter-bored, all good there. One thing, I do not have sling or bayonet. You can buy those at Raleigh gun shows, or at some of the local shops, e.g. sovereign gun has boxes of them. I am able to meet in Apex, Cary, Morrisville or RTP areas. Happy to send more photos."

I've had it for a few years but its just been sitting in my safe. I haven't used it, so maybe you can. It's only had 2 rounds put through it. Quite a little gun. Stainless steel, it only weighs 13.2 oz. It's measurements are 1 1/4"" wide at the grip, 3/4"" at the breach, 4 3/4"" from stem to stern, 3 1/4"" high, with a 3"" barrel. This gun will fit in your pocket, pouch, purse, cell phone pouch, or ????. A very concealable protective weapon. The finish is like new. Barrel shows no signs of wear. Automatic selector from top to bottom barrel. Thumb safety. Shoots .38 or .357 magnum rounds. Made in the USA. Check prices on this web site and Gun Broker. Cabela's looked up the blue book on this gun and it came to $505 + $50 because it's a .357 magnum. That books out to $555. You'll find $400 to be a very fair price. This must be a private party sale if sold in California so for California buyers that means we have to meet face to face, at a FFL dealer where he'll take care of the transfer. You must meet State laws, over 21, no felonies, etc. I will also sell to an out-of-state buyer. I'm not familiar with the laws in all the States. You must know yours. If it's legal to purchase this gun in your State I'll be happy to send it to your FFL once it's paid for. Shipping is $35."

I'm only selling it because I got laid off from my job and need the extra money. This is a very hard to find shotgun right now because it is a tactical shotgun designed for home defense and no one can keep them in stock. I have done no modifications to this shotgun. I do have a MAKO pistol grip I will be including with it ( not installed ). It can be used as just a pistol grip or you can also unscrew the back cap from it to attach a buffer tube and tactical stock. Below are the stats on the shotgun and below that is a description of the MAKO grip. I'm just attaching stock pictures ( for reference purposes) because, as I said, the gun is in new condition. If you really need actual pictures of the gun the just text or email me and I will do my best to provide some.

Product Information
Shop more Surefire products The SureFire High-Capacity Magazine is compatible with all Mil Spec AR-15 variants and other firearms that function with standard AR-15 pattern magazines. Constructed entirely from Mil-Spec aluminum and then Type III hard coat anodized for durability. Surefire magazines feed smoothly and reliably were designed to be left loaded indefinitely. Additionally, Surefire Magazines can be disassembled for cleaning via the removable floorplate. Also, unlike other high capacity magazines, the Surefire High-Capacity Magazines DO NOT require dry lubricants for reliability.

Due to their unique 4x2 quad stack configuration, the magazines add firepower without excessive bulk. The 60-round magazine is only an inch and a half longer than a standard 30 round magazine and narrower than two 30-round magazines clipped together.

Surefire High-Capacity Magazines can be seated in a rifle with a closed bolt, even when fully loaded-no downloading required. Surefire ensured this by allowing for differing tolerances between SAAMI and NATO specifications.

Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip.

Made a 9mm Glock race gun instead since there are more parts readily available and plenty of ammo. Collected everything in the pictures over the course of the last 2 years. Hardly got a chance to shoot this that much. I've put fewer than 500 rounds through it and I've kept it more than maintained. The scope mount is an original HK part and is quite hard to find, also have extra screws for it. Also comes with a caliber conversion ported barrel for 400 Cor-bon and 30 rounds of 400 Cor-bon and 9 pieces of brass. I shot a magazine of 10 and lost 1 at the range, which sucks because this is rare ammo, unless you reload of course. Also comes with Streamlight UTL with batteries and an extra bulb, some 45 ACP brass from all the rounds I've shot, 250 rounds of Remington UMC, and 20 rounds of Federal Premium JHP, 6 magazines (4 standard ten round, and 2 original 12 round), I also have 2 extended length National Match 45 ACP barrels (only one has been used as a practice barrel.) Original box and papers included. Also, this is a variant 1 double/single action pistol, I have also had a match trigger and match hammer installed, as well as switch the safety from the right to the left side and I used an HK45 safety lever, which is slimmer and fits and operates perfect, original left hand safety included too, for you weird left handed people out there! I've put too much into this gun and really hate to see it go... but right now there are more important things. I prefer to deal local, preferably with fellow WA Arms Collectors or those who have their CPL, but I can ship through my local FFL to you, but you will have to pay actual shipping & your FFL fee. Remember... I'm a collector, I love BS'ing about guns... and I love trades if it's right!!

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters.

DESCRIPTION: For sale is a Used FNP-45 Pistol. The FNP-45 Ships with FN Herstal Original Manufactures Case, Original Instructions Manual for Pistol and all other original documentation from factory. Comes with Factory Warranties or as expressed by the OEM. 

If you are looking for an FNP-45, but in USED/NEW condition, this is it. This Pistol is in Great, Clean Condition and sells for half the price of a tactical version for basically the same gun ($1399).  As the Owner I am obsessive about cleanliness and you won’t find a cleaner Pistol. This auction is for a used/like-new FNP-45. It has L&R ambidextrous decoking levers, removable back straps, accessory rail, loaded chamber indicator, external hammer, polymer frame and stainless steel slide. It comes with two 14 round magazines.

The FNP offers all of the features that dedicated hand gunners want. The ergonomic polymer frame has a low bore axis for less felt recoil and improved control. The grip panels are checkered and ribbed for comfortable, no-snag carry. The profiled stainless steel slide has cocking serrations front and rear, and the 4"" hammer-forged stainless steel barrel delivers pinpoint accuracy. Ambidextrous operating controls make the FNP perfect for competition or personal defense."" USA Made.

You can read a review of this model here: GunBlast.com Review 

The DT Sport proved to be one hundred percent reliable, as expected. The carbine fed, fired, and ejected every cartridge perfectly. Accuracy was excellent, especially considering the mil-spec trigger. I do much better work with a match trigger, such as the Alexander or Timney, but this carbine is built for fighting, and the trigger is well-suited to that task. The AR-15 is a wonderful concept, and Del-Ton executes it very well. The Del-Ton rifles are built very well, and just because the DT Sport is one of the most affordable AR-15 carbines available, does not mean that it sacrifices on quality. The DT Sport has everything that you need, and nothing that you don’t. It performs as well as rifles costing three times the price, and buying a basic rifle such as this leaves a lot more cash to purchase a good optic, plenty of extra magazines, and ammunition. You can’t have too much ammunition. The stuff keeps well, needs no refrigeration, and several thousand rounds will fit neatly under your bed. Buy it while you still can.

Apex Tactical Hard Sear = $42  http://www.midwayusa.com/product/551730/apex-tactical-hard-sear-s-and-w-m-and-p-9mm-luger-357-sig-40-s-and-w-steel 

Desantis Nemesis Pocket holster = $17  http://www.midwayusa.com/product/995917/desantis-nemesis-pocket-holster-ambidextrous-glock-26-27-kel-tec-p11-p40-s-and-w-m-and-p-9c-40c-s-and-w-m-and-p-shield-taurus-709-slim-nylon-black

Total = $534 before any taxes or shipping was added 
I rounded down to an even number which gives what I believe is a very fair price for this carry setup.

Price is $530 

This is everything that you need to start carrying this pistol minus ammo. 
I am not interested in trades unless it is a Gen 4 Glock.

SLING
a new standard for tactical slings when introduced to the public in 1989. It ushered in the era of the modern tactical sling, allowing fast presentation of the long gun, immediate transition to the sidearm and secure retention from snatch attempts.
It also converts immediately to a standard carry sling just by pulling the body loop closed. Real world high-speed users include L.A.P.D. SWAT, Phoenix P.D. SAU (SWAT) and Marine Corps Force Recon units, just to name a few. Combat-proven around the world in every environment, it's versatility makes it superior in both urban close-quarters battle and field operations. Tough, simple and functional, it still sets the standard by which all others are judged.

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle. If you have any question please email me, thank you"

Manufactured in 1891. If being a Deluxe model with 3X walnut wasn't rare enough, this one comes with a special order 30"" long octagon barrel (26"" standard). According to ""The Winchester Book"" written by George Madis, on guns before serial number 100,000, 1 of each 900 rifles had a longer than standard barrel, 1 of each 320 guns had special wood, 1 of each 400 guns had pistol grips and 1 of each 570 had checkering. Add all of these rare features on a gun of this high condition and you quite possibly could have a one of a kind rifle. This rifle comes with a letter from the Cody Firearms Museum confirming all features and originality. There were only approx. 159,990 Model 1886's manufactured between 1886 - 1935. As for condition, overall this rifle would rate 96% or better. The receiver retains nearly all of its original, very vibrant case coloring, with almost all of its original clear coating as well."
