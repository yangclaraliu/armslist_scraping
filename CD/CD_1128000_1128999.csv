A LEGENDARY FIREARMS

The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrote them.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. 


. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may easily ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. The grip frame is flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control. 
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm. This INOX is presented with 2 - 15rd mags. Additional factory mags available as in stocd,

46,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1128046,For Sale/Trade:  7.62 NATO ammo and brass combo! $10,"Smyrna, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 10,"Listed On: Thursday, March 21, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"6 rounds of 7.62x51 South African surplus ammunition and 48 once-fired brass cases of boxer-primed 7.62 NATO. I'm throwing in a 7.62 stripper clip too. If you shoot and reload 7.62 NATO, this is a value package just for you!

Details: The 6 rounds of 7.62x51 South African surplus ammunition is dated 1984 (headstamp 84-12). This ammunition was originally sold in a 140-round sealed South African battle-pack. I have personally fired some of this ammunition out of my Ishapore Enfield and it functioned flawlessly. I later sold my Enfield and bought a Savage in .308 Winchester so I prefer to shoot that instead of 7.62 NATO.

The 48 once-fired brass cases of 7.62x51 NATO (boxer-primed) are a mix of LC (Lake City), SBS (Santa Barbara Systems), WCC, and TAA08. Sampling a handful of them, most of them seem to be Lake City. Almost all of them have NATO cross headstamps. I am selling these cases because I only want .308 Winchester cases and these were mixed in with the batch I bought. I know they are basically the same but the pressures differ slightly and I'm reloading for precision so I don't want variances.

Price for everything is $12. Cash payment only please. Buyer must be at least 18 years old. You'll need to come and pick it up in the Smyrna / Vinings area.

Great way to start off the new year. Anyways, The weapon is fairly new and has had around 200rds through it. I bought this weapon with the intentions to SBR it, but, things have changed in my life. When it was received from CAI the rear sight was slightly off-centered which has been the only issue but it works completely fine. Surprisingly accurate at 50 yards and this weapon is EXTREMELY LOUD, like very loud. I have worn earmuff ear protection and it still rings my freakin bell. Weapon punches out a nice 2 foot flame when you fire it too. I really enjoyed this gun, it is so much fun to shoot.The weapon comes with one 30rd promag and one 40rd steel mag.

About this one: 
-I am the original owner. I bought it at the store about a quarter of a century ago before they stopped importing them. (Man, that makes me sound old.)
-It has had maybe 50 rounds through it. They were all flawless as you would expect of an AK. Other than that it has been a safe queen. 
-It's practically new with the same box and goodies I left the store with. Three mags, sling, bayonet w/ scabbard, oil bottle and cleaning/tool kit that fits into the stock. All goodies are in great shape to. 
-Some interesting features are that it's age exempts it from 922r compliance, chrome lined bore, threaded barrel, and very lightweight. 
-As time marches on these little jewels become harder to find and their value and desirability continue to rise. This one is like new with a known history.

This is considered to be one of the best CCW revolvers ever made, and the only reason I’m considering parting with it is because I am consolidating calibers and only keeping my .38s.

This is a 4th Generation Charter Arms “PUG” from the plant in Shelton, Connecticut, and is the best model they’ve ever designed. The alloy frame keeps it light, the 2"" barrel keeps it pocketable, and the .44 Special cartridge packs the punch of a .45 ACP with far less recoil than a .357 Magnum. Magnum recoil is very sharp and snappy, whereas the .44 Special is more like a firm push. This is the best big bore caliber for short barrels or recoil sensitive shooters, and is a very accurate round.

The PUG has a stainless finish, practical sights, and a snag-free DAO hammer. Lockup is very tight and revolver has a VERY low round count. It is practically in like new condition.

There is exactly 120 rounds of defense ammo that goes with (80 rds Gold Dot, 20 rds Silvertip). I'll also throw in an IWB holster to complete the package.

I’m asking only $500 CASH for the revolver and ammo, which is a very good deal. Not particularly interested in trades, but I might consider a good quality .38 Special snubnose, depending on your offer.

Face to face local transaction with LEGAL buyer only. I reserve the right to refuse to sell to anyone I don’t like, or to withdraw this item from sale at any time."

It has 133k miles. Kelly Blue Book value for the 1998 Mazda 626 Lx with 155k miles is $3,500.00. My Mazda has lower miles for its year. This car is not in mint condition. The paint is oxidised from the son and there are a few minor tears on the front seats from wear. There is zero body damage the body is perfect. I drove this car for a little over 4 years with no problems it is a great car however the last time I drove it the tranny was slipping into third. I like to take care of my vehicles so I just parked it because my brother had just left to the AF so I had an extra car to drive. I parked the Mazda and it sat. It has been parked for a little over a year so it needs a tune up and a new tranny filter. The other day I charged the battery and tried to start it. It wanted to start and kind of sputtered but wouldnt turn all the way over. A mechanic came to look at it and said it just needs a good tune up and a new tranny filter. I'm asking a nice dependable handgun plus 200 dollars.I am not a fool I know what this car is worth. If I had the money I would get it fixed and sell it for a lot more however I'm in need of a nice handgun. I'm starting the police academy next semester and I need a reliable handgun for class. So if you want a nice but cheap car and you have an extra handgun laying around then this car is for you. Buyer is responsible for their own tow to either a mechanic or home. Like I said it wants to start but needs a good tune up first. If you'd like to bring your own mechanic to look at it and verify what I have already said that's fine with me.  I can send more pics  upon request threw picture message. If your interested please feel free to email me and Ill get back to you as soon as possible. Or you can call or text me at REDACTED I prefer texts but calls are fine. I work graveyards 7 days a week so I'd prefer calls in the afternoon but texts anytime. Also feel free to contact me after hours into the early morning. I am older then 21 years of age and I am not a felon I have my right to bare arms. I have a valid Colorado drivers license I can provide for proof of age and I can sign bill of sale. Thank you for your time. God Bless"

Hotchkiss ""type Universal"" submachine gun is one of most unusual weapons that appeared during early post-WW2 period. It was announced by once famous French arms-making company Societe des Armes a Feu Portatives Hotchkiss et Cie in 1949, and was produced until about 1952. The idea behind this gun was to made it as compact as possible when carrying or storing; the intended market for such weapon could be either paratroopers or people engaged in all sorts of clandestine operations. As a result of development, the ""type Universal"" submachine gun was able to be folded into a rather small package, only 440mm long when completely ""collapsed"". On the minus side, resulting weapon was overly complicated and expensive to make.  Small number of Hotchkiss ""Universal"" submachine guns saw action during earlier stages of war in the Indochina; few were purchased by Venezuela during early 1950s,

Uses a simple blowback action. It fires from open bolt, and capable of selective fire (fire mode selector is made in the form of cross-bolt button above pistol grip). The cocking handle has a sliding dustcover on its slot, and does not move when gun is fired. The sights consist of hooded front and flip-type aperture rear, marked for 50 and 100 meters.
 The buttstock and pistol grip are made from sheet steel. When gun need to be collapsed, the pistol grip is pivoted forward to cover trigger guard, and magazine housing is folded forward to lie below the barrel. The buttstock then folds down and forward, and locks to the outer walls of magazine housing. If gun has to be further collapsed, operator shall depress a special latch that is located at the front of receiver, below the barrel. barrel then can be pushed backwards and into the receiver."

Taken off display.  This gun has a problem: the safety is not lining up with the firing pin to engage correctly.  To correct this issue I have replaced the trigger and sear and the main spring.  The problem is still there.  The bolt assembly is not original to the gun, and I suspect that it is off just enough to cause this problem.  I will be at the gun show in Wilmington at the armory looking for spare parts to fix this.  I will also have the rifle there for sale.  Once I fix this problem, the price will go back up.  The rifle fires fine, but no safety is an issue for some people. :)

I am selling all 500 rds for $200 firm. There is no need to email to see if it is available. If you are seeing this then it is available. Just email me for a time to pick it up. I am located in Cary at the intersection of Kildaire Farm Rd and Ten Ten Rd. 

Thanks!"
