The 91/30 appears unissued, the bore is very tight (a .308 projectile will not slip in the muzzle) with bright lands and grooves.

Ammo consists of one sealed can (440 rnds) of polish light ball 149 grain I believe.  310 rounds of chech light ball in paper packages/ loose.

Brass is boxer primed, mostly S&B head stamp, once fired.  A few are badly dented, call it 40 total.

Boom Holsters doesn't need to resort to such behavior, our products and service will speak for themselves.  To that end, we are offering up our latest Glock 19 holster - made out of thick, heavy duty 0.093 inch thick Kydex - 1/3 thicker than our standard 0.060 kydex - at the low price of $25 (50% off) to show the quality of the product you get with a Boom Holster. 

This holster - like all of our others, is backed by our unconditional lifetime warranty. If you manage to break it - we will replace it. 

We mold our holsters around Rings Blue Guns - THE professional's choice of not only the majority of custom holster makers, but also they are the preferred non-firing training gun for law enforcement, private security, and martial artists nationwide because they are molded to the exact dimensions and detailing of the real guns. These are also the demonstrators of choice for other businesses in the firearms accessories industry - pick up any Crimson Trace demo model at your LGS and chances are it is mounted on a Ring's blue gun. Same with Streamlight, Insight Technologies, and SureFire. These guns are made from hard polymer - similar in composition to that of the Glock and Smith & Wesson polymer pistols - and withstand repeating heating and cooling.  We can, and do, mold our holsters around real guns when needed - though it is NOT needed when we have a Rings blue gun mold for your particular gun.

The gas block is new and in factory packaging. The picture below is a pic of an older build that I used one of these (badass) JP's gb's on last year. These adjustable gas blocks are great. They allow you to regulate the gas flow into the system by adjusting a set screw with an allen wrench. This not only allows you to adjust for different loads, but it also allows you to get the bare minimum amount of gas to reduce recoil.

It has been enhanced with several $$$ added features. Springfield built this gun on a Springfield Series 70 frame and slide.

It has been Enhanced with a Wilson Combat (match) threaded barrel. It shows an attached screw on compensator (also takes a suppressor or just a knurled thread protector) and a Wilson fitted bushing & link. Has S.S. Mag well, Target grips, Wilson Extended takedown and ambidextrous safety and an extended mag release button. Also has the Wilson two piece solid guide rod with spring and reverse rod holder.

This gun with the enhanced trigger group including combat hammer, has as nice of a trigger pull on it, as guns costing twice as much as I'm asking. I believe the series 70 frame and slide has something to do with that as well.

Slide and frame fit like a glove, and move as smooth as glass together, with no play or hesitation at all, and makes the gun much more accurate than I am as a shooter. I would consider the overall finish as 98%+.

If you are looking for an easy shooting (reduced recoil when using the  compensator) .45 for pleasure, tactical use, or to possibly get into a little competition without a lot of investment, then this is the 1911 for you.

I already have (5) other .45's so I decided to sell this little treasure to someone that can do it justice.

May consider the following pistols as potential trade material with some added cash on your end, if they are in excellent LNIB condition:

      I have for sale a barely used T/C Omega (Made in the USA-owned by Smith and Wesson). This is one of most accurate and hard hitting muzzleloaders on the market. The 28"" barrel gives you more compression time thus more speed coming out of the muzzle. Below I have copy and pasted the info from T/C's website on the gun however, chances are if you looking at this you already have an idea about how great of a gun this is... I am also topping this off with a Thompson Center ""Hawken Hunter"" 3-9x40 muzzleloader scope ($150 value) with Weaver style rings and basemount.  Additionnally this setup includes the T/C sling with speedloaders and a guncase.  I will also mount and bore-sight the complete setup for you included in the price."

These are the exact same memberships as described, with all of the benefits.  They are fully transferrable, to anyone after assignment to you. The school is fantastic, and the membership is the second highest level, the available class list is basically any class, lifetime membership, no charge for any class at all. I am a diamond member and was offered a chance to purchase them at a substantial discount-do not be afraid of the purchase price on the website, nowhere near what i am valuing them. I have all of the documents, and would be happy to let you call to verify the info with frontsight.  Email me with pictures of what you have, and depending on the weapon, we could make a deal on how many i would offer. you could sell them, give them to family, etc-they are fully transferrable once assigned. I would assign the memberships to you, and they would verify with you, and once i recieve the paperwork and your membership card we would make the deal.

I have substantial amounts of high quality 22LR ammo, (9MM also but I'm not as motivated to part with it) and I really don't want to outright sell it as these prices are just not sitting well with me. I bought ammo over the last year to use and keep, not really profit off of it. However, if you have something in the gun/ammo/outdoor arena that would make a cool trade then I would consider it. I have plenty so no need to email me just wondering what I have - specific trade suggestions considered only.

The bulk of the ammo is the new Tactical Winchester M-22, which is Winchester's answer to the CCI-AR ammo - it is specifically made for the newer semi auto 22's, and works great in my M&P 15-22 rifle and M&P 22 pistol.  It is a little faster than the CCI, and has a black copper plating.  All my ammo is stored in humidity controlled safes.  I also have other's like MiniMags but I mostly use them for hunting so if I trade them away they will have to be replaced by me eventually.

If you have a gun, revolver, Eotech, moped, or whatever would make a cool trade, just shoot me an email through here and we will see if we can work something out!  Some items that I do not have interest in is cheap guns, AR's, AK's, .223ammo, .308ammo - I have turned all those down due to lack of interest on my end.  I'm open to most quality items, however when it comes to ammo right now everything I have is chambered in .22 or 9mm."

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

These are 22LR MP5 clones by German Sports Guns (GSG) that have been upgraded to look like the real MP5 by throwing on the early A2 style lower and rail system that allows you to mount flashlights, lasers, fore grips or anything you want that will go on the 1913 authentic barrel shroud that has the trademark, caliber and qd laser engraved on to it. I've added the rail system and SEF lower receiver. 

Second up is the GSG5-pk that is almost complete. I'm modeling it after the SP-89 by H&K that were produced as a semi-auto 9mm civilian version of the mp5k model. I upgraded the lower receiver to the SEF lower and ordered the fore-grip that emulates the SP-89 look. It was very rare and now they are worth upwards of 7,000-8,000.00 per unit. Both models will come with rail mounts on top. Either model you wish to purchase comes with 2 magazines. The rifle comes with 2 22rd magazines and the SP-89 comes with one 10rd magazine and one 22rd magazine. 

If you would like to purchase a kit to make your GSG look like these I have 5 sets to sell for 80.00ea. They come pre-cut and ready to mount. If you need help installing, I can do it for a fee of 50.00.

The original rubber grips have been swapped out for aftermarket wood stocks with gold Colt medallions (sorry, I did not receive the originals). Mechanically this Anaconda is in fine shape with good timing and lock-up. It's been fired, but not that much. The bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling.
