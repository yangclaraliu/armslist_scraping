Smith with target sights and the ribbed rail.  Very clean gun with tiny holster ware on muzzle.   Hardly been turned really.  Bought it from my friend who inherited it from his Dad who bought it new.  My friend is not an enthusiast and never shot it.  I've owned it 10 years and have maybe put a box and a half through it.  When I got it it really didn't look like it had been used much at all.  The main blemish is a little holster wear near the muzzle.  Has nice wood checkered grips but I don't think they're original because there is no S&W insignia.  I'm selling the gun because I need the money but I won't take less than 495$.  Thank you for looking."

I purchased this Sub2K in the spring of 2012 (either March or April of 12'), and it's had no more than 300, maybe even 400 rounds through it since that time.  
I upgraded this Sub2K with a (RFB-420-2) quad-rail that was mounted with upgraded with Mil Spec Pan Head Phillips Machine Screws, Size: ""8-32 #2 Drive. 5/16 from McMaster Carr''. I found these to hold the quad rail 100% secure compared to the factory screws provided by Kel Tec.  All four sides of the quad rail are equipped with Kel Tec brand Picatinny Rails (SKU: SUB-420-R).   In additional to the upgraded factory quad rail is an inexpensive, yet very efficient Tasco red dot optic that is mounted on a 1/2'' riser to co-witness the front sight.  Also installed is a Kel-Tec (SUB-230A) factory sling to make carrying it a lot easier.  

I will add some pictures later tonight when I get home. 

In addition to the upgrades explained above, this rifle comes with a 10rd Glock magazine, original box/instructions/ & key that secures the rifle when folded/closed in half.  I will also include the original factory/standard rail (in which I replaced) that almost all of  the Sub2K's are sold with.  

This rifle is extremely easy to field strip & clean, and I am also willing to demonstrate first hand to the new owner how to take it apart and thoroughly clean it.  I personally keep all my firearms in tip-top shape and this Sub2K is no different."

Fluvanna Ordnance is a veteran owned company, and have experience through multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan utilizing this platform. Mass production has led to poor tolerances, parts that simply do not meet muster, and a gun that was a shadow of what the 870 once was. For three months we modified and tested our R&D 870, until finally what we felt was perfection was achieved. One of the primary goals being able to use an optic or tritium bead, and not have it “Figure 8” when charging the next shell. After careful analysis we found all the key friction points to accomplish the smoothest cycling possible from a pump shotgun. The ramps on the charging handle have been re-worked and smoothed to pass the springs in the receiver more efficiently. The Bolt has been smoothed to glass on the bottom, the bolt internals completely re-worked to get a fluid relationship between them and the follower. The bolt follower has been smoothed and polished, the sharp angles worked into a smooth radius and polished and all imperfections from casting re-worked and polished. All the parts of the trigger group have been re-worked and polished meticulously, until the feedback from the trigger pull was smooth and precise. Simply put, the operator will know exactly when the shot will be released, unlike originally where a firm pull was required throwing the gun slightly off target, now a gentle squeeze is all that is required; and the operator knows precisely when the shot will come. After completion of all the modifications, the Receiver/Charging Handle/Barrel/Shell Tube/Billet Shell Follower/Bolt/Bolt Internals and Bolt Follower were all coated In Nickel Boron X; and all parts listed except the bolt internals/follower/shell follower coated with a High-Heat Ceramic that has many attributes. The looks and durability are bar none the finest, heat dissipation is vastly improved, and it can be painted to adapt to varying environments if need be, and stripped easily without taking the ceramic coating off. The buffer adaptor is also ceramic coated. The trigger, QD sockets, shell saddles, big-dome safeties, rails, barrel clamp, weapon light rail, castle nut, buffer lock plate, shell door and every single bolt have had Cerakote applied. We took it to the level of Cerakoting every bolt as they are now completely corrosion proof. This model has Quick Disconnect sling attachment points, or 5 if the weapon light rail is removed. The weapon light rail can be swapped to either the left or right side depending on Operator preference as well. Once the function had been properly attended to, form was given the next highest priority. Almost every part is done in contrast to the surrounding parts, creating a vivid portrait of the attention to detail involved in these builds. These are truly works of flawlessly functional art, and honestly may never be taken to this level again except by special request, as the time involved surpassed anything we expected initially. Our gunsmiths and designers are perfectionists, so until what we felt was perfection was achieved we did not stop. This build utilizes a Mesa Tactical High-Mount buffer adaptor and Enidine hydraulic buffer assembly, mitigating recoil by 70%. A load of 00 Buck shot produces just over 600 foot pounds of felt recoil, with this setup that is reduced to just over 200 foot pounds of felt recoil. There are other similar systems on the market, but the Enidine marketed by Mesa is the finest and guaranteed for 2 million cycles. Utilizing M4/AR 15 collapsible butt-stocks and grips are made possible by this system as well. This build utilizes the Magpul MOE forend, Magpul MOE grip, Magpul ACS-L Stock"

I just want to sell it out, that's why am selling it cheaper, you can never know what you are getting for this cheap not until you get a hold of it.

The 500 is unusual amongst Tanaka revolvers in that there is no gas nozzle/adaptor to allow you to extend the fill nozzle on a gas can to reach the cylinder mounted gas nozzle. This is because the 500's cylinder is so large in diameter that a gas can's nozzle can align directly with the cylinder simply swung out.

BIG. There is no other word for it.

The gun is truly huge, dwarfing the M29 and even the mighty Desert Eagle.

Some statistics - Length 15"", Cylinder length 2.25"", real steel weight 2kg...

However, you do not get the sense of how big it is just from these photographs because everything is to scale. The frame has to be massive, because the cylinder (only holding 5 rounds and there are 5 fake rounds in there) is so vast.

The Rubber Hogue like grips, however, look a little odd, because S&W (and Tanaka, by copying it) made them in the same dimensions as the K frame revolvers, like the model 19 .357 magnum, a whole frame size smaller than the old .44,"

I just want to sell it out, that's why am selling it cheaper, you can never know what you are getting for this cheap not until you get a hold of it.

The 500 is unusual amongst Tanaka revolvers in that there is no gas nozzle/adaptor to allow you to extend the fill nozzle on a gas can to reach the cylinder mounted gas nozzle. This is because the 500's cylinder is so large in diameter that a gas can's nozzle can align directly with the cylinder simply swung out.
First Impressions

BIG. There is no other word for it.

The gun is truly huge, dwarfing the M29 and even the mighty Desert Eagle.

Some statistics - Length 15"", Cylinder length 2.25"", real steel weight 2kg...

However, you do not get the sense of how big it is just from these photographs because everything is to scale. The frame has to be massive, because the cylinder (only holding 5 rounds and there are 5 fake rounds in there) is so vast.

The Rubber Hogue like grips, however, look a little odd, because S&W (and Tanaka, by copying it) made them in the same dimensions as the K frame revolvers, like the model 19 .357 magnum, a whole frame size smaller than the old .44,"

No FTF, FTE or other jamming issues. Is completely ambidextrous for either left or right hand shooters. Charging handle and ejection port can be changed to opposite side.

This has the new heavy barrel on it to improve accuracy and reliability. Is pretty accurate out to 200 yards. I love it because I can use the Glock mags in this or in a handgun.

The butt stock has a partial Coyote tan coating and comes with 5 rail guard caps that are matching Coyote tan for the quad rail. Has very little recoil and is a joy to shoot from the shoulder or on a bench using the included grip-pod. My wife loves shooting it as well because of the low recoil and it's accuracy.

All in all I love this gun but I have a baby due soon and would rather have the money for her. Overall worth of gun is $675 + 5 mags equal to $135 or more + Grip Pod $30. Could easily be sold for $800+. Not willing to budge on price because Buy It Now price on gunbroker is $700. Plus the fact that it comes with 5 Glock factory mags and rail caps.

Don't. Just, do not support the disgusting practices that are being carried out on this site. When you see someone selling .22lr for $0.20-.30 a round, or .22 for $1 per round, DON'T TALK TO THESE PEOPLE, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM.
These people are the largest reason that ammo is so difficult to find right now. They go down to the store at 6am, buy every single box they can (even if they have a 1 box limit. These people are scammers, they know how to get around it.) then immediately come onto Armslist, and sell it foe $50 a box. This is truly disgusting that people do this. I understand that everyone wants to try and turn a quick buck now and again, but the way this is going has got to stop. This hobby is a truly wonderful one, but we need to support each other during this shortage. We cannot support these people and their practices.

Its BS but what are ya gonna do....

As such, I am looking to sell my AAC Tirant 45 Suppressor to a PA resident. The can has about 250 rounds through it and was painstakingly cleaned after every trip to the range. Zero issues with the can, absolutely no baffle strikes or any problems. It is truly awesome to listen to it. Potential buyers can demo the can with me at a local range if so desired to hear its awesomeness. I have multiple pistons for different thread types and calibers which I will also include (a $200 value) if I don't sell them first.

If you wish to proceed to purchase, you must be a PA resident, at least 21 years of age, have an absolutely pristine criminal background, know the type of transfer that makes sense for you (individual, Trust, LLC/Corp), and be willing to wait 6 months for ATF to process your paperwork before you can take delivery.

Here is the process:
1.) Pay for the item ($500 to me, the seller)
2.) I will complete with you the form 4's and US Citizenship form 
3.) Get 2 passport photos taken from Walgreens or CVS and attach them to the Form 4
4.) Get your county's Chief Law Enforcement Officer (CLEO) to sign off on your Form 4 (not needed for trust or LLC/Corp route, only individual transfer). At the same time, your CLEO signs off on your form they will also do your fingerprints cards which go up with the Form 4.
6.) Write a $200 personal or cashiers check made out to the BAFTE
5.) Together, we will double check your forms & cards, then I mail them along with your $200 Check to the ATF (total cost to you is $750 all in) I paid over $1000 all in FYI.
6.) Wait 6 months for the ATF to process your paperwork
7.) One of the best days of your life comes when you get a call from me saying that your Form 4 came back with the tax stamp approved by the ATF for you to own the item. After we hang up, come over and pick up your suppressor and have a great life!"

Rifle shoots great. The mags are old, once the first round is chambered never had problems, Sold the M16 full auto Nickel boron bolt,  7.62x39 rifles Short stroke with full weight bolts, This rifle needs a Ar-15 Bolt or a SP1 Bolt Carrier Only..  nothing fancy. not a m16/full auto..  Rifle shoots flawlessly like any 5.56 rifle with correct bolts. Guranteed any other 7.62x39 wont be built to last longer than this. An LMT Superbolt is required to shoot 7.62x39, every other 7.62 bolt breaks(Period). Also WPA classic ammo is underpowered can also cause short strokes on most rifles.  Nice Remington ammo or brass cased ammo is more consistant, but is also more expensive.. This rifle shoots WPA ammo Perfectly fine..  I chronographed WPA ammo at 2,400 FPS avg which is great :-).
