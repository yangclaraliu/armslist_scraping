Apparently stopping and frisking New Yorkers for the fun of it, telling them what sort of drinks they are allowed to buy, and strictly controlling new mothers access to  baby formula  isn't enough for Bloomberg, who recently stated: ""I do think there are certain times we should infringe on your freedom,”, he know's what's best for you in NC too, and he's going to spend millions to ram his agenda down your throat.

 NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox had this to say about ""universal background checks"":

""
Your Second Amendment freedoms are on the chopping block RIGHT NOW and ONLY YOU can save them.

Next week, your Senators are scheduled to vote on a so-called ""universal background check"" bill being pushed by lifelong anti-gun zealot, Senator Chuck Schumer. Schumer's bill would MAKE YOU A CRIMINAL if you simply transfer a firearm to an aunt, uncle, cousin or lifelong friend without the federal government's approval.

Even worse, President Barack Obama's Justice Department says that Schumer's bill will only be effective if it's coupled with MANDATORY GUN REGISTRATION.

Please call both of your U.S. Senators TODAY and tell them to vote ""NO"" on Schumer's ""universal background check"" bill. Simply call the Senate switchboard at 202*224*3121 and ask to speak with your Senators by name.

Call today, tomorrow, and put a reminder on your calendar to call next week too!

Think about it. Are criminals going to walk into a licensed gun dealer's store and fill out a federal form every time they want to give one of their criminal buddies a gun? Of course not! And Schumer knows it...he's just trying to play us for fools.

This isn't about making Americans safer...it's about leading law-abiding gun owners down the road to gun registration - and ultimately, GUN CONFISCATION - just like we watched happen in England and Australia.

So please, call your Senators RIGHT NOW and tell them to vote ""NO"" on Chuck Schumer's ""universal background check"" bill! Tell them you aren't fooled and they shouldn't be either!

And please, forward this email to your friends and family and urge them to take immediate action.

Thank you!!!

In Freedom,

Chris

Chris W. Cox
Executive Director
www.NRAILA.org""

It's real simple: Do you trust the NRA-ILA executive director or Michael 'stop and Frisk' Bloomberg when it comes to your gun rights? I know who I trust, and it's not Herr Fuhrer Bloomberg.

Contact senators Burr and Hagan and tell them you oppose ""universal background checks"".

Derived from the HK UMP, the USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge. Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HKs line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted. One 10 round magazine included.

HK USC Picatinny Rail Set from HDPS

Complete set of rails for your HK USC carbine. Each set includes the latest 4th generation HDPS rail sets with the improved side for no sharp edges, upper rail is an extended rail to offer more room for preferred fitment of your scope or optic of choice. Rounded front face for a true snag free design as well as a 100% flat fitment giving you a complete rail stability. Each rail is class 3 Mil spec hard coat anodized, in flat black. This is the finest set of rails available. Each set includes the top rail and all 3 of the forward rails as a complete set for your USC. Some consider this set to be a better option than even the HK OEM rails.

5 – (20) Round HK USC Carbine .45 ACP Magazines

The 20 round extended capacity magazine for the USC carbine. Magazine body and follower are constructed of a DuPont Zytel based polymer to ensure a long service life. The springs are made from heat treated Chrome Silicon wire for increased reliability and smooth feeding.

Aimpoint T-1 Micro 2MOA Red Dot Sight

In response to the need for smaller and lighter tactical sights, Aimpoint is proud to introduce the new Micro T-1 electronic red-dot sight. Built to offer the same battle proven ruggedness as larger Aimpoint sights, the Micro T-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. This new compact sight is suitable for use on rifles, carbines, shotguns, submachineguns and handguns. The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics. The Micro T-1 weighs in at only 3.6 ounces, and comes complete with a patent-pending integral Picatinny mount that is keyed into the sight body to absorb recoil."

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

New from SIG SAUER®, the P238 SAS. The pistol has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that’s ideal for concealed carry. It’s just a fraction of the size of our full-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 SAS is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with custom wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. The new SIG SAUER P238 SAS is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.

Included will be the original factory box and two S&W factory 15 round magazines. The pistol is in excellent condition. No significant scratches or dings, very minor holster wear on the slide.

The 5943 SSV is effectively a shorter steel 6906 slide w/3.5"" barrel on an alloy 5900 series size frame. Thus a full size grip and full mag capacity with a shortened barrel for concealment. This was supposed to be Smith & Wesson's answer to the Glock and were made from 1990-1992. It has a flush hammer and low profile sights. It is double action only and there is no manual safety. The trigger pull is relatively short, smooth and breaks cleanly.

on model 60's and model 80's in .22 and .380. My questions are: could it be rare ?
What is it worth ? Should I have it re-blued ? The bluing is at about 80% with pin point rust
spots on 3-4 places.
The Bernardelli web-site is also worthless as an info source, they seem to be more
interested in promoting their late model handguns and their shotguns.
Any knowledgable advice will be appreciated."

Manufacturer: Bulgaria/Russia
manufactured in the early 70's through the 80's

The Silver Tipped 149 grain Boat Tail bullet in this ammunition is unique in that it has a steel shank in the center of the projectile beneath an exterior coating of lead that is bonded to the bullet jacket. This allows the projectile to stabilize in flight and provides the accuracy and penetration of a steel core round while not being harsh on the barrel or bore as is the case with a full hardened steel core. It is the absolute best of both worlds.
Also, the Boat Tail Bullet is more aerodynamic and allows for a flatter trajectory and greater accuracy over a long distance.
This ammo has a copper washed steel case and is berdan primed. The case neck and the primer are sealed for moisture protection. It comes packed in 20rd. military packs, 440rds. per sealed spam can.

In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever or a manual safety by a simple parts change.

No parts missing. 30rd Troy Battlemag rebuild kits available to ship today! These are exactly the same as standard Battlemags only disassembled.

I accept PayPal ""gift"" payments or Postal Money Orders.
Super Fast Shipping! Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate. All items ship via USPS priority mail.

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.

The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits! Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws, you must modify the magazines to limit capacity to 10 rounds in California. I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

What happens to the fingerprints that are stored in the Biometric portable safe box when the batteries die?
The Biometric portable safe box retains all fingerprints in the event of total power loss. Once the power is restored by inserting new batteries the unit will function as it did before the power loss.

Is the Biometric portable safe box fire proof?
No, the Biometric portable safe box is not fire proof or fire resistant. The Biometric portable safe box has been specifically designed for secure access control and convenience.


If I cut my finger, does the fingerprint heal the same as before and will it open my safe?
Usually yes, although if the cut is significant or requires stitches, scar tissue may form as a result causing a change in your fingerprint. That is why we recommend enrolling additional user fingerprints and also fingerprints from your other hand.


Will the Biometric portable safe box scan my finger correctly when my finger/fingerprint is puffy after a shower/swimming?
The Biometric portable safe box has been designed to be very sensitive when authenticating and matching fingerprints. The unit will open when your fingerprint has increased moisture from after an average shower or swim and will open. There may be times when extreme water retention due to extended time in the water will cause a minuet aspect of your fingerprints to change for a short time and access to your Biometric portable safe box may be denied until your fingerprint returns to its ordinary normal condition the same as when you originally enrolled that print.


Can someone cutoff my finger and try to use it to open the Biometric portable safe box?
No, Biometric portable safe box uses technology that detects live fingers for scanning, so in the unfortunate event that a detached finger is used to attempt access the unit will not open.

The wood furniture is very nice and all numbers match.  These are highly collectible shotguns and are tough to find.  The prior owner did cut the barrel down to 20"", but still looks good.

Rebuild kits,"Nationwide, California, United States",$ 25,"Listed On: Thursday, April 4, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"All brand new. No parts missing. 30rd Troy Battlemag rebuild kits available to ship today! These are exactly the same as standard Battlemags only disassembled.

I accept PayPal ""gift"" payments or Postal Money Orders.
Super Fast Shipping! Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate. All items ship via USPS priority mail.

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.

The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits! Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws. In California, you must modify your magazine to hold no more than 10 rounds.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."

Barrel: 
A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.

In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system. The A2 lighter profile barrel allows for better balance and portability over the standard A2 profile and is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider. This is not a ""pencil"" barrel.

Not ""brand new with only 100 rounds through it"" but totally new. I've never even loaded it! This is a quality Bushmaster, and not a cheaper DPMS product, or a plastic Carbon 15.

Comes with:
-Factory box
-2 metal 30-round Bushmaster magazines
-Empty chamber indicator flag
-Lock and key
-Sling
-2 rail risers in case you want to use a big scope
-Warranty
-Owner's manual
-and whatever extra paperwork/coupons/etc might be included normally. 

It is factory built with the receiver-length picatinny rail, 6-position adjustable stock, A2 flash suppressor, bayonet lug, and sling swivels. And unlike most modern AR's, it is stamped on the mag well so you know it accepts BOTH .223 AND 5.56 ammunition, whatever you can find to use - no guessing that the NATO rounds MIGHT go boom without your gun going BOOM!

Also included is:
-A brand new (in the unopened box) BSA 42 mm red-dot scope sight with built-on sun shade
-100 rounds of new brass PMC X-Tac 5.56 55 gr FMJ (perfect military round for this barrel)
-A brand new Tapco Intrafuse AR spanner wrench with a mil-spec castle wrench, receiver extension removal wrench, and A1/A2 flash suppressor wrench. It is manganese phosphate coated for durability, and has a lifetime warranty
-A brand new weather-resistant ammo box large enough for all the extras to fit in

No need to worry about someone's garage build, or whether “100 rounds down range” really means 100 rounds or 5,000.  Plus you can get it sighted in on the range and have some fun banging away without having to wait a couple months to find some clean ammo, or pay $1 a round.

The base model MSRP on this is $1,391.48, and with this deal you avoid taxes, fees, and snoopy government agents.  I saw these at the last gun show going for around $1600 without any extras, so I'm listing it at $1550 (with ammo, red dot, wrench, and ammo box).  Face-to-face cash sale, prefer you have a CCW but not required.

I also have a brand new rail-mountable tactical laser/light combo with pressure switches I can throw in for an extra $40.  I do have up to a couple hundred extra rounds of the X-Tac 5.56 rounds in boxes of 20 I'm willing to sell for the right price with this rifle.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  However, do not ask if this is still available.  If the ad is up, the gun is still for sale.  Do not e-mail me telling me you saw this at Cabella's for $850 two days ago – you're lying and we both know it.  I'll just laugh at you, and probably put your idiocy and name on display in my next gun article for the world to laugh at you.  Ditto if you e-mail me with any other complaints or gripes without actually displaying any interest in the rifle.

Prefer the cash, but may be willing to accept a partial trade for a Bersa Thunder in 9mm or .45 cal."

I have for sale a 1994 Dodge Ram 1500, the truck runs and drives perfectly, It has the 5.2L V8, auto transmission, 4x4. It is a regular cab, long bed pickup truck. It has a steel rear bumper that has been installed, an aftermarket CD player with usb and aux hookups. It has also been rubberized along the trim/bottom of the truck to prevent rust! The oil and all fluids and filters have recently been changed, and it has had a tune up done to it, it has also had both brake lines from the block all the way back replaced. The truck starts right up and will drive anywhere! It has its fair share of nicks and faded paint etc, the windshield is slightly cracked on passenger side, and the steering has some play in it but nothing that affects driving or that even needs to be fixed. The interior is an 8/10 with a few stains etc, but it is a 1994 work truck. It will get you anywhere you want to go reliably. I am also going to throw in some ratchet straps. 

I am looking to buy a small economical gas efficient civic etc so I am selling this to do that. I am asking $2500 OR BEST DECENT OFFER! I AM NOT SET IN STONE ON THE PRICE! The blue book on good and fair for this truck is just over 3,000$. I am asking under Fair value condition. This would be a great work/winter/first truck for someone. Not looking for trades unless its atleast 1500$ cash with it. Give me a call at REDACTED or email me. Thank you!"
