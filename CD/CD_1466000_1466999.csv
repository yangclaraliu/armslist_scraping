As long, as I'm available when you are, I can have it made within a few hours. I'm not professional, but they work great and I'll guarantee them for life. I can use rivets or screws based on request.

          Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject  to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends  only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible  for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the  warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION).

If your firearm is repaired, the time frame until we return your firearm will be longer.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

Down to 14 boxes left at this point. Price is $75/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

In case you're not familiar, this rifle is based on the Pre-64 Winchester model 70 action, which is generally held by real shooters to be one of the finest rifle bolt actions ever made. It's rock-solid and designed to outlast me, you, and your kids.

Hogue fully overmolded stock with a solid aluminum bedding block/pillar system, free floating the barrel.

The scope is a cheap NCStar, but it's VERY high powered (10-40x!) and worked well the day I tried it out.

It includes a Harris-type bipod (not sure of brand, may be a Harris, not sure) and a really nice padded tactical (shock) sling.

The metal has been Duracoated in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) inside and out to protect from the elements, should you decide you need to shoot in foul weather.

This is an extremely rare rifle. There is exactly 1 like it for sale on gunbroker, and none that I can find on Armslist, if that tells you anything.

I've only had it to the range once (got it in trade a while back), but it shot just over 1 MOA with cheap steel case FMJ ammo at 200 yards in a nasty gusting crosswind. All the reviews and range reports I've found say that it's easily sub-MOA with decent ammo. I have no reason to doubt it.

The previous owner told me he had some bolt work done to it, so it's supposed to be slicker than stock. I don't have anything to compare it to, but the action is very smooth.

The trigger is adjustable. I'm not sure how it's set at the moment, but my ""finger scale"" says it feels like around 3.5 lbs with very little travel, so I'm happy.

I'm not really looking to trade, since that would defeat the purpose of ""getting rid of a few guns"", but you're welcome to offer if you have something you think I might like."

In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

If you had not heard, Windham Weaponry is basically a new & improved Bushmaster, the company was founded by Bushmaster's original owner, and employs many of the original Bushmaster employees pre-Freedom Group buyout.  A cool feature of Windham rifles are that it includes a TRANSFERABLE lifetime warranty, so any buyer will benefit form this.  MSRP on this rifle is $1680, and I haven't seen them under $1600 right now.  It's a VERY well made rifle with some high quality components - magpul grip, AFG, and stock, Diamondhead BUIS (the set costs almost $300 alone), Diamondhead Rail, Vortex flash hider.  Also includes 30 round magazine, sling, printed materials, and hard case.  5.56 chamber so you are good to go with .223 AND 5.56 ammunition.

I can send more pictures upon request, sorry for the initial grainy cell-pic.

I am only willing to trade for .308/7.62 platform ARs, and I am very willing to add cash to a trade offer for higher-value .308s.

Upper:
German made Hera Milspec reciever (with forward assist) and IRS free float rail

Hera Arms low profile gas block, Daniel Defense chrome lined gas tube
Spikes Tactical Dynacomp

Northtech Defense billet lower (no rollpin lower, uses all screw construction even for bolt catch)
PSA lower build kit
Magpul MIAD with custom maroon grip storage insert for AA's
Black Magpul UBR with custom maroon panels for the storage compartment.

I built the rifle over the past 6 months or so, carefully selecting each piece that went into its build.  The rifle has all genuine Magpul parts, some of which, like the black UBR, are total unobtainium right now.  The gun shoots around 1.25 MOA with my prefered ammo, recoil is similar to a Ruger 10/22 due to careful balancing of weight in the right places, the midlength gas system and the Dynacomp.  A sweeter shooting AR you will not find.  This is a premium AR-15, I'm asking a lot of money for it because the parts in it are the best of the best.  Period.  

If you'd like the rifle minus the Trij SRS or any of the rail candy, I can part it out.  Please make sure you have a valid NC ID and you're legally able to purchase."

The rifle shoots great and I believe it to either be a ww1 or ww2 bringback since it exhibits no importation markings. The second rifle is an original 1943 dated nagant PU sniper which is also a bring back as it has no importation markings. The only drawback I can see is the previous owner stated the scope had a very worn finish so he reblued the scope. Not really a big deal as the finish on the gun is still original but it was worth mentioning for full disclosure. Rifle is very accurate and shoots well. Very hard to find bring back originals as most are reproductions. Lastly I have a Mauser 24/47 sniper that I
Purchased about 10 years ago that was dubbed a Balkan war sniper They were sold around 2002-2003 as imported. Some came with bases and even scopes but mine was purchased as just the gun with the holes already drilled into the reciever as was done by the army who fielded it as a sniper. Once I received the gun I sent it off to a
Mauser guru who builds guns back to orginal WW2 sniper spec and he completely redid the rifle from top to bottom at the cost of $1200. He basically did about everything you can do to a rifle to make it more accurate from bedding the stock, to action job, to trigger job. He also tru cut the chamber for accuracy as well as trimming any wood that made contact with the barrel and trimmed the barrel bands so they no longer touched the barrel as well. He then topped it off with a vintage weaver scope that looks identical to the ww2 German scopes and added quick release rings for easy scope removal. The results are the rifle shoots half inch 100 yard groups all day long with off the shelf hunting ammo. This rifle is not only a nice example of a WW2 sniper it is also an amazingly accurate shooter that will out shoot most modern snipers. I have tons of money invested into this gun and it shows with not only performance but looks as well. I will also include an additional 3 post reticle scope. I also have 880 rounds of 7.62x54 ammo and 350 rounds of yugo surplus ammo I will include. Looking to sell everything as one lot for $2500 which is a bargain as I have close to $2000 invested in the Mauser alone. Will consider partial trades for original WW1 era 1911s and possibly WW2 1911 A1s. E-mail, call, or text REDACTED."

Like the day it rolled off the assembly line, nobody has monkeyed with the trigger or springs or grips.  Comes with original plastic box and paperwork.  I bought this one off of armslist thinking I would like it as much as my 3"" SP101.

According to my research, these are no longer made but are excellent quality, VERY STURDY and lightweight mounts. Made in Waukesha Wisconsin, this is a one-piece extruded alloy mount wiht a standard Weaver rail on the top and two screws and washers to attach it to the left side of your receiver. This one has been screwed onto a gun once but no scope rings have ever been attached so it is basically new.

Simply remove the small and large trigger pins, install the mount and insert the screws with nylon washers from the right side, then snug them up and install your optics choice on the rail (no rings included but any ring that will fit a Weaver rail will work).
You can quickly mount your scope, red-dot or holographic sight on your shotgun for either hunting turkey or combat competition (three gun).
This should all the 12 gauge Remingtons with two dissimilar pins holding the trigger in. It will NOT fit 20 gauge models as it is, BUT you could easily drill another hole to match your 20 gauge receiver, then it should work just fine.

This has an old price tag on the box of 40 bucks, and these were never cheap. One recently sold on Ebay for $29.95 and shipping:

If you have looked at these you know they are not cheap. This one is an absolute steal at only 20 bucks cash.

Smooth as butter now, no need for a running start just to let the slide catch down anymore and I threw some model paint in afterwards. Not over the top, I like it but if you don't, a little alcohol will take it right out without ruining its finish.
  I may have ammo for it, but depends on when you inquire with me and also what your offer is.
  $400, Trade, or Best Offer. Given the current market and the work I had done, this is worth more to me, but wanna see what's out there or maybe cash if the price is right.

801,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1466801,For Sale:  Beeman Sportsman .22 Air Rifle (Upgraded Spring/Piston),"West Knox, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 150,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 16, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,Break Open                                                                                ,Rifle,"TL;DR: Awesome air rifle for $150.

I have for sale my Beeman Sportsman .22 caliber air rifle.
(Not the craptastic dual-barrel Wallyworld special that has brought shame to the Beeman name.)

I'm selling this because I moved into a house in the suburbs of Knoxville.
My yard is too small to for any shot to be a challenge, and houses surround me in every direction.
I'm looking to sell this air rifle to someone that will come to love it as much as I do.

This rifle was a project to turn a fairly low cost air rifle($200) into something that shot like a top dollar air rifle such as the $700 Beeman R1 Supermagnum.
My father and I started by going through quite a few boxes to find the air rifle with the best tolerances out of the box, paying special attention to the rifling as that was pertty much the only part we did not intend to replace and then sent it off to recieve a Maccari spring, guide, and seal kit.
(This kit is considered one of the best, if not THE best.)
As a result, the velocity was increased and the velocity is amazingly consistant between shots. It also reduces vibration and spring twist, which reduces the felt recoil and improves accuracy greatly.
We considered a new trigger, but the RS2 trigger is a highly adjustable two-stage trigger that ended up feeling well...awesome.
(Imagine a glass rod breaking, you have to feel it to believe it.)
I left on the iron sights, mostly for redundance...it will come with the original 4x32 scope that isn't all that bad.
(I've been using a Bugbuster, but I'm keeping that.)

This air rifle has been chronoed at 850 FPS with LEAD pellets, not the non-lead ultra-light alloy pellets (that don't group worth a rats ass) that most airguns are rated with.
It's capable of some amazing groups at 50 yards, I can keep most of my shots on a quarter...and I sometimes shoot at 150 yards at 5x5 inch steel plates just for giggles.
(keep in mind this is a springer and requires a special artillery hold)

I love this air rifle, I'll be sad to see it go.
Only make an offer if you'll take care of it and use it.
With proper maintainance, this thing will be able to be passed to your kids.

So basically, $200 for rifle + $99 for spring/piston kit + 50 for seals and lubes = $350.
...for a rifle that shoots as well or better than a $700 German made air rifle

To answer some questions I'm sure I'll get...
It was purchased by my father in 1996, back when they were running out of Huntington Beach, CA and the Beeman name still meant something.
(Springs and seals have all been replaced as needed.)
Yes, it was ""Made In China"".
(However, it is not an inferior product. This rifle is a QUALITY product with great tolerances.)
I've never put locktite on any of the threads, as with proper maintainance it's not required due to it not vibrating heavily after every shot.
(Just make sure they're tight before a shooting session, 1/4 turn of the two screws at the front of the forearm can open your groups up 1/2 inch at 50yds.)

Thanks for looking."

                                   HISTORY OF ORIGINATION

PTR-91, is a family of modern, American-manufactured civilian semi automatic rifles. The design is a variation of the Heckler and Koch G3/HK91 rifles. These rifles are produced by PTR Industries, Inc. of Bristol, Connecticut. The abbreviation PTR stands for ""Precision Target Rifle"".

The assault weapons ban of 1994 (which expired in 2004) prohibited certain cosmetic features of the HK91, meaning that it could no longer be manufactured and sold to the US civilian market in its original configuration. Furthermore, the German-made HK91 was specifically prohibited from importation under the 1989 Import Ban. Subsequently Heckler and Koch ceased manufacture of the semi-automatic HK91, and since then civilian versions of the G3 have increased in collector value. The PTR-91 was developed to fill the void, as the two rifles are almost identical.

JLD Enterprises (""JLD"") began manufacturing ban compliant PTR-91 rifles in 2002, after purchasing prints and tooling from Fabrica Militar of Portugal - an HK licensed factory. The ban compliant models did not have a threaded barrel, bayonet lugs, adjustable stocks, or ""high capacity"" magazines. Very early models, being produced directly from the purchased prints were nearly identical to the HK91 with the exception of modifications for compliance with the assault weapons ban. After the ban's expiration in 2004, JLD began offering a wider range of PTR-91 models, many of which featured more of the original military features. JLD also began investing in research and development, and debuted many new improvements and modifications to the original HK91 design. Initially, JLD produced rifles relied heavily on imported military surplus components for G3/HK91 rifles. In fact, most parts between the HK-91 and the PTR-91 are interchangeable."

I believe it is the generation 2 model according to the internet research I did.  I purchased this from a dealer who took it in as a trade-in from a law enforcement agency.  It shows sign of use and holster wear but it's in good functioning condition.  The sights are Tritium night sights but they have pretty much lost their glow due to the age of the pistol.

I have an additional 15 round magazine I can offer the successful buyer for $20 if they are interested.

I will need a copy of the buyer's Colorado drivers license for my records and you will get a bill of sale.  Get it now before you have to pay an additional money to the State of Colorado for a background check and FFL transfer fee.

I will not ship firearms because a couple of deadbeats agreed to purchase firearms on this site and then never supplied payment and a FFL to ship to.  Please, no offers for trades as I want cash.

Lowball offers will not be responded to."
