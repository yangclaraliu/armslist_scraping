Please make sure it is legal to own in your state or region.Manufacturer's Description:
Built off the legendary 700 action, the Remington 700 5-R sets the benchmark for accuracy and durability. Much like M-24, the barrel is cold hammer forged and features 5-R rifling. The 5R rifling profile increases barrel life expectancy, accuracy and creates less fouling and bullet deformation over time. Whether you’re a benchrest shooter or longtime hunter, look no further for better reliability and precision.5-R rifling is the same type of rifling used on the battle proven M-24 SWS. There are 5 lands as opposed to the normal 6 land configuration. Traditional lands are squared off at a 90 degree angle to the groove while the lands on 5-R rifling are tapered at 110 degrees which results in less bullet deformation. Also, none of the lands are directly across from one another. Both of these features lead to better accuracy and less fouling.Legendary Model 700 Stainless Steel Action featuring the “3-Rings of Steel” makes this the strongest action on the market.**Black Cerakote finish for additional protection against the elements**5-R hammer-forged with tactical/target-style rifling like that used in famous M-24 military rifles for the utmost in shot-to-shot consistency**5-R increases barrel life and accuracy, causes less friction and bullet deformation**Tactical bolt knob for easy bullet manipulation**Six longitudinal LTR style flutes reduce barrel weight and increase heat dissipation**H.S. Precision Sand color composite stock with black webbing features full-length aluminum bedding blocks for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency**Dual front swivel stud system for convenient mounting of bi-pod and sling**X-Mark Pro externally adjustable trigger**Silencer ready with 5/8x24 Threads"

Marty ter Weeme of Teppo Jutsu designed the cartridge in 2000 and Tony Rumore of Tromix was contracted to build the first .458 SOCOM rifle in February 2001. Tony Rumore fired the very first round of .458 SOCOM ammunition in the Tromix shop located in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma on February 16, 2001, at 8:30pm. SOCOM is the acronym for the Special Operations Command.NO TRADES"

Puppies are pure bred, mom and dad are our family pets and on scene. Father is imported from Belguim and mother is from a local pet store, parents are both AKC papered but puppy litter is not yet registered. Pups have just turned 7 1/2 weeks and have not yet started their shot routine. Original litter was 9 and only have 2 left. Asking price is 800.00 and is reflective of them not having shots and papers yet. They are due for their shots and when they start they will also get their papers. In the interest of saving money for both parties Id like to sell them prior to this to save expense and time. If your looking for a good family pet and dont care about papers for show etc. then this is a good deal since these pups would normally sell for much more due to bloodline and purity.

Marty ter Weeme of Teppo Jutsu designed the cartridge in 2000 and Tony Rumore of Tromix was contracted to build the first .458 SOCOM rifle in February 2001. Tony Rumore fired the very first round of .458 SOCOM ammunition in the Tromix shop located in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma on February 16, 2001, at 8:30pm. SOCOM is the acronym for the Special Operations Command."
