I found it in Illinois about 10 years ago and every time I get it out for study I notice something different. While there are no markings of any kind I'm sure it is American made, likely 1840 ish but I can't place it North, South or anywhere in the middle. The weight is 9 lb. 12 oz., barrel length is 40.5"" and overall 57.25"". Both barrels are smoothbore and if you look at the photos you can see the bores are of different size. Silver runs from the ramrod pipes to the cheek piece. All the inlays are nailed in place. The butt plate and trigger guard are brass, the guard has a silver overlay on the bow and the lock plates look to be silver plated. The set trigger fires left or right, right or left or both at one time. There is no patch box? The gun is in as found condition with no cracks, splits or breaks. I feel sure the ramrod is a replacement. The price is $2,000 + shipping & insurance NO FFL REQUIRED. Whether you are interested in buying or not, if you think you might have any information on it I would be most interested in hearing from you. I have many more photos. if you want to look just ask."

It has a round 26” barrel and shotgun butt stock. The bore is somewhat rough but shootable with visible rifling and even, shallow pitting from black powder. The case colored receiver is lightly and evenly pitted from rust, with no case color remaining. The barrel and magazine are evenly rusted overall with some slight blue remaining visible. The action is tight. The lower tang shows a lot of blue, and may be refinished or came on another gun. I would speculate that the butt stock is a replacement as well as the magazine retaining band - also probably several screws. But all metal appears to be original Winchester, whether or not it was all born together. The good news is it old enough to be an antique, so no FFL is needed to ship. No letter or box accompanies the gun. That's all I can tell!"

""The development and introduction of the Ruger LCP is in direct response to customer demand,"" said Ruger President, Stephen L. Sanetti. ""We have not been part of this market, but the growing number of states authorizing the licensed carry of pistols for personal protection by law-abiding citizens, and continued demand by law enforcement for quality back-up guns, cannot be ignored. The Ruger LCP is a .380 Auto pistol with superior ergonomic design and handsome styling. It incorporates state-of-the-art polymers, aircraft quality aluminum alloys and high-grade precision steel components engineered for strength and maximum weight savings."" This shape and size of the Ruger LCP is similar to a Kel-Tec 380, but unlike Kel Tec P3AT380s, the LCP offers legendary Ruger reliability and quality craftsmanship. The Ruger LCP is comfortable and affordable, making it a natural choice for a dependable back-up or personal defense carry pistol."

This BCG will work with Colt style AND Glock style AR9 Lowers.Melonite Nitriding treatment turns standard chrome moly steel into very slick, hard and corrosion resistant steel. The Melonite process is a treatment done to both the inside and outside part. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less surface wear which will extend life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier. This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.Item #: BCG9R-MNCondition: New"

Bubba got ahold of both of them, but they are functionally sound. First is a Spanish M95 that I believe started life as a Calvary Carbine. The saddle ring has been removed, and the stock filled and painted. The barrel and receiver have also been painted. The bottom metal needs refinished or painted, as it appears to have been cold blued at some time. It is chambered in 7x57 Mauser. I have only test fired one shot from this rifle. It functions good. Also, I ran a bore scope, and chamber, throat, and rifling look good. Asking 200.00 OBOSecond is a Swedish M94. Bubba got ahold of the stock, and it has been chopped, filled, and rubber recoil pad installed. I have shot this rifle quite a bit, and it is very accurate. It is chambered in 6.5x55 Swede. Asking 300.00 OBO You can email or text me at 865 three three three 81 five four. If you have any questions, please ask. I may consider trades."

The rifle features a 24 inch heavy fluted barrel with a muzzle break, a one piece picitinny rail, digital camo AccuStock, AccuTrigger, and an all steel construction 10 round detachable box magazine by Accurate Mag Company.  In addition to that, I have a 6-18 Vortex Crossfire II scope with a level attached, a cheek riser, and an imitation Harris bipod.  I zeroed the rifle at a hundred yards last August, cleaned it, oiled it, and put it away.  The only adjustment I never made to it is on the magazine feed lip.  I never bothered to buy the adjustment tool because I feed the ammo by hand one round at a time when I shoot long range.  The mag feed lip probably needs to be opened up about 3 thousandths or so to get the cartridges to feed more smoothly.  The adjustment tool costs about 25 bucks.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale.  1000 dollars gets everything I listed in the ad.  900 gets you everything but the optic.  Not looking for trades at this time.  Be sure to check out my ad for an unfired AK47 Arsenal SAM7 UF.  Thanks for your interest."

Also includes all original parts.  Comes with 2 15rd Beretta magazines and 1 10rd Beretta magazine. Gun fires and functions flawlessly and is a pleasure to shoot.  Just as a matter of full disclosure, I DO NOT have the Beretta factory case.  When I bought the gun, the shop could not locate the case in their safe.  Knowing what modern Beretta factory cases are like, I was not concerned with not having one.  Only selling this and my Sig 1911 to help fund a new bike purchase.  Not interested in any trades, only cash.  Will meet at local FFL in South Denver/Centennial to complete transfer and transaction.  Asking $600."
