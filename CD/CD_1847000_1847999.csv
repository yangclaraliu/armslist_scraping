Safety works, every serial number on it matches. Manufactured in either 1895 or 1896. Rearsenaled in 1934. I will admit that it's dirty as hell. It has 95 rounds of Iranian surplus ammo that comes with it. Do NOT expect every round of those to fire correctly. They are known for being terrible. The gun itself is in pretty good shape, no real wear, but there's a ton of grease and dirt on it. The rifling is in excellent condition. It's pretty accurate as well from my (limited) shooting of it.

 hard to find!! Adams Arms Huldra 5.45x39 16"" Complete Upper. Includes BCG! It is brand new in the box, never fired, never attached to a lower. This is a beautiful high quality upper! The pictures show exactly what you will receive.

 The Huldra 5.45 carbine upper comes complete and is ready to go into any mil-spec AR-15 lower. Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome.

 The 5.45x39 caliber bullet matches high muzzle velocity with excellent sectional density, resulting in a flat trajectory and good penetration. The standard ball cartridge will penetrate 5mm of steel plate at a distance of 350 meters. The lowered recoil impulse of the 5.45mm cartridge (verses the 7.62x39mm) has a beneficial effect on accuracy. The 5.45x39mm cartridge is an excellent round that offers comparable penetration, accuracy and lethality to anything fielded by NATO. More importantly, 5.45x39 ammunition is less expensive to shoot! This upper has been designed to handle dirty and corrosive surplus ammunition. The bolt and bolt carrier have been protected by an ion-bond finish. These processes make the parts more corrosive resistant and harder than hard chrome. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surplus ammo without the fear of the parts being unduly worn. Each upper also comes with a 30 round magazine and a Wolff Extra Power Hammer Spring to ignite the older hardened primers.

 The melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrel provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. The melonited barrel has higher lubricity, lasts longer and is just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chamber is speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber.

The rifle will come in a US PeaceKeeper nylon zip case with 4 pouches for magazines and a zip-shut pocket for other necessities while you are at the range.

There was a spot on the ejection port side (right side) where tool marks were left while deal with a stubborn roll pin while assembling the trigger guard. The spot was touched up with an off brand (not birchwood casey) gun bluing by a buddy of mine....but it is still able to be seen. I've attempted to show the spot in the last picture. It could be touched up with some aluminum black for a better match with the rest of the finish. Other than that, this rifle is in fantastic shape with very few other handling marks (opposite side of the trigger guard, and one by the bolt catch). More pictures are available if you are interested.

I have over $1,600 into this package. That said, I don't expect anybody to pay what I paid for it. Sorry, but I am not interested in trades. Cash only. All State and Federal laws apply (24 hour wait, valid FOID card, record of transfer, etc).

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.

The barrel is mounted on a FORGED A3 upper receiver with built in Mil-spec M1913 Picatinny accessory rail, with the correct rail numbers engraved, made from certified forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec. The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover.

Just a little on the GI and PTR: the GI, unlike earlier PTR-91s, is not fickle with ammo. It will eat anything you feed it, and its bolt is huge and rugged. PTR was based in Farmington CT, but announced in the Hartford Courant that, due to that, ahem, esteemed state's new gun laws it would return the ""up yours"" they received by moving. They just announced that they will be moving just north of Myrtle Beach. According to Investors Business Daily, their production run annually increased from 2000 in 2011 to 4400 in 2012, and they are trying to produce 10,000 this year. Nevertheless, they have standing orders for 56,000 rifles - in other words, IF they meet their production goals, they will be back ordered for 5 1/2 years!

This is a lightly used (<100 rounds) PTR-91 GI, with OD green furniture and the naval polymer trigger group. It is THE HK-91 clone, manufactured on HK machinery. Only difference is a hammer forged match grade barrel instead of HKs mil spec.

Comes with everything pictured (plus the original case and manual):

- 24x 20-round HK magazines (4 new, 20 surplus)
- THREE different forends
  -- The original OD (on right)
  -- A UTG milled aluminum tri-rail with rail covers (left, about $40)
  -- An original HK black wide forend with integrated bipod (hkparts.net has just the forend for $200+, with bipod usually retails for $600)
- Factory HK rear sight adjustment tool ($50 on hkparts.net)
- PTR Industries bolt carrier assembly tool ($25)
- Barska cantilevered scope rings
- Simple 3-9x40 Banner/Bushnell scope ($125)

So I have about $2000 sum total in this. But it sits in the back of my safe, and that's no way to treat this gun. Will sell entire package for $1400 cash. Trades are welcome, though there's not much I'm really hunting for. I'm not really interested in shotguns or 1911s, just FYI. And cash trumps all other offers.

Just a little on the GI and PTR: the GI, unlike earlier PTR-91s, is not fickle with ammo. It will eat anything you feed it, and its bolt is huge and rugged. PTR was based in Farmington CT, but announced in the Hartford Courant that, due to that, ahem, esteemed state's new gun laws it would return the ""up yours"" they received by moving. They just announced that they will be moving just north of Myrtle Beach. According to Investors Business Daily, their production run annually increased from 2000 in 2011 to 4400 in 2012, and they are trying to produce 10,000 this year. Nevertheless, they have standing orders for 56,000 rifles - in other words, IF they meet their production goals, they will be back ordered for 5 1/2 years!"

This would be perfect for that.

Comes with 1 factory 10 round rotary magazine.

Has a small scuff as shown behind the ejection port as shown in the photos.  How it got there is a long story, but suffice to say it involves a rogue band of hybrid ninja/samurais, a couple of World War 2 era tanks, and some toenail clippers.  It doesnt affect the operation at all but it's worth mentioning.

It has a scope rail already installed so you can mount your scope, red dot, night vision, or heat seeking lazors on top.

Description:
This is a low round count, beautiful H&K USP Compact Stainless Steel duotone / bitone chambered in .40S&W. Picked up in a trade, this is piece of beautiful engineering. I shot 11 rounds to check its function, which was flawless.

The V1 features a double action/single action hammer fired pistol and has the best slide release I have ever felt. There are many things I love about this gun, however I just don't need two carry guns at this time. The night sights (green front, orange back - pic) have some glow, but would likely need replacing at some point in the near future. This would make a great carry piece.

HK no longer offers the USP line in stainless steel, so if you like the look, this is your chance. If you know anything about HK, the USP will eat anything. It is rated to fire standard velocity ammunition, +P and +P+.

Designed to operate in automatic and semiautomatic applications, it employs a larger hand-wheel and double spring for increased reliability. Unique to this magazine's design is a patent pending feed device that allows the magazine to run massive spring pressures without effecting the firearm's bolt operation. The durable body is constructed entirely of aluminum; and finished in a friction reducing ceramic coating. All internal and operating assemblies are made of black oxide steel and aluminum. Comes with a lifetime warranty and includes an instruction manual. Currently available in black, optional colors coming soon. Please note: That with the wide variance in receiver specs there may need some slight fitting in order to work properly.

Portage IN Chief's car. I just replaced all the Coil Packs, spark plugs, Idler and tensioner pulley, ac compressor, fuel filter, air filter, belt and just had a oil change with the 5,000 mile oil added for extra protection. Mechanically the car is solid, its a P71. We all know these cars are used by police and taxi services because the are extremely reliable. My company gave me a work car, I have my brand new Chrysler and a 79 Z28 + wife's car and we live in a town home with limited parking. The body is solid, there is rust starting to pop out on the lips of the fender wells, and on the lower part of the drivers fender. The trunk does have to plugs and the roof has one. It has the black cop rims with the chrome center caps, and the black grill. The paint is still bright, the spot light works and its fun driving because all the idiots that drive slow in the left hand lane surly move out of your way when your coming up behind them. Great if your running late. 

The car is what it is nothing special, but one heck of a reliable car that will run for countless miles. Everything that goes wrong with them around 100,000 has been replaced before it could go bad. I think its a lot easier to invest the money in parts before they break then deal with the breakdown itself. 

3,000 OBO like I said no longer need, and its taken up space, but that does not mean I am hurting for money and need to sell it, so be reasonable
