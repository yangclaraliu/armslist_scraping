This is one fun and still realtively inexpensive way to shoot. This is the Soviet answer to a more compact & mobile WWII rifle with a collapsible stock.

I have a spam can of 800 that I will sell separately, though  not for shipping. This pistol is a gas to shoot, easy to tear down and clean. In great shape for a rifle that probably saw action 70 years ago. Some people are selling these as new, I don't know how they can say that as they are all put together from left over parts from the last manufactuire date.

Mounted on the rifle is a matching Simmons 22 MAG 3-9-40 scope with Adjustable Objective lens and finger adjustable target turrets. I bought this rifle and scope brand new a year ago. I mounted the scope and zeroed it in my backyard, cleaned the rifle, then put it into a gun sock and into my climatically controlled safe where it has sat untouched until I took it out this morning to take these pictures. This rifle has less than 50 rds thru it and it is like new. The stock is gray and black laminated hardwood and it is beautiful, as is the stainless steel construction of the rifle. The rifle holds 14 rounds of .22 LR ammo and it is tube fed, which means no high capacity magazines to buy or be banned by the upcoming (Oct 1) hi capacity magazine ban here in Maryland. This rifle is hard hard hard to find, not another like it on Gunbroker as of this morning and the big box sporting goods stores do not carry it. You can see more about this rifle at Marlin's website. I have the boxes for the scope and rifle and the owners manual for the rifle. I will also include at no addtional cost a 100 rd box of CCI MiniMag Hollow Point High Velocity ammo, same ammo that I used to zero the rifle with. This rifle is complete and ready to have some fun with, it needs nothing but a new owner, I am approaching retirement and trying to reduce the number of like new guns I have and this is one of them, I'll never use it, maybe you can. I will meet you half way between us for a FTF cash and carry deal in a public place during daylight hours, buyer must be a legal Maryland resident or active duty Military stationed in Maryland, I will not ship this rifle.

It's surprisingly accurate and I was able to shoot 3"" - 4"" groups at 100 yards with a military style bolt action rifle, and I could even do a little better with a M1A I had back then. Of course I had to hand cycle the M1A because this ammo doesn't create enough pressure to operate a semi-auto. Another bonus is that there is zero felt recoil so the kids and the lady's could shoot the big rifles with no problems.

A word of caution is in order and that is that you must treat this ammo just as you would with regular ammunition firing traditional bullets. This stuff is not a toy and it shoots right through half inch plywood at 50 yards like it was nothing. So I know it would be deadly out to any normal plinking range.

 The Plinker Tactical M&P 15-22 magazine is a 22 long rifle, polymer, 35-Round magazine. This magazine is specifically designed for the Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22.

The Plinker Tactical magazines function just the same as factory magazines, but give you an increased capacity for longer shooting sessions. These mags are specifically designed to work with the Plinker Tactical magazine loader. The magazines are constructed of impact and solvent resistant polymer and are sonically welded for long term durability. The solid mag body, without exposed springs or loading tabs keeps dirt and debris out, increasing reliability and long term durability.

Mounted on the rifle is a matching Simmons 22 MAG 3-9-40 scope with Adjustable Objective lens and finger adjustable target turrets. I bought this rifle and scope brand new a year ago. I mounted the scope and zeroed it in my backyard, cleaned the rifle, then put it into a gun sock and into my climatically controlled safe where it has sat untouched until I took it out this morning to take these pictures. This rifle has less than 50 rds thru it and it is like new. The stock is gray and black laminated hardwood and it is beautiful, as is the stainless steel construction of the rifle. The rifle holds 14 rounds of .22 LR ammo and it is tube fed, which means no high capacity magazines to buy or be banned by the upcoming (Oct 1) hi capacity magazine ban here in Maryland. This rifle is hard hard hard to find, not another like it on Gunbroker as of this morning and the big box sporting goods stores do not carry it. You can see more about this rifle at Marlin's website. I have the boxes for the scope and rifle and the owners manual for the rifle. I will also include at no addtional cost a 100 rd box of CCI MiniMag Hollow Point High Velocity ammo, same ammo that I used to zero the rifle with. This rifle is complete and ready to have some fun with, it needs nothing but a new owner, I am approaching retirement and trying to reduce the number of like new guns I have and this is one of them, I'll never use it, maybe you can. I will meet you half way between us for a FTF cash and carry deal in a public place during daylight hours, buyer must be a legal Maryland resident or active duty Military stationed in Maryland, I will not ship this rifle. Not interested in counter offers or trades of any kind. Thanks for looking, pls email with any questions. I have more of the CCI ammo that I will sell to go along with the rifle if you need some."

The bolt in the pictures is no the one that came with the rifle, or included in the sale, but I have put many rounds through this rifle without incident.  The bolt and floorplate however, are not matched.  Although there is some wear to the wood and the bore shows signs of wear (lands and grooves are strong, but is not bright and shiny) for being almost 100 years old this rifle is in excellent condition. 

It is missing one of the sight acjustment buttons and the cleaning rod.

If you're asking yourself why you would buy this rifle for $200 instead of one of the shiny M91/30s at fleet farm for $90, you probably aren't a collector.  The M91s are getting VERY hard to come by, especially the ones with such a rich history as this one.

$200 firm, will consider trade for HD shotty.  

I will require to see a valid driver's license and either a purchase permit or permit to carry.  I realize this is not required by law, but it is required for my peace of mind.  Also, I wil not sell to an end buyer that is not a MN resident, and will not ship or travel outside of the Mpls/Twin Cities area or sell to a ""middle man"".

It's .45ACP, cleaned after every time I've finished firing it. They MSRP for $1,512 on Kimber's Site but I purchased mine from Vance's for $1,415 + Tax = $1,510.51. I've fired MAYBE 500 rounds through it. Kimber is an AMAZING handgun manufacturer and their Quality is unparalleled, if you can't afford a Wilson.

My asking Price is $1400 BECAUSE it comes with, in addition to all the stock items, 5 additional mags. Three 7+1's, One 10+1, and one 8+1. Not to mention it also comes with an open carry holster. The brand name of the holster escapes me, but it's VERY good. The grips are VZ Grips and are amazing, I put them on myself and I love them.

This is a package deal, so everything must be purchased. Seeing that each mag is roughly $25 and the Holster was $40, that brings my used Kimber's value at $1,235 which is actually a very good price for a Kimber Warrior in this condition.

Anyone who purchases this, can also purchase .45ACP target ammo from me. I have boxes of 50 and depends on how many boxes you want to buy, there are discounts involved. I have 950 rounds, so I have plenty upon request for sale.

Thank you."

Mounted on the rifle is a matching Simmons 22 MAG 3-9-40 scope with Adjustable Objective lens and finger adjustable target turrets. I bought this rifle and scope brand new a year ago. I mounted the scope and zeroed it in my backyard, cleaned the rifle, then put it into a gun sock and into my climatically controlled safe where it has sat untouched until I took it out this morning to take these pictures. This rifle has less than 50 rds thru it and it is like new. The stock is gray and black laminated hardwood and it is beautiful, as is the stainless steel construction of the rifle. The rifle holds 14 rounds of .22 LR ammo and it is tube fed, which means no high capacity magazines to buy or be banned by the upcoming (Oct 1) hi capacity magazine ban here in Maryland. This rifle is hard hard hard to find, not another like it on Gunbroker as of this morning and the big box sporting goods stores do not carry it. You can see more about this rifle at Marlin's website. I have the boxes for the scope and rifle and the owners manual for the rifle. I will also include at no addtional cost a 100 rd box of CCI MiniMag Hollow Point High Velocity ammo, same ammo that I used to zero the rifle with. This rifle is complete and ready to have some fun with, it needs nothing but a new owner, I am approaching retirement and trying to reduce the number of like new guns I have and this is one of them, I'll never use it, maybe you can. I will meet you half way between us for a FTF cash and carry deal in a public place during daylight hours, buyer must be a legal Maryland resident or active duty Military stationed in Maryland, I will not ship this rifle. Not interested in counter offers or trades of any kind. Thanks for looking, pls email with any questions. I have more of  the CCI MiniMag ammo that I will sell you to go along with this rifle for only $10 per box of 100 rounds, thats what I paid for it."

From AWC:
The T.H.O.R. Raider represents a state-of-the-art design in a durable, compact, ultra quiet silencer for 5.56mm caliber series. The AWC T.H.O.R. Raider is so effective that it can be used safely and comfortably without hearing protection in confined areas such as underground structures, aircraft hangers and small seagoing vessels.

The T.H.O.R. Raider is designed to be utilized on bolt rifles and semi auto AR platforms. The T.H.O.R. Raider should not be used for full auto fire or on barrels shorter than 14.5 inches. The T.H.O.R. Raider is an extremely strong and lightweight unit, constructed of 100% titanium with each component solidly 360 degree welded.

The Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 tactical scope gives the shooter a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. This NXS retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. 

Nightforce uses outstanding glass and coatings in all their scopes, and the 5.5-22x50 tactical gives you superb resolution at high magnifications. It is the ultimate long range scope. The 50mm objective lens gives you maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This Nightforce scope gives the shooter precision accuracy at the longest ranges, yet at 5.5 power remains highly effective for shots at close ranges. 

The MOAR reticle is an improved, more versatile version of the NP-R1 reticle. The MOAR has subtensions that are thicker than those of NF’s traditional reticles, which makes the reticle easier to see against dark backgrounds. The MOAR has 1 MOA spacing on the horizontal and vertical axis’, and this is a great tool for precise range-finding and hold offs. The first hash marks on the reticle are 2 MOA from center, and the crosshair is 1 MOA in length."

This is PERFECTLY sized for concealed carry and has been maintained extremely well.  I have put no more than 200 rounds through this firearm. I'm in the market for a full sized 9mm and currently have no need for this compact pistol. I am asking $330.00 however I will consider any legitimate offer. I AM WILLING TO NEGOTIATE! NO FELONS! MUST BE ABLE TO LEGALLY OWN A HANDGUN! BILL OF SALE WILL BE REQUIRED FOR MY RECORDS! 

NOTE: The PF-9 is a (polymer framed) semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from the highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind and is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety and the trigger pull breaks crisply at point of fire (very predictable trigger break). The Kel-Tec PF9 is a reliable self protection pistol and is also a fun weapon to plink with at the range!"

Wider magazine well accepts unmodified, submachine gun magazines in pistol calibers. With caliber conversion upper receivers and magazine blocks, standard AR15 magazines can be used without modifications. As well, any M16 magazine can be used with easier reloading than aluminum receivers.
