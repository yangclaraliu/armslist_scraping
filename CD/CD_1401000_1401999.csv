Have tons more of miscellaneous survival/SHTF/zombie apocalypse items such as lots of lighters, hundreds of strike anywhere matches, can openers, survival books, empty 5 gallon buckets, ABC fire extinguisher, Colt AR-15 Mag, AK 47 mag, AK 47 mag. pouch holder, etc. Selling all these cheap! Make me an offer!

7. My knowledge and expertise about preparedness & survival including food & water issues, defense, economic concerns, what items you or your family might need to purchase, and what type of strategy to take in order to prepare for disaster. I am *NOT* a former special forces operator, hero, tough guy, self-proclaimed expert of everything in the world, or going to attempt to B.S. you by pretending to be someone that I am not. What I do claim to have is practical knowledge gained over almost two decades of disaster preparedness to help assist you if you are new to prepping or planning for your family’s survival in the turbulent times to come. This I will offer *FREE* to anyone who asks. So far I have been happy to provide free help and assistance to over 50 people.

11. Long-Term Food Storage-Year supply of FOOD for six people-or Six years of food for one person! I have 26 Emergency Essentials SuperPail buckets, some of the highest quality long-term food you can get. Perfect for when hyperinflation makes the price of food out of reach or if disaster hits. Food will soon be currency in our country in the next couple of years, so you can barter away whatever you do not need/use. These buckets will keep food edible for 20+ years. 

I have white rice, red beans, pinto beans, black beans, sugar, and rolled oats (oatmeal). I purchased this combination on purpose to allow the correct combination of proteins, simple and complex carbohydrates, to avoid food fatigue from always eating only one thing, and which require a minimal amount of preparation or cooking materials. Since there is not a major source of Vitamin C in this food, a couple of bottles of Vitamin C should be stored as well to avoid scurvy.

From my economic research long-term food storage is going to be a panic item sometime in the future, similar to how ammo is now, but with greater intensity. I do not know WHEN this will happen, but my research shows this to be a strong possibility. This is for several reasons such as poor weather/climate conditions such as drought, the dollar is losing value due to inflation which will restrict food imports, and the price of food keeps rising as the dollar goes down. This will result in food being out of price of many people. Since most Americans don’t keep lots of long-term food stored up in their homes, the rush will be on to secure food while money still buys something. Compounding this problem is the fact that there are few legitimate places that actually are able to provide long-term food storage solutions, leading to a perfect storm of chaos. All the guns and ammo in the world wont do you any good if you have no food. Many of these are out of stock due to massive demand and cannot be purchased from manufacturer. Keep in mind the price does *NOT* include shipping, which is alot, for free if you come pick them up. Price reduced to $1299/offer.

12. Kirkland Signature Embossed Bath Tissue, 36 Rolls, 425 Sheets Per Roll Soft and Absorbant. These are now extinct and can no longer be purchased at COSTCO. Their present toilet paper sucks FYI, which of course, is just the opinion of my rear-end. If you enjoy abrasions on yours by all means get the cheap stuff. Selling these for $20/each, got tons! If you buy them all I will cut you a deal! Excellent barter item as it's the one thing everyone needs! 

13. Large Silver Serving Spoon. Not sure what it is worth and I'm not gonna B.S. you by saying it's ""priceless silver antique from the Ming Dynasty that Cleopatra used and later George Washington had when he signed the Declaration of Independence and just now recovered from the Titanic!"". I guess you pays your money and take your chances. Make me offer plz. 

14. 7.62x39mm AK-47 Ammo. 640 rounds of high quality brass non-corrosive in sealed factory box. Don't ruin your weapon with cheap ammo! Only $249! That is 38/cents a round! 

15. 3 Sig Sauer P228 mags(9mm). These are slightly used but in very good condition and function flawlessly. $69 for all 3

Specs from Lucid:

The LUCID HD7 Red Dot Sight Gen III (HD7) is a quality optic that is gaining favor with many law enforcement and recreational shooters alike. Made extremely durable, reliable and packed full of well thought out user friendly features, the HD7 is always on target.

This red dot sight has a cast aluminum frame that is fully rubber armored, waterproof, shockproof tested to .458 SOCOM, and fogproof made for extreme durability. 1/2 MOA windage and elevation adjustments on external turrets have positive adjustments with a solid audible click.

The sight gives the operator the option of four different reticles: 2 MOA Dot, 2 MOA Dot with Outer Circle, Circle with Crosshairs, Crosshairs.

The HD7 is powered by a common AAA battery for the customers' convenience and an estimated 1000 hours of battery life. The battery cap is o-ring sealed against the elements. The sight powers itself down automatically after two hours of operation.

This Red Dot Sight features two modes of operation, Manual mode and Auto-Brightness mode where a light sensor will keep the reticle at the right brightness regardless of the environment you are shooting from.

The HD7 sight is designed to mount on Weaver as well as Picatinny rails, and is secured by two 13mm 6-point slotted nuts. The mounting base height of the HD7 provides for a lower 1/3rd co-witness when used in conjunction with a BUIS. The mount is an integral part of the optic frame assembly and does not allow for the adapting of quick release type mounts manufactured by other optic companies.

Started in 2009 the Gen III HD7 is the version with the threads on the ocular side to allow for the Lucid 2x Magnifier attachment. From Lucid HD7 Gen II to the HD7 Gen III - an ocular focus was added.

Manufactured in West Germany by Sig Sauer imported by Browning
Manufactured in 1977 with around 2500 total production.
The  gun is in Excellent Condition.comes with one magazine, no box or papers.
Before SIG got its US import license, they used Browning's import license and brought the original P-series pistols into America as the Browning BDA. SIG only did this for three years - 1977 through 1979 and that was it. So these pistols are fairly rare.
The BDA was basically the same pistol that the Swiss Army adopted and was the first SIG P-series pistol. Later on, SIG expanded this line and we saw the P220, P225, P228 and P226 come out of this line up. this pistol was the basis for the W. German SIGs that built SIG's reputation.
The BDA or P220 Euro was a very well made pistol. It is very accurate and mine has been a 100% reliable shooter that will put the bullets where you want them.
The BDAs are collectables and they were only made in that configuration for 3 years and will only go up in price.

The Steyr M9-A1 is a gun that has, shall we say, been around the block, and has made a return to the forefront of the Steyr line of military and law enforcement models in just the last year. The M9-A1 design is distinctive, compared to a Glock, Sig Sauer or Smith & Wesson M&P semi-auto, in that the Steyr feels different in the hand than a more traditionally styled sidearm. The best word to describe that difference is “ergonomic,” a term more often associated with automobile interiors than handguns; but in the case of Steyr’s revised M9-A1, it’s a good word to use.

At first glance the M9-A1 looks oddly shaped, appearing to increase in proportions from the breech to the muzzle. In other words, it looks wider at the front than the back. This is partially, but not entirely, an optical illusion due to the deep contours of the triggerguard and a sharply tapered frame that slants upward toward the grips. The backstrap is also deeply recessed to position the back of the frame higher over the hand, thereby creating a low barrel axis to help reduce muzzle flip. Once you pick this gun up, wrap your hand around it and take aim down the trapezoidal (triangular) sights, it all begins to make sense. This is a gun you absolutely have to handle before passing even the slightest judgment."

Scope is a brand new Primary Arms 1-4x24 with German #4 illuminated reticle (30mm tube, works with or without illumination, great scope) and Primary Arms Mount. Just mounted, hasn't even been bore-sighted yet. In my opinion this is the only .308 AR platform that is actually light enough to carry in the field practically and can serve a multi-roll as an excellent Battle Rifle as well as a great Hunting Rifle. This hard to find model receives excellent reviews on accuracy and reliability. Gun will come with two 20 round mags, all factory paperwork, lock, etc"

This genuine Ruger® factory magazine has been tested and has proven to
feed as reliably as the standard BX-1™ 10-round Ruger® rotary magazine.
BX-25™ magazines will work with any factory original Ruger® 10/22®
Rifle, SR-22® Rifle, 22 Charger™ Pistol and 77/22® Rifle.
The BX-25™ will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition.
However, you may experience malfunctions (“jams”) when using
subsonic ammunition or ammunition with heavy coatings of bullet lube.
In some instances, cleaning the magazine may improve reliability,
but in other cases you may need to switch to a different type or brand
of ammunition to get the full use and enjoyment from your BX-25™
magazine. Please also be aware that some .22 LR magazine loaders are
prone to damaging cartridges. If you experience stoppages while using
magazines that were loaded using a magazine loader, please try loading
the magazines by hand and determine if reliability improves.
The BX-25™ magazine requires no lubrication."

This SKS is in great condition and has been converted to a Tapco assault rifle stock with a multi position butt stock. I have made two upgrades to the rifle. I upgraded the mag release to a Tapco quick release, and I have replaced the firing pin with a new Murray’s SKS firing pin. This is a much safe firing pin. It has a spring on it, reducing the risk of slam fires. I have also added several attachments. The first attachment is a Tactical 3-9x40 optics R4 reticle crosshair air sniper hunting rifle scope with a Tapco intrafuse shell deflector and the scope is mounted on over-under sites so that the SKS iron sites can still be used. Then I put a Military Law Enforcement Steel Inserted Leg Mil Spec Polymer Composite Grip+Bipod+Side Rail. The last attachment I added is a laser sight with a pressure on and off switch hooked to the for grip. The rifle also comes with a one point bungee tactical sling, two twenty round magazines, and one forty round magazine, and fifty-four 7.62x39 rounds. I still have the original parts that came with the rifle including the wooden stock. I am selling  all of it for $1200.00. I would also consider a trade for either an AR 15 or an AR 10.

The Ruger Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR) is a light, small-frame handgun with a smooth, easy-to-control trigger and highly manageable recoil. Its patent-pending polymer fire-control housing holds components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduces weight significantly and reduces recoil. An optimized friction-reducing cam results in a smooth, nonstacking trigger pull. The cylinder and barrel are supported by a monolithic, aerospace-grade aluminum frame treated with a black synergistic hard coat to reduce weight and enhance durability. The cylinder is strong 400 Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight and is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s durable Target Grey® finish. Five-shot capacity.

My rifle is new and upgraded, it's not in the box, but it's barely been shot and looks beautiful. It is black Polymer and a very sharp design. Nice iron sights that are above average and I will add a scope and rings...and sight them in, for the right trade. The 7 round magazine slides into the bottom of the rifle and isn't visible in the pictures.
I have upgraded the extractor, the extractor spring and the plunger with Volquartsen brand parts. The extractor/plunger and it's spring are the parts in the semi auto rifle that make it function properly as a semi-auto. All semi auto rifles get an occasional jam while cycling, the Remington is no exception...so I upgraded it. For $40.00 in parts and my labor, this rifle is now the Cadillac of semi-auto rifles and functions without a hiccup. The work was easy and is done right. 
The first two pictures are the rifle, the third picture is a picture of the stock that you can buy for this rifle for $108.00, if you want the tactical look. It's at Midway.com and is called the Remington 597 Archangel stock kit. It's the same archangel kit that is used on the Ruger 10/22, except this one fits the 597. It's 108.00 through Midway. I was going to buy this stock, that's why I bought the rifle, but the wife and I need a revolver for our walks (coyotes and dogs) and since we shoot a lot of .22 rounds, we want it to be in .22 caliber. I will sell the rifle with the scope for $240.00"

The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment.

The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

I'll install a scope and rings and sight them in too for the right trade.
I've upgraded all the parts that make the semi-auto feature of the rifle work (Extractor/spring/plunger) with Volquartsen brand parts. They were 40.00, plus my labor. This rifle is the Lamborghini of semi auto rifles, it's smooth and has no hiccups. The iron sights are a very good design and it is very easy to be accurate with this rifle. The rifle is a very sharp design and it is new looking.
The hidden magazine (slides up flush in the rifle...it doesn't protrude) holds 7 rounds and they sell up to a 30 round magazine for it.
The first two pics that I posted are the rifle, the third pic is a picture of the archangel tactical stock that Midway.com sells for $108.00.
I was going to buy the archangel stock, it's why I bought the 597 rifle, but the wife and I need a revolver for our walks (for dogs) and for target practice .22 is cheap, so that's our pick."
