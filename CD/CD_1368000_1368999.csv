     No matter how the facts are twisted, gun control has never and never will stop the bad guys. They obviously don't care what the laws are......duh! Gun control only penalizes the honest people for the actions of others and that's wrong. What in the world is so hard to understand about this?
     The NRA's suggestions are well founded. Prosecute the bad guys. Seek out and help the mentally ill. Protect our schools as we do our public offices and our money!
     But this is about far more than just gun control. It's about all of our rights and freedom itself. Government was never intended to be a body that keeps digging into our wallets, wasting our money, prying into our personal lives and eroding our freedoms as it has been doing. These are the very things we freed ourselves from back in 1776......with the use of guns by the way!

This rifle is new in the box with all factory accessories. This is a current production model,
The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with. Caliber:"

Now that I've cleared that up, I also want to state that I'm not desperate to sell this gun.  I like it just fine, just was going to go in a different direction, but again, NOT DESPERATE.

Up for sale is a NIB, unfired, original boxed and factory oiled Bushmaster AR-15. It comes with a 30rd magazine, sling, lock, and the original manuals. This firearm features a 16” barrel with 1:9 twist, screw on/off flash suppressor, forward assist, a bayonet lug, sling mounts, and a 4-Position collapsible stock. It does have the carry handle, which is removeable so you can put optics on if you choose. Has the 2 position sights (small and larger ring selectable).

This weapon isn't like the Bushmaster Carbon 15's, or any DPMS product. It is aircraft grade aluminum forged, then machined to exacting tolerances. It also isn't just the plain flat top that most are selling here for $1,200 - $1,500.

For an extra $100, I'll throw in 4 brand new DPMS 30rd mags (aluminum). Also have some parkerized steel 20rd mags (still in original packaging and oiled), and about 500rds of ammo available. Will negotiate fair pricing for all, or part of collection.

A3 (removable handle) features 1/2 MOA elevation and 1/2 MOA windage adjustments

SKS's are known for durability and reliability. It's a rock solid rifle, good for 200-300 yards. YouTube has a video of a guy hitting a 16 inch steel plate  at 420 yards with iron sights. They're like an AK but with better distance.

Because of having seen service, the stock has dents & dings. This is easily fixed with a Tapco or ATI poly stock replacement. A new stock is lighter, solid, easily customized and extremely durable. You can also sweat out the Cosmoline and refinish the wood if that is your preference. I like the fact that this firearm is a piece of real life history.

Here's the facts on the rifle (top rifle in pics) - 
*  all matching #'s on  Bolt, Receiver, Trigger Guard, Floorplate, and Receiver Cover. Stock has matching # too.
*  All Milled Parts. This receiver is NOT stamped.
*  The barrel is threaded into receiver (rather than pinned) and have the heavy reinforced barrel lug. Chrome lined.
*  Trigger group is 1 piece milled unit rather than stamped. 
*  Gas tube is one piece milled as well.

Rifle is a little worn on the metal but still good (hey, it's from the late 50's). This rifle functions excellently. No rust on the rifle ( a tiny spot on the cleaning rod only). This rifle is available for $450 firm. 

Also available- Tulammo 7.62x39 ammo at $50/ 100 rounds. Hardly available anywhere right now. I'm selling some of my stash to get you started. Maximum of 300 rounds / rifle bought.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

The gun has had exactly 20 rounds fired through it and has been my regular daily carry weapon. The revolver is in great condition and only has the normal rub marks from opening and closing the cylinder and some light rust on the grip screw from being carried. If I was going to keep it I planned on getting some Crimson Trace grips for it or maybe some classic wood grips so the screw was never a concern. The revolver comes with the blue plastic factory box and everything that was in the box when I bought it. I'm also including 60 rounds of Federal Premium Personal Defense Hydra-Shok .38 Special +P ammo in 129 grain. In addition to the ammo I'm including one Galco inside the pants holster (#WB158), one Galco pocket holster (PRO158), one Uncle Mike's inside the pants neoprene holster (size 36) and one Blackhawk CQC Serpa holster. I believe the asking price is fair considering everything that is included. 

I've already searched armslist.com, gunbroker.com and gunsamerica.com and it appears the revolver itself is averaging for close to $500 in most cases without the extras. I've included part numbers so you can confirm the value of the extras. The holsters alone are worth over $100 and I don't need to say how hard it is to find .38 Special +P ammo these days thanks to the horders. More pictures are available upon request. Bottom line it's prices for a quick sale or trade.

I may also be interested in trading it for a compact or subcompact 9mm, .40 or .45 acp. Specifically Glock 27, Springfield 1911, M&P compact or M&P Shield. I'll entertain other trades but please have a picture to email of what you have. Depending on what you have we can work out the details if any cash needs to be included with the trade from either party. 

I would prefer to sell to a CCW holder but at a minimum an Arizona license will be required. I will also fill out a bill of sale for my records with all your information. If needed we can meet at Shooters World in Peoria for the sale. Thanks for looking."

 So if you're interested, get with me soon.
 There are 2 on eBay now for $5000.00 and $5500.00.
 $1500.00 CASH is a pretty good deal.

Slightly used but in box with soft case. Mint condition. I'm the original owner; ordered it a few years ago to eradicate a few starlings, but they disappeared prior receiving the rifle. It sat new in box until last month. I installed the scope and have put about 100 pellets thru it. Nothing wrong with it, still needs sighting-in. Shoots 1000 fps with lead, and up to 1250 fps with PBA ammo. It actually breaks the sound barrier on PBA ammo. The scope is a Center Point designed for spring air rifles, and has an illuminated Red/Green MIL DOT reticle. Also comes with owner's manual, .177 pellets, bright tactical light, bi-pod, and red dot laser. If interested, send me a reply with your phone number, or a text at three eight three, eight thousand.

The gun shoots the 5.7x28mm cartridge, a very capable cartridge that was designed by FN with the intent of penetrating soft body armor. The gun uses the standard Five-seveN magazines. The standard magazine holds 20 rounds, however, there are 30 rounders made and 10 round extensions to increase your magazine capacity to 30 rounds. The gun has a muzzle brake/compensator, non-reciprocating charging handle, and a picatinny rail on top for mounting a red dot or other optics. The gun utilizes the MAC design which means it is very reliable and built like a tank. It uses a straight blowback design which means that there is very little to go wrong. The gun is also very accurate (For what it is.) because of the low recoil nature of the round. The gun is also very fun to shoot. (I know from experience.) The bolt assembly is all CNC machined, further enhancing the gun's reliability. A hard plastic case is also included with the gun.

nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight.
