From Mystery Ranch:

Using every trick Dana has up his sleeve, the Kodiak is truly a beast of a pack with the ability to carry 7000 cubic inches of gear weighing up to 120 pounds. The Overkill Guide Frame combines the added stability of the Overkill Yoke and the comfort and weight transferring ability of the Five Segmented Lumbar Wrap with the absolute best internal framing. A classic top loading design with dual draw cord shroud increases weather resistance and allows for upward expansion. The Daypack Lid separates top load into two compartments for better organization and load control. Built-in shoulder straps convert the lid into a day pack complete with ports for a hydration reservoir. The SpeedZip sleeping bag compartment can handle the largest winter bags while remaining easy to close. Plus it can be sucked flat to reduce the size of the packs volume for smaller loads. Side zippers provide great access into the pack. From backpack hunting in Alaska to extended missions and expeditions all over the world, one word describes the Kodiak- overkill.

I have a very nice 60's era Mossberg 640 in 22 Mag. The price is FIRM at $250. It is labeled as a Revelation 107 and was sold at Western Auto Stores. This gun is an amazingly accurate bolt action rifle with a 5 round magazine and it shoots great. It comes with a nice Tasco scope. It is ready for anything from varmints to small game. Or of course you could use it for target practice as well. It is in nice shape. It has been well-loved and has the patina to reflect this. So obviously it is not a safe queen and comes with no boxes or paperwork.

123,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1712123,Want To Buy:  Looking for Curio / Relic Firearms pistols shotguns rifles older or newer,"West, Houston, Texas",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, June 3, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am a collector; I enjoy finding, collecting, and in some cases restoring antique, curio, and relic fires (but will look at anything). My offer for your firearm will be more than you will get at a Pawn Shop, trade in at a dealer, or what you will get at a gun show. If you need to sell today I can buy today. 

Always keep in mind this is a business transaction, don't take it personal if we don't agree on your items condition or price. A lot of it is subjective, so if we can't agree it's okay. We all have our opinions. You may have sentimental value for your firearm, could have been a family members etc... I respect that, however unless the family member was famous and it adds some provenance to the firearm, it is not something I can pay extra for. 

I determine the current market value of a firearm using the NRA grading standard, book value and the selling price on the major auction sites. This gives me the current market value of a firearm either NIB or NRA Excellent. What people are asking and what items sell for can be very different. Taking in consideration the gun(s) you are selling are not new, and may have been fired, also whether or not you have the factory boxes, and manuals along with any accessories. I come up with an offer. For optics, unless they are an intrinsic part of the model, I price them separate from the rifles using the same method. If I can buy it now, in an auction, for less than you are asking, then why would I buy it from you? Boxes and Manuals are always a plus.

My offers are subject to inspection. Initial offers are based on an assumption of a grade of NRA Good to Excellent. If I find any blemishes or condition issues upon inspection that have not been previously discussed it will affect the offer. My offer is good for 30 days.

I also buy surplus ammo

Once we agree to a price I will be happy to purchase your firearm, I will provide you with a bill of sale, a copy for you and a copy for me. This is to protect both of us. The bill of sale will have to have the Make, Model, and Serial number of the firearm, along with your Name, DOB, and TDL #. You must be at least 21 years old to sell a sidearm, and 18 years old to sell a rifle or shotgun in Texas. The sale is private party to private party. If you agree to the terms and price we can do business."

""The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system. It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

It is labeled as a Glenfield 75 which is the same as the Marlin 60 except it has different wood and a shorter barrel and was sold at Department Stores. I actually prefer this to the Marlin 60 because of the shorter barrel. It makes it easier to carry as a survival type gun for shooting small game. This gun shoots great. It comes with what looks to be an original scope. It is not a very fancy one but it gets the job done. It is ready for anything from varmints to small game. Or of course you could use it for target practice as well. It is in nice shape. It has been well-loved and has the patina to reflect this. So obviously it is not a safe queen and comes with no boxes or paperwork.

It is the top rifle in the picture with the smaller scope and strap. And YES, all the guns in the picture are for sale. Check my other listings. I also have plenty of ammo available for sale at an additional cost if the buyer is interested.

Was going to carry or use it for CCW. However, decided not to because it's just too nice to carry. Also comes with a brand new Galco inside the pants/belt holster, and a box (20 rounds) of Federal hollow points ammo.

Colt’s use of the MaTech flip-up sight is unique among flip-up rear sights in that it has adjustment for both Windage and elevation and its slender design allows for maximum peripheral vision when in use giving the shooter the most un-obscured view of the target. These are also the reasons that the MaTech flip up rear sight has been the US Military standard for almost a decade.

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability.

The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones.

The AR6720 is a hybrid of Colt’s Government Carbine model AR6520 and Colt’s Flagship M4 Carbine model LE6920. This Lightweight Law Enforcement Carbine has a roll mark of AR-15A4- recognizing Colt’s newest designation of an ORC (optics ready carbine)."

She has a 16” 1/9 NATO CL barrel from a Smith n Wesson upper used primarily as a 22. The bolt carrier group is from the same S&W upper and shows little sign of use. The upper receiver on this SPR is a monolithic jobbie by Armalite; she is an SPR MOD 1 continuous optics platform. This allows uninterrupted mounting positions for optics and goodies along the top rail. What is really sweet about this set up is the side and bottom rails are interchangeable with either a full, half, or blank rail. All rails included as well as the barrel removal wrench.The gas block is a top railed BTE clamp on with magpul sights and she also has a standard A2 flashider.
 The lower is a spikes punisher color filled. Not sure on the LPK in this guy but the trigger is stainless. Has a magpul poly trigger guard, magpul moe rubber grip, spikes ST-T2 buffer, and Blackhawk collapsible stock. There is some cosmetic wear around the front trigger guard mount but is only noticeable if you are looking for it. This set up will come with 2 new 30rd magpul pmags. Asking $1200 shipped from ffl to ffl.  I will split the upper and lower as follows: Spikes Lower $425 and the Upper Assembly is $800 with Magpul Sights, $750 with out.

ShowDown 5.6 Dual Beam Digital Fishfinder. The most exciting ice fishing sonar out there, and with Dual Beam Transducer capability! The new American-made ShowDown 5.6 Dual Beam Digital Fishfinder by Marcum Technologies ""ups the ante"" for the best in both deep and shallow water performance. Because it can use a Dual Beam Transducer (sold separately here) you can get both 8 and 20 angle options. It also has all the exceptional features of the original ShowDown 5.6 Digital Fishfinder. Higher resolution LCD to see fish and bottom structure clearly, a 12V 9-amp battery included for long fishing between charges, and a custom neoprene soft pack, a waterproof case to keep the system dry. Compact, with half the footprint size of standard flashers, and silent operation, no whirring motor. And simple 7-button, no-menu operation. It's a dynamic Dual: Super-crisp vertical LCD display... the vertical matches the water column, so it's logically easy to read. Multi-level high-contrast grayscale, so you see fish as they approach your bait by watching the gray bands turn to black. Backlit to be easily daylight viewable. Ice-Mode activates an internal heater to aid the LCD in extreme conditions, down to -40F; 1000W true RMS power, up to 8,000W peak-to-peak power. Amazing 1/2"" target separation in the 20', 40', and 60' ranges; Digital Auto-Range control... 20', 40', 60', 80', 120', 240'. Automatically adjusts depth ranges when ""hole hopping""; 25 sensitivity settings; 10 Interference Rejection settings, to eliminate any ""noise"" from nearby units. Plus surface clutter elimination filter; Auto Bottom-Lock Zoom... the bottom 25% of the water column is magnified in any depth range for maximum fish detection, jig detection and target separation; Infinitely adjustable digital zoom to focus in on any segment of the water column in 1' increments; Runs 24 hours continuous on a charge. 12V, 9Ah rechargeable battery and 12V automatic battery charger included; Made in the USA, with maker's 1-year warranty"

""Back in 1980, Bill Wilson asked me to test some of his new Wilson-Rogers .45 magazines. He explained that he felt they had solved the problem of cracked feed lips and that their new magazines fed much more reliably than any others on the market. Well, it's 30 years later now and I'm still using some of those original 6 prototype magazines that Bill sent me… Through the years they have proven without a doubt to be the most reliable and durable 1911 magazines on the market. I have personally used specimens from various production runs through the years and have yet to see any quality variation or have one let me down in any way. They are my first and only choice as well as the choice of the elite special forces units I train. I trust my life to a Wilson Combat® pistol and 8-round Wilson magazines; so can you…""

Take your pick for $700 cash.  I'll throw in a box of ammo.
Why do I have 2 Gen 4 Glock 26 ??    Long story short.. After I purchased a Glock 19 in Feb. 2013,  I ordered the Glock 26 for my wife and paid full purchase price + tax in advance. Every time I called to see if it was in, they told me that they were expecting the shipment any day... Last month I purchased the other 26 from a friend who had lost his job and was in desperate need of cash. A few days ago I got a call from the gun store telling me that the one I had ordered had finally come in....  I went to the store with the intention of getting a refund... however, they were only willing to only refund the price of the gun and not the 9.6 % tax, since they had already paid that to the State...   Well, to heck with that !!  

Both of these guns come with a hard case, 3 ten round mags, speed loader,  2 interchangeable back straps, cleaning kit and pad lock. 
The Generation 4 ""Baby Glock"",  is the most sought after conceal carry in the country and also one the most difficult to obtain. Most stores have a stack of 4-6 month backorders..   but you can get one today if you have the cash, a WA drivers license, and either a CPL or Military ID and be willing to complete a WA firearms transfer document.   Email or TEXT 206-251-10 nine three.   Please no BS about my price... I realize that it's about  $60 more than if you bought one in gun store,,,,  but they don't have any and I do.   Call it a convenience fee.

A portion of the trigger guard has been modified as well, making the overall grip much more ergonomic. I have also duracoated the frame in Steyr AUG green. I also had Meprolight tritium night sights installed by a gunsmith(Green front, yellow rear, provides a great contrast for quick target acquisition). The weapon comes with the original box, and three 15 round magazines.

This gun is a Gen 2, thus the slide has some wear on it. I can duracoat the slide black for you for $25, I haven't done it because I like the way it looks as is. It is a great home defense, carry or duty weapon.

689,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1712689,For Trade:  WTT: AR for a 1911/Colt Snake gun,"New River, Jacksonville, North Carolina",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, June 3, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Got an AR Carbine out of a trade a while back. I like it, but I started to miss having revolvers. Also itching to start a 1911 build. 

Here's the rundown:
-R-Guns Lower
-what I suspect to be an old Colt upper (not sure, can send a pic of the stamping in case you wanted to verify)
-free floating barrel with uninterrupted top rail
-one-point sling (VTAC)
-extended charging handle
-Angled Fore Grip (Magpull)
-HK fixed iron sights (Picture was taken with old NC Star iron sights that are included)
-VLTOR 6-position stock
-14.5"" barrel with compensator (not sure of the comp brand, can include pic of company logo. The comp works wonders. Comp brings it to legal limit.)
-LWRC bolt
-Surefire low-profile rail covers
-Ambidextrous magazine release
-Duracoated lower and ejection port
-Carrying bag in first pic.

Basically, here's the deal: not looking for a top-notch example of a Colt snake gun. Ideally I would want a Python in 6"", but beggars can't be choosers. Fit and finish aren't important either, as long as it fires. My last one was a blued example from '69 with plenty of holster wear and damaged grips, as a frame of reference. Has to be able to chamber .357 Magnum. If you got an Anaconda, let me know. I may be able to work out something with you.

For 1911 offers, either the full 5"" Government or the 4.5"" Commander's model. Manf. isn't a priority, as it will be stripped and built again. Keep in mind that I'm reasonable, but not daft. A $500 Rock Island would need to come with some extras/ammo, for example. Higher priority would be given to trade offers featuring any of the following: deep or mirrored bluing, threaded barrels, compensator, or one chambered in 10mm/357 Magnum/50 G.I./.400 Corbon. Depending on the model/options offered, I may make the same arrangements as with the Anaconda request above.

Mint condition I trust this gun with my life at my bed side every night I sleep like a baby :)............Up for sale is a rock-solid, only fired 10 rounds all stainless 9mm semi-auto pistol with 2 12round magizines. The flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range. This pistol is used but in good shape. The hand grips have some scuffing, and minor holster marks near the front of the slide, but otherwise in great shape. Comes with 2 magazine."

       Product Information :
       Arsenal, Inc's side-folding buttstock assembly is an extremely durable, genuine    Bulgarian AKS-74 style stock that is identical in appearance and construction to those currently fielded by various overseas government agencies. The buttstock features all steel construction, including a robust metal-to-metal folding joint capable of withstanding the rigors of extended field use. The skeletonized design reduces excess weight while also providing for a solid shooting foundation in the extended and locked position. The stock folds conveniently to the left side for storage or transport, and allows the gun to be fired while in the folded position in case of emergency. Compatible with stamped receiver AK-47 and AK-74 rifle variants, and includes fixed sling loop and all mounting hardware. Made in Bulgaria. 

NOTE: As dimensions often vary between AK-47/AK-74 rifles of different origin, minor fitting to the stock's rear mounting block may be required. May interfere with side-mounted scope mounts when folded.

I will also include 150 rounds of older 22LR ammo with the purchase.

I am selling it because I have a 22LR upper that mates to a multi-caliber lower and I need the money to finance a Glock purchase I just made otherwise I'd keep it.  As you can see from the pic below Scheels is selling them for $649 + Tax so you'll be dumping $695 if you buy it there.

The scope is basically brand new, never fired a gun with it mounted & it's in excellent shape.  Sold the gun, and don't have another that this scope would be suited for; hence why I'm selling it.

Excellent for CQB applications to 800 yd shots. Reticle pictured below & check out the review linked. 

1.5-8x magnification.  35Mm tube with 26mm objective lens.  Excellent quality glass from Schott Glassworks in Germany.   It's beefy in a good way.  It illuminates (optional), and the reticle is etched on the glass, so no battery is required. Tactical exposed knobs have positive clicks.  Both windage & elevation have zero-stop capability (set zero with hex screw lose, then tighten it down once you have zero).  Includes Free IOR 35mm Rings.

This review by a soldier back inbetween deployments to Afghanistan sold me on it initially: http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_3_18/512475_.html&page=1
  It's an older model without the zero-stop, but the other specifications are the same.  There's a Youtube review here also http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1jZIDEftAE 

IOR Valdada lists it for $1900, though I've seen other places sell it for $1500.  I'll let it go for $1200 flat so you save $300 because I took it out of the box.  No tax & shipping to lower 48 is included, so you save even more than an online purchase (at least another $100 savings for you).   Insurance is more if you want it – I'll have to price quote.
