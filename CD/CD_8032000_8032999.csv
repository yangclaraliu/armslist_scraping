I’ve exchanged a few positive emails with some good people. Yes I know, I am selling at great prices. Just for fun, I’ve also exchanged a few emails with people trying to send me worthless cashier’s checks in the hope that I would spend a lot of money to give them some of my property. Don’t send me questions about my best price. If you want to make me your best offer, go ahead although I’ve already priced my items to sell and more than reasonable price. If I said that I wanted $200 for an item, then I want to $200 for an item. Your offer of $50 cash isn’t really an offer. Norinco Hunter Type III (or so I think... for some reason I thouht it was a type II, the instruction manual that came with the gun seems to indicate that it is at least a type III).I bought 2 of these way back. I hear that they are a rare oddity and were somehow legal to import for a brief period of time.386 factory stamp with all matching serial number. Rifle, sling, 3) 5 round clips / mags 1) 30 round magazine.This is a comment that I found on the Internet: “This rifle will NEVER-EVER be imported to the U.S. in any variant EVER again. All of mine have a beautiful ""blond"" stock, checkered grip, rubber recoil pad (like you'll ever need it) and matching blond checkered fore-grip. The rifle is very well made and is extremely accurate and reliable. (I ran 200 rounds through my first one to see if heat would cause the cyclical bolt to fail, or misfeed and it ran through 2 drums and one magazine as fast as I could pull the trigger) What you have is a very rare AKvariant, that is not being made anymore and the price will continue to climb. Buy the rifle, run some mil sup or Tula, Wolf, Bear ammo through it, then some good, quality hunting grade rounds and there is little difference. It's a great investment as far as the return.”This one is banged up a bit. If I sell the other one, it will ask more. You can see picture of the same type of rifle on gunbroker."

I’m selling a few to fund future firearm/range related purchases. Buyer must be allowed to own a firearm by law, and I will check to make sure. I’ll provide a bill of sale with copy of buyer’s driver’s license. No low ball offers, and I’m not interested in trading down. The price is well below the MSRP of over $700 ( plus background check and sales tax if purchased from a local gun dealer which would add another $100+ to the bill), so the price is firm and fair. I’d just like to get my money back out of it. I’ll consider trades, but only if they are in good working condition and of equal or greater value than the retail price of this rifle, although I prefer cash to fund my own projects. I will consider trade for bulk ammo if price is right."

It may be used as direct thread, semi-permanently installed, permanently installed, or purchased as part of our DEDICATED SUPPRESSED UPPER. With a 10-inch barrel, the 556 TAKE DOWN was designed to meter at an average of 140 dB or less at both the mil-spec mic position and at the shooter's ear with mil-spec Mk318 mod 0, Federal T556 TNB1, Hornady 5.56 75-grain Interlock HD SBR Black, or Hornady 5.56mm 75gr TAP SBR. (Actual suppression level will depend on ammunition and conditions.) This suppression level at the muzzle and at the shooter's ear is made possible by specific tuning and baffle design, since a high level of muzzle suppression typically dramatically increases ejection port volume. An adjustable gas block is recommended to achieve this level of report at the shooter's ear. The 556 TAKE DOWN can be fully disassembled by the end user. As a somewhat unusual design feature, the 556 TAKE DOWN is disassembled from its front, so that the suppressor may be disassembled while its body is still installed, permanently or otherwise, on an AR-15 upper receiver or rifle. It is designed to withstand at least 20,000 rounds before depot-level service comprising a firing schedule of 8 magazines fired rapid/burst/full-auto and then a cooling period. Although the suppressor has an indeterminate lifetime and will keep operating indefinitely, the baffles may be replaced by a depot-level service -- for commercial customers, this is TBAC, the manufacturer -- to regain the original suppression level. The baffles are salt bath nitride coated (melonite) to further extend their service lifetime.   SPECIAL FEATURES Direct thread attachment option Nordlock (locking) washers included Toolkit and special tools available for purchase Rear wrench flats for installation/removal Pin hole on wrench flats for pinned/welded permanent installation Full disassemble-able from the front end, uses common tools Black nitride (melonite) coated baffles for longer service life 17-4 heat-treated stainless baffles, 316L tube When permanently pinned/welded to a 10"" upper, complete upper will no longer require a registered SBR host    FIRING SCHEDULE The 556 TAKE DOWN is full-auto rated. This rating is used in the sense that it is specified in recent military solitications, that is, 8 30-round magazines fired back to back from a 10"" upper, magazines alternating burst/rapid fire and full automatic magazine dumps. After this firing schedule is completed, the suppressor should be allowed to cool to near ambient temperature.LOCATED ATNORTHEAST MUNITIONS LLC27 LOWELL ST #505MANCHESTER, NH 03101603 854 0836"

234,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8032234,For Sale:  1800's LeFaucheux  Shotgun?,"Van Buren, Fort Smith, Arkansas",$ 575,"Listed On: Sunday, April 1, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"When I purchased this gun, I was told that it is a LeFaucheux made in the late 1800's. Probably from Paris, France or Belgium area from what he told me. I have not been able to confirm this myself, but the person I purchased it from is very knowledgable about these guns, so I took his word for it. I do not guarantee it because I can find no name on it. All I can find are the stampings on the underside of the barrel when it is removed from the main action. It has a stamping that you can see in the pictures. It looks like a Lf with a crown or something over it. It has a number stamped in it also. Also the butt plate has the same number stamped on it with a bird like an eagle with initials in it.The gun is very well made, and is a 16 guage that has had an optional German made Rekord 22 cal. barrel inserted in the left barrel. It can be removed with just a twist of the retainer screw, and tapped out from the other end of the barrel. It only goes about halfway through the shotgun barrel.Also I have a set of Browning Little Skeeters mini-tube guage reducers to shoot 20 guage low powered shotgun shells. I was told not to shoot high powered shells in it.The barrels are NOT Demascus. They are what was known as ""Stub Twist"" steel made from horse shoe nails. It is a 30,3/4"" long barrel, and the gun is around 47"" long overall, and is very tight. The hammers are not actually hammers. They are ""Cockers"", and have very strong springs. The triggers are very tight, and the whole gun was a very impressive piece of work. It has a front barrel release that is made from what looks like cow horn. It has one very small crack probably from shrinkage over the years, but it still looks good, and works great.There is some minor pitting in a couple areas around where the shells feed into the barrel, and on the forestock removal lever. Not bad for it's age.The gun is engraved all over, and looks really nice in real life. The pictures do it no justice.I have attempted to take good pictures to show it, and can only post 5, but I could send more on request if needed."

I haven't included pictures in this ad because there isn't really anything special to show - if you know your guns, you already know what I'm selling anyway.

Thought I would pick up archery, never did. This is a super cool 80's era Barnett crossbow, it's self-cocking. You break it in the middle and it flexes it up for you. Really cool mechanism. I did find one or two examples of these on sale on eBay, and they're going for $355-400 with a bent arm, to nice condition. Mine is fully functional, just unstrung, but I will string it this week and can show it works. 175LB draw, from what I see, this thing really is a serious bow. The body is made of some type of alloy, which is unusual for the time period. Collectors really like them, it was in a few famous films (For Your Eyes Only, it's the base for Chewbacca's bow, Commando, things like that). Really could get more, so please do not reply unless you have at least $250 to take it. Will also trade for small pistols (preffered) AR parts, stripped lowers, complete uppers things like that, because I have a build I haven't finished, maybe a really high quality knife.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of my guns, and I'm really in no desperate need to let them go. I'm an honest, private seller who wouldn't advertise anything I would turn my nose up at buying again myself. If you are looking for fair pricing without taxes and transfer fees, then here's your chance at some very nice guns (several of them BNIB). I will include all of the factory packaging and documentation for these guns, but I can't spare any ammo at this time. Sorry!One thing, though - I won't sell anything without a signed Firearms Bill of Sale (I will supply). So, that's going to mean providing some ID (preferably a CWP) during an in-person transfer in a public place. If you're good with that, then feel free to contact me via reply to this ad and I'll provide any additional information on any of the pieces I am selling. I haven't included pictures in this ad because there isn't really anything special to show - if you know your guns, you already know what I'm selling anyway. However, I will certainly be glad to provide photos through email if you'd like to see specifics.Here's the list of everything I'm letting go:CORE15 TAC ULII 5.56 (Quad-Rail) <200 round count 480.00Kahr CW40 (Bronze Cerakote) BNIB 340.00ISSC M22 Threaded Barrel (Two-Tone) BNIB 290.00All of the firearms are being sold in their 'factory' state, but I do have several firearm accessories and other odds and ends that I am planning to sell separately on auction sites. If you have any interest in accessories, feel free to inquire as to what you're looking for and I'll see if I have anything you're interested in."

These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a match grade stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine will remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.Above is the description and specs directly from the Springfield Armory website. I bought this gun brand new and have put less than 200 rounds through it. It works perfectly fine and is in great condition, I wouldn't be giving it up but I am building another gun and the wife isn't allowing any more money to be taken from savings. With the gun I will include the original case, two mags, LAG Tactical OWB/IWB holster and a BluelineCustom light bearing holster (TLR-1/OWB)."

Standard 9/16"" X 24 threads.This barrel is all stainless and has standard rifling so it will shoot cast lead bullets without any of the factory Glock barrel polygon bore leading issues.I bought this brand new in the hopes of attaching a suppressor to it, but that never happened. I did install this in my Gen.3 G22 to check it for function and everything worked fine with the 100 of so rounds I fired though it. But, since I didn't use my G22 much after that, and never did get a suppressor for it, I decided to sell that pistol.The guy I sold the gun to locally didn't have or want a supressor for it, so here I am without a G22 pistol anymore but with a nice N.I.B shape threaded barrel for one.From what little use it got with me it seemed to be a good quality/accurate barrel. FTF sale in S.E. MI. would be preferable, but for @$10 extra, I should be able to ship it just about anywhere in the continental US. (No foreign sales)"

This is a H&K G36 which of course are illegal for civilians in the US, so this gun was built using an SL8 frame (the legal semi auto version) and all other interchangable parts (including the full auto lower) from an actual G36. This does not make the gun full auto, it still shoots semi, and is legal to own and transfer as any other semi auto rifle is. Also has the conversion magwell to accept standard AR15 magazines. This includes the very hard to find dual optic/carry handle. The HK G36 parts kits used to build this have been out of stock for years, and sold for $2,500 when they were available several years ago. Plus SL8's sell for about $2000. These typically sell for over $5,000 now on gunbroker. I paid $4,250 for this one several years ago, and have taken it to the range 3 or 4 times.

A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools.The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before.Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year. May ship with or without a lanyard loop."

Introduced in 2009, the CZ P-07 was the first handgun to feature the convertible Omega trigger system. A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools.The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before. Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year. May ship with or without a lanyard loop."
