If you can see it, you can hit it, bowling pins on the first try at 350 yards, no problem.  Priorities have changed and I have not shot it in over a year.  The price is firm at 1200, you can not get these from rock river, call them they are months out on production.  I bought this gun to shot service rifle matches, it is perfect with only a few hundred rounds threw it.  Comes with one thirty round mag or the twenty round pictured, buyers choice.  This gun it top of the line for rock river, fits tight with match trigger, all around awesome!

Using every trick Dana has up his sleeve, the Kodiak is truly a beast of a pack with the ability to carry 7000 cubic inches of gear weighing up to 120 pounds. The Overkill Guide Frame combines the added stability of the Overkill Yoke and the comfort and weight transferring ability of the Five Segmented Lumbar Wrap with the absolute best internal framing. A classic top loading design with dual draw cord shroud increases weather resistance and allows for upward expansion. The Daypack Lid separates top load into two compartments for better organization and load control. Built-in shoulder straps convert the lid into a day pack complete with ports for a hydration reservoir. The SpeedZip sleeping bag compartment can handle the largest winter bags while remaining easy to close. Plus it can be sucked flat to reduce the size of the packs volume for smaller loads. Side zippers provide great access into the pack. From backpack hunting in Alaska to extended missions and expeditions all over the world, one word describes the Kodiak- overkill.

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) and TALO Distributors, Inc. have teamed up to create a limited edition USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ rifle. This special run is limited to just 5,000 rifles, with serial numbers GOLD-0001 through GOLD-5000. This is a historic opportunity to own a collectible Ruger® firearm and support the USA Shooting Team at the 2012 Olympic games.

""We are proud to team up with TALO to support the USA Shooting Team,"" said Ruger Vice President of Sales & Marketing Chris Killoy. ""Every person that buys this rifle will be part of a team contributing $100,000 to support USA Olympic Shooters, and we're excited that Ruger and our popular 10/22 Takedown™ rifle are part of this patriotic fundraising effort,"" he concluded.

The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is a stainless steel rifle with a distinct blue stock. Like all 10/22 Takedown™ rifles, the barrel and forend are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction-fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but rarely needs re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The USA Shooting Team Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™ is also shipped in a special red ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features the USA Shooting Team logo. The bag features internal sleeves, which hold the two subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options."

I also have them listed separately if your just looking for parts. But anyway the choice uppers are:

 Either a Di complete upper (s&w m&p 15 sport with magpul rear sight, handguard, and front sight). The specs are as follows:

 Barrel: 16″ Melonite coated – 1/7″ twist 5R rifling 4140.
Receiver: 7075 T6 Aluminum
Front A2 post

The other option is a Huldra Mark IV piston upper with magpul sights and vertical grip. 1st and 3rd picture is it. The Specs are as follows:

Barrel Length: 16""
Barrel Twist: 1:7 Right Hand - M4 Feed Ramps
Barrel Profile: Government Profile
Barrel Material: CrMoV 4150
Barrel Coating: Melonite
Barrel Lining: Melonite
Upper Receiver: Dry Film Lubed - T Marked
Gas System: Mid Length
Fore Arm: M4 Hand Guards
Flash Hider: A2 Flash Hider
Overall Length: 25""
Overall Weight: 4.23 lbs.


Either option will include  three magazines, armorers tool, scope riser, and nc star mil dot scope. Not interested in any trades at this time. 

If you look at the prices of these items you can see I'm not looking to price gouge. I'm looking for 900 dollars for the DI configured way or 1025 for the piston.  Both configurations are extremely reliable the s&w has seen 185 rounds down the pipe and eats any ammo Ive mixed steel with brass in mags and runs like a champ. the piston has only seen 160 rounds through and so far has has some steel but mostly brass. The huldra doesn't appear to need a reduced power spring to run steel ammo but again i haven't ran it hard. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask I can provide exact specs on the uppers if you cant find them online and I also have more pictures of them. Thanks!"

Info From Browning:

Few hunting rifles in history have achieved the status of the Browning BAR. And no other autoloaders have even come close. The line covers a wide range of tastes from the original styling of the BAR Safari, to the working rifle look of the Stalker version to the feature packed Short and Long Trac versions with modern aesthetics and handling features. 

The Browning BAR has a long standing tradition for achieving bolt action like accuracy in an autoloading rifle. Some of this is accounted for in the extreme level of precision and careful craftsmanship that goes into every rifle. But the design really sets it apart. The gas system combined with a 7-lug rotary bolt give the shooting significant recoil reduction for comfort, while at the same time locking in bolt action-like accuracy.

To complete the package, the BAR is available in a full spectrum of calibers from the most popular magnum calibers (including the WSMs) down to long range, high velocity varmint class loads.

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

 Rare NIB Cold Steel Black Sable Folder Knife with San Mai blade- No longer being made.

Consider the blade made of hollow ground San Mai III® blade construction and hand polished to a mirror shine even the most jaded eyes will find it fascinating. But a Cold Steel® blade is more than just homage to style, this blade has enough substance to be frightfully effective. Every feature from its curved, upswept shape to its acute, reinforced point has been judiciously chosen to maximize cutting and piercing power. Just running your thumb over its razor sharp edge will tell you this is something to be reckoned with. 

But no folder can stand on the merits of its blade alone. That's why Cold Steel® spared no expense or effort in making sure every other component corresponds to the blade in quality and performance. The distinctively shaped, pistol grip handle features a Titanium frame overlaid with highly polished black Micarta scales and forged Titanium bolsters that have been matched together and bolted inseparably to the frame with the latest high tech fasteners. 


To protect the fingers from the unintentional closure of the blade, the Black Sable™ has been fitted with Cold Steel's® state of the art ""rocker"" lock. A highly refined locking mechanism, perfected by Cold Steel® over the last eighteen years, that relies on extra strong springs, super close tolerances and other secret refinements to make it equal, if not superior, in strength, to any other lock on the market. 
For carrying and operating convenience, the Black Sable™ comes complete with a mirror polished pocket clip (for right handed operation), and double thumb studs for rapid deployment.

Great rifle very accurate but I am going with something different before the ban. Has seen about 2000 rounds through it always cleaned and well maintained. Nice rifle for your kid or just for cheap plinking. Sorry no box or accessories just what you see. Get it while you can with the extra mags before the ridiculous ban."
