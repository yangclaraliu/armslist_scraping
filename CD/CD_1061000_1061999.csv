I actually like this gun more than my AK...it's more accurate (by 2 fold), it has a milled receiver instead of stamped, about the same size and weight, the 16.5 inch barrel actually makes the SKS platform worth owning (to me, a 20in barreled, 9lbs gun chambered in ""only"" 7.62x39 isn't worth it when I can get a gun that is the same size and weight and has a much more powerful round ie .308 or 7.62x54).

Thermold Magazines started in the 1960’s as a molded plastics injection manufacturer that served the automotive industry. It's founder, William Howard, was well known in his hometown of Wilson, N.C. as an innovative thinker who held many patents. Mr. Howard was also a big game hunter for whom making firearms more reliable was both a passion and a necessity.

Using a nylon resin called Zytel, developed by DuPont after World War II to replace metal in large-scale manufacturing, Thermold began producing weapons magazines that resisted heat and corrosion, and functioned with extreme reliability. Thermold magazines rapidly became the product of choice among military personnel, law enforcement officers and sport shooters around the world.

All of our products are proudly made in the United States in North Carolina. Today, many of the firearm industry’s largest and most prestigious distributors are once again able to sell the trusted line of Thermold magazines and weapons products.

Way back when I shot Bullseye this was my competition case that also doubled as a public range case when practicing.  The spotting scope detaches from its tripod and attaches to the aluminum plate on the lid.  When you open the lid at the range and secure it with its double straps you swivel the case to align with your targets so you can shoot, check where you hit, correct and shoot again.  When you are done you simply close the case and the attached scope goes into the padded slot in the front until next time.  The case is cosmetically damaged on one of the corners but doesn't affect its functioning at all.  The inside is well padded with removable dividers to keep ammo, guns and gear where you want them.  It locks and I have the keys"

See how fast they return calls or emails.  Why are they wanting 100% up front.  Ill tell you all about myself, give you my cell, 800# work email linked in ebY

It is the style with the carry handle and it has a Tapco brand picatinny rail mounted on the carry handle for a scope/red dot etc. It comes with a (1) 10rd mag but you can get 25rd mags for it. It also has an ATI 6-position stock and a paracord sling. Its is basically brand new (only 70 rds exactly through it) with not a single failure to feed/fire/eject. It was cleaned right afterwards and kept very clean and well oiled since. With the prices of ammo recently this gun is still cheaper to shoot than any other caliber. This rifle is steadily gaining value/price with the proposed assault style rifle ban approaching. I have seen other people selling these for $450-750 so I figure $400 is very fair. I also have a tactical soft case/bag i can put with it that has 6 mag pouches on the outside and 300rds of high velocity ammo for the right trade. I like this rifle and dont have to sell it, I just want something new to play with. Let me know if your interested. 

$400 cash firm or trade. Face to Face in Tulsa. Must be an Oklahoma resident and willing to sign a bill of sale/trade.

It has the RRA LAR-458 lower and matching upper. It's not a franken-gun thats been pieced together. This rifle has a total of only 30 rounds down the pipe. There are no major issues such as scratches or dings that I can see on it. It truly is a great shooter. It comes with the original 30 round metal magazine and two brand new Magpul Gen 2 windowed 30 rnd P-Mags. All 3 mags are labeled .223 but work fine for this monster of a caliber, however you wont get 30 rounds of .458 into these mags. I'm sure you know this because if you've read this far, you already know what this caliber is all about. 

It also comes with two additional ""enhanced"" Rock River Arms buffer springs. These are marked red and green for both CAR length and MID length setups as shown in the picture below. Also comes with the blue hard case, and all paperwork and warranty card that I never filled out. 

I bought it to go hog hunting but the range is as far as that idea went. I really don't want to sell it but my wife has medical bills. This rifle is on another web site and has been advertised to friends as well. First one with the cash or right trade gets it. 

This will be a FTF deal. You must be over 18 and provide drivers license and LTC so I know I'm not selling to a mental case. I am not interested in driving very far to deal but we can work out details."

It has always been a safe queen. 

Comes with original box, instruction manual and factory target, signed by the Ruger tech, with handwritten serial number that matches this pistol, but no date.  Comes with one magazine (new). The box is overall pretty good for its age but not perfect.

Catalog No. MK-678G 6 7/8 Bull Bbl. Fully adjustable sights. Has not been cleaned, fired (other than by the factory) or molested in any way.

Don't recall when I bought it, however this model was built from 1982 until it was discontinued in 2005.  The serial number pre-fix is 210, and does not show up on the Mark II history pages of the Ruger Website, so I was unable to determine the year of manufacture but suspect early 80's but do your own research.  

Terms and conditions:  Face to face with a buyer of appropriate age and not otherwise restricted from purchasing a pistol.  I'm asking $750, but will entertain cash offers, but I'm not interested in trades.  Would prefer to see this pistol taken into Ruger collection, as there are many similar pistols for less money etc available in today's market.  Available to meet in Creswell to Portland unless other arrangements are made."
