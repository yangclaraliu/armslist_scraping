PhaZZer®Dragon CEW is similar in operation and effect compared to all Taser® Electronic Control Devices (ECDs). PhaZZer® CEW Ammunition is compatible with all Taser X26 and Taser M26 ECDs. PhaZZer offers five variations of ammunition cartridges, including: Dart Pro 15 foot (4.5 meter); Pepper Ball® 30 foot (9.1 meter); Rubber Bullet 30 foot (9.1 meter); Paint Ball 30 foot (9.1 meter); and Multi-Target Pepper Powder 8 foot (2.6 meter). All PhaZZer projectiles have an average velocity of 155 feet per second (fps).

PhaZZer®Dragon CEW was designed to be easy to carry and simple to use. Strictly for self-defense purposes. When you slide the safety into the armed position, the device is ready to deploy an incapacitating pulse technology that interrupts the voluntary muscle control of the nervous system upon 2-5 seconds of contact with the target. Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology has shown to be effective against any sized individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol

The Dragon is legal to carry without a license in 34 states. Other states have some restrictions, please see the list below.
AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, DE, FL, GA, ID, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN,TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WY

The following states have some restrictions: 
*CT - Legal for home use, carrying prohibited. 
**IL - A FOID card is required. 
***IN - TASER subject to requirement of handgun license. ****WI - A CCW permit is required. 
*****PR - Special permit/training certificate may be required

PhaZZer ® Dragon is based on a convenient, easy to use design that is compact and easy to carry on a belt clip sidearm holster. The 10 second cycle of incapacitation allows an individual enough time to get in control of a threatening situation and out of harms way. When any PhaZZer CEW is used in a self-defense situation, the CEW may be deployed and left behind, providing the Operator User a window of opportunity to get to safety and call the authorities.

We also utilize “circuit disconnect ripcord technology” in most of our products as a STANDARD safety feature***. This feature allows added peace of mind knowing that if your Phazzer product is ever taken from you in the event of an attack by an assailant, the unit is deactivated and rendered useless. 

*** the circuit disconnect rip cord is available on the PhaZZer Enforcer by special order and not as standard issue due to this product being carried by police and military units and private security and citizens worldwide

All PhaZZer products come with a one year manufacturers warranty and limited lifetime warranty.

The SIG M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle. Provides unparalleled accuracy, with a 16” chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel that provides maximum durability and corrosion resistance. A 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability.

The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Includes one magazine. 

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out. 

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today: - The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. - Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design. - Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.

The PhaZZer Scorpion is one of the most unique compact high powered multi-function stun guns on the market today. The rechargeable/replaceable battery pack was designed to eliminate, the common trend of disposable stun guns. The superior Scorpion battery system was designed to gain a more favorable public response to counter the fact that too many poorly constructed low cost stun guns with D grade components flood the market and have created unsatisfied customers. This is the simple concept of you get what you pay for, and PhaZZers goal is to educate the public that our products have value in several different areas including; product quality, guaranteed warranty, RMA program, tech support, excellent customer service for a proven brand.   The PhaZZer Scorpion delivers a 3000KV High Voltage Shock and is the ONLY drive stun gun to our knowledge equipped with a replaceable/rechargeable 7.2 V Grade-A NiMH battery and self-contained charging system (A/C adapter built in). The Scorpions safety features include the Circuit Disconnect Rip Cord technology which deactivates the units shock feature to prevent the unit from being used against the owner in case an attacker is able to take the unit away during an altercation. Upon the Ripcord being removed from the unit the 120db Alarm system is activated to attract attention and possibly demotivate the attack. The LED light may be used to cause a few seconds of temporary blindness when shined directly into the eyes of an attacker. The Scorpion is equipped with a safety on/off toggle switch with a separate momentary trigger system, as well as a momentary push button for the blinding LED light.

Female college student reports story about dorm room rape incident to PhaZZer Electronics, Inc. in regards to the PhaZZer Scorpion Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun with 120 dB Siren Alarm successfully fending off the attack.
PhaZZer Electronics, Inc. was contacted by a female customer explaining that the PhaZZer Scorpion Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun with 120 dB Distress Siren Alarm saved her life and assured her safety in a highly dangerous attack/attempted rape by a dorm stalker. Our customer reported being cornered in her dorm room by the stalker and she repeatedly told her attacker ""NO"". Our customer had the Scorpion Stun Gun in her hand with the safety disconnect ripcord secured around her wrist.  She armed the unit and placed her thumb on the ""stun"" button and attempted to jab the attacker with the electric current. He knocked the unit out of her hand dislodging the disconnect ripcord from the unit which deactivated the high voltage stun feature. The disconnect ripcord feature also immediately activated the 120 dB ear piercing siren alarm mode and was heard throughout the dorm building attracting attention to the scene in which the attacker immediately fled in panic. The customer reported to PhaZZer that the Scorpion saved her from a rape situation and emotional distress. She also reported a rise in confidence now knowing she could protect herself. These types of incidents happen more than people think on college campuses. Protect yourself with a quality multi-function non-lethal weapon like the PhaZZer Scorpion Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun.

The PhaZZer Scorpion has saved people’s lives and allows you to create a diversion to get out of a potentially dangerous situation in a number of different ways. We have had countless emails, blogs, and letters from customers who have expressed their appreciation through their success stories due to the usage of this product.  Some of our best feedback has come from young females attending colleges who live in dorms or on campuses. Check out our customer feedback forum for the latest incident reports.

This stun gun utilizes the unique features of the Phazzer brand products integrated for ease of use and safety.

The PhaZZer Titan is a security grade Multi-Function High Voltage Contact Drive Stun Gun.  The PhaZZer Titan features a 3 function slide toggle to easily select the  Shock  position, ""Blinding LED Light"" position, or  130 decibel Siren Distress Alarm .  For operator safety, we incorporated an On/Off toggle switch on the bottom of the unit that deactivates all function capability with the exception of the Circuit Disconnect Rip Cord activation of the siren alarm. Dislodging the Circuit Disconnect Rip Cord will automatically render the Titan useless preventing an assailant from using the ""stun"" function against the owner. The 130 decibel siren alarm can also be activated manually through the use of the toggle function position switch. The Blinding LED light may be used to cause temporary blindness if properly shined in the eyes of an attacker to cause a distraction for an easier get away.  The charging system is self-contained (A/C charger prongs built in) and uses a rechargeable Grade-A NiMH battery which provides a longer battery lifespan of over 5 years if suggested charging instructions are followed.

The PhaZZer Titan could potentially save a person s life or allow you to get out of harm s way in a number of different ways.  We have had countless emails, blogs, and letters from customers who have explained appreciative success stories from the usage of this product.  Some of the best feedback has come from females attending colleges who live in dorms or on campus where such criminal behavior may take place.  Check out our customer feedback forum for the latest customer testimonials and incident reports.

Anyway., it's all boxed up, new, dry ...clean and ready to fire. It's all steel cased, it's all 122 gr and non-corrosive. I paid 50 cents a round for every round, it cost me 325.00.
You can't find it any cheaper anywhere, I've tried. When you do find it in stock, after tax and shipping it is .50 cents a round AND you have to buy 1000 rounds to get it for that price. I'm selling my SKS so I don't need the ammo.
I'll trade for something not tactical/something that's not going to be banned.
I'll trade for a .22 rifle or revolver, tell me what you got. I'd really like a lever action and I like Ruger 10/22's preferably wood, but open to any.

Other than the gun everything was purchased in the last 3 months and is still new in the box or has VERY little signs of wear, as I have only put about 60 rounds through it since it has been converted.

All of the OEM parts are included with it also; the OEM stock was in bad shape and got a quick camo paint job.

All said and done to build this gun, I have $950.46  in it, and that does not include the time spent to clean the layers of cosmoline out of it. I am not interested in selling any of the items alone and this is a package deal. 

I do have ammo that I would be willing to sell along with the package (you must buy the package to get the ammo) and I can sell 100 rounds of 7.62x39 for $30 ( 5 boxes of 20 for $6 each- I have Tula, Wolf, Wolf Mil-Classic HP, and Golden Tiger to choose from)

The second image is a pic of the SN with the last 3 removed, but you can look up the SN based on the first 4 to know what year it was built. Also shown is the original 26 Factory marking

 I have more pictures on request. This is not an SKS for everyone, some folks don't like to change from the original configuration, and that's Ok too, this one is for the person who wants all the extras already installed.

Feel free to email with any questions or for additional photos, Armslist limits 3 per ad.

Would be open to some select handguns for partial trade (no Jennings, Jimez, Phoenix arms, or Cobras) and not interested in anything not firearm related (ATVs, Boats, heavy equipment,ect)

This stylish eyewear model has a built in 3 megapixel camera and DVR with micro switch controls right at your fingertips.
PhaZZer offers 3 variations: Black; Soft TPR Matte Black; and Camouflage. This unique camcorder system is wireless and will record directly what the user sees from eye level. The audio is captured at a limited range, but is excellent for narration or commentation by the operator or others within a 10 foot radius. The accessories include 3 sets of lenses; polarized dark tint, yellow sportsmen, and clear for indoor or low light environments. The primary use is to record video of hunting, fishing, winter and summer sports activities, family events and any other indoor or outdoor activities as well as for law enforcement code call, victim interviewing, perpetrator interviewing, witness interviewing. Keep in mind that slowing down natural side to side head movement will ensure a higher quality recording session. The video is stored on a 4 GB Micro SD flash memory card which has a memory capacity of 90 minutes. We recommend using an 8 GB SD card that provides a longer memory capacity of 3 hours. The play back is easy by connecting to your PC via USB cord or Flash Card adapter and requires no additional software or downloads. SD Flash Memory Card adapter included. This unit also has the ability to take a Still Photo at 1280 X 1024 dpi for a clear crisp image. DVR3.0 II has a high quality video resolution at 720 X 480 dpi and a true record speed of 30 fps. It also contains a 650 mAh rechargeable lithium ion battery that lasts 4-5 hours for maximum performance in both extreme cold and high heat conditions. Additionally, DVR 3.0 II comes with a full one year warranty which is unmatched in the industry and a technical support program to further educate the user how to operate correctly.

I am only considering this because I am tempted to get a SBR 300 BLK suppressed and I don't have the money for both. This .308 has a 16"" barrel and is only 27"" in overall length, yet perfectly legal as a rifle because it is a bullpup design. It is a very good home defense weapon, yet can reach out to 500 yards or more. I don't shoot long range, which is why I may switch to an NFA gun. This gun requires no paperwork and is not an NFA item. It takes standard FN FAL metric magazines. I have 5 of them to go with the gun, 20 rounds each. I have the original box, manual, sling, and ammo if you need it. This gun is used, but I have only shot about 80 rounds through it to tweak the gas system just right. This is a gas-piston operated gun so it runs very clean. Shells eject out the front of the gun. Left or right handed, doesn't matter. charging handle can go on either side. Safety on both sides. Very nice, clean gun. No scratches or anything, basically like new. I have a magpul 45 degree forward grip on the botton rail I will either leave on for you or take off, doesn't matter to me. 

Pics are not actual gun. One is just the RFB, the other is one I found online to compare the size to an AR-15 just to give you an idea of how short the gun is in case you haven't seen one in person. 

I am not willing to ship this gun. FTF only. Indiana license required.

Price is FIRM! (search armslist around the country, price is the same everywhere and some don't come with as many mags). Cash is king. I will only consider trades for a 300 BLK upper 9"" or less, or a full 300 BLK SBR. If you want to trade a full SBR, we MUST go through a local FFL because I want the paperwork to be accurate and legal. Nothing else for trades, sorry."

If we can make a face to face deal today or Saturday morning I am willing to knock $50 off the price (S1,050) or include two additional boxes of ammo or two additional magazines (either 15- or 30-rounders your choice)

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP. CMP certificate included. It has a low 1.4 million serial number so was made in middle of WWII. Stock is birch and is clean with only a few dings. 

I am selling it with 50-rds ammo, two 30-round magazines, and a carbine pouch with two-15 round magazines (15-round mags are loaded with ammo). It also includes the sling and oiler. The price reduction bonus would be on top of these accessories shown.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling any of my carbines but with the craziness in Colorado (high-capacity mag ban, limitations on private sales, etc.), I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price.

If you are not familar with the M1 Carbine, these are our first real a$$ault rifle. My favorite gun to shoot - they always go to the shooting range. 

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades and price is firm with the exception of the $50 savings or additional ammo or mags. 

Thanks for looking."

If we can make a face to face deal today or Saturday morning I am willing to knock $50 off the price ($1,200) or include two additional boxes of ammo or two additional magazines (either 15- or 30-rounders your choice)

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP a few years back. It has Austrian markings on the trigger housing to add to its history (See more at http://www.bavarianm1carbines.com/index.html) 

It has a mid 4 million series serial number. Stock is dark walnut with the usual nicks and dents for a rifle that has been to war and back.

I am selling it with one 15-round magazine and one 30-round magazine. It also includes the sling and oiler. The price reduction bonuse would be on to of these accessories shown.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling any of my carbines but with the craziness in Colorado (proposed high-capacity mag ban, limitations on private sales, etc.), I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history.

If you are not familar with the M1 Carbine, these are our first real a$$ault rifle. My favorite gun to shoot - they always go to the shooting range with me. 

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades and price is firm with the exception of the $50 savings or additional ammo or mags.

Wingo was an experimental indoor wing shooting sport invented by the Winchester-Western Division of the Olin Corporation in the early 1970s.[1] The only Wingo facility built was in San Diego, California and was in operation during 1971. It was a family friendly sport enjoyed by men, women and children. Competing teams were organized into leagues. Many area businesses formed teams to compete with one and another. Individual play was also available. The building was purpose built for the new sport and luxurious in it's appointments. It contained a service and concession area, a restaurant and two sunken lounges with seating and color slide shows of sporting activities. It had a large parking lot and a very large sign with the ""Wingo"" logo only. This created a natural curiosity about what it was to passing motorists. The cost of a 10 shot game was one dollar. Popular Science published an article in the February 1971 issue titled ”Indoor Wingshooting Is Here” about Wingo.
The equipment consisted of a bank of 18 machines that created 4-inch-diameter (100 mm) hollow spheres of ice. One of the original machines is in the collection of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center. The player had a custom-made .20 calibre lever action shotgun that was about the same size and weight as a .22 calibre rifle. The choice of calibre was to prevent players from bringing their own .22 calibre shells from outside. The Wingo shot shell was brass with a crimped end and a ""w"" stamped on the base. It was 24.81mm in length, 5.36mm in case diameter and 6.94mm in rim diameter at base. It was loaded with 119 lead pellets of #12 shot and produced a 30"" pattern at 50 feet. The rimfire ammunition was produced by Olin in boxes of 30 or 36 shells with the Wingo logo. The gun was tethered to the shooting bench to prevent it from being pointed toward spectators and to facilitate the wiring for the internal microphone that detected when the gun was fired. The gun was also wired to only fire when the ice target was launched. The gun weighed in at 5.5 pounds and was 38″ in length. It had a ""Kwik-Point"" scope for quick and easy targeting. Only about 20 of these smooth barrel guns were made and they are now very rare collector's items.

I got this straight from Winchester. I sold one of these for Winchester and it went for $2,500.00 to a Winchester collector. I have a letter of authenticity from Winchester for this rifle

This gun takes any standard Ar-15 magazine or drum and fires 556 or 223.  I have run a few hundred rounds through it. The gun is very comfortable to shoot and draws a lot of attention at the range.  

The gun qualifies as a pistol (for now) because it has a 10"" barrel, no butt stock, no forward grip, and can be fired from one hand. (I've done it, but it is heavy to shoot one handed).  There are plenty of videos online of this type of gun in case you would like a little more info.

I stripped and cleaned the gun after each firing.

Included in this sale are:
1 - P556 Pistol
2 - 30 rd black magazines
60 - .223 rounds (to take to the range)
60 - 5.56 Federal penetrating rounds (green tips) on stripper clips
1 - y harness

1 - lock 
1 - Sig Sauer hard case
1 - Sig 556 manual

I am only interested in selling this gun, not trading.  I prefer cash.  No checks.  I have the ability to accept credit cards.  There is a private office we can use at my building to make the exchange. 

Please don't message me about how the gun is cheaper elsewhere, or offer me half of the asking price, you won't get a response and will waste time for both of us.  You can't find these for sale anywhere right now.  With the new legislature, you may not be able to get them in the future either.

These are so rare that this is the only one I have ever seen in person and I have been to I can't count how many ginstores across the country and close to 1000 gunshows. I have been asked by colloectors if I have ever seen one and when I have told them that I have one they go nuts just to see it. I am the original owner of the rifle. This was a birthday present for my 10th birthday in 1964. This rifle has been shot maybe a 1000 times, I am really not sure. It still works great it is very good condition for it's age and it has a Bushnell Scope on it. The scope for this rifle is usually a necessity as the screw that held the rear iron sites was so thin that it would usually strip out after two or three adjustments. It is a tube loader from the butt staock. It holds 14 rounds in the tube and one in the chamber. When these Nylon Rifles were introduced they were touted as being next to indestructable and they are close this one has been all over the country and to Canada many times in it's life. I DO NOT NEED TO SELL THIS RIFLE so my price is firm and I am only looking to sell no trades etc. I do not need any more guns or equipment. I am at the point of reducing the things that I have to simplify my life. I am putting it out there for sale to see if there is someone who really wants this for their collection.

The numbers are matching and the bore is NOT counterbored.  The bore is in excellent condition and looks mirror like.  This is the version with the side folding bayonet, in the carbine length.  Great investment as 10 years ago they were selling for $59.  Supplies are supposedly drying up also.  Anyway I will throw a stock pic on here, but please email me for questions or more detailed pics.  I will meet FTF or ship (you pay for shipping and will have to provide a copy of your FFL or C&R).  FTF meetings in Beaver County or Moon Township.  Nice thing about meeting FTF is you get see what your buying before you buy!!!  This is an Izhevsk."

It is in very good condition and I just took it out and shot it yesterday. I have a pump I decided to keep and just don't really need this one. When I got it the end of the 29"" barrel was pitted so I cut and crowned it to 24"" then reblued the barrel. The receiver is case hardened. It shows some wear but is in great functional condition. This shotgun also has the spring loaded extractor/ejector so when you open the barrel up the hull will pop out for you instead of you having to pull it out. This will make a great single shot for hunting or the occasional trap outing. This shotgun is also unique in that it has wood grain synthetic furniture. Looks like bakelite somewhat. Has some minor scratches but otherwise it is in good condition. Lastly, having just shot it I can tell up that it patterns very well.

The product is Peters .22 long rifle cartridges.  It is Remington boxed to look different, old, or special.  It has no ballistics listed but each shell has REM on it and research shows that it is manufactured by Remington.  It is probably the same ammo they sell by the bucket....So the skinny is I am selling this for $6.95 per 50 round box and I have 50 boxes.....Again I have the receipt for what I paid, good or bad that is the facts so I do not care to hear from all the smart people out there about how much they know about everything.

I purchased this previously owned rifle in October 2004, about 2 -3 weeks after the Clinton-era ""assault weapons ban"" expired, so this is a pre-1994 rifle (1991 - 1994).  I never got around to shooting this myself, but I have no idea how many rounds the previous owner put through it.  It's a very clean rifle in very good condition.

This rifle is in great condition and only has a few minor handling markings on the synthetic stock, but nothing too extreme. It is properly greased and tuned to the right gas setting for semi-auto fire. The only reason I am looking at getting rid of it is because it is a little too big for a deer stand!
I've only had this rifle since January. In fact, I found that this rifle was more sought after at the time than the M1A standard or the SOCOM. Many say that because of the Scout Squad's 18"" barrel, it offers the best of both worlds from both the M1A standard and the SOCOM because it offers great accuracy without sacrificing and is not too big or small for most.

- (1) Springfield M1A Scout Quad rifle with synthetic stock
- (2) 20-round M1A magazines
- (1) Tac Pro Adjustable Kydex Cheek Rest (http://tacpro.com/product_info.php?products_id=19)
