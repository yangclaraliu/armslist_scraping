I purchased this gun bnib a month ago.
This pistol also comes with these extras:
Hogue Grip: $20
Spare CZ 19rnd extended mag : $52
(2) 32 rnd CZ extended mags: $30 each
Total package for me was $534 after tax. I want $425 cash no trades. 

Loftis sells these guns brand new with one mag for $360+tax. Just fyi, the mags for these are expensive from EAA as the CZ mags are expensive. So if you were to buy the gun from Loftis and order one mag online, you will be paying loftis $369+tax amd am other $40+ online for 1 spare mag online. Here you get the more expensive extended 19rnd mag and 2 32 rnd mags as well as the grip. Email me thru here for questions"

Here is the CMP description: CORRECT GRADE: (Very Good to Excellent) 
Correct Grade Rifles are similar to the Service Grade, but will show less wear and use. Correct Grade rifles will have all correct parts for the date of manufacture with 80% or better overall original metal finish. The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects. Very good to excellent condition. This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities. Because of the scarcity of these rifles, they will only be sold on the CMP auction site.

NOT INTERESTED IN TRADES AT THIS TIME. 

A small, lightweight pistol ideal for concealed or backup carry, the Kimber Ultra Crimson Carry II pistol features a compact aluminum frame with short grip for easy concealment. Like the Pro Crimson Carry line, Ultra Crimson Carry pistols combine Kimber quality with a Crimson Trace Lasergrip for greater accuracy, confidence, and value. A lightweight pistol ideal for carrying all-day/every day, this 1911-style handgun is built around a lightweight aluminum frame machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. The Ultra Crimson Carry's steel slide and match grade steel 3'' bushingless bull barrel aids concealability while still delivering Kimber accuracy. One of the finest laser sights available, Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, to help shooters of all levels learn the advantage of proper grip and trigger control immediately, helping them improve accuracy and reduce time between shots while training. Extended thumb safety and beavertail grip safety for fast positive action.

Improving on the FNP™-45 Tactical, developed for the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 Tactical is the latest in technological advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a host of unique features that no other handgun can match. The checkered polymer frame is offered in Black and Flat Dark Earth and has a low-bore axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced operator control. Two interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The 5.3″ cold hammer-forged, stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to accept sound suppressors, compensators and other accessories. The stainless steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights.

REMINGTON MOD. 81 WOODSMASTER - Cal. 300 Savage. Serial # 27XXX puts date of manufacture at 1946, so it is C&R eligible. The rifle is in overall fine condition, and metal an wood would grade at an easy 95% condition. There are no dinks or dents in the barrel jacket as found on many of these. It appears to have seen minimal use, and the bore is excellent. I know very little about this model, but my limited research shows that the 300 Savage seems to be the least common chambering in these.
The rifle comes with a period correct 1.5-4.5 steel tubed El Paso Weaver scope with duplex reticle, in a Williams side mount (offset from the bore) which gives the instant option of open sight or scope use. Optics are crystal clear, and adjustments are solid and crisp.
This was purchased at an estate sale, and I have not fired it, but it loads, chambers, and ejects live rounds, but with any 67 year old rifle, it is strongly recommended that you have it inspected by a competent gunsmith before firing.
Price: $595.00+ $25.00 insured delivery via USPS Parcel Post to your FFL or C&R.

Don't shoot dirty ammo with a direct impingement AR.  An AR platform is a lot of fun to shoot until you pay for expensive ammo; the inexpensive stuff is just a fun to shoot.   

Ruger SR-556E .223/5.56 NEVER FIRED with THREE MagPul magazines and B.A.D.. 

B.A.D. was developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.

You can see on the bolt there are no piston marks and it's PERFECLTY clean...  Only difference from new is the savings and the extra two  PMAG (with window)

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

TWO-STAGE PISTON WITH ADJUSTABLE REGULATOR provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The four position gas regulator can be adjusted for optimum reliability and superior operating endurance. The gas system may be  closed completely for manual operation during training or when using a suppressor.

SIX-POSITION TELESCOPING M4-STYLE BUTTSTOCK is mounted on a mil-spec diameter tube.

COLD HAMMER-FORGED, MIL-SPEC 41V45 BARREL with removable flash suppressor ensures  accuracy and longevity.

A2-STYLE PISTOL GRIP with finger groove.

SMOOTH, TRIM, LIGHTWEIGHT ERGONOMIC HANDGUARD. Flattop receiver with Picatinny Rail at 12:00 position extends full length of handguard. Rails for 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions sold separately.

CCI/SPEER GOLD DOT HANDGUN CENTERFIRE AMMUNTIONSpeer 45 ACP 230 Grain Gold Dot Hollow Point Short BarrelThis ammo is recommended for short barrel guns.A patented process forms the hollow point cavity in two stages. The core is pre-fluted to define the ""fault"" lines of expansion, controlling final diameter and retained weight. The second process finishes the cavity and controls the rate of expansion. Select, clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, as well as nickel plated brass cases for smooth feeding and durability. These technical features allow Speer's engineers to fine tune each specific caliber and bullet weight for maximum field performance.SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num: 23975 Category: AMMO CENTERFIRE Caliber :45 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP)Bullet Type :Gold Dot Hollow PointBullet Weight :230 GRMuzzle Energy :343 ft lbsMuzzle Velocity :820 fpsRounds/box :20 Rounds Per Box"

It has ZERO defects and was part of a very limited sale. 

These upper and lower receiver sets are finished using Cerakote's premium ceramic coating technology well known in the firearms industry. Not only does it provide for a flat dark earth color scheme it imparts additional durability, corrosion resistance, hardness, and resistance to solvents and chemicals. This FDE matches our rifle grip extremely well so it only makes sense to include Grip 23 as part of the package. Capacity is limited and we expect to produce less than 100 sets per month. 

Set includes one FDE third generation stripped upper receiver, one FDE fourth generation stripped lower receiver, and one FDE Grip 23. For specs on the individual components, check out their respective sections on the website for details. Assembly by a qualified Armorer is required. 

Set cost me $450 by the time I did FFL, shipping, gas, and buying it. This is 1 of 100 releases. I spent TONS of hours working to get it. So my $50 profit really isnt gouging. Firm on price.

Will consider all trades. This is a great gun and very hard to find in the equinox configuration. 

Ky resident and ccdw preferred. Will travel halfway for the right deal."

The FNS is the result of years of research incorporating the most precise
engineering and product development to bring the most highly-advanced
striker-fired pistol to the American law enforcement and personal defense
market. The FN FNS is a true double-action pistol with a pivoting hinged
trigger featuring an exceptionally crisp break and a short travel to reset.
The matte black polymer frame comes with four interchangeable backstraps to
customize grip fit and is designed with a low-bore axis for reduced felt
recoil and enhanced control. The fully-ambidextrous controls are shaped for
easy access without snagging on holsters or clothing. The contoured
frame-mounted manual safety is ideally placed for positive operation by
either thumb. The FNS offers a hammer-forged stainless steel barrel. The
slide features front and rear cocking serrations and is topped with
three-dot fixed sights. The FN FNS also is equipped with steel frame rails
that can be easily replaced.

It has an original wood stock with marking in the stock from that era. Now please note that the gun does have a different rear sight, and what is believed to be an early 1950’s S/A barrel. I would only assume that somewhere in the mix U.S. Army armorers did in fact change parts and such to make it top notch service grade rifle either before or after the Korean War, keep in mind please this would have been an officers weapon. I did purchase this gun from an estate sale and was able to speak with the son, who stated that it belonged to his father a retired military officer; it was purchased from Ft .Knox Kentucky in 1957as surplus, and I believe his personal rifle…. He related that his father was issued the rifle in 1949 and it did go to Korea with him. Once he purchased it, he only used it for VFW functions firing planks only upon his retirement from the US Army. The barrel is in 70%+ condition.  I have I think 12 clips and a reproduction web sling. Now please do not waste our time with low ball offers $800.00 buys it. Please note to the gun flippers….. I will not lower the price so you can turn around and sell for what the value is. It can sit in my safe until a buyer comes along. It’s really not eating anything or asking for money so need to sell or entrain low ball offers. And if you do not have the money do not contact me. The serial # starts with 291 so if you are curious about the date look it up. This rifle can be fired safely and without any concerns .

It even has the original wood stock with marking in the stock.  The pick’s are the best that can be taken with my phone…. To view the rifle. I did purchase this gun from an estate sale and was able to speak with the son, who stated that it belonged to his father a retired military officer; it was purchased from Ft .Knox Kentucky in 1957as surplus, and I believe his personal rifle…. He related that his father was issued the rifle in 1949 and it did go to Korea with him. Once he purchased it, he only used it for VFW functions firing planks only. The barrel is in 70%+ condition.  I have I think 12 clips and some ammo 80 rounds and a reproduction web sling. Now please do not waste our time with low ball offers I have already turned down $850.00.  If you are looking for a weekend shooter then you best play is a parts gun that really has no history or really collectable value.
