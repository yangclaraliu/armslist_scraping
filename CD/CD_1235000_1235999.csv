The 500AB is the 500A Mossberg shotgun with some improvements...specifically a Walnut stock VS the various hardwood stocks found on the regular 500A model. My 500AB also has some etchings in the receiver metal ,as seen in 1 photo, that the 500A does not have ...and it has a 30"" barrel. (Every part on this 500AB is interchangeable with the regular 500A)
This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. Thirty inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer /Water Fowl...and well, anything. You get the 100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun. Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances. It shoots bird and buck shot and rifled slugs. It is chambered for 2&3/4"" and 3.00"" shells. I'll include a box of shells with it...I won't need them if I sell the shotgun. It functions flawlessly and it looks great. The walnut is beautiful. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle. It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. It has a Tasco Red Dot scope, a good one, that enables quick sholdering and accurate firing of shotgun. For those folks who don't know what a Red Dot scope is: You turn the switch on and the red dot is displayed in the scope lens...when you look thru the scope, wherever the dot is - that's where the bullet goes. If you move your head, the red dot stays on the target your pointing at and you can still see the dot as you move your head around. It makes for very quick and accurate shooting. I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too. I need money, I have to sell it. Three hundred is as low as I'll go. A box of shells #6 shot- I think they are, go with it. Thanks."

Up for trade/sell is a Like New Kahr CW45. I just bought this last weekend and have shot it twice (150 rounds through it). It will come with a leather Galco holster and 50 rounds Winchester 230 grain FMJ ammunition. I do have the original box but not the styrofoam that it came in (I cut it to fit inside a different gun case since it only came in a cardboard box) I LOVE the gun but wish I would have gotten a 9mm so my girlfriend could have shot it. I need something that has less recoil than this gun so that she can shoot it better. 

I am mainly looking for something that is for Concealed Carry and low recoil. If you have anything similar to this you can email me. I am open to offers of cash, different trades, and even paying a little more for a slightly more expensive gun. 

Thanks,

Included in this deal is two great carry holsters. The first is a Black Hawk Serpa belt loop holster quick and secure. The second is a Crossbreed tuck holster. With this holster at the 4 o'clock position the gun almost disappears and is very comfortable for all day carry. 

Aftermarket Tru-glo fiber optic night sights. These sights are amazing in the daylight and perfect at night.

For sale, a bill of sale is preferred, if not I need name only and see either a Colorado DL and CCW to confirm purchaser is legally able to purchase/posses gun.

Between 300 and 400 rounds fired. 

Thanks

Everything was installed by a certified glock armorer just yesterday. No springs or anything else have been changed. If you feel like you need to question my price then call every gun shop you know of and be laughed at when you ask if they have one in stock. Not many Gen 4 Glock 30's made it onto the market and the people that have them are holding onto them. The Gen 4 is the size of the 30SF if you don't use any of the removable backstraps so it'll fit anyone's hands. 

At this link you'll see that the bid is up to $725 without night sights with two days left. If these guns were easy to find the bid would not be going that high. By the time the auction is over it'll be $800+.

 The Noveske KX3 Flash Hider is designed to increase reliability in short barreled AR-10 and LR-308 pistols and SBR's by increasing back pressure. Also, the KX3 directs the muzzle blast forward of the shooter which alleviates most of the discomfort when firing the AR with an abbreviated barrel. The KX3 is made of chrome moly steel that is heat-treated for further durability. The entire assembly is then phosphated for corrosion resistance and individually serialized for quality control. Although originally designed for short barreled AR-15's the Noveske KX3 will work on any barrel length

The Neos pistols feature cutting-edge design, modular construction that allows personalization and the flexibility for many shooting disciplines. Available at popular prices, the Neos is ideal for new shooters, but it won't easily be outgrown as skills improve.

The RRA rifle we reviewed is their Varmint A4 with a 24"" barrel.  The barrel is a Wilson Arms 24"" stainless heavy barrel that is 1.05"" thick under the hand guards and .92"" from the gas block to the muzzle. The RRA Varmint rifles come with a Wylde chamber, which is a mix between .223 and 5.56. For those of you that do not know, the 5.56x45 NATO is NOT exactly the same as a .223 Rem. The 5.56 spec allows for slightly longer chambers for higher pressures. The .223 has a tighter chamber around the neck and is shorter which allows for a bit better accuracy. You can shoot .223 ammo in a 5.56 chamber. What the Wylde chamber does is allow for 5.56 ammo with slightly tighter chamber for better accuracy. So you can shoot both 5.56 and 223 safely with good accuracy."

ATF RULING ON THIS TYPE OF FIREARM;

Under the new ruling, a pistol could be converted to a rifle and back again without having to register the firearm as an SBR. However, the opposite of that will still be forbidden (a firearm that starts out as a rifle can never be a pistol without being registered as an SBR)."

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed. The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine. The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .3oo Win Mag ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots. In the AR tradition, the Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reassembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle virtually seamless. The Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag Ultra Long Range Rifle includes a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for 1 year."

 Caliber:.223 Rem Barrel: Wilson Heavy contour Stainless Steel - .920"" at the muzzle brake

GUNS&AMMO MAGAZINE ARTICLE:
It is not common for us to review .223 rifles, as the caliber is not normally suitable to long range sniping. Even with the new 80 & 90gr high BC .224 bullets, there is still inadequate energy on target at long ranges for the caliber to be effective. But, in certain conditions, like MOUT (urban) environments or in situations where one is wishing to extend the range of the fire team or squad, a precision .223 rifle makes a lot of sense and if one's team is familiar with the M16/M4/AR platform, than a precision AR rifle is the ticket. We were able to test an off the shelf (thanks goes to John for letting us eval his rifle) Rock River Arms (RRA) Varmint A4 rifle. The RRA's have had a very good reputation for high quality products at a good price. So, this rifle is as good as any. RRA claims .75 MOA for these rifles, which I think would be good for an out of the box .223 semi auto, but we had heard stories of much better accuracy from these rifles and other .223 AR's.Military/Civilian ammo would be very good for the intended role of this type of rifle and would extend the range of the squad very effectively to about 600 meters on man sized targets. 

AR-15 MAGAZINE REVIEW
The RRA rifle we reviewed is their Varmint A4 with a 24"" barrel. The barrel is a Wilson Arms 24"" stainless heavy barrel that is 1.05"" thick under the hand guards and .92"" from the gas block to the muzzle. The RRA Varmint rifles come with a Wylde chamber, which is a mix between .223 and 5.56. For those of you that do not know, the 5.56x45 NATO is NOT exactly the same as a .223 Rem. The 5.56 spec allows for slightly longer chambers for higher pressures. The .223 has a tighter chamber around the neck and is shorter which allows for a bit better accuracy. You can shoot .223 ammo in a 5.56 chamber. What the Wylde chamber does is allow for 5.56 ammo with slightly tighter chamber for better accuracy. So you can shoot both 5.56 and 223 safely with good accuracy"

It has been enhanced with several $$$ added features. Springfield built this gun on a Springfield Series 70 frame and slide.

It has been Enhanced with a Wilson Combat (match) barrel with attached screw on compensator (also takes a suppressor or just a knurled thread protector) a Wilson bushing & link. Has S.S. Mag well, Target grips, Wilson Extended takedown and safety and an extended mag release button. Also has the Wilson two piece solid guide rod with spring and reverse rod holder.

This gun with the enhanced trigger group including combat hammer, has as nice of a trigger pull on it, as guns costing twice as much as I'm asking. I believe the series 70 frame and slide has something to do with that as well.

Slide and frame fit like a glove, and move as smooth as glass together, with no play or hesitation at all and makes the gun much more accurate than I am as a shooter. I would consider the overall finish as 98%+.

If you are looking for an easy shooting (reduced recoil because of the compensator) .45 for pleasure, tactical use, or to possibly get into a little competition, without a lot of investment, then this is the 1911 for you.

I already have (5) other .45's so I decided to sell this little treasure to someone that can do it justice.

I've owned butterfly knives and one switchblade in the past and I obviously knew what a switchblade should be, but this outdid my expectations. It functions beaufully and looks great. On doing a google search, I found out that these are pretty sought out 1950s to 60s knives that can range as high as $400. The handle is some sort of horn I think, and other than that I know nothing about it beside the fact its really really sharp, stainless steel and patented. 
The blade is 3.5 inches and the knife has an overall length of 8 inches. It says ""Inox"" on one side of the blade and ""Patent 96847"" on the other. The knife has a bayonet blade (this makes it somewhat easier to pull out of a soft target), a standard slide-safety and the handle is  animal horn stained in a deep brown/black. No rust, no heavy scratches, nicks or scrapes. The only thing that keeps this weapon out of the ""mint"" category is the fact that it's obvious the blade has seen more than her share of a sharpening stone. That is probably this knife was used as it was intended: either as an easy one-handed access tool for craftsmen and campers or as an intimidating weapon  This knife came in a genuine leather belt-loop Buck pouch (in which it fits perfectly) and so I see no reasons it shouldn't come with it. Email me to see more pictures.

I will accept only TWO types of ammo in trade, .308 Winchester or 9x19 Luger. But if you want to do that, keep in mind that I want $110 dollars worth of it."
