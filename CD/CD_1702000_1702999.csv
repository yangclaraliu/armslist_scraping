The SIG556Â® Classic SWAT continues the on-going evolution of the Classic model. It features an aluminum quad-rail hand guard that is ideally suited for mounting tactical accessories. The stock is a hinged folding Swiss-style that is able to collapse for ease of transportation or use in tight quarters. This feature is made possible by a new stock interface into the trigger casing. The adjustable stock snaps and securely locks into a folded position with a length-of-pull that can be preset by the user. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m.

Specs:
The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 7 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75"" shells each, for a total capacity of 7+7+1=15 rounds. The reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in.

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliersâ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

If you live in the north metro, you are welcome to purchase a few.
I had a friend that worked for Federal in Anoka, he supplied me with some nice ammo buys once in awhile, some boxed some bulk bag.

Not sure if current retail prices are panic prices or actual pricing as I have not been following the ups & downs of pricing.

I believe these are also called the classic rounds
How about $1 per / $20 for 20 124gr rounds, $1.15 per / $23.00 for 20 135gr, this is a very fair price from what I have researched.
I only planned to sell about 120 or so rounds give or take, nearly there already.
At this time I only plan to sell about another 50 more of the 135gr, sold 50 of these thus far. I do have a nicer supply of the 124gr.

I have 3 guns that I am selling; two custom ARs and an XD-40 Subcompact.
First I have a Springfield Armory XD-40 Subcompact with bright night sights. I am not the original owner. I received her on a trade but came across a nice P938 so I need to let this one go. She appears to have slight holster wear on the front right side of the slide. It has under 300 rounds down the chamber. She will come with 1 9rd mag and 3 12rd mags with extensions, the factory case with goodies, and a SA holster. Price is $500 firm.

Next is a nice special purpose rifle in 5.56/.223. She has a 16â 1/9 NATO CL barrel from a Smith n Wesson upper used primarily as a 22.  The bolt carrier group is from the same S&W upper and shows little sign of use. The upper receiver on this SPR is a monolithic jobbie by Armalite; she is an SPR MOD 1 continuous optics platform.  This allows uninterrupted mounting positions for optics and goodies along the top rail. What is really sweet about this set up is the side and bottom rails are interchangeable with either a full, half, or blank rail. The gas block is a top railed BTE clamp on with magpul sights and she also has a standard A2 flashider.  
The lower is a spikes punisher color filled. Not sure on the LPK in this guy but the trigger is stainless. Has a magpul poly trigger guard, magpul moe rubber grip, spikes ST-T2 buffer, and Blackhawk collapsible stock. There is some cosmetic wear around the front trigger guard mount but is only noticeable if you are looking for it. This set up will come with 2 new 30rd magpul pmags. Asking $1200 OBO.

And last is my sweet 16â spikes spider.  This black widow has a 16â Spikes LE carbine barrel in a 1/7 twist for heavy grain 5.56/.223 and is topped with a spikes shorty dynacomp compensator. Wrapped around the barrel and protecting that lo pro gas block is a troy 13â alpha rail with a built in flip up front sight, comes with picatinny rail inserts for your customization.  The upper is spikes along with the bolt carrier group.  She has a tac latch charging handle to finish her top half off.
Probably the most impressive thing about this set up is how the upper and lower receiver match up. Boys she is tight, tight. No slop. Absolutely awesome! Now her lower half is primarily spikes with some Seekins stuff sprinkled about. The mag release and bolt release are Seekins, the trigger guard is a spikes tactical engraved PA for Primary Arms, the fire control group is a spikes nickel boron battle trigger, and the grip is a Hogue rubber over mold with storage. The stock is a magpul CTR and the buffer kit is spikes except for the Noveske sling adaptor end plate.  This is a really bad rifle.  Iâm asking $1600 OBO for her.

If you have any questions or would like to see more pics email or text is best. 
Thanks.

This pistol was my Wife's EDC for the last 6 months. It has been well cared for. It has approximately 300 rounds through it at the range. She doesn't really want to get rid of it but I have finally talked her into a larger pistol, this one is so small :P

Purchase Includes:

1x Gumball Pink Walther P22 
3x 10rd Magazines
1x N82 Right Handed IWB Holster
1x Hard Shell case the pistol came with

A few things to note:

The gun is finicky with Ammo, it has flawless execution with CCI Minimags and Stingers, but it doesn't like any kind of cheap bulk. If you research a little you will see this is a normal thing with a P22.

The holster is one of the most comfortable I have ever tried. 

The magazines are not available in a higher capacity than 10

This rifle features black phosphate/anodized aluminum finishes, a Stark SE-1 pistol grip with battery compartment, a 6 position adjustable stock by UTI, a Picatinny quad-rail forearm and top rail, rail mounted front/rear adjustable sights, and a stock sling mount. The free float rails are designed to fit all the tactical gear that you can carry. Unlike many ARs, this is a standard feature which you won't end up spending more to upgrade the rail set-ups. It has an efficient autoloading direct-impingement gas system for ejection of spent cartridges and auto reloading. No forward assist is necessary for a rifle this smooth. It does have a dust cover, a large trigger hole, and nice charging handle. The blued barrel is 16.25"", rifled for 1 in 9"" and ends with the muzzle-flash suppressor. The receiver, magazine release, and charging handle are all well designed to make use and maintenance reliable and easy. The upper and lower separate easily with two pins for service and cleaning. The receiver accepts 5.56 Nato ammunition as well as .223 Remington brass or steel casings. It has a 31 round capacity and is a real front-runner in the AR style market. Colt also makes a good quad rail set-up like this, but is generally much more costly. Mossberg redefined affordable with .223s and the .22lr. They have been around over 90 years. They must be doing something right. Mossberg offers their one year manu. warranty on this product. I have additional 30 round factory Mossberg magazines for sale"

I contacted Ruger and they told me based on the serial number that the gun was made in 1980 and came with an 18 1/2 inch barrel and a Walnut Stock. 

The only blemishes I found on the gun was where the bullets are entered into the tub, which unless it is brand new I have never seen one without a little bluing missing there.

The other is on the shiny metal where the charging handle goes into the slide assembly, look at pic and you will see a small about 3/8"" circular blemish on the metal by the cocking handle.  I believe a dremel and some polishing would take this out.

A family member of mine bought this Carbine off Armslist about 6 months ago for $750 as it is.  I did just put Weaver scope bases on the gun.  He decided he does not want to hunt and gave me the rifle.  I already have the same rifle though, so I don't need a second one.

I stripped the rifle down and gave it a thorough cleaning and lubed it with oil and Frog Lube.  

I have had 2 surgeries in the last 6 months and my family member never goes to the range, so neither of us has even fired the rifle.

I can only post 3 pics, so if you want more send me an email at REDACTED.

So as I said he obviously overpaid at $750 so I just want to get as much of his money back as possible.  Shoot me an offer or if you want to see I am home all day everyday.  I also have the same rifle and my stepdad has 3 more of the same rifle and the wood on this one is easily the nicest I have seen.

The free float rails are designed to fit all the tactical gear that you can carry. Unlike many ARs, this is a standard feature which you won't end up spending more to upgrade the rail set-ups. It has an efficient autoloading direct-impingement gas system for ejection of spent cartridges and auto reloading. No forward assist is necessary for a rifle this smooth. It does have a dust cover, a large trigger hole, and nice charging handle. The blued barrel is 16.25"", rifled for 1 in 9"" and ends with the muzzle-flash suppressor. The receiver, magazine release, and charging handle are all well designed to make use and maintenance reliable and easy. The upper and lower separate easily with two pins for service and cleaning. The receiver accepts 5.56 Nato ammunition as well as .223 Remington brass or steel casings. It has a 31 round capacity and is a real front-runner in the AR style market. Colt also makes a good quad rail set-up like this, but is generally much more costly. Mossberg redefined affordable with .223s and the .22lr. They have been around over 90 years.

Moving home soon and needing to work out what I want to take with me and what I should let go. 

This firearm has never used in weather or kept anywhere outside optimal controlled room teperature conditions and so it's very clean (though it could use a dusting...sorry about that!)

Consequently, it's in perfect condition, scope as well, and even still has lens covers. It's only ever been used by me, meaning that no kids have been hard on it. However, it's the perfect rifle to get a younger person started. This single-pump weapon is very quiet in use, ammo couldn't be cheaper, and it's a pretty powerful 1000ft/sec shooter.

This is a more than fair price for a hardly used weapon. Don't bring $85 and hope to get the gun. Instead, bring $90 and you'll save yourself a trip to the ATM.

All joking aside, thanks for looking. If this isn't for you, hope you find what you are looking for.

 Made in Italy by Pietta and imported by LSI, the PPS is a semi-automatic rimfire remake of the famous Soviet-era machine gun. The PPS uses a blowback system with two recoil springs located behind the bolt that insure the correct closing and a release that's locked by a lever-type safety. The barrel is the most noticeable part of the rifle with its drilled barrel-cover that gives the carbine a military look. A screw fixed base with a dovetailed blade front sight and a folding V-leaf rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation provide the rifle's sight picture.
 Ive never had one problem with this rifle and 400 rounds shot through it.

I wanted something with old world style and love the Old West era so this was a great option. The hammer spurs are close to each other making cocking them with one sweep of the thumb very easy.  The wood furniture is beautiful! It is a heavy gun which makes a long day at the range feel even longer. But the weight also means it swings very well. Many friends have said they love how steady it is when tracking the target. This gun is made in China but it is made very well and definitely up to Cimarron's exacting standards. The gun is a great addition to any collection, is a fun shooter and a great conversation piece.

Readily separated into two subassemblies, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular RugerÂ® 10/22Â®. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America's favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

 The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

 The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves which hold the subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

 The 4.67-pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37"" long when assembled; each subassembly is less than 20 1/4"" long when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action and ten round rotary magazine (one magazine is provided), the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a compact and portable package.
