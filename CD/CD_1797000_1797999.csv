The serial number is 1107926, indicating it was manufactured in 1919. The Mark I was developed for the Pedersen Device, which was an attempt to introduce a semi-automatic rifle on a emergency basis at the end of WWI. The war ended before the Pedersen Devices could be fielded but production of Mark I's continued into 1919 before the program was scrapped (as were the majority of the Pedersen Devices). The barrel is the original installed on this rifle and is a Springfield Barrel dated September 1919. The barrel is superb with a mirror bore, strong rifling and it gauges at just over 0! This will a very accurate shooter. The stock is a Type 2 ""S"" Stock that was manufactured by Springfield Armory as a replacement stock and has the finger grooves and two reinforcing bolts. There is a ""J"" stamp in the magazine cutoff recess and a sans serif circle ""P"" firing proof on the bottom of the wrist. The stock has normal handling dings and scratches but no cracks. This rifle was covered inside and out with cosmoline when I got it, to include the stock, and I don't think this rifle was every issued given the lack of wear in the barrel and on the hardware. All parts retain the majority of the arsenal gray-green parkerized finish, which was done during overhaul either just before or during WWII. There are no post-war arsenal cartouches. The hand guard is also a Springfield Type 9, 1st Variation convex that has handling and storage dings but no cracks. Has the original Type 2 Lower Barrel Band with sling swivel that has nearly 100% of the reparkerized finish. The milled Upper Barrel Band with bayonet lug and stacking swivel likewise has nearly 100% of the reparkerized finish. Has a milled Rear Sling Swivel Assembly. Front Sight is a Model 1905 Type 2, 2nd Variation. The Butt Plate is an early Type 3A fully checkered with trap door. The milled Springfield Trigger Guard and Floor Plate also have nearly 100% of the reparkerized finish. The bolt is an excellent bent bolt Brown & Sharp subcontracted bolt that also has nearly all of its parkerized finish and is marked ""B&S"" over an Ordnance Bomb on the bolt handle. Has Type 1 Serif Magazine Cutoff. This rifle functions perfectly and will be an awesome shooter given the barrel. This rifle is C&R eligible.

Selling a barely-used Taurus PT 1911 AR in blue. The ""AR"" designates that it has an Accessory Rail. This handgun has less than 100 rounds through it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it and it's worked perfectly the couple times I've had it out. I'm only considering selling because it doesn't get out much and I can use the money for another firearm. Gun comes with all original items including plastic case, 2 magazines, cleaning brush, and Taurus hammer lock. Also included is a holster (not pictured) just like this one: http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/auction_info.php/products_id/411541165/auctions_id/736/page/1/auction_show/1



I checked at a local gun dealer today and their normal price on this gun is $649. I'm looking to get $550. 

Face to face sale in the Brighton, Thornton area. Get it before the new private sale laws go into effect July 1.



I will not ship, so don't ask. Buyer must show CO ID or CCW and be of legal age. No felons, etc, etc. I reserve the right to not sell to you for any reason.  Your response to this listing indicates you are legally allowed to purchase a firearm.

It has had exactly 15 rounds fired. The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

I am not a collector or an M1 expert so I dont really know the in-depth info collectors are typically interested in other than to tell you this: Ive had the rifle in my safe for years, the end of the barrel is threaded, the butt plate is missing, I consider this rifle to be a shooter not a high grade collectible, Ive had this on another site and I received many calls from collectors telling me why whoever threaded the barrel and refinished the stock diminished the collector value, I understand the point and its reflected in the price, there is another M1 on another site thats probably more collectible, its 2200.00"

For those wanting a deep penetrating all copper expanding 38SPL load, this is it. Depending on impact velocity, (barrel lengths and target distance vary) you can expect between 11 to 13 inches of penetration in flesh and bone. Buffalo Bore was able to engineer a flash suppressed powder for this load and therefore the shooter will not be blinded by his own gun fire in low light. This creates a huge tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about.
This load is safe to fire in all 38SPL and all 357 firearms that are in normal operating condition. This cartridge is designed so the bullet will not jump crimp when subjected to recoil from firing in super light 12 OZ revolvers, provided you do not subject any cartridge to the recoil of more than ten to twelve firings."

Shows signs of use, shoots and groups great, great modern 9mm, very rare..
Accepts Beretta and Taurus mags..

The Polish MAG 98 9mm /9x19 NATO caliber pistol is an improved variation of the original Polish MAG95. 
It was produced for the Polish Special Forces, Border Guard and Prison Guard (Straż Więzienna) in the 1990's. 
Made in the Z.M. Lucznik factory 11 at Radom Poland. 

These fine pistols feature a ambidextrous decocker safety, steel slide, alloy frame, and serrated trigger guard front strap.
In 1996 the Mag 98 was evaluated for adoption purposes by the Polish Army. It had advantages over its competition such as 
better reliability, durability and safety (better protection against accidental discharge, when dropped). 

Although the quality was deemed superior,  the MAG 98 was rejected by the Army because the frame was slightly larger
than  the contract qualifications called for. That was a shame because most service members prefered it and in fact 
the pistol has a good reputation among users: It is considered a precise, well balanced and durable weapon 
and its mass leads to good stability during firing. 

This double/single action pistol comes with ONE 15rd magazine."

Ruger 22/45 pistols have offered shooters the familiar feel of a 1911 pistol with the performance and value of a Ruger rimfire pistol. Sturm, Ruger is proud to introduce a thoroughly modern family of autoloading pistols, which combines the best of both - the New Ruger 22/45 Mark III pistols. All 22/45 Mark III pistols feature: An unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in the ""SAFE"" position. A magazine disconnect to prevent accidental discharge when the magazine has been removed. The first-ever visible loaded chamber indicator for a .22 rimfire pistol. New front and rear sights for faster, more precise target acquisition. New precision-molded polymer grip frame with a serrated front strap and checkered grip panel areas and back strap for a great appearance and comfortable, non-slip hold. A manual safety that positively locks the sear. An internal cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving-slide designs. A new, contoured ejection port and tapered bolt ears. Two ten-round magazines and high-impact case included with each pistol. All adjustable sight .22 pistols come drilled and tapped for a Weaver-type scope base adapter, included with each pistol.

Soft-point bullets are less common than hollow points, due to the slower expansion and greater penetration, but they fill roles that hollow points do not. In some cases the reduced expansion is desired, so that more penetration is achieved before the bullet begins the rapid deceleration caused by expansion. In other cases, the smooth, rounded profile typical of a soft-point bullet is preferred over the concave tip of a hollow point, because the latter tends to suffer failure to feed malfunctions in certain magazine-fed firearms. Many of the more modern magazine-fed firearms were expressly designed to feed hollow points reliably, but many older and military-derived designs were not

Ruger 22/45 pistols have offered shooters the familiar feel of a 1911 pistol with the performance and value of a Ruger rimfire pistol. Sturm, Ruger is proud to introduce a thoroughly modern family of autoloading pistols, which combines the best of both - the New Ruger 22/45 Mark III pistols. All 22/45 Mark III pistols feature: An unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in the ""SAFE"" position. A magazine disconnect to prevent accidental discharge when the magazine has been removed. The first-ever visible loaded chamber indicator for a .22 rimfire pistol. New front and rear sights for faster, more precise target acquisition. New precision-molded polymer grip frame with a serrated front strap and checkered grip panel areas and back strap for a great appearance and comfortable, non-slip hold.

688,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1797688,"For Sale/Trade:  Arsenal sgl-31 with accys, magazines, and AMMO!!!","New Bern, Jacksonville, North Carolina",$ 0,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 16, 2013",Rifles,no type,5.45x39mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Made in the popular 5.45x39.5 caliber. The brainchild of two of the best gun makers in the world, the SGL31-61 rifle is manufactured at the world-famous Izhmash Factory in Russia then imported and remanufactured by Arsenal Inc, Las Vegas, NV into its final configuration. 

The absolute reliability and authenticity make the SGL31-61 the ONLY CHOICE for collectors, perfectionists, and AK enthusiasts alike. All authentic components, made according to the original technology, and detailed attention, which went into the manufacturing, make the SGL31-61 THE rifle you will be proud to own and show off to your friends at the shooting range. The ONLY truly configured AK-74 currently available in the US market that uses brand new Hammer Forged and Chrome Line barrel, the SGL31-61 offers the safety and reliability that you expect from your rifle, making it the highest quality AK-74 available on the market. 

This is one of the finest AK systems imported into the US. Anyone that truly knows AK systems, knows that Arsenal Inc. makes some of the best AK's in the world. I purchased this AK back in December brand new. When I purchased this rifle, it came configured as a true Arsenal SGL-31 61 with the black polymer furniture on it. I have since upgraded the rifle with new furniture and converted it to a sgl-31 94. Meaning I removed the standard buttstock and put on the ACE folding stock. The Ace folding stock is the second best folding stock made, behind the true folding stock that's standard on the 94. The Ace folding is made of light weight Aluminum and features an unique push button actuation method that securely locks the stock to the side when folded. It is a rock solid stock with no ""wobble."" I chose this stock because of the robust and durability characteristics it displays. 

Now for the features and upgrades:

*Chrome lined hammer forges barrel 
*front sight block with bayonet lug
*stamped receiver and magwell dimples for no magazine wobble (its an Arsenal!!)
*Ace Folding stock with locking mechanism
*US Palm battle grip
*Tapco G2 Trigger group
*XS Night sights (still have original sights as well that will come with package)
*Kreb's custom retaining plate
*Midwest Industries Rail system
*AK74 muzzle break
*Magpul AFG (black)

I ordered 8 Bulgarian Circle 10 magazines from KVAR.com at $50 dollars each that I will include in thie package. Two of which are brand new, never used. The remaining 6 have been used but are in great working condition. These are the best magazines ever made for this rifle. It also includes 1 factory 10 round magazine. This is great for sighting in or hunting! 

I will also include 1,000 rounds of 5.45 ammo to get you started with this rifle. 

Arsenal sgl-31 61...........................$1199.00 from KVAR.com
Accys/upgrades.............................$500
Magazines.....................................$400
Ammo..........................................$200

Basically over $2200 in this package. These prices are legitimate and can all be verified online with a little research. I know where I bought everything from and know what I paid for them. 

Obviously, I can not expect to get the same amount of money that I put into it. Having said that, I will not respond to lowball offers, please be respectful and I'll, in turn, do the same. Please make a reasonable offer and we'll talk!"

773,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1797773,For Sale:  NIB Glock G30SF w Deep Discount Mods Available. Documented as the Finest Pistol Ever Made by Glock and Masad Ayoob's Favoite Pistol!,"Mesa, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 549,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 24, 2013",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"For ANYONE who know ANYTHING about tactical and defensive shooting, Massad Ayoob's assessment is legendary. 

Ayoob feels the Glock 30 is the best pistol ever made by Glock. He emphatically states it is Glock's most accurate and tactically/practically perfect pistol! Massad Ayoob is internationally known as a renowned author, columnist, and instructor on the subject of firearms and self-defense. He is Glock Talk's resident expert in the GATE Self-Defense Forum. 

On several occasions, Ayoob has made very compelling and positive statements about the amazing accuracy of the G30 which he has chosen for one of his carry guns. Ayoob favors the G30 over the G21 and G36 Glock 45ACP pistols and calls the G30 his favorite Glock. In his book, ""The Gun Digest Book of Combat Handgunnery"", Ayoob writes the G30 ""may be the most accurate pistol that Glock makes."" In his personal experience, the stock G30 with factory ammo is capable of under 1.0-inch groups for 5 shots at 25 yards from off the bench, performing better than the Gen3 G21 or G36. The G30 is freakishly accurate for a combat pistol with a 3.78 inch barrel. 

""Mas wrote a comprehensive review of the Glock 30 that was published in the American Handgunner 1998 Combat Annual, titled ""Fist Full of .45"". The impressive result he obtained on the firing range with the first G30 he received for evaluation is very interesting reading. After firing three boxes of ammo to break in the pistol, Ayoob shot a 1-3/16"" group of 5 shots at a measured range of 25 yards from a righthand barricade standing position using Federal 230gr HydraShok HP factory ammo. The best three of five shots were just 3/8"" apart. He was so favorably impressed by the G30 that he couldn't resist the temptation to buy the test pistol for his personal use."" Also see: http://www.glocktalk.com/forums/showpost.php?p=20109903&postcount=11 . 

And, unlike many Glocks, its ""SF"" frame will fit your hand! The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. 

The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands. 

SPECIAL OFFER: I can perform the popular recessing of the trigger guard where it intersects the back-atrap. This further improves the ergonomics of the grip PLUS it helps correct the well-known, aim-point of Glocks, which is universally acknowledged as high for the majority of shooters. I charge $20 while framesmiths charge $30-40. 

I can also install the highly-acclaimed McNally Trigger System for $139 (retail $160 and increasing to $180 in 2 months); I will install it with FREE LABOR! 

MANUFACTURER PRICING INFORMATION: MSR Price: $637.00, * Consumer Price:	$637.00, Sale Ends: NA, Additional Fees: $0.00, Total: $637.00 MSRP.

This rifle has been shot and there has been no issues with the suspected problems that Remington has posted. Remington put a ReCall on the 597, 17 HMR because while using Remington ammunition the cases were expanding , causing ejection and feeding issues.

The final item is a leather pocket gear organizer with integrated credit card slots. It is made out of a tan leather.

Asking  $550 for the lot or $200 per rifle. Most of the cosmoline has been baked out of the stocks, all metal parts are also free of cosmoline and the bolts have been polished. All rifles have a NON-HEX reciever. Collectors may frown upon refinishing a mosin but any of these rifles would make a good gift or wall hanger, also practical shooters as most of the rifling is intact. The 1939 Tula is not counter bored, both 1942's have been.

-1st rifle in the top pic is a 1939 Tula with matching bolt/stock plate. Mag is not
matching numbers. 
-2nd rifle is a 1942 Izhevsk w/matching bolt/stock plate. Mag not matching # 
-3rd is also a 1942 Izhevsk w/ all NON-matching #'s

All 3 will come with a bayonet thats NON-Matching and an oiler/stripper clip pouch/bolt tool. Refinishing job is not professional but what I would call Very Good for a rifle stock that has been Cosmo soaked and in storage for 70+ years :) again $200 per rifle or I would rather sell all 3 for $550. No hassle with cleaning up these rifles. These rifles are becoming more popular and prices are creeping up into the $120 to $170+  range for them in basic Cosmo soaked surplus condition.
