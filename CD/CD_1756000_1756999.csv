Putting new grips on your 1911 does not make your 1911 a custom piece.
Adding a bunch of 'tactical tupperware"" does not make your $1,000 AR an $2,500 dollar rifle.
AR Mags are available and reasonable again, there are $16-$18 P-Mags all over town.
If you overpaid for something during the panic, don't expect it to have the same value now.  Looking at you WASR-10!
If someone says ""No Taurus or Jennings or Bryco or Hi-Point guns"" in their ad, that probably means they aren't looking for one, so don't offer that shit.
If someone says ""No Trades"" in their ad, do you think they might mean it?
If someone says ""Not for sale"" in their ad, do you think they weren't talking to you?
If someone says ""Make offer"", that means to make an offer.  If you ask them for their bottom dollar, they should ask you for your top dollar.  Man up and make an offer!
If you're expecting MSRP value for your gun, then accept the MSRP value of the other guy's.
If you've got something in your picture that doesn't come with the gun like a scope or ammo or holster, take it out of the picture!

Compact, lightweight and intuitive; delivering results to captivate the most discerning audience.The EOS 350D Digital employs Canon's acclaimed CMOS technology, for outstanding image quality and 8.0 Megapixel resolution. Always be primed for the next shot with responsive 3 frame per second, 14 frame burst performance and instant 0.2 second start up time. Powerful DIGIC II architecture taken from Canon's pro-series cameras ensures no compromise on sophisticated, effective and super-fast image processing.7 auto focus points are distributed across the frame for fast, accurate focusing, even with off-center subjects. Lock focus before the shot with One Shot AF, or switch to AI Servo AF for predictive tracking of moving subjects - great for wildlife and sports photography.The powerful pop-up flash offers plenty of lighting flexibility. E-TTL II distance-linked flash reads lens distance information and ambient light for accurate flash metering: perfect for recomposed shots and difficult reflections. The camera is compatible with the entire EX Speedlite flash range, including the Speedlite 580EX, which transmits color temperature information for improved color stability.The EOS 350D Digital is compatible with more than 60 Canon EF lenses, including Canon's EF-S lenses.Before shooting, choose to optimize JPEG images either for direct printing or post processing. For ultimate flexibility, JPEG and RAW images write simultaneously. Canon's Digital Photo Professional RAW image processing software gives you post-shoot control over valuable RAW images.A USB 2.0 Hi-Speed interface ensures rapid image uploads and fast direct printing. Once connected directly to any PictBridge compatible printer, simply hit the 'Direct Print' button for an instant print of the displayed image; automatically sized and correctly aligned.

These will make an excellent starting point for a really lightweight rifle. I wasn't originally expecting to sell these, so i wasn't as careful as I could have been while assembling and each has a couple of scratches on the finish. The lower is constructed of a magnesium alloy to reduce weight by 35% without using any plastic, and the Ace stock weighs only 5 oz.

These guns were tossed around quite a bit, but it does not appear they were shot very much.  The bores will have strong rifling.  These came out of storage so they will have cosmoline on them - some rifles will have more cosmoline than others.  They will all have the mounted folding bayonet.  serial numbers probably will not match - these are not really collectible rifles - they are better for good cheap shooting. 

Prices range from $100 parts guns to $180 for the best in the lot.

Please note these are only available for pickup in Fresno. (I don not drive all over the state delivering guns) I seem to have a lot of people driving from the bay area so I have posted this here as well.

I have a few Mosin Nagant carbines for sale.  These are the shorter version at roughly 40"" long.  They have a folding bayonet attached.  

The metal is in decent shape.  Some minor beginnings of rust on some guns, some dark spots on the bolts, etc.  I do have a few that have some pitting but the price will be lower on those.  Rifling is strong on all these guns.  It appears they were thrown around quite a bit but not shot very much.  The stocks will have bumps, bruises, scratches, dents, chips, etc.

Prices will range from $150 to $250 depending on the gun

These were in storage so they will have some cosmoline on them which you should clean off pretty well before shooting.  

Cash and carry.  These old guns are exempt from typical FFL transfer.  You get to take it home the day you buy it.  No other additional fees, etc.

some ammo for these is also available - metal can of 440 rounds for $150

Also you should be aware that July 1st most of the AR type rifles are going to be pulled from shelves and returned to distributors. This is because the new law has some stipulations about detachable magazines. 

Ask your local gun store. I believe that modified ""compliant"" models will hit shelves late summer. But I'd say get your toys now, while they are still available and enjoy your summer shooting."

The metal is in decent shape.  Some minor beginnings of rust on some guns, some dark spots on the bolts, etc.  I do have a few that have some pitting but the price will be lower on those.

These were in storage so they will have some cosmoline on them which you should clean off pretty well before shooting.  

Cash and carry.  These old guns are exempt from typical FFL transfer.  You get to take it home the day you buy it.  No other additional fees, etc.

NFA REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (16 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)

These are lead nosed rounds with the ""moly coat"" on the projectile to minimize fouling. It is a slightly lower velocity round than typical 9mm (1,117 fps). This ammo is loose packaged in the box shown. Hence the ""ugly brown box"" label from Tucson Ammo Company.

I have tested this ammo and had no issues in 3 magazines. I will admit, it is not the cleanest ammo and would be better suited for outdoor shooting as opposed to an indoor range. Accurate rounds with slightly reduced recoil due to the reduced velocity."

It's the 9mm big brother to Walther's PPK. It's even been used in several films with Sean Connery and Roger Moore and the Bourne series . No longer made, the P5 was brought into the US in the 80's. This one was from 1986. It's the perfect size for carry but remains extremely accurate. It packs a powerful punch a 9 x 19 full size 9mm should. It has some great German features that put the battery release to use as a decocker. It ejects to left. The magazine release has been brought up on the grip in the P5 compact. the magazines spring out promptly as they should.  That is the hard to find version.  I like that better than it's predessors and other European pistols with the release on the heel. This is truly a rare gun.  Don't confuse it with the P5, it's a fine gun but not as rare as the P5 COMPACT like this one.  It has the coolness of a ppk, but it's a full 9mm. It comes with the hard to find custom holster, the original box and manual and 2-7 round clips.  I just got this pistol back from the gun smith. now it's even more rare. I had him put a nickel finish on it for me. It looks awesome.  It's only been fired by the gun smith after reassembly to verify operation. It's in immaculate condition. It comes with 2 - 7 round clips (had them nickeled to match as well).  I Look forward to hearing from you. Shoot safe, shoot straight and shoot often..."

This cart was bought and stored, but never actually used.  Very well made cart.  The details from CalGraf is below:





At last!  An actual ""covered"" cart—sit on it, play cards, clean your guns on the Cowboy Coffin Cart . . .





The Cowboy Coffin is the secure way to keep your weapons from dust, dirt and the bad guys.  It holds 5 long guns (3 rifles, 2 shotguns) in the same sort of cradle as the Range Kart.  But, instead of a Range Box or other sort of box, there is a compartment for your cartridges and handguns in the lid of the Coffin, 16"" x 16"" x 4"" with drop down lid that becomes a table.  Lid is held in place by slide hook on side.


Wheels are 16"" hard rubber 1890s bicycle wheel spoked on a hardwood and steel axle that is tapped to accept the 1/2"" threads on the wheels, and two 1/4"" bolts secure it to the Coffin.


A 36 inch piano hinge is on the right side; the Coffin is approximately 47 1/2"" inside height, and 20"" wide at the ""shoulders"", inside measurement.  It is made of 3/4"" pine, double-sided 1/2"" birch plywood top and bottom with the side 3/4"" pine.  The Coffin lid is held open by use of a dowel brace.  There is a leg on the top back as well as the leg corresponding to wheels underneath which work great for ""hand-trucking"" the Coffin around.  Easily removed without tools leaving only a Coffin with sisal rope handles. Between stages you can ""lay it out"" and sit on it!


Guns are able to be carried with the actions open, and you can remove your guns, muzzle up for safety and in compliance with the rules (or in the horizontal position as well).  As with our Original Range Kart, the Cowboy Gun Coffin can be disassembled—wheels, axle, legs.  The chain shown in several of the images has been replaced with a leather strap, also shown.


Cowboy Coffin weighs in at about 65#.   It is finished with a Watco oil.  Coffin pivots on wheels in upright position, held in place by base which provides stability.

Includes: one brand new spare buffer/recoil spring from Brownells'. I also have a Marlin box, as well as the box and papers for the scope. Also will include one new and unopened bulk box of Federal Auto Match 40 grain round nose lead 22LR ammo. 
Soft case not included.
Lots of fun to target shoot and plink with. I recently bought a bolt action Marlin that I prefer, so this one's for sale. 
It  cycles great and is amazingly accurate as long as you feed it reasonably clean ammunition. I almost exclusively run Federal Auto Match 40 grain lead round nose through it, but it does OK with Federal Champion 36 grain copper plated hollow points too. It was recently inspected and serviced by the manufacturer and has had the bolt and chamber polished to remove tooling marks and smooth out the action, increasing the reliability even better than new out of the box. 
Price is firm. Purchaser must be at least 18 years of age, legally able to own firearms and complete a bill of sale.
If this ad is still posted, it's still for sale."

I shot about 50 rds through it. The action is smooth with a clean trigger break, and the cylinder locks up nice and tight. 
    The gun belt and holster are both Triple k brand with all brass hardware. The belt is sized for someone who is anywhere from size 36to 40. Both items were purchased new. I bought this setup to get into cowboy action shooting but haven't had the time for another shooting hobby.
    This would make a great camp/hunting rig to go with your long gun. .38 rds feel like your shootin a 22. I can throw in 25 rds of .357 to get you goin and fill up your bullet loops on the belt. Will sell for 400 with no ammo. Not interested in selling seperate. I'm interested in full size 1911, gp100, 10/22, newer mini 14 with thicker barrel, etc. I'm will take trade+cash, straight trade, or trade+cash/ammo/otherguns from me.
