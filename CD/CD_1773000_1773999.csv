The load is also tailored to the defensive use of the shotgun. Remington's Tac 8 Buckshot provides the reliability, consistency, and stopping power you need when a shotgun comes out of the rack. This loading created a new standard of pattern performance with the addition of our one piece compression section Power Piston wad column, polymer buffering and hardened 3% antimony pellets.

It will come in a soft sided case and I have several opened tins of high quality pellets that go with it (close to 2000 pellets). 

Asking $200 but I need the cash so feel free to make reasonable offers. Just don't expect me to give it away.

Selling my FNH PS-90, $1900 Firm. 

I bought this gun brand new. I have the receipt still in the box along with the original FNH paperwork; I purchased the PS-90 on 21 March 13. I am firm on the price of $1900/cash, which is what I paid; I am NOT looking to gouge anyone, if nobody wants it for that price it can sit in the safe. I was hoping to get a Five-seven and was going to use this as a companion rifle, but I doubt I will be able to buy one before 1 July 2013 when all the laws change.

This PS-90 has been shot less than 300 times over two shooting trips because I used up all my 5.7X28mm ammo and I had 300 rounds, and I did shoot my buddies Five-seven 40 times two full mags, the PS-90 would of been shot 260 times. Anyways practically new, the new owner won't be disappointed.

More photos at request, $1900/cash firm (I should be asking more). Only reply if you are legal to own a firearm and I will require a photocopy of an official Colorado state id and a signed wavier that states you are legal to own a firearm in the State of Colorado. If you are considering buying this PS-90 you better buy it before it becomes more difficult than my terms above.  Any background check that will have to be performed after 1 July 2013 will be at the buyers expense, and I won't be able to include the high capacity magazines.  

Also in the photos I have shown a lot of magazines, they are for sale at additional prices $45 for the FNH 30 Round and $40 for the AR-57 50 Round Magazines.  I will sell them out right, the gun doesn't need to be purchased at the same time.  Buy-em now or you can't buy them after 1 July 2013.

NOT looking for any trades at this time. Unless you have a realistic trade price on your FNH FiveseveN 5.7x28 or Browning HighWall in .454 Casull.

The difference starts with Remington's proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597 all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, the 597 incorporates a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot ""hold open"" magazine feature and Remington's patented, easy-to-use stagger stack 10rd box mag.   Mine is packaged with the awesome ProMag tactical stock with colapsible buttstock, forearm grip, detachable show bayonette a 3-9x32MM Remington scope a 25rd extended ""banana clip"" magazine, in addition to the original 10 rder and single point fatigue sling. This gun is just crazy fun and very accurate I shoot 2"" groups at 150 yards. Sadly have to let it go, moving to NY and due to their insane gun laws this rifle would be illegal because it has the ability to hold more than 10 rds!"

Never a failure, perfect for a project to make into a sniper variant (long barreled)


From Wikipedia: 
The Zastava M72 chambers and fires the 7.62x39mm M43 round. It is a gas-operated, air-cooled, drum-fed firearm with a fixed stock.
This weapon is a near copy of the Soviet RPK light machine gun. There are a few differences on the M72/M72A. It does not have a scope side rail mount, the butt is also different, having the shape of a regular AK-47 rifle. It has a reinforced receiver, night sights and no carrying handle. The barrel also differs from other RPK rifles because of the cooling fins to help with heat dissipation from prolonged fire. The M72 only appears with a heavy profile barrel as opposed to Russian and Romanian RPK rifles that can come in both light or heavy barrel configurations.

This specific M-72 was purchased locally about 3 years ago, roughly 400 rounds put through it, and cleaned after every use.  No failures ever experienced with a variety of ammo manufactures put through it.

Do not have time for the 'hobby' any longer (plus, pretty expensive for me), and really need to sell.  Not really wanting any trades right now, but am not completely closed-minded about that either.

Up for sale is a mint condition DPMS with chrome-moly barrel, standard carbine length, collapsible stock, 3 new 30 round mags included with anti-tilt followers (only 1 is used on one occasion), Eotech holographic sight (not a clone), all aluminum quadrail (have original handguards in original DPMS factory box), Magpul vertical foregrip, Tactical light (150 lumens) with strobe on left, and laser mounted on right side.  

Package will include 220 rounds of good brass ammo (no steel casings):

50 Remington
50 Ultramax soft-tip
60 PMC Bronze
40 Winchester
20 'loose' Federal Lake City Steel Penetrating ammo, so a total of 220 rounds.

Package deal also includes a new condition tactical soft-case w/ the magazine pouches; I have two soft cases (not pictured, but can see bottom of one of them), buyer can choose which they prefer. 

Also includes metal back-up sights (MBUS), front and rear which I mail-ordered and have not arrived yet, will give them to new buyer once they get here ($60).

If you added all these items up separately, ($779 rifle, $400 Eotech, $125 PLUS invested in ammo, $40 extra mags, $175 in quadrail, light/laser, and VFG, $30 soft case, $60 MBUS, for reference, without taxes) and the time it took to get everything together, then you can see this is not a ""gouge"", but a fair and reasonable asking price which is unusual based on what I have seen here on Armslist, and even GunBroker.

Asking $1350 or best offer in cash or 'potential' trade.  Thanks for checking out my listing.  Meeting in Tulsa face-to-face only, buyer MUST be a Oklahoma resident.  Ad to be removed when sold."

If you are wanting a ""cheap gun to shoot"" you can get a normal 91/30 for $140+ shipping online. This is a hex receiver ex dragoon, and while its a cheap gun to shoot it is also uncommon and runs for about $275+ online. Hex,Tula and Ex Dragoon make this a very nice rifle to pick up.
You can spend $180 and buy a 91/30 round receiver at a gun show and you will have a $160 rifle. Or you can grab this $300 rifle at $200 and already be on the +. Im simply to lazy to sell online/ship. My loss your gain.

This was an accuchoke gun and I loved the barrel and the wood grain finish but they didn't offer one in this configuration for home defense, so I created one. The barrel is 20"" with the top rail still attached. The receiver has been drilled and tapped for rails and currently has a pic rail on it. It has a NCStar reflex and a pressure activated laser. You guys know what the shops charge drill and tap and how much it is to cut one down the right way. The gun is in excellent condition, the wood has no scratches or dents and is beautiful, the receiver and barrel are equally so. Looking for 400 obo, thanks for looking."

The stock, seems to me, is in outstanding shape especially for the age. There are a few marks as if another rifle was bumped into it in a safe. Look at the pictures and judge the stock for yourself. The metal shows almost no scraps (a few minor scratches.) The front sight blade is not bent as I have often seen with these types of sights. The rear sight is missing the piece that slides fore and back to adjust it. There are redfield rings on a single piece base. It has a R in a crosshair embossed on it and is very similar to the current Leupold one piece bases. I can take more pictures as needed.

I have never shot this rifle and I have no idea about the functional condition. Please have a gunsmith look it over before shooting.

The chamber seems to show NO rust and it cycles by hand perfectly. The bore is shiny with strong rifleing."

This gun was manufactured and purchased 20 Mach 1993.  I bought this gun 13 July 2010. I have the receipt still in the box along with the original Freedom Arms paperwork

This freedom arms has very few rounds shots through it.  I have shot it less then 50 rounds, and very few full factory loads, I shoot lighter hand loads.  The only reason I am selling it I didn't like the 7.5 inch barrel, I bought the same gun with a 6 inch barrel.  It has very minor scratches for a gun this old and one good scratch on the right side grip, see Photo 3 I knocked the rough edges off but it is still visible, if I keep it I was going to get Rosewood Grips.  The bore and cylinder are bright and shinny, ready for hundreds of more rounds.  I don't know why but folks are always looking for these older Freedom Arms because of some manufacturing differences.  So get it while you can.

More photos at request, $1900/cash (I should be asking more). Only reply if you are legal to own a firearm and I will require a photocopy of an official Colorado state id and a signed wavier that states you are legal to own a firearm in the State of Colorado. If you are considering buying this Freedom Arms you better buy it before it becomes more difficult than my terms above. Any background check that will have to be performed after 1 July 2013 will be at the buyers expenses. 

NOT looking for any trades at this time. Unless you have a realistic trade price on your FNH FiveseveN 5.7x28 or Browning HighWall in .454 Casull.

Do not have time for the 'hobby' any longer (plus, pretty expensive for me), and really need to sell.  Not really wanting any trades right now, but am not completely closed-minded about that either.

Up for sale is a mint condition DPMS with chrome-moly barrel, standard carbine length, collapsible stock, 3 new 30 round mags included with anti-tilt followers (only 1 is used on one occasion), Eotech holographic sight (not a clone), all aluminum quadrail (have original handguards in original DPMS factory box), Magpul vertical foregrip, Tactical light (150 lumens) with strobe on left, and laser mounted on right side.

50 Remington
50 Ultramax soft-tip
60 PMC Bronze
40 Winchester
20 'loose' Federal Lake City Steel Penetrating ammo, so a total of 220 rounds.

Package deal also includes a new condition tactical soft-case w/ the magazine pouches; I have two soft cases (not pictured, but can see bottom of one of them), buyer can choose which they prefer. 

Also includes metal back-up sights (MBUS), front and rear which I mail-ordered and have not arrived yet, will give them to new buyer once they get here ($60).

If you added all these items up separately, ($779 rifle, $400 Eotech, $125 PLUS invested in ammo, $40 extra mags, $175 in quadrail, light/laser, and VFG, $30 soft case, $60 MBUS, for reference, without taxes) and the time it took to get everything together, then you can see this is not a ""gouge"", but a fair and reasonable asking price which is unusual based on what I have seen here on Armslist, and even GunBroker.

Asking $1350 or best offer in cash or 'potential' trade.  Thanks for checking out my listing.  Meeting in Tulsa face-to-face only, buyer MUST be a Oklahoma resident.  Ad to be removed when sold."

Like new, as in 25 rounds through her then cleaned; only 6 months old.

Do not have time for the 'hobby' any longer (plus, pretty expensive for me), and really need to sell.  Not really wanting any trades right now, but am not completely closed-minded about that either.

Up for sale is a mint condition DPMS with chrome-moly barrel, standard carbine length, collapsible stock, 3 new 30 round mags included with anti-tilt followers (only 1 is used on one occasion), Eotech holographic sight (not a clone), all aluminum quadrail (have original handguards in original DPMS factory box), Magpul vertical foregrip, Tactical light (150 lumens) with strobe on left, and laser mounted directly on the right side within finger-reach of the VFG.  

Package will include 220 ROUNDS of good brass ammo (no steel casings, all reloadable, all 55 grain except the penetrator rounds which are 20 rds of 62 grain)......

50 Remington
50 Ultramax soft-tip
60 PMC Bronze
40 Winchester
20 'loose' Federal Lake City ""Steel Penetrator"" ammo, so a total of 220 rounds.

Package deal also includes a new condition tactical soft-case w/ the magazine pouches; I have two soft cases (not pictured, but can see bottom of one of them in the ammo/mag pic), buyer can choose which they prefer. 

Also includes metal back-up sights (MBUS), front and rear which I mail-ordered and have not arrived yet, will give them to new buyer once they get here ($60).

If you added all these items up separately, ($779 rifle, $400 Eotech, $125 PLUS invested in ammo, $40 in extra mags, $165 in the quad-rail, light/laser, and Magpul VFG, then nearly $30 in the soft case, $60 MBUS, for conservative reference) and the time it took to get everything together, then you can see this is not a ""gouge"", but a fair and reasonable asking price which is unusual based on what is generally seen here online.

Asking $1395 or best offer in cash or 'potential' trade.  Thanks for checking out my listing.  Meeting in Tulsa face-to-face only, buyer MUST be a Oklahoma resident.  Ad will be removed immediately when sold."

 Introduction
The ST 9"" Side Loading Flare Launcher features the latest in design and manufacturing technology. Parts are CAD designed and CNC machined from solid billet material rather than the typical stamped and welded construction of other launchers. The 6061 and 7075 Aircraft grade aluminum components are anodized in Type III Hardcoat black for maximum durability and ease of maintenance.

Additional components are built from 1018 cold rolled steel and plated with a Mil-spec black oxide finish. The proprietary STZ push button cylindrical breech lock design is 3 times stronger than existing lever lock systems. The Havoc is designed to mount on any Mil-Spec rail system. Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the handguard and tightening two set screws which are included.

NOTE: Havoc shown with Adapters, sold separately.
