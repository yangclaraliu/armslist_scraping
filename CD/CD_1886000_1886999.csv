Just as the title says. I've got a brand new still in the manufactures packaging GL- SHOCK absorbing butt stock from The Mako Group. Will fit mill spec or commercial buffer tube. 

The Mako GL-Shock AR15 Buttstock effectively reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise for better control when firing. The GL-Shock is also the perfect solution for AR15s and AR10s chambered in harder recoiling calibers, such as the 6.8 SPC, .308 Winchester, .450 Bushmaster or .50 Beowulf.

The GL-Shock's unique patented design allows it to be mounted on any standard M4-style tube. The GL-Shock auto-adjusts to fit both commercial and MIL-SPEC buffer tubes with a tight, rattle-free fit. Unlike other recoil management systems for AR15 carbines, the GL-Shock does not use expensive non-standard buffers or buffer springs which often affect the function of the weapon. With the GL-Shock, all factory buffer parts are retained, since recoil-reduction takes place in the stock itself.

Reinforced polymer composite material
Gasket-sealed, waterproof battery storage compartment that slides down with the push of a button
Tire tread-inspired, integrated rubber buttpad grips body armor or tactical vests
Slots for three sling attachment locations, as well as quick-detach sling swivel mounts on both the left and right sides of the stock
Available with or without a fully-adjustable cheek riser that provides the proper eye height for carry handle-mounted optics on M4/AR15 carbines; cheek riser can be removed quickly if needed"

88,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1886088,"For Sale:  Mossberg Model 500 10 Millionth Commemorative, Serial Number U500005","Binghamton, Binghamton, New York","$ 1,050","Listed On: Tuesday, July 16, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Shooting Industry Masters Auction Benefiting First Shots More than 350 industry representatives, ranging from top administrators and factory personnel to professional shooters, will compete in the 2013 Shooting Industry Masters shooting competition July 19-20 at the Cody Shooting Complex near Cody, Wyoming. A major component of the shoot will be fundraising events to benefit the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) First Shots program, which introduces thousands of new shooters to the shooting sports each year. You can bid on this highly collectible Mossberg shotgun — and help support this important program — only at Gunbroker.com! History Since the first model came off the line on August, 21, 1961, the Mossberg 500 Pump-Action shotgun has received accolades from sportsmen and women, law enforcement and military personnel alike for its reliability, versatility and affordability; and notably for its distinctive ambidextrous top-mounted safety. Now this true American classic has reached an astonishing milestone of 10,000,000 produced; and in an unprecedented 52 years making the 500 Pump-Action the fastest-selling shotgun in history! Lead design engineer, Carl Benson, and his team at O.F. Mossberg & Sons, Inc. began work on a slide-action shotgun to replace the unique design of the 200 Series which had been in production since 1955. Though the Model 200 had set a new standard for innovation, Benson knew that Mossberg needed a more traditional-looking pump shotgun to compete with the “big three” at the time. The result was the 500 Shooting System, a 12-gauge pump-action base gun with interchangeable barrels. Features of those early Model 500 shotguns included the top-of-the-receiver safety; disconnecting trigger; damascened bolts; single slide-bar; solid steel-to-steel lock-up of the bolt to the barrel; and anodized aluminum receiver for lighter weight and better balance. This original design remained virtually unchanged for 30-plus years. Sixteen and 20-gauge versions were added to the 500 line-up in 1963 and the .410 bore became available in 1965. Over the years, numerous configurations designed for Law Enforcement, Military and Conservation groups were introduced as well as special purpose configurations. Youth models made their first appearance in 1983. In total, over 10 million Model 500 pump-action shotguns have been produced. To commemorate this historic benchmark, Mossberg donated the heavily-embellished 10 Millionth 500 with serial #U500000 to the NRA® National Firearms Museum in recognition of the National Rifle Association’s unwavering defense of the Second Amendment. Mossberg has also produced ten additional “10 Millionth” commemorative shotguns with the unique serialization of U500001 through U500010 for the fundraising efforts of deserving industry partners. Serial #U500004 was given to NRA-ILA® for their auction at the 2013 NRA Annual Meeting & Exhibits in Houston, Texas. Our featured “10 Millionth” Model 500 here is serial number U500005 and obviously is a bench-mark, showcasing Mossberg’s manufacturing and embellishment expertise. This is a one-time-only very special series and will never be available again. These milestone-commemorative Mossberg 500 shotguns feature a matte-silver finished receiver with gold inlay; traditionally-styled, high-gloss Fancy Walnut stock and forend with fine checkering on the pistol grip and wrapping around the underside of the forend; and classic red recoil pad with white Pachmayr line spacer. Distinctive jeweled bolt and elevator; gold trigger; 28-inch ported, vent rib barrel; and complementing high polished blue metal finish on exposed metalwork complete these classic pump-actions"

Maybe you wouldn't have so many people trying to haggle or trade junk/stolen items if you didn't try to sell stuff for over twice what it costs. The only people who are going to pay 225% for an in stock, ready to ship from the manufacturer item are felons who can't pass a background check and have it legally transferred to them by an FFL. Why do you think they won't be a pain to deal with?  Be glad they haven't just mugged you. 

The problems isn't the buyers, it's you and the rest of the price gouging SOBs trying to screw everyone and complaining that you can't.  Your lower isn't new anymore, you have owned it, whether you have shot it or not it is now used. That means it costs less than new, not more.

And by the way, save yourself the time, we also don't want to pay $25 for a $8 box of .22lr or $50 for a $20 box of 5.56 that you have done who knows what to and probably improperly stored.

I am also looking for an M1A standard, which I would pay $1400 for. I know what these weapons are worth, even during todays political climate. These go for 1700, and 1000 ish new, respectively.

If you are looking to aquire a nice ar15, and you have one of these fine specimens, I have a surplus of AR's and am looking to diversify. Up for trade is what started out as a rock river, and now is as close to an M16A4 as you can get, with the exception of the timney trigger. It also has the KAC M5 RAS, and a TRIJICON ACOG. 

For the Ptr, I would either ask for $500 on top with the acog, or at least 400 rounds of .308 for cheapy wolf/tula etc. I would move on numbers if you had some good ""match"" ammo.
For the M1A, I would trade straight up with ACOG. 

As stated, I would also just buy either, or if you are more blessed than I, I would buy both."

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

This is an incredibly accurate, full power 44 Mag., lead free load. The long-for-weight all copper bullet uses up the limited powder capacity of the case and keeps us from driving the bullet any faster than we are currently doing.

This 44 mag. load will work great and give adequate penetration for hunting big game species up to about 350 lbs. Since the bullet weight is relatively light, this load only generates moderate recoil.

At Buffalo Bore we always use real over-the-counter firearms to develop our published velocities. We believe the long time industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to achieve exaggerated published velocities is unfair to the customer as he/she will never be able to duplicate such laboratory type velocities in the real world, where it matters.

The compensator consists of two longitudinal openings in the barrel and slide of the pistol arranged in ""V-position"". This minimizes front sight blackening through powder gases.The GLOCK 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in security services. In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. For instance, many of the elite pilots of the USAF trust the GLOCK 19 for their efficient defense in emergency situations. The good thing about a compensated glock is you can always make it a standard glock by just changing the barrel.
GLOCK Tactical Lights present a solution for practically all conceivable target illumination situations. In close cooperation with top-ranking Special Operations groups, GLOCK developed a set of tactical light units based on modern microelectronics. This modern technology delivers the well-known GLOCK advantages to the user: safety, reliability and tactical superiority.

I load my own ammunition so I will look at anything that will shoot .308 projectiles or .224 projectiles.  I have several Pistols and Rifles to choose from in trade for what I'm looking for.

Here is a list of what I am willing to trade with:
#1  A Mossberg 144LSB .22lr Heavy Barrel Target Riffle with factory Peep-Sights and (5) 7 & 8 round magazines.  I was able to hit the gong at the city range 7 out of 8 times with one magazine and the cheap Remington Green Box ammo at 220 yards.  It's a real tack driver.  

#2  A Ruger 10/22 full custom...  Carbon Fiber Bull Barrel, Custom Laminate thumb-hole stock (for right hand) BSA 8X32X40 Scope with Adjustable Objective, Tall Turrets (for easy Windage and Elevation with 1/8"" @ 100 yards per click adjustment) and BDR Reticle.  The rifle has had slide work and trigger work done.  Comes with (1) 10-round magazine and will eat just about any ammo you feed it.

#3  Is a like new Marlin Camp 9 Carbine Rifle.  Rarely fired and in near perfect condition.  I do not have the original box but I have the original owner's manual.  I have the original 10 round magazine plus an additional 15-round and (2) 25-round magazines for a total of 4 magazines that hold a total of 75 rounds.  

#4  Is an un-issued 1955 British Lee-Enfield No.4 Mk2  (Irish Contract) .303 in pristine condition.  Comes with 2 Bayonets, scabbards and a frog for the belt.  This is a unique rifle that I will talk in length about in person but will not spend a lot of time here.  Do your research and you will see this is a special rifle and in top collector grade condition. 

#5  Is a Like New in the Box Gen-4 Glock 19 with 3 magazines and Trijicon Night Sights.

#6  Is a Like New in the Box Ruger Mark 1, built in 1980/81, with the original book and a second factory magazine.  It is the 6&7/8"" target version with adjustable sights and in wonderful condition.

#7  Is a H&K .45acp is very good condition with 2 magazines and a custom leather holster.  The HK45 is the weapon of choice of out Navy SEALS.  

#8  Is a High Standard Model ""GB"" and built in 1948.  The condition is exceptional and it functions perfectly.

Because of the nature of the Internet and some of the people who lurk there, I will not be posting my contact information.  If you wish to discuss any of these weapons please send me your name and contact information and I'll get back to you just as quickly as I can.

Kimber Pro TLE II 45 ACP

Includes a box of 45 acp Remington Golden Sabre 230 gr.

The Pro TLE II™ .45 ACP is a shorter version of the
duty pistol carried by LAPD® SWAT, the 4-inch bull
barrel making it easier to carry and conceal. Custom
Shop features like Meprolight™ night sights and 30
lines-per-inch checkering on the front strap make
it ideal for duty carry and personal protection. Both
frame and slide are machined from solid steel, and
like all Kimber pistols it features a match grade
barrel, chamber and trigger. The single action
trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep
and overtravel common to other designs, and
the 1911 safety system has never been equaled.
The full-length grip aids in controlling recoil, and
also accepts standard magazines. The Pro TLE II
is a perfect compromise of size and weight. It
 ts almost any size hand and points naturally for
faster and more accurate shooting. Dependability
is everything in a pistol, and no pistol is more
dependable than a Kimber 1911.

First is a 1942 Izhevsk 91/30 ex sniper. This is the hardest to find of the ex snipers or sniper rifles. Was a side mount PEM set up. Arsenal refinished, was put back into a war time stock, numbers matching, no line outs, bolt changed and matches. Bore frosted but not counterbored and shoots excellent. Still a tack driver. Comes with sling and bayonet, cleaning kit. Has scope numbers on side of barrel and has plugged holes where the PEM side mount was on reciever. This is the rarer PEM, not the more common PU set up. The majority of sniper rifles used by the greats you read about were PEM. Battle of Stalingrad the majority were PEMs which stalingrad started 42.

Second is a CZ 24 pistol in 380. Made in 1937 and has the czech military acceptance proof of J with lion and 37. Has original grips, it is numbers matching complete, even magazine matches. Bore shines and is excellent. Was a pre war high polish finish pistol that still looks nice. After germany invaded czechoslovakia they issued these captured pistols to the SS and wermacht. 

Both of these firearms are a nice piece of WWII history and collectible.

There are so many different types of these guns it's hard to put a price on them. Some are copies from China, and others are no firing display models. Some are very rare and worth a few thousand but they are in museums.  Most people know what they have, so tell me what you want for it and we can work out a deal.  Oh Airsoft (a bb gun) also makes a metal copy of the C96, I'm not interested in the airsoft BB gun model.

  -  7.63x25 (A 30 Cal round, smallest of the 3 types)

I'm mostly interested in a 10 or 20 round magazine for this gun.  Send me a photo and a price and I'll be happy to consider your asking price. They are hard to find so I'm sure you can get a nice price for one. (It's all in the condition, they are going on almost 100 years old)"

Just like the AMD-65 $400-450.  Depending on manufacture and dates, these were best you could do rifles for those who couldn't afford quality, or didn't buy quality before importation got cut off.  Surplus is defined as those rifles sold by the pallet.....average.  You might get a decent shooter, or you might get a lemon.  For the price, it seemed to be a decent gamble.  Now...they are apparently ""rare"" and ""hard to find"".  Quite frankly.....just about everything is hard to find these days.  Damned if stuff aint coming out of closets once forgotten at a price that might feed your family for three months or make two house payments.  You youngsters need to be up on your game.  Take this from an old guy that's been in the firearms market for the past 25 years and in the military to boot.  You can buy a quality AK47 made in USA for less than that surplus rifle now.  You think ammo costs too much now?  In reality it's still pretty cheap considering the supply and demand and world market.  If you're willing to pay double what a rifle is actually worth....you're feeding the machine and those who are wanting to take advantage of you and your family, just like those who gouged on gasoline prices after 9-11.  Never forget folks.  Bottom feeders, bottom rifles....bottom line.  You make your own decisions at this point.  Just do your research first.  It's too bad some of you willing to buy now didn't have the chance to buy quality when it was available at face value.  I understand most of you were still in school.  Well..........learning is good.......school's out.  Best of luck selling and buying.  Remember one thing in your dealings......buyer or seller........no remorse.  be that as it may.  Zastava my ass.  Put two and two together.....Zastava and Egyptian?  Russian blueprints to boot.  Do the math kids."
