I also have over 200 rounds of ammo.  One box of 50 is .38 special, which was a little cheaper when I bought it so I could practice, but I never fired the gun.  I just loaded it and laid it beside my bed, and there it sat for about two years.  The dust has been wiped off.

I need the cash now, so I am selling it.  Gun, handmade leather holsters and ammo pouches, ammunition for one price.  What is that price?  Make me a reasonable offer.  Insults will be discarded, unanswered.  Serious offers will be answered.

This is new/ unfired in the original box.

Gentlemen, this is the perfect sized pocket pistol and I've tried many looking for one that is just right. Ladies, want a pistol that you can tuck into a pocket in your purse? Can even be carried when wearing jeans or a light jacket.

The extras:
The Keltec comes with an extra (new in plastic) magazine. They are about $29 when you can find them.
It comes comes with an Uncle Mike's pocket holster. These little neoprene sleeves help keep the pistol from moving and help keep pocket lint or debris out of the workings of the gun. They run about $14.
Can't find ammo? Relax. This comes with 2 new boxes of .380 ammo. Plenty for practice and for going loaded when you feel you need to protect yourself or your family.

To privately purchase this handgun you need to be legally eligible to own a firearm in Tennessee."

The firearm is manufactured at the Zastava factory and imported by PW Arms of Redmond, Virginia.  It has the Yugoslavian crest on top of the slide.  

I have fired the weapon many times and found it to be a reliable, fire breathing, bullet launching, ammo chewing machine.  The recoil and firepower is somewhere between a .22LR and a Howitzer… But it’s closer to the Howitzer.  

I have cleaned the firearm after every range trip.  As the picture shows, I fire name brand factory loads through it.  The bore is clean and the grooves deep and prominent.  

The firearm comes with 3 magazines, the issued holster, the issued cleaning rod, and 2,350-rounds (forty-four 50-packs and three 60-packs).  The images should nicely represent what comes with the pistol.  If you could take a moment to appreciate the picture with the shiny bore I’d appreciate it – it turns out it’s hard to take a picture of a bore with a cell phone camera.  

This is the Mail Carrier of pistols – it’ll work in the rain, sleet, and snow.  If you are looking for a sidearm with stopping power and durability consider this as a suitable choice.  It’s solid enough that if you manage to miss your target with all 2,380-rounds you can still flip it over and beat them with the thing.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. Features: Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines Reliable functioning due to mechanical simplicity and high-quality non-binding coil springs—no lubricants required Long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance Easily seated in weapon with bolt forward May be kept fully loaded for extended periods without spring fatigue Only 1.66"" thick, less than two 30-round magazines clipped together 60-round magazine is approximately same length as two 30-round magazines clipped together 60-round magazine fits in most dual-mag pouches"

520,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1362520,For Sale/Trade:  Yugoslavian M57 Tokarev Pistol w/ Lots of Ammo,"Northfield (55057) - South of Twin Cities, Bloomington, Minnesota","$ 1,150","Listed On: Friday, March 29, 2013",Handguns,no type,7.62x25 Tokarev                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a Yugoslavian M-57 / M57 Tokarev in 7.62x25mm.  The firearm is manufactured at the Zastava factory and imported by PW Arms of Redmond, Virginia.  It has the Yugoslavian crest on top of the slide.  

I have fired the weapon many times and found it to be a reliable, fire breathing, bullet launching, ammo chewing machine.  The recoil and firepower is somewhere between a .22LR and a Howitzer… But it’s closer to the Howitzer.  

I have cleaned the firearm after every range trip.  As the picture shows, I fire name brand factory loads through it.  The bore is clean and the grooves deep and prominent.  

The firearm comes with 3 magazines, the issued holster, the issued cleaning rod, and 2,380-rounds (forty-four 50-packs and three 60-packs).  The images should nicely represent what comes with the pistol.  If you could take a moment to appreciate the picture with the shiny bore I’d appreciate it – it turns out it’s hard to take a picture of a bore with a cell phone camera.  

This is the Mail Carrier of pistols – it’ll work in the rain, sleet, and snow.  If you are looking for a sidearm with stopping power and durability consider this as a suitable choice.  It’s solid enough that if you manage to miss your target with all 2,380-rounds you can still flip it over and beat them with the thing.  

See the picture, think happy thoughts, don’t tell your wife, and contact me with an offer.

Not ""brand new with only 100 rounds through it"" but totally new. I've never even loaded it! This is a quality Bushmaster, and not a cheaper DPMS product, or a plastic Carbon 15.

Comes with the box, empty chamber indicator flag, lock and key, sling, metal 30 round magazine, rail risers in case you want to use a big scope, warranty, owner's manual, and whatever extra paperwork/coupons/etc might be included normally. It is factory built with the receiver-length picatinny rail, 6-position adjustable stock, A2 flash suppressor/compensator, bayonet lug, and sling swivels attached. And unlike most modern AR's, it is stamped on the mag well so you know it accepts BOTH .223 AND 5.56 ammunition, whatever you can find to use - no guessing that the NATO rounds MIGHT go boom without your gun going BOOM!

Also included is a brand new (in the unopened box) BSA red-dot scope sight and 100 rounds of ammo (80 rounds of WPA .223 and 20 rounds of PMC X-tac 5.56) so you can get it sighted in on the range and have some fun banging away without having to wait a couple months to find some ammo, or pay $1 a round.

I found another gun I want even more, so I'm looking to sell this quick.  The base model MSRP on this is $1,391.48, and with this deal you avoid taxes, fees, and snoopy government agents.  I saw these at the last gun show going for around $1600 without any extras, so I'm listing it at $1500 OBO (with ammo and red dot).  Face-to-face cash sale, prefer you have a CCW but not required.

I also have a brand new rail mountable laser/light combo with pressure switches I can throw in for an extra $40. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask."

One w/ red&green dot scope and front grip, the other with nice optic scope.

Both have 25rnd mags, adjustable stocks, carry handles, picatinny rails and handle similar to an AR15. 

Ammo for these rifles is still cheap. I know a .22lr isn't considered all that manly ... but ... thats coming from people who shoot .223's? The entry wound is almost the same size and a .22lr usually takes a more ""creative"" path through the body, causing more damage on average (but is also unpredictable).

Very fine rifles. Both of them.
Will sell or trade."
686,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1362686,For Sale/Trade:  Phoenix Arms HP22 w/ holster and 22lr ammo,"Brookfield, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 1,"Listed On: Friday, March 29, 2013",Handguns,Phoenix Arms                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I'm selling my Phoenix Arms HP22 pistol.  It comes with one 10-round magazine and a leather IWB clip-on holster.  It also includes over 350 rounds of 22 long rifle ammunition (40 rounds CCI Blazer, approximately 20 rounds of Remington lead round-point, and the rest Federal 36 grain copper-plated hollow point).

I am the original owner, but I don't have the owner's manual or anything anymore.  The gun is in good shape, with some minor holster wear and a little bit of build-up (oxidation perhaps?) on the back strap and bottom of the magazine.  It can be scrubbed off, I just scraped a little off with my thumbnail, but it is a cosmetic flaw.  I have fired under 500 rounds through this pistol with no problem, except the last time I went to the range I had a couple failures to feed.  This may just mean the magazine's ready for a good cleaning or needs a new spring, but I have another 22 pistol and my wife's starting to complain about too many guns.  This is a good, solid metal gun that has been reliable for over a decade, while small enough to slip into a pocket or keep in small, inconspicuous pop-out tray in your truck or van.  It's also a single-stack gun, which mean's the grip is narrow enough for people with small hands to get their fingers around, and is ideal for training new shooters with.

I'm not looking to make a huge profit off this gun, but I am looking to get a fair value, especially with the ammo that's getting more expensive and almost impossible to find these days.  Shoot me an offer, whether cash or trade, and we'll talk.  I'm willing to add cash and more ammo for the right deal.  First one with cash (or trade) that meets me gets this – I'm not going to hold it for your paycheck in a month.  Face to face transaction preferred, although I'm willing to ship to an FFL at your expense.  CCW preferred, though not required.  

***NOTE:  Due to the overwhelming response in the first 24 hours, I will not accept any offers less than $200 now.  Write me all the hate mail you want, but I've had too many offers for just the ammo to think this package is worth less than this.  And no, I will not split it up."

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

I have recently gotten really interested in Sig 1911's. I wanted to see how many people out there have a new/lightly used or in good condition Sig Saur 1911 that they would be willing to trade for a Remington R1 1911. I am mostly interested in the Elite model or the Scorpion but will hear all offers of course so don't be shy!

The Remington 1911 is in good condition. It is perfect for those of you who love the Classic GI look of a 1911! The Remington is extremely close! It has never been fired and kept in my safe, and has also never been carried. The only cosmetic flaw with it is that it has a slight nick on the slide which is pictured below. It is only really noticeable when a light is held over top of it and could be made much less noticeable with a touch up pen. Everything else about it is good condition. I am the one and only owner of this handgun. 

It comes with everything pictured (excluding the ammo). 

-2  7 round magazines
-Original manuals and papers
-Black Fobus paddle holster (not pictured)
-Gun lock and original case
-1911 Wrench

Also, I am aware that this handgun values at less than that of a new Sig 1911 which is why I can do the Remington 1911, a plastic paddle holster, and of course cash to sweeten the deal. Please no low balls. I am looking for a fair trade on both parties. I'm only really interested in Sig 1911's. Might consider a trade for a Ruger 1911. I'm not in a hurry either. I am patiently waiting for the right deal to come along. 

The trade will occur face to face and in a public place. You are more than welcome to inspect the weapon. I also request that you have an Ohio ID or driver's license (ccw preferred but not required). I also request a bill of sale to be signed for my records. I will also not do any business with anyone under the age of 21, anyone who is not an Ohio resident, and absolutely no one who has been convicted of a felony.

Super Fast Shipping!  Each magazine rebuild kit comes with 1 Troy Battlemage housing, 1 anti-tilt follower, 1 pull-tab floor plate, and 1 flat bottomed floor plate.  All items ship via USPS priority mail.  

Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes. The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines. The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

These magazines have been involved in a lengthy research and development phase, in which time they have come under severe punishment and testing. They have survived not only loading and feeding evaluations, but also destructive product testing, such as being shot with shotguns, high powered rifles, crushed by vehicles, frozen and baked in extreme temperature ranges. All magazines then functioned flawlessly after the for-mentioned torture tests, and the visual results can been seen on the Troy® YouTube video channel.

Stephen Troy, Troy® Industries President and CEO, declared that the magazines will offer the end-user the most durable and comprehensive magazine on the market today.
""We are extremely excited to be releasing these Battlemags™ to the world market”, stated Mr. Troy. “As with all Troy® products, we will not and do not release any product until it meets all of our stringent requirements. After a thorough schedule of internal and external contract testing, we are certain that these magazines will meet and exceed every shooters requirements”.
 The CBIR™ Battlemag™ is currently offered in a 30 round 5.56mm/.223 version. Every magazine includes a flush and tabbed shock absorbing bottom floor plate. Battlemags™work flawlessly with all M4, M16, AR15, HK416®, and FN SCAR® rifles and carbines. With patent pending features such as proprietary engineered resin, reinforced feed lips, anti-tilt follower, and an aggressive fish scale gripping pattern, these magazines will undoubtedly become the choice of the most discriminating shooters.


Magazines are ALL disassembled and intended ONLY as rebuild kits!  Reassembly of these magazines could constitute a crime depending on your state and local laws.  I assume no responsibility for any misuse of these rebuild kits."
