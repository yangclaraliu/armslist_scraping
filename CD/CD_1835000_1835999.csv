I bought this Saiga new ($1200) earlier this year and had it professionally converted ($350) with a Tapco conversion kit ($120) and ergonomic ATI Strikeforce pistol grip ($30).  The tang was cut and an internal receiver block adapter ($50) was installed so that the buttstock could be installed with a Tromix all-aluminum skeleton stock with the Limbsaver recoil pad ($225).  This stock is rock solid and the Limbsaver does an amazing job of soaking up recoil!  Fully 922r compliant.  This is the short barrel version (19"") and has the threaded barrel to easily accept a muzzle brake.  After it was converted it was test fired with 10 rds of low power birdshot thru it to make sure it would cycle low brass shells and it functioned flawlessly.  This is a 4 port gun and will eat up anything you put into it, from Walmart bulk ammo to high power slugs and 00 buck. After test firing it was cleaned and has sat in my climate controlled safe ever since.  The gun comes with the factory 5 rd mag and a brand new current production 3rd Gen AGP 10 rd mag (best Saiga 12 mag on the market).  I am now looking to fund another project so it's time to let her go.  I have invested over $2k in this weapon so my loss is your gain.  I also have a new UTG Quad Rail and additional AGP mags available to the buyer if interested."

Troy Battlemags are chemical, biological, and impact resistant polymer Battlemags. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes.

The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines.

The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416 and FN Scar rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate.

325,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1835325,For Sale:  Benelli M1 Super 90 Tactical,"Colorado, Colorado, United States",$ 900,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 2, 2013",Shotguns,no type,no type,no type,Shotgun,"The Benelli M1 semi-automatic shotgun based on the proprietary Benelli system, which utilizes the gun recoil and inertia of the moving parts to operate the action. This system was developed by Benelli by the mid-1980s, and is simple and reliable in operation. System utilizes the rotating bolt head with two locking lugs that lock into the barrel extension. The bolt is mounted inside the massive bolt body (bolt carrier), and fixed to it by the locking pin, which allows the bolt head to move slightly forward and back and rotate simultaneously within the bolt body. The massive inertia spring is interposed between the boldbody and head, and separate recoil spring is located in the buttstock, pressing the bolt body forward via the link at its rear. When bolt is in the battery, the locking lugs of the bolt head are engaged with the barrel and locked it. Inertiaspring, pressing on the both bolt body and head, holds the head in the forward position relative to the body. When gun is fired, it recoils and moves backslightly against shoulder of the shooter. Due to the inertia of the bolt body,it resists the initial recoil movement, so the bolt head, locked rigidly with the barrel and the rest of the gun, moves back relative to the bolt body,compressing the inertia spring and rotating itself to unlock due to the headlocking pin being encaged in the cam slot in the bolt body. As soon as the rotation of the head is enough to unlock the bolt head from the barrel, the residual pressure of the barrel pushes the bolt head back, and this, in turn,pushes the bolt body against the recoil spring, overcoming the bolt body inertial and commencing the reloading cycle (ejection of the spent case and feeding and chambering of the fresh round). As soon as the bolt group returns into the battery, the pressure of the compressed inertia spring pushes the bolt body slightly back against the bolt head, causing the bolt head to rotate and lock into the barrel. Now, gun is ready for the next shot. This sounds quite complicated, but the whole system is mechanically very simple and has few moving parts, resulting in high reliability and easy production and maintenance.No Trade"

It just got here, and I dont want or need it. The bullet feeder comes setup in 223 ready to go, and has the caliber change kit for 308. Currently MR. Bulletfeeder is not making rifle calibers from what i was told. They are only doing pistol calibers and you are still at a 5-6 month wait for those only. Get this unit from me and have two of the hardest calibers to find in a MR. Bulletfeeder within days! Will ship this to wherever, will go UPS and you will be required to purchase insurance and sign for it. Otherwise, FTF in metro atlanta near the airport will have to work for local pickup.

Again, this unit has never been used. It has never been plugged in, taken out of the packaging(aside from pictures) and never hooked up to a machine. Its as it came from the factory. It was purchased to be used on a dillon super 1050, but can be used on other presses."

This system was developed by Benelli by the mid-1980s, and is simple and reliable in operation. System utilizes the rotating bolt head with two locking lugs that lock into the barrel extension. The bolt is mounted inside the massive bolt body (bolt carrier), and fixed to it by the locking pin, which allows the bolt head to move slightly forward and back and rotate simultaneously within the bolt body. The massive inertia spring is interposed between the boldbody and head, and separate recoil spring is located in the buttstock, pressing the bolt body forward via the link at its rear. When bolt is in the battery, the locking lugs of the bolt head are engaged with the barrel and locked it. Inertiaspring, pressing on the both bolt body and head, holds the head in the forward position relative to the body. When gun is fired, it recoils and moves backslightly against shoulder of the shooter. Due to the inertia of the bolt body,it resists the initial recoil movement, so the bolt head, locked rigidly with the barrel and the rest of the gun, moves back relative to the bolt body,compressing the inertia spring and rotating itself to unlock due to the headlocking pin being encaged in the cam slot in the bolt body. As soon as the rotation of the head is enough to unlock the bolt head from the barrel, the residual pressure of the barrel pushes the bolt head back, and this, in turn,pushes the bolt body against the recoil spring, overcoming the bolt body inertial and commencing the reloading cycle (ejection of the spent case and feeding and chambering of the fresh round). As soon as the bolt group returns into the battery, the pressure of the compressed inertia spring pushes the bolt body slightly back against the bolt head, causing the bolt head to rotate and lock into the barrel. Now, gun is ready for the next shot. This sounds quite complicated, but the whole system is mechanically very simple and has few moving parts, resulting in high reliability and easy production and maintenance.No Trade"

 This weapon system has many features such as a straight pull R93 bolt. I did change the factory thin cone shaped plastic bolt knob to an AI style larger round knob. It feels better in the hand and is much more easy to function when behind the rifle. 

It is fed by a TEN round magazine (TWO included). This platform allows for a quick change of barrels with just two allen bolts and can be done in just a minuite or two and do a barrel/caliber swap. Attached to the barrel on this rifle is the optional rare 20moa optics rail. 

The weapon is fully adjustable using the same allen wrench (included) for length of pull, cast on, cast off, height of comb, etc. The trigger shoe length of pull and weight is also adjustable. 

The aluminum chassis stock with very little plastic has many adjustments. The bottom of the forend is a full 1913 rail system.  Flush cups have been added to the left side of the stock. The barrel is 23.5"" long fluted and threaded 5/8x24 for a brake or supressor.This is NOT assembled from misc parts this is a factory built rifle by BLASER.

It screams but can also play some very sweet low Floyd style melodies. Very versatile plus it is easy to shred with amazing high gain sound. I always took care of this axe and never abused it. It is in excellent condition except for a paint chip on the horn. I guarantee you will love this guitar and no one else has one. The case alone, which is factory, goes for quite a bit when you can find them. It is just a giant awesome guitar case. Comes with all the tuning tools and still smells new. This comes from a single owner, non-smoking home and always in optimal climate/humidity. Never taken to a gig. Not something you want to pass up at this price.

These are the latest generation and feature the ability to center the reticle in field of view, which if you have ever tried to set up one of the old ones you know is a big step forward. Product in NIB with all the paperwork. Here are some of the Highlights and Updates over previous generations of magnifiers: 

The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.
 This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.

Specs:
Magnification Fixed: 3.25X 
 Eye Relief: 2.2 in 
 Field of View: 7.3 degrees 
 Length: 3.9 in 
 Temperature: -40 degrees to 160 degrees F 
 Waterproof: 33ft 
 Sealing: Fog proof Internal Optics 
 Mount: 34mm ring with integrated dovetail adapter for use with quick release mount

Im open to trades or to tell my S&W .38 SW double action 2nd model revolver. Its in over good condition with the majority of the nickel finish in good shape with minimal pitting. The finish condition is better then the vast majority of these revolvers I come across. There is only one issue and that is the trigger guard is missing. I've been trying to track down an original but haven't had any luck yet. I have someone who can make an exact duplicate but I've yet to to do.

Besides the trigger guard its in over all very good shape considering its nearly 132 years old. It fires 38 SW (NOT 38 special) and while to my knowledge no one sells this ammo still I can include some rounds for it.

Its definitely a very cool old revolver but I'm open to either cash, or trades."

It is in absolute MINT (100%) condition. These are VERY rare to come across on the used market. I fired it 16 times just to see how it shoots and put it in my safe. It is a very accurate pistol, especially given its compactness and has an incredibly smooth double action trigger pull. I'm just trying to thin out a few of my 9mm's. This is one of the coolest compact 9's to come along. It was the preferred pistol of many detectives a few years ago, many still use it! It doesnt have one blemish on it anywhere.  I am asking 650 on this pistol... it is well worth it. The 3913 makes an excellent choice for anyone with a carry permit. It comes with an extra magazine, the box (which is in excellent shape as well) & all the paperwork..as new! The pistol has a beautiful satin stainless finish and two 8 round magazines, one with the little finger extention on it, also features ambidextrous safety and windage adjustable Novak sights. Thanks for looking and just contact me if you have any questions."

Im open to trades or to tell my S&W .38 SW double action 2nd model revolver. Its in over good condition with the majority of the nickel finish in good shape with minimal pitting. The finish condition is better then the vast majority of these revolvers I come across. There is only one issue and that is the trigger guard is missing. I've been trying to track down an original but haven't had any luck yet. I have someone who can make an exact duplicate but I've yet to to do.

Besides the trigger guard its in over all very good shape considering its nearly 132 years old. It fires 38 SW (NOT 38 special) and while to my knowledge no one sells this ammo still I can include some rounds for it."

I can usually have your holster finished and at your side in under 2 weeks. I have different color kydex and can special order any color or design you want.

Recently got laid off so I'm selling a couple of my guns to make ends meet.  Included with this is all the ammo, primers and black powder pellets I have which is like a little over 30 each. First $100 takes it."

If you didn't already know, then these stocks very closely simulate automatic fire using the free slide of the buffer tube through the stock, the recoil of the gun, and a forward pressure provided by the shooter to achieve this, really fun. Bought it around November of last year, shot around 200 rounds with it, then couldn't find any more cheap ammo after December. So I've decided to sell it, ammo is too expensive for me to shoot that fast. They currently sell for around $380 new, looking to get around $275 for mine.

I picked this up when I was looking for another revolver, and then a day later I found the revolver I was looking for, so this excellent S&W is on the trading block.

It is the CM-15 ""Center Mass"" laser shotgun pattern with a 9 dot ring and center dot.  It fits Picatinny rails 3"" or longer.

I purchased this laser and received it in late May of 2013.  It has been used on a 20 guage shotgun with 30 rounds placed thru the shotgun with the laser attached.  It was intended to be used for my daughter on the weapon but since then we have gone in another direction and the shotgun has been sold.  I do have 2 of these lasers but only 1 for sale. The one shown in the pictures is my first CM 15 but is not for sale.

The pictures attached are of the same type of laser on my current 12 gauge shotgun ""FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES ONLY, THIS 12 GAUGE IS NOT FOR SALE"" 
The CM15 laser for sale is not the one on the 12 gauge but the newer laser which was one the 20 gauge for 2 weeks then removed and shown off of the gun in the photos separately. 

This laser is not damaged and was used on the weapon as stated above.  It is in brand new condition and has the directions and allen keys included for adjustment.  It works perfectly and is in no way damaged. 

I am selling because I do not need 2 of these at this time and am selling the newest one purchased in May of this year.

If you have any question please feel free to contact the seller @ REDACTED. Thanks"

In the last year my business has grown from a Gunbroker only (100% positive feedback)  business, to running a full-fledged website.  We are a small company, who tries to keep prices low, and we have NEVER gouged.  With that said, almost 50% of our online customers come from TX, FL, and VA.  So I am now advertising on Armslist in these states!  This is the only form of advertising I do, along with a link from our gunbroker auctions, so the costs stay down since this is free!!!

After months of development with Daisy and Legacy Quest Outdoors, a special rendition on an American classic of the 1938 Red Ryder was created. This American-made Daisy model BB gun has a 17” stock and 11” forearm made of milled extinct American natural chestnut wood blanks. Legacy Quest Outdoors was honored to provide the American Chestnut wood for the 2013 NRA Special Edition Red Ryder BB guns. This historically rich material was procured from the Dominic Family Farm located in upstate New York. This circa 1930 large livestock barn was constructed with heavy Dutch influence architecture and is known as a bank barn. Bank barns were used by the Dutch to allow for heavy loaded wagons to be pulled into the loft for unloading and storage via a ramp that was built from the bank into the loft of the barn. This barn is an outstanding example of craftsmanship. It featured a hand pegged and hand hewn hemlock timber frame and was secondarily framed and sided in American Chestnut. The barn was dismantled and transported to North Carolina where Legacy Quest Outdoors crews meticulously hand selected and milled this high quality lumber for inclusion into this exciting project. Each board has been graded a total of 11 times to ensure that only the finest reclaimed American Chestnut was utilized. In keeping with Legacy Quest Outdoor’s passion to ’Pass it On’ the extinct chestnut stocks contain original nail holes and tight knots that provide originality to the item’s classic form. Each Daisy also includes recessed NRA gold seal medallion on the stock along with Red Ryder logo. Limited in production to 1,100, the Legacy Quest Outdoors Daisy BB Gun is truly collectible and available only at Friends of NRA."

I need to move on to other projects, but after much deliberation and wanting to sell different guns than these, I have decided that hopefully these will bring someone else as much pleasure as they have brought me. I have priced them to hopefully sell quickly. I take firearm care and cleaning very seriously and have taken excellent care of them all! Please give me a call if you are interested! (918) 629-Zero31Five

1. Smith & Wesson Model 19-3 4"" .357 Mag. In my opinion, the Model 19 has to be one of the best 'combat' revolvers Smith & Wesson makes (well, made). It definitely has a special place in my heart, and I always make sure I own at least one! Excellent Condition, locks up tighter than any revolver I currently own. The timing is perfect, it has been very well maintained, and I have fired less than 100 rounds through her (the majority of which were .38 special). Cleaned directly after each bout of target practice. Kept in a dehumidified safe for the entirety of her life. $500


2. Ruger New Model Vaquero 5.5"" .45 Colt. My first foray into single-action shooting. In just as good if not better condition than the Model 19. The case-hardened frame still has it's new luster, the finish on the entire firearm is also immaculate. Again, less than 100 rounds fired through her, and thoroughly cleaned after each shooting session. Timing and lock up are VERY smooth and tight. Trigger pull is very enjoyable, and is the most accurate revolver I currently own (or maybe is just very forgiving on my broad-side-of-a-barn shooting skills!) Kept in dehumidified safe. $500

3. EAA Over/Under 12 ga. A no-frills double-barrel shotgun. It was bought new and has had less than 50 shells through it. What drew me to it was the 18.5"" barrels, which causes it to handle like a carbine rifle and is extremely light. I originally bought it during my non-lethal phase I went through earlier this year! I thought that I would keep a non-lethal (i.e. rubber buckshot, bean bag, rock salt, etc.) shell in one chamber, and a very lethal shell in the other, whatever the situation would warrant! I even almost cerakoted the triggers blue and red to designate the two. I'm glad I didn't because that's not for everyone! I did install some fiber optic truglo sights on her that create a triangular sight picture that's pretty great to use. Anyways, it IS a quality over/under, finish is great, action is great, has hundreds of shells left in her. Can come with a couple of those specialty shells if you were so inclined! $200

All guns come with ammunition for target and self defense. Thanks for your time!"
