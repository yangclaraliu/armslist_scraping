84"" in length and 40"" in width.
Anywhere from 10 inches thick up to 3 Ft in thickness.
Great for Bow and arrow or cross bow shooting.
Has been shot with small handgun calibers. 9mm .380 .22 LR.
Does catch most bullets. 
One bed was cut into a square about 42"" x 42"" x 18"" and shot with 
45 ACP 12 Gauge .40 cal and bullets went straight through. 
However this was done inside of a gun range and distance was pretty close.
May hold up to bigger calibers if shot through a complete bun and at a farther distance.
I will sell two large buns for 100. I have several you can choose from with different thicknesses. Some are very soft similar to memory foam. Others are extremely hard.
Each bun weights roughly 200 - 250 lbs. Two on a pallet is about 500lbs.
We have shot several times with a Crossbow and it holds up great. 
Bolt will not enter completely. Very easy to cut if you have a hot wire or the correct tools to do so. Have tried to take a hand saw to cut samples off and it is very difficult.
It's hard to explain the texture and feeling on the material. If you are interested you can come by and take a look at the materials and feel them for your self. 
When shot it does not chip off and leave a mess. However I am sure after being abused and shot for a while it will begin to tear but to my opinion it will take quite a lot of abuse before that happening.

If interested we have them stored at a warehouse with a forklift for easy loading in a truck. 

Give me a call at REDACTED to set up a time to take a look. If i don't answer PLEASE leave a message and I will return the call as soon as possible. I get a lot of calls from customers due to work.

ATTENTION:
For those who buy 22LR AMMO and resale them for 200% or even 500% profit are not eligible to purchase from me!

I am selling 22 ammo who actually wants to go out, shoot and have fun. 
NOT worry about finding ammo and OVER priced stupidity.

If you are in a state that does not accept ammo dont email me.
There is a limit per customer. Make this fair for everyone.
Local free pick up is available. 
You can not order more than the limit. So saying you can not order x1 1400brick today and order another one the next day or the other day. When I say that limit that means thats all your getting for one person!. I am trying to make this as fair as possible.

Beat the ban!!! 

 If a federally imposed gun ban is put in place that prohibits the sale of an AR-15 from a manufacturer or a dealer to a customer, it will prevent any further transfers of AR-15’s.  The important thing to keep in mind with that scenario is that the lower receiver is the part of the AR-15 that will be banned.  The lower receiver on an AR-15 is the only part of the firearm that has a serial number. In the eyes of the BATFE, the lower is the gun. When you take position of the lower in advance of a ban, you have beat the ban.

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, folding front and rear sights for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

 $180.00 each 

5 available, consecutive serial numbers 

This forged lower receiver is quality made using 7075-T6 and is marked ""CAL MULTI"" to accommodate most AR builds including 5.56/.223, 6.5mm, 6.8mm, 300 Blackout, 9mm, .45 or other chambering’s that fit the standard AR-15 receiver.  Finish is Black Hard coat Anodize. This lower is made using the most advanced aerospace manufacturing technology to produce the industries finest, forged Mil-Spec lowers. This receiver is machined on a multimillion dollar, automated, manufacturing system. 

For those of you not familiar with FAMCO, they are a contract firearms manufacturer based in FL. You don't normally see their names on products because almost all of the firearms/components they make ship with their customer's logo and info engraved on them. They don't usually sell to the retail public. 

This FAMCO stripped semi-auto lower receiver is precision machined from a durable, 7075 T6 aluminum forging. Stamped “Cal: Multi,” this versatile mil-spec receiver can be the foundation for rifle builds on 5.56/.223, 6.5mm, 6.8mm, 300 Blackout, 9mm, .45 or other chambering’s that fit the standard AR-15 receiver. Holes, inletting and pin locations have been cut to final dimensions and accept standard AR-15 magazines and components. Clearly stamped safe/fire switch position indicators ensure that you can easily identify the service state of the rifle. 

 I will be happy to answer any questions or provide additional pictures. What you see in the photo is what you get

Beat the ban!!! 

 If a federally imposed gun ban is put in place that prohibits the sale of an AR-15 from a manufacturer or a dealer to a customer, it will prevent any further transfers of AR-15’s.  The important thing to keep in mind with that scenario is that the lower receiver is the part of the AR-15 that will be banned.  The lower receiver on an AR-15 is the only part of the firearm that has a serial number. In the eyes of the BATFE, the lower is the gun. When you take position of the lower in advance of a ban, you have beat the ban.

The slug in this round, just like any other foster slug, will cause an amazing wound cavity and catastrophic damage through as many layers iof denim and bone as any person would ever posess; the buckshot following the slug not only ensures everything around the target area is also severely damaged, but it also offers better coverage just in case of innacuracy or duress while aiming.  This was one of the first rounds besides buckshot to dissappear when the scare started, and for the most part is has been very hard to find.  

The birdshot offered is FEDERAL 8 shot, and besides being an outstanding field game and target load, it is arguably the BEST shell one would use to make wax slugs, which are some amazing, proven slugs for home defense, hunting , or just blowing things apart cheaply.  at this rate, after buying the crayons to melt down, you can have some premium wax slugs for about 40 cents per round!

Thompson Sub-machine Gun - DEMILITARIZED,"NW, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 649,"Listed On: Saturday, April 27, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"THIS IS NOT A FIREARM. IT WILL NOT FIRE AND CANNOT BE MADE TO FIRE. IT IS A NON-FUNCTIONAL PIECE OF HISTORY THAT IS NOT PROHIBITED BY ANY RULES.

 This is a magnificent display gun built from excellent WWII Thompson M-1928 parts and reassembled with a fantastic non-functioning new made anodized aluminum display receiver. Every part on this display gun is original WW2 manufactured other than the receiver. Original WW2 parts include:

• Detachable Walnut Butt Stock
• Complete Lower Frame Assembly
• Walnut Pistol Grip
• Barrel
• Sling and Buttstock Oiler
• Walnut Horizontal Foregrip
• 30 Round Magazine

 The Thompson 1928 sub machine gun is perhaps the most recognizable firearm of World War II, made famous by the Airborne Troops of the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions. This military model differs from the original commercial model in its horizontal foregrip. Though heavy by today's standards, the weight helped control the .45 caliber bursts when operated on full automatic.

 The Thompson submachine was invented by John T. Thompson in 1919 and became infamous during the Prohibition era. It was a common sight at the time, being used by both law enforcement officers and criminals. The Thompson was also known informally as: the ""Tommy Gun,"" the ""Chicago Typewriter"" and the ""Chopper."" The Thompson was favored by soldiers, criminals and police alike for its ergonomics, compactness, large .45 ACP cartridges, and high volume of automatic fire and among civilian collectors for its historical significance.

 Many new made replica and Airsoft Thompsons flood the market today, but this is an opportunity to own a true piece of history, a genuine WW2 Thompson in excellent condition and totally legal to own in the USA by federal law without any type of license.

This gun has shot 5 shells in its life.  3 from the right barrel and 2 from the left, just enough to sight in laser and scope.  This gun is high quality and quite the conversation piece.

Polish Russian PPS-43C semi-auto metal assault PISTOL 7.62x25 Tokarev 2-35rd MAGAZINE - LAST CHANCE, LAST ONE!!","Lexington SC, Columbia, South Carolina",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, July 7, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,"SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY!  ALL LAWS APPLY!!! LOCATED IN SOUTH CAROLINA and back up for local sale only due to dishonest non paying people.. Must be 21 years old or older!!
I.O. Inc. redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the triggerguard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position. This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland. All parts and components are new and Polish made. The PPS-43C pistol comes with 2 curved box magazines, each holds 35 rounds. Polish PPS-43C semi auto pistol ATF approved incl. 2 x 35rd. magazines and cleaning kit. Caliber: 7.62x25 mm TT,. Weight: 3.67 kg loaded, 3.04 kg empty,. Length: 615 Barrel length 250 mm,. Magazine Capacity 35 rounds.. Effective range:200 meters .
 Produced in Poland at the famed Radom plant, this new production PPS-43C is a semi-automatic derivative (FOLDING STOCK IS FIXED SPOT WELDED) of the Russian PPSH-41 full-auto, sub-machine gun developed during WWII for the Red Army in its fight against Hitler. The PPS-43C is chambered in the potent and battle-proven 7.62 x 25mm Tokarev due to its highly penetrative characteristics. When there isn't a nationwide buying panic going on, This ammunition is readily available in both new production and surplus offerings. Even though derived from a folding stock SMG, this closed-bolt model is ATF approved - the stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the 14” barrel length weapon is classified as a pistol, not a SBR. It comes furnished with two(2) 35rd magazines, oiler, cleaning rod .. The PPS-43C offers substantial firepower in a very compact and light weight platform. It is a natural candidate for a SBR conversion (subject to NFA compliance). Hi-cap pistols of this genre are becoming increasingly difficult to find among suppliers; availability may be very limited to non-existent in the future due to pending ban and Nato Treaty talks in March for Small Arms Treaty.

Scope by itself retails for $200, so you're basically getting the binoculars for free (which retail for $115). Willing to ship for $15.00 extra.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

I currently have 4 of these left.  They are BRAND NEW, but do not have any factory packaging (no box, papers, ect.).  They do have a bubble wrap sleeve that they come in.  A manual may be downloaded online.  Excellent unblemished condition.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

The PPS-43C is chambered in the potent and battle-proven 7.62 x 25mm Tokarev due to its highly penetrative characteristics. When there isn't a nationwide buying panic going on, This ammunition is readily available in both new production and surplus offerings. Even though derived from a folding stock SMG, this closed-bolt model is ATF approved - the stock is permanently fixed in the folded position, thus the 14” barrel length weapon is classified as a pistol, not a SBR. It comes furnished with one(1) 35rd magazines, oiler, cleaning rod .. The PPS-43C offers substantial firepower in a very compact and light weight platform. It is a natural candidate for a SBR conversion (subject to NFA compliance). Hi-cap pistols of this genre are becoming increasingly difficult to find among suppliers; availability may be very limited to non-existent in the future due to pending ban and Nato Treaty talks in March for Small Arms Treaty.

To further augment the Ambush 6.8, we have included modular rail sections and an adjustable indexable foregrip, enhancing your natural shooting position. Outfitted with a two stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger to decrease rifle movement, the Ambush 6.8 SPCII realizes its superior accuracy to take 'em down in one shot. (Geissele SSA® Trigger has a total pull weight of 4.5 lbs, 2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2 lbs on the second stage.) The Ambush 6.8 SPCII features a monolithic upper rail platform and a 12” modular free-float hand guard, which protects the barrel while giving plenty of real estate for hand placement or accessories.
