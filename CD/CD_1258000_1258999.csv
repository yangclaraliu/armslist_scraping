Which this is no semi-auto so you won't go thru them unless you just wanna blow threw them. Great thing about a single shot is you make the shot count and it is faster to reload than an empty semi-auto, lever, or bolt action .22 

Let me tell you something else, know how people are saying they get dud bullets from the bulk packs. Well I have found that this gun will fire those 100% of the time. Yes what most people think is a dud in a semi auto is not a dud just a malfunction of the gun. This gun will not malfunction like that and is built to last, so ask for the ""dud"" rounds of .22lr from your friends. Or use a metal detector to find them at the range...and then you have a good source of .22 ammo when it is expensive and hard to find now."

A brief history - Many of the major pistol makers, including Glock wanted a Mil/Gov contract) anticipating the pending military .45 pistol trials, the M1913 (or Picatinny Arsenal) rail system was considered to be the standard that would be required in the specs package. These trials never occured as the existing contract was renewed. There was a limited run on these that were released to the public. The gun also has Ambi mag release.

(By law I can not do it for you) but I have machines that make it a whole lot eaiser.($75.00)

I'm an ar-15 expert builder(price varies depending on job cheaper than any machine shop), have a part that doesn't fit? Really want a look or something to work on your rifle, I can probably help. I can also machine custom parts out of stainless, aluminum, titanium, plastic. U have an Idea we can make something work. I have lathes mill's and surface grinders.

I also specialize in ar-15 side charge modifications($175.00). On the LEFT SIDE, for RIGHT handed shooters. Let me explain. You can do all the charging prone with only your left hand. Your trigger hand NEVER HAS TO COME OFF THE RIFLE FOR ENGAGING TARGETS. During a malfunction or anything. It doubles as a left side forward assist. and nearly eliminates the need for the bolt catch paddle. The bolt is reciprocating so when the mag is empty the bolt is all the way locked back, pop in a fresh mag slap the pin and your ready to go. Ar-10 also works the same, some Dpms round sides(no brass deflector, no forward assist, and no dust covers) can have the pin on either side or both. This is a modification to your existing rifle and only requires the pin which I have a few designs or u can make your own design. Standard pin is titanium, and only adds a few seconds to disassembly. 

Gunsmithing also!, broke something? Need a part made for an old gun? I can help. ($ depends on job quotes available)

Can do pistols also, glock slide machining? Slide/barrel ports, engraving.

CNC engraving ($50 and up) logo's words. See preview before it is cut. I won't cut anything until it is approved by the customer.

Nearly all jobs can be done within 3 days. And usually I can get you your parts back the next day.

Thinking about finishing with a drill press? It's kinda tough, so y wouldn't u let me help you? We can setup a time and I'll help u finish it. (By law I can not do it for you) but I have machines that make it a whole lot eaiser.($75.00)

I'm an ar-15 expert builder(price varies depending on job cheaper than any machine shop), have a part that doesn't fit? Really want a look or something to work on your rifle, I can probably help. I can also machine custom parts out of stainless, aluminum, titanium, plastic. U have an Idea we can make something work. I have lathes mill's and surface grinders.

I also specialize in ar-15 side charge modifications($175.00). On the LEFT SIDE, for RIGHT handed shooters. Let me explain. You can do all the charging prone with only your left hand. Your trigger hand NEVER HAS TO COME OFF THE RIFLE FOR ENGAGING TARGETS. During a malfunction or anything. It doubles as a left side forward assist. and nearly eliminates the need for the bolt catch paddle. The bolt is reciprocating so when the mag is empty the bolt is all the way locked back, pop in a fresh mag slap the pin and your ready to go. Ar-10 also works the same, some Dpms round sides(no brass deflector, no forward assist, and no dust covers) can have the pin on either side or both. This is a modification to your existing rifle and only requires the pin which I have a few designs or u can make your own design. Standard pin is titanium, and only adds a few seconds to disassembly. 


Gunsmithing also!, broke something? Need a part made for an old gun? I can help. ($ depends on job quotes available)

Can do pistols also, glock slide machining? Slide/barrel ports, engraving.

CNC engraving ($50 and up) logo's words. See preview before it is cut. I won't cut anything until it is approved by the customer.

Nearly all jobs can be done within 3 days. And usually I can get you your parts back the next day.

Many businesses in the firearm industry are under attack by oppressive laws and regulations in their current states or municipalities. As a result, it is becoming increasingly more difficult for them to provide us the selection and quality of product at competitive prices that we have come to expect and enjoy.

These companies have been there for us.  Now it’s time for us to be there for them. Many other states across the country are courting these companies and providing incentives for them to relocate to a less restrictive environment.

 Please take a moment and use our Action Center to send Governor Branstad a note asking him to reach out to these businesses and encourage them to consider Iowa.  These are financially solid organizations that provide high quality jobs, making this the right move not only for firearm manufacturers and dealers, but for Iowa citizens and the economic development of our state."

It is some that I have had for awhile and each brick has 500 rounds (not 333,335 or 400 rounds.....a full 500!)
BUT it is stuff that the Russian shooting teams used for practice, so it has a wax on it that is just a bit sticky, so it doesn't feed well in semiauto guns. It can be wiped off easily with a paper towel or just used as-is in a bolt action rifle, and for that it works very nicely.
I used up one of these bricks years ago and it was quite accurate and consistent, has brass casings, and (although it doesn't say) I'd guess 40 grain round nose lead bullets.

I used it in a couple Target bolt guns that I no longer own, and it worked well - and the guns cleaned up easily, too.

There are four (4) of these bricks, one is opened so I could take a pic of the boxes and cartridges, otherwise these bricks are sealed. Check the pics....I have more pics and can email them.

Price is $40 cash for each brick or will sell all four for $150 cash. THAT is pretty cheap by today's prices, and REALLY CHEAP for target grade ammo!

Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were originally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel for end, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price is for $2900 therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the shipment,"

Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were originally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel for end, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price is for $2900 therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the shipment,"

397,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1258397,For Sale:  Important info on Constitutional carry (update),"Columbia, Columbia, South Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, March 21, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Palmetto Gun Rights gathered nearly 9000 petitions to pass Constitutional Carry. 

I delivered those petitions today as part of my testimony before a South Carolina Senate Judiciary subcommittee. 

After listening to two hours of public testimony, the subcommittee approved The Constitutional Carry Act of 2013, S115, by a vote of 5 to 0. The bill now advances to the full Judiciary Committee. 

It would never have received approval without the e-mails, phone calls, and personal contacts that were made by PGR supporters like you. 

Thank you!!! 

So, take a short victory lap, eat an energy bar, and prepare for the next bigger battle in the full Senate Judiciary committee. 

The testimony before the subcommittee was a classic battle of the state vs. the people. 

Everyone who testified against the bill represented some government agency . . . primarily law enforcement.

Everyone who testified for the bill was a member of the general public or a representative of a grass roots group

The fight ahead is going to be extremely tough because nearly every law enforcement agency and municipal association is going to lobby against us.

Funded by your tax dollars either directly or indirectly, these organizations will use your money to try to continue to violate your second amendment right.

The Second Amendment is written to protect our right to keep and bear arms from violation by the government.

So, who will your Senator listen to?

The people whose rights he is sworn to protect, uphold, and defend? 

Or the very politicians and government officials who want to continue to violate those rights?

Contact the chairman Senator Larry Martin at REDACTED today and encourage him to schedule this bill for a hearing immediately! 

Be polite, but be firm! 

There were several verbal amendments made in subcommittee. 

That is always a scary proposition. The devil is in the details. 

We must get the language of these amendments to make sure we still have a good bill. 

And as soon as we are able to take a look at the amendments in writing, I’ll let you know for sure. 

We have a big challenge in the Judiciary Committee with many liberal anti-gun Senators and too many Senators willing to sit the fence. 

These fence sitters will wait to see how the wind blows in their own districts. 

That is why it is critically important for you to contact them now and make it clear that you want them to pass S115 right away. 

You can get the contact information for each of the committee members by clicking here. 

Just like you did with Senator Hembree, make it clear that fence sitting is not an option. 

We at PGR will continue to fight to reclaim our constitutional right to carry a self-defense firearm without infringement. 

We will never sit idly by while our right to self-defense is violated by the men and women in government who are sworn to protect it. 

Thank you for all that you did to bring us this first step toward victory and thanks in advance for what you will do to carry us on to final passage. 

Please continue to support Palmetto Gun Rights so we can continue to fight for your rights! Will you chip in $10 or $20? 

   For Liberty,

You normally can't get .40 for as cheap as 9mm, so now is your chance to trade out your less expensive ammo for slightly higher value ammo. The reason I am doing this is simply because I have found .40 in the stores I have frequented, but for some reason they haven't had 9mm. Maybe I'm just going to the wrong stores, who knows. But I want some 9mm, and I'm willing to give up some .40 for it.

I am not interested in paying much more over retail. So if your a price gouger no need to reply. I am willing to pay a little over retail 150 to 250. but not the insane prices that some of you are asking. I am not new to ARs I am vary familiar with them so save your nonsense for someone else. I am also willing to pay a little more if yours is stamped Law or military only. I am a serious buyer who will pay cash. In the private gun buying and selling market right now there is an abundance of Ars for sale so save your supply demand crap for some other sucker. Right now there are over 400 Ars for sale in WI alone on Armslist and over 600 on Gunbroker. The reason there are so many available is simple the demand is not as high as your asking prices. I am not looking to buy out of fear of a ban that may or may not happen. I would just like another rifle to play with. Prices on Gunbroker have leveled off a bit and the Le  6920's that have a starting bid of 1500 or more are not selling. Unless they come with extra mags, ammo, etc. I am a Wisconsin resident with no criminal backround and I am ccw holder and I also have a utah permit. If you would honestly like to sell your rifle for a fair price not a 50% mark up please email me."

The right .45 handgun. I'm just not sure what that is.
Trades including extra magazines and a decent amount of ammo will be considered much more than ones without. Have to feed them somehow in this market.
4 mags, and around 300 rounds of ammo would be amazing.

What I have:
Marlin 1895GBL .45-70 lever action rifle. Never fired. I bought it, bought ammo, loaded it, and it's been my bedside protection gun since. Haven't gotten a chance to fire it yet.
I have 80 rounds of various ammo, hollow point and solid lead 400+ gr bear loads.
Sling with ammo loops. Buttstock pouch that can hold 20 rounds of ammo. (I like having ammo easily accessable on the firearm.)
I have about $860 into it with all that, and really not looking to take a loss in a trade.
____
Universal M1 carbine with 4x15 round mags, and 150 rounds of 110gr FMJ. I have a Blue Force sling rigged to it, and the buttstock pouch on it also. Two of the mags are taped together ""Jungle Style"".
I'm aware of the bad rep Universal carbines have, which made me wary of this one. But in firing it, I know it's one of the good ones. It's one of the later generation ones.
Looking for about $750 worth.
____
Lastly, a Beretta 3032 Tomcat in .32 ACP. Great little CCW with 3x7 round mags, has the box, manual, and about 320 rounds of mixed ammo. About 30 of which are law enforcement hollowpoints.
I have a waistband holster, and an ankle holster that fit it nicely.
Looking for about $570 worth.

Box papers and three magazines with this D - model. 

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
 Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.
 The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and
 interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
 1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
 2. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
 located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
 3. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. 
4. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
 misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
 5. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
 6. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).
 7. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
 8. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
 9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
 dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

 10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
 13. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction).

658,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1258658,For Sale:  CZ 75 P-07 Duty,"N. Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 650,"Listed On: Thursday, March 14, 2013",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a new gun, box papers and two magazines. The gun is black, 9mm.

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

The stock is in rough shape to include a crack from butt plate that extends out about two inches. That can be repaired with some Gorilla wood glue. The metal however is in great shape and the barrel looks good inside (I cleaned it). Didn't come with a sling or cleaning kit which was annoying but came with the attached bayonet. I'm located in Fairfax Va. If you want it, Come up and give me your $200 cash and its yours. I have an M91/30 which came in similar condition but I cleaned it up and resurfaced the stock so it's nice now but I don't want to do it again with this guy.

Included:
Raven Concealment Holster + Streamlight TLR-1 Flashlight Included + 3 Wilson Combat Magazines + Wilson Combat Bag

This pistol has about 500 rounds down the chamber, and the finish is in fabulous condition. Please see the pictures and you'll agree.

History of this gun:

I was approached by someone recently who shared the history of the limited run of Wilson ""Cave Guns,"" which were developed for a custom order for Special Forces units heading overseas. According to conversations they had with Wilson Combat, this select run with the SF prefix ended up never being delivered and went up for private sale.

So if you enjoy collecting serial numbers and pistols with some history to them, this is a great pick.

Includes 3 holsters I have for it.

The pistol comes with one 8-round Wilson mag.  I'm throwing in an additional 8-round mag that has never been used. It just has a bumper designed for a smaller grip size, and if you get a new bumper on there, it will work perfectly (I'm just trying to offload that mag!).

Raven Concealment Holster!

The most exciting extra is a Raven Concealment custom molded holster designed for this pistol, as well as a Streamlight TLR-1 flashlight with option for an extended, threaded barrel. These holsters take 6-8 months to receive on custom order, so this is a real steal.
There are two additional holsters I'm throwing in with this. One is an IWB, as well as a Blackhawk holster with paddle attachment.

Details of the sale------

Once you buy this pistol, I will put it in the hands of my local FFL here in Geneva.  Your FFL will have to contact him and fax or email a copy of their information. I require certified check or money order or CASH.  Once the funds clear my local bank, I will tell my dealer that he can ship out the package or you can pick it up from him in Geneva.  He charges $45 normally for the handling and shipping fee via USPS.  If you pick it up, he charges you $23.00

Why am I selling? I'm trying to downsize my collection to fewer pistols.  Otherwise, I love the way this baby shoots!

 I would like to trade a very nice example of the 1944 dated Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifle for an original matching New England Westinghouse M91.

 The original WWII PU sniper that I offer up in trade is one of the better examples from the more desired and lower production Tula arsenal, with no visible [I], [X] or [/] refurbishment stamps on the barreled action, stock or scope.

It is all stamped matching with the letter prefix's (no line-outs), has an excellent bore and the original crown.

The original numbers matching WW2 scope is sharp and clear as well.

I would not consider trading it if it were not a duplicate model and year for me.

 So... if you have an original and matching numbers New England Westinghouse Mosin Nagant you would be willing to trade for a pretty scarce, Tula PU sniper please send me a email and we'll talk.

 Many detailed photographs available to ""NEW"" owners considering a trade.
