Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitionGulf Coast Arms2111 W.

Has ambi controls as the safety doubles in as a decocker the mag release is ambidextrous also. Functions very much similar to a Sig Sauer feels the same to me. Incredibly accurate and mind blowingly smooth double action allows you to carry with one in the hole and the hammer down. Can be fired without charging or pulling Hammer back. Can be fired from single action just as well with about a 3lb trigger pull. Nice gun, nice trigger, all in all this is a couple levels above Glock as far as fit finish and craftsmanship goes. I am pretty well situated when it comes to 9mm and this is my nicest and newest so I figure this is the best one to sell or trade as far as your perspective goes. It operates about the same as a Sig Sauer 226,  one of the newer ones. I will also include a $100 holster. Leather or Kydex, your choice. I will also include a $100 holster. Leather or Titus, you're choice. Been to the range twice as I said and that's about it.If you have an extar 556 I would ignore the price difference and trade you flat out. Also interested in a semi-automatic shotgun such as a Saiga or even some type of Benelli or Beretta, something Tactical.If you have a very nice 300 Blackout pistol and you just want 9mm pistol of quality make, with high capacity, and just an all-around top-notch pistol this is it. Not really looking to sell a firearm but in the end I do need cash and would rather have other things besides a fancy pistol so make an offer if that's what you want to do. Do you have a well running manual automobile? If so maybe interested in a nice stick shift.Mainly looking for a trade and that's about it. Can add some cash if you do have a nice enough car otherwise looking for a Glock 21 or 20 Generation 3. Simple as that."
