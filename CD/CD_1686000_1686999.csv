Gun is in fair condition. It's not a mantle piece princess, it has some wear here and there. It's been shot on the weekends at the range and on some makeshift rifle training courses. Smooth action, no slam fires, gun is thoroughly cleaned after each use and cleaned again after the cleaning just to be sure..

So let there be no confusion as to who is typing this response letter or who is speaking here. No one else prompted this other than the person whom I am suspecting is a 150 pound impatient jilted twerp from Bend named Jason Viele that thought P-mags should be worth 90 dollars each. 

I figure since we are posting names and whatnot on the internet for all to see I could stoop to his level, I am sick of being on the high road here. 

Yes Mid Oregon Armory did in fact close its doors and by the fault of poor practices and bad judgment calls on MY PART not Michaels or Donna or Mikes part but my part alone several people got jilted. I had nothing but best intentions at all times however the road to hell is paved with good intentions. For this I apologize. HOWEVER I am working diligently to get people handled and thus far I have an entire receipt book to prove that I have in fact been doing that. I have been diligently returning consignments and getting them paid out as fast as I can.

I will explain this plainly for the apparently mentally challenged person that can’t get it through his head I AM EARNING THE MONEY CONVENTIONALLY this takes time. Let me explain something to you about an LLC. I can walk away… I can bankrupt it… and you can’t do anything… you will have no recourse. You should ask yourself why I haven’t done that. Ask your attorney if I can do that, see what he has to say. I bet you will be shocked to know I can stick it in you and break it off then walk away and open a business tomorrow with a new LLC as if the old one never happened. You know why I haven’t done that? Because I am not a giant douche nozzle, I don’t intentionally screw people over. I am working as hard as I can to get people paid back and get people handled, but realize that I am earning money the same way everyone else does with a JOB.  I have a receipt book and a damn call log that I have to keep because people like you are calling the police on me like I am some kind of criminal that had a mass plan to keep a business open at the cost of 6700 dollar a month just to steal your 900 dollar consignment. Use your brain.

Here is where you are a worthless, gutless cur. You lumped in people that haven’t had anything to do with the company in 9 months. Donna and Mike Cox, they had nothing to do with anything that has to do with you. Shame on you for putting their name out there, they haven’t been a part of MOA since last October. Michael is no longer part of the company at all. You should not have named or mentioned them at all this rests solely on ME STEVE GRAVES. Leave everyone else out of it.

You are just stomping your feet to do it, and you know all you have accomplished is the following, and yeah I’ll say it out loud I don’t care if it makes people hate me, It just moved you to the bottom of the list of getting you taken care of. I don’t give a rat’s ass. Don’t get me wrong I’ve never screwed anyone in my life and you will get taken care of it will just happen last. VERY LAST after everyone else on my list is done. So call the police AGAIN, and see if this time when the try and explain civil and criminal you can get it through your head. Or try and sue me and see if your lawyer can explain to you that the person behind an LLC can’t be held liable for the actions of an LLC, hence the point of an LLC.

 What happened was simple. Your stuff was boxed up and ready to move back to you, your entire 90 dollar gouge the people PMAGS, ready to go and when we bulk sold the store they got lumped in on accident with the wrong set of boxes. The guy that bought it all acknowledges that and said he would go through his storage and find them. I haven’t heard back yet. Simple issue, simple solution, you are just being impatient.  I am trying to either recover them or buy 50 more I responded to your text on Friday and never got a return text and here I am having to type out this response.  Now you are to gutless to return a text at all. 

For anyone else that reads this, normally I am the nicest person you can come across. I am not shady even if I seem It I have sold everything to try and make this right with people I live in a damn fifth wheel on my friends property. I have nothing, I have sold all my guns, my jeep, my car, my collectables, anything I had of value and am now working odd jobs and whatever I can do to get people paid. I have receipts to prove it and have been working with the police to ensure that people can contact me via phone, email or Facebook. If someone says they can’t get ahold of me they aren’t trying I am not hard to find. 

If you have been jilted my number is REDACTED DO NOT CALL ME… TEXT ME… I NEVER ANSWER MY PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OR FACE BOOK ME steve.graves96

Selling two brand new S&W M&P15-22 rifles in 22lr.  Any purchase will include 50rds of Remington 22lr ammo.  One is the standard version and the other is the Magpul special edition that has Magpul parts (grip, stock, flip sights).  Both will come with a 25rd mag.  I have other 25rd factory S&W mags if you need more.  I personally own the Magpul version and it is a blast to shoot.  Out of the 22lr ""ARs,"" the Smith and Wesson 15-22's function is the most similar to full-size ARs.  Thanks!

(I will not pay gouging prices though, so don't bother trying to trade me .12 cent .22 rounds or .80 cent 5.56's, I'm well aware what I can get them for in the stores, I'm looking to avoid the quantity limits). Other small stuff and accessories for an AR15 like optics, flashlights, laser sight, mags, ammo cans, etc. to bulk a deal is ok. 

Here are the values on the gear.

PRS Soapbar II w/ P90's, killer sounding PRS, great player- $450

Douglas 7 string, MINT in the limited natural finish, Grover tuners and Floyd Rose trem, brushed nickel hardware, beautiful mint axe- $225 

Danelectro 'Danoblaster' with built in distortion mod, great retro look and sound, distortion with the push of a button- $150

Ibanez Acoustic, great low action in awesome condition!- $125

Peavey Vypyr15 mod amp, has several different amp combo sounds, and tons of on-board effects, a little cranker in mint like new condition- $85

Peavey 2-10 Bass Cab w/ attenuation, excellent working condition, sounds great- $150

Bravo Company 16"" upper with magpul furniture and Allstar Tactical lower 

This is a high quality AR not some cheap dpms or PSA rifle 

Comes ready to fire 

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM®) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. 

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)

M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver

In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 

T-Marked Upper Receiver 

The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 

The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 

BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber 

One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 

Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

5.56 NATO Chambers 

The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 

Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

Government Barrel Profiles 

Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels 

Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

First, I have 150 rounds of 45 acp FMJ. 50 of those are in a ziploc bag (remainder from WWB Bulk pack) and 100 are in an unopened Federal bulk pack. At walmart, Winchester ammo is $29/box of 50 so I am selling it at $25/50 for any of the stuff I have.

I also have a Pelican case, cut out for a mid size Glock. It will fit most handguns that are about the size of a Glock 19. I have so far tried an M&P compact, G19/G23, and a G30 in this case. All of them fit great. You can also cut out more squares for a G17/G22 and the like. It's waterproof, crush proof, humidity controlled, etc. Like I said, its cut out for a mid size gun (and 3-5 mags). Very nice case that retails over $100. I'm asking $60.

They come with an integral Trigger Guard for added strength and rigidity. There also have very subtle and slight grooves machined into the front of the magazine well for extra grip in any situation. The operations left to be completed are as follows: fire control group slot, trigger pin hole, hammer pin hole, and the safety selector hole. This is a not an FFL item and can be SHIPPED TO YOUR DOOR. This is not a complete receiver and still requires some machining in order to have a fully operational firearm.

 This pistol is absolutely FLAWLESS.The only way you will ever find one in better condition is to go back in time and hand pick it from the assembly bench.
 With that being said,i have a gen 2 g17.Two factory 17 rd magazines,standard sights,factory Tupperware,cleaning brush,mag loader.
 The old gentleman that I got this from stated that this was an L.E. gun but may have been un-issued.
 He had only run 50 rds through it and as far as barrel wear is concerned it coincides with that amount.
 I can not stress to you the absolute incredible condition of this gun.There is not a single scratch on it,any handling wear on the frame or any holster wear AT ALL.
 You truly have to see this to believe it.
 I am not placing a cash price as I have no idea what to ask for it.
 I am entertaining trades of all sorts but am asking that handgun trades be of a larger caliber than 9mm.Any other trades considered.
