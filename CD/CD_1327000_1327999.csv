Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

The ND-3¬Æ x40 Laser Designators features a 40mm lens and is part of the newest precision optical lighting instruments using advanced green laser technology. The patented Rotary Optical Collimator uses a system of 9 fully multi-coated lenses that allows full adjustment and control of the beam diameter and intensity to focus light where you need it most. Rotating the collimator to minimum, it creates a bright micro beam of green laser light visible up to 3 miles or ‚Äúpaint a target‚Äù at up to 400 yards. Rotating the collimator to more open settings provides plenty of illumination for closer objects or targets. Two CR123 3V batteries power the ND-3¬Æ x40. 

Unparalleled source of illumination for night hunting and shooting sports. 

Anyone hiking, hunting or who will need long distance illumination in warmer climates of 40¬∞ F. or above, we recommend the ND3x40 Laser Designator. However, if you are planning a trip or outdoor adventure to colder climates of 40¬∞ F. or below, then the ND-3 x40 Subzero‚Ñ¢ is better suited for you. This model is specifically designed to operate in subzero temperatures without loss of intensity or power.

124,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1327124,For Sale:  French Lebel Rifle - Model 1907/15 - Made in 1927 - Beautiful Condition,"Valrico, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 575,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 3, 2013",Rifles,FN Herstal S.A.                                                                                ,8mm Mauser                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"For Sale today is a French Model 1907/15 Lebel rifle that has hung on my office wall for 20 years. Unfortunately I work for a Fortune 500 company who has recently requested that I remove it due to the anti-gun sentiments we all face these days. So since I'm just a few short years from retiring (with a rather nice pension) - I decided to comply. My wife also told me that it didn't fit our decor so no chance of hanging it over the fireplace at home... Ha!

The quick story on this rifle is that I lived next to an older retired gentleman many years ago whose full time retirement passion was collecting and refinishing/restoring old military firearms. He only worked on older rifles that dated from WWII or before.

Every few years he'd make a road trip in his van, and he'd come back with a big pile of rifles. He told me he would stop by some of the big importers who in those days let him pick through their piles of rifles that were too beat up to sell easily. Of course that was what he was looking for and he picked the rifles that were a physically unattractive, but that were in good working shape mechanically. He would sometimes spend weeks working on a single rifle to make it beautiful, and I can tell you that no one who came to my office for the first time ever went more than 5 minutes without asking about this beautiful old rifle. So it's an incredible conversation piece.

Additionally he told me that this rifle would be perfectly safe to fire and even gave me (4) clips of ammo which is 8mm Lebel. These cartridges and clips go along with the rifle as does the original French "" needle style"" bayonet. The bayonet is in nice shape and has a brass handle, but it's not as nice as the rifle. I looked on eBay recently and similar bayonets are listed for $125+ by themselves.

 I never fired this rifle so I must say that you need to get your gunsmith to take a look at it before firing. Even though there isn't a speck of rust or corrosion on it anywhere - be safe and get an expert's opinion.

I did take a look through the barrel and rifling appears very good with no rust or pitting, and there is even some shine to my older eyes.

Finally I had a difficult time trying to take good pictures of this rifle with the camera I have. So the three pictures allowed by Armslist really don't capture the true beauty of this rifle. I'd be more than happy to arrange a time for a SERIOUS buyer to take a closer look.

Price for the rifle, clips & ammo, and the bayonet is $575. The rifle was made in 1927 so it's not a true antique in the eyes of the law. Therefore you must be a Florida resident and at least 21 to buy.

Thanks for looking"

From Sig Sauer website:

""SIG SAUER P250 SUBCOMPACT NITRON

The P250¬Æ, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER¬Æ P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.
SIG SAUER¬Æ P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association‚Äôs coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year. This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250¬Æ...""

If you want ""the best handgun in the world"" then you should chose Sig Sauer.
If you want ""the best Sig Sauer"" then you should chose Sig Sauer P250.
There is only one better then this one for me. But this one is the best for many others.
Start with this subcompact model, and then later add different sizes and calibers. This is the original solution for many people that want more then one caliber, and one gun for more then one application.
If you ever shoot the best of all handguns, this one will surprise and impress even you. It is so smooth, sweet, stylish, comfy, very sturdy, accurate and very light. It works like a dream.

A small, lightweight pistol ideal for concealed or backup carry, the Kimber Ultra Crimson Carry II pistol features a compact aluminum frame with short grip for easy concealment. Like the Pro Crimson Carry line, Ultra Crimson Carry pistols combine Kimber quality with a Crimson Trace Lasergrip for greater accuracy, confidence, and value. A lightweight pistol ideal for carrying all-day/every day, this 1911-style handgun is built around a lightweight aluminum frame machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. The Ultra Crimson Carry's steel slide and match grade steel 3'' bushingless bull barrel aids concealability while still delivering Kimber accuracy. One of the finest laser sights available, Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, to help shooters of all levels learn the advantage of proper grip and trigger control immediately, helping them improve accuracy and reduce time between shots while training. Extended thumb safety and beavertail grip safety for fast positive action."

Revolver Taurus M856 .38 special handgun. Slimmest and lightest six shot revolver. 
This is the real deal. Brand new in the box. Perfect for concealed carry.
One of the best quality revolvers. Has some extra features like special key to lock the gun, automatic double safety sliding transfer bar, etc.

"" Taurus M 856 6 Shot Rev .38 SPL +P 2""B 22oz NIB 20% more firepower than the 5 shot revolvers with virtually no gain in size! The Model 856 is essentially the Model 85 in a six-shot version. So how did Taurus do it? With a clever mini gain in size we squeezed in the sixth hole in the cylinder.

Ultra-fast. Ultra-reliable. It's no wonder the 85s are our most popular family. We pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo making them powerful, easy to carry and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers.

Plus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the revolver cannot be fired or cocked. Revolver Security System device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear of the revolver and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System.

The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

The Taurus Unlimited Lifetime Repair Policy‚Ñ¢ is just that. The lifetime of the gun...not the buyer. This is the first warranty of its type in the industry. No other manufacturer has the confidence to extend this kind of offer. Except us. We know how good our guns are, and we are not afraid to stand behind them...for a lifetime.
Simply put, our unprecedented repair policy stands firmly behind every firearm imported or manufactured by Taurus International. The full terms are we will repair your Taurus firearm FREE OF CHARGE for the lifetime of the firearm.

For sale Raven Arms MP-25 small handgun in .25 auto. Holds 6+1 rounds. All black.
Weight only 15 oz. overall length 4.5"", 3"" tall, 7/8"" wide. The slimmest gun you can buy.
Double safety, voted as the best compact and inexpensive handgun ever produced.
Made in the USA from quality steel, full metal frame and slider. Not like today's small cheap alloy or plastic guns that can explode in your hand on the first shot. 
Fixed barrel (length 2 3/8""), good for mounting silencer, not that you need one.
This is very good quality personal defense, or backup, easy to carry and conceal handgun. Perfect for ankle holster, any pocket, purse or just any place. It fits in small size hand perfect. Ideal for women, or young people with tight clothing.
Very easy to disassemble and clean, very simple construction with only few moving parts.
Handgun is in like new condition. It's very accurate and had less than 300 rounds trough it. Has been functioning flawlessly, without any problems. I have several of this guns and I enjoy shooting them because of literally no recoil and excellent accuracy on 25 yards.
Caliber .25 with hallow point personal defense rounds, its the way to go if your are concern about the size, weight and easy concealing. I own several full size handguns and they all weight around or over 2.5 lbs with the full 15 rounds magazine. After a wile becomes big burden and very unpleasant to carry such a bulky, heavy, and very hard to conceal gun. One that I always enjoy to carry is this one, you don't even feel it.

Online research: 
""In CT, there have been six self-defense shootings employing the MP-25 over the last 20 years. All six have been fatal for the attacker. At 100% fatality rate, this weapon exceeds both the .45ACP and .357 magnum for lethality. Obviously the sample is too small to draw any real conclusions, but it is important to note that 6 rounds of .25 at close range means a lot of blood lost for the bad guy.""
With today's technology boom in ammunition evolution, one modern self defense .25 bullet can make a lot of damage.
 Gun Review: Raven MP-25 Semi-automatic pistol
""Raven MP-25 has a tumultuous history and remains a controversial piece of the American firearms scene. It was designed by the famous George Jennings, and is the original, quintessential, ‚ÄúSaturday night special.‚Äù Reviled by journalists and anti-crime activists for its extreme popularity with criminals, this weapon suffered a smear campaign unrivaled until the concept of the ‚Äúscary black rifle‚Äù reared its ugly head in the nineties. While it is true that criminals employed this weapon heavily through the seventies (count how many you see in the movies ‚ÄúDolemite‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlack Caesar‚Äù), it was the same things that attracted the weapon to criminals that attracted it to everyone else. For twenty years, this pocket stinger ruled the streets of Miami, Memphis, and Harlem. It was designed to be small, light and disposable. In the end, like any weapon, it has good points and bad, and the end user must ultimately make the decision for their own reasons...
This weapon only had one competitor in its class when it came out: the Colt .38 Detective special. In the sixties, the snub-nosed .38 ruled the concealed weapon scene. Small, comparatively powerful, and reliable, every cop had one on the ankle and every detective had one on the hip. When the MP-25 hit, you now had access to a weapon that could shoot seven rounds and then reload in the blink of an eye. Like all detachable magazine automatics, reloading is as simple as dropping the mag, and sliding in another. It was way faster than wrestling a speed-loader into a revolver, or worse, feeding individual rounds into the cylinder...""

If you see this listing handgun it's available.

For sale: New in the box, CZ 99 (CZ999) handgun pistol caliber 40 S&W, Century International Arms, Zastava Arms Serbia (Yugoslavia). Price $899.
Magazine capacity 11+1 rounds (with the extended mags 15 and 20 rounds). Mags from Beretta 92 fit as well.
In original box, never fired, brand new. Comes with cleaning brush, manual, warranty, factory certificate of pressure testing and quality control.
This is the best handgun in the world (my opinion). A  40 S&W caliber is the best choice between the stopping power, number of rounds in the mag and the price. This is the caliber that is being used by US police, secret service and special units.
CZ 99 reassembles Sig Sauer P226, but in many ways is better and more improved then Sig. It's combat-proven all over the world, and it is the service weapon of choice for the police and military forces in many countries.
I had a CZ 99 in the military and police service and as my personal concealed carry weapon for many years. My experience is 100% positive. There was not one malfunction on any of these guns that I know of. They performed flawlessly under any condition and without cleaning, for months of extensive use, and accuracy was always the same.
The feeling and fit of the CZ 99 in your hands, while aiming and shooting, can be compared with the Mercedes amongst cars. And yes, I have been shooting many different guns and calibers for the past 25 years.  I own a Beretta 92 and a Sig Sauer as well, and have been shooting and comparing them side by side millions of times. My choice is always CZ 99. My hands are small to medium size, and it fits well.

In America, CZ 99 is known under different names and was imported by different companies:

CZ 99, CZ 99S, CZ 999, CZ999 Scorpion, ZDA, CZ05, Zastava Arms, Serbia Yugoslavia.
US importers: Nationwide sports, TD Arms, Century International Arms, Charles Daly ZDA, Arsenal, EAA.
License: KSN Industries Israel - Golan, Tressitu South Africa.
""CZ"" is short for Crvena Zastava, translates to Red Flag, which is the old name of the factory from Kragujevac, Serbia. This Factory started making canons and firearms in 1800s. With the rich history and recognizable quality has set their reputation. Today they make many good quality firearms, handguns, hunting rifles, shotguns, military firearms, machine guns... including the famous AK 47s, which are practically indestructible and the most reliable in the whole world, same as CZ 99. We had these AKs and CZs falling from the chopper from 200 yards and, they worked like new afterwards.

The CZ 99 is a military-police service gun, or it can be a very dependable self defense and concealed carry gun. Alloy frame and polymer grips make it very light.

Parts exposed to high dynamic loads such as hammer, firing pin and unlocking insert (locking block) are made of the military ordnance steel
Hard-chromed barrel inside and out, no need for oiling, will never corrode. Barrel length 4,5"", machined slide from one solid block of steel, full length slider rails.
Forged alloy frame, decocker and slide release in one, ambidextrous.
Good trigger SA and DA (single & double action), low recoil, firing pin block, easy field strip.
Barrel is made from same material used in the M-84 machine gun and is hard-chromed. In the test done in the USA in 1991 it was found that it dissipated heat very well. While this is not a concern with handguns nearly as much as it is with the machine guns, the ability to dissipate heat rapidly makes the barrel capable of lasting longer due to a shorter expansion/contraction cycle. After many Serbian and FBI tests (mud, water, sand, snow, ice, hot) firing 200,000 rounds from the single gun, there was not one malfunction, and accuracy was the same like the new one. 
It's been accepted like a service weapon for many different police stations in the US.
Not many people here know how good this gun is, because is not advertised globally and many after seeing it, think it's Sig Sauer. To add to that, Sig besides CZ 99, is the only official police service weapon today for many police stations in the US (in 40 S&W caliber only), replacing Beretta 92 and Glock. Portage police station is one of them.

Now is the smart and best time to invest in a good quality affordable hand gun like CZ 99. The time is coming soon when you will not be able to purchase it. They are not imported any more. Current owners know how good it is and will never sell it.
This one will go fast. So please no negotiations. Price is firm, $899.
This is private sale. I am not a gun store or a gun dealer. There is no background check, and according to Indiana law, the sale is simple and straightforward - exchanging cash and guns between hands. But, my moral obligation is to make sure that these guns end up in criminal- free and responsible hands. So please, if you can legally own guns you are welcome; if you cannot or have mental issues, you are not welcome, and I will refuse to sell to you.

It has the 21 inch barrel, Thumb hole stock, No Bayonet mount, No flash hider, Has a nut on the threads in the front of the barrel.
I have never tried to take the nut off to expose the threads.

 It came with one 5 round magazine, I bought the 30 round and the 75 round drum.

 This rifle had a factory modification which added a button under the magazine catch. That button required a detent to be milled in the magazine for the magazine to seat fully in the rifle.

This was an attempt to differentiate between a pre and post ban rifle and that the pre ban mags could not be used in the post ban rifle.

As opposed to modifying the rifle by lightly grinding off the button this rifle is stock new, as received, and unfired.

The two additional mags have the detent milled into them to be fully functional in this rifle or any other rifle with no issues.

I have attached pics of the mags and the button . I hope the words and the pics are self explanatory.

Caliber 30-06 Springfield (7.62√ó63mm) is the most used, the most popular, versatile and world wide spread hunting, as well military sniper caliber. 
Used in American military as a sniper caliber for many decades.
 From Wikipedia:
"" .30-06 Springfield
 Place of origin : United States. 
 In service: 1906‚Äìpresent. 
 Used by: USA and others. 
 Wars: World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, to present.
In military service, the 30-06 was used in the bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifle, the bolt-action M1917 Enfield rifle, the semi-automatic M1 Garand, the M1941 Johnson Rifle, the Famage Mauser, the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), and numerous machine guns, including the M1917 and M1919 series. It served the United States in both World Wars and in the Korean War, its last major use being in Vietnam. Large volumes of surplus brass made it the basis for dozens of commercial and wildcat cartridges, as well as being extensively used for reloading. In 1908 the Model 1895 Winchester lever action rifle became the first commercially produced sporting rifle chambered in 30-06.
Ballistically, the 30-06 is one of the most versatile cartridges ever designed. With ""hot"" hand-loads and a rifle capable of handling them, the .30-06 is capable of performance rivaling many ""magnum"" cartridges. The .30-06's power (combined with the availability of surplus firearms chambered for it and demand for commercial ammunition) has kept the round as one of the most popular for hunting in North America. With appropriate loads it is suitable for any small or large heavy game found in North America.
The .30-06 cartridge was designed when shots of 1,000 yards (900 m) were expected. In 1906, the original M1906 .30-06 cartridge consisted of a 150 grains (9.7 g), flat-base cupronickel-jacketed-bullet. After WWI, the U.S. military needed better long-range performance machine guns. Based on weapons performance reports from Europe, a streamlined, 173 grains (11.2 g) boattail, gilding-metal bullet was used. The .30-06 cartridge, with the 173 grains (11.2 g) bullet was called Cartridge, .30, M1 Ball. The .30-06 cartridge was far more powerful than the smaller Japanese 6.5√ó50mm Arisaka cartridge and comparable to the Japanese 7.7√ó58mm Arisaka. The new M1 ammunition proved to be significantly more accurate than the M1906 round. In 1938, the unstained, 9.8 grams (151 gr), flat-base bullet combined with the .30-06 case became the M2 ball cartridge. The M2 Ball specifications required 2,740 feet per second (840 m/s) minimum velocity, measured 78 feet (24 m) from the muzzle. M2 Ball was the standard-issue ammunition for military rifles and machine guns until it was replaced by the 7.62√ó51 mm NATO round for the M14 and M60. M2 bullet was considered optimal, and many rifles performed well. The U.S. Marine Corps retained stocks of M1 ammunition for use by snipers and trained marksmen throughout the Solomon Islands campaign in the early years of the war. In an effort to increase accuracy some snipers resorted to use of the heavier .30-06 M2 armor-piercing round, a practice that would re-emerge during the Korean War. Others sought out lots of M2 ammunition produced by Denver Ordnance, which had proved to be more accurate than those produced by other wartime ammunition plants when used for sniping at long range. Commercially manufactured rifles chambered in .30-06 are popular for hunting.Current .30-06 factory ammunition varies in bullet weight from 7.1 g to 14.3 g (110 to 220 grains) in solid bullets, and as low as 3.6 g (55 grains) with the use of a sub-caliber bullet in a sabot. Loads are available with reduced velocity and pressure as well as increased velocity and pressure for stronger firearms. The .30-06 remains one of the most popular sporting cartridges in the world. Many hunting loads have over 3,000 ft-lbs of energy at the muzzle and use expanding bullets that can deliver rapid energy transfer to targets.
One reason that the 30-06 has remained entrenched as an extremely popular round for so long is that the cartridge is at the upper limit of power that is tolerable to most shooters. Recoil energy (Free recoil) greater than 20 foot pounds (27.1 joules) will cause most shooters to develop a serious flinch, and the recoil energy of an 8 pound 30-06, firing a 165 grain bullet at 2900 ft/s is 20.1 foot pounds (27.3 joules). Recoil shy shooters can opt for lighter bullets, such as a 150 grain. In the same 8 pound rifle, a 150 grain bullet at 2910 ft/s will only generate 17.6 foot pounds (23.9 joules) of recoil energy. Young shooters can start out with even lighter bullets such as the 110, 125 or 130...""

806,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1327806,For Sale:  German GECO Flare gun package - everything included!,"Valrico, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 350,"Listed On: Sunday, March 24, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a Geco 26.5mm all steel flare pistol. The Geco is made in Germany and was imported into the US in fairly limited quantities in the early 2000's. Sportsman's Guide and several other retailers sold them inexpensively then. However today they are nearly impossible to find. In my opinion the Geco is the highest quality, strongest and most interesting of all of these type pistols brought to US during the last 20 years. Many feel that the HK is a better pistol however I've owned both and unlike the Geco - the only steel part on the HK is the barrel as the entire frame is plastic.

This Geco is in original UNFIRED condition. Also included in this package is:

26.5 mm to .410/.45 Long Colt adapter that allows 2.5"" & 3"" .410 shotgun ammo or .45LC ammo to be safely fired.

26.5mm to 12 gauge adapter that allows the less expensive 12 gauge flares to be fired. This adapter cannot be used with regular 12 gauge shotgun shells and must never be attempted as the results would be catastrophic.

Original German flap holster that is weather resistant and has room to store the pistol, cleaning brush, 26.5mm ammo, .410 or.45 ammo & one or both adapters. Holster also has a shoulder carry strap attached.

26.5mm cleaning brush and nylon lanyard strap for pistol

(3) 5 round boxes 2.5"" .410 rifled slug ammo. (1) 25 round box of 3"" - 00 buck with 5 pellets per shell, & (1) 25 round box 3""  #7.5 shot (devastating close range defense load).

(2) 26.5mm white parachute illumination shells, (2) 26.5 mm Red Rain shells & (2) 26.5mm orange smoke shells.

(1) sealed 4 round package of Orion 12 gauge super red flares - expire July 2016

The last Geco I saw on Gunbroker was before Christmas and it sold for over $200 without accessories similar to what the HK's do when they come up for sale. So if you investigate and price everything included in this set - you'll see that my asking price is a bargain.

Price: $350 obo. Also this is a pickup item as shipping live flare shells is a hassle and it's costly. Also because this flare pistol becomes a real firearm when the .410 adapter is inserted you must be at least 21 to purchase."

Also, this rifle has mil-spec Magpul FDE (Flat Dark Earth) furniture, including the extended polymer trigger guard, along with their theory products B.A.D. lever (Battery Assist Device) and angled forgrip.  The charging handle has been modified with a Badger Ordinance tactical charging handle latch to make it easier to manipulate the charging handle with the BUIS down and/or optics on the weapon.  In addition to this the commercial buffer assembly was changed to a mil-spec assembly and paired with a Spike's Tactical ST-T2 heavy buffer that is 4.05oz in weight, does not make any noise like traditional buffers, and is filled with HDTP (High Density Tungsten Powder) to eliminate the chance of bolt bounce, help with muzzle rise, and cut down on felt recoil.

This gun has been babied and is selling between 850-1000.  I also have about 50 rounds of .40 to throw in.  SO! Here comes the weird part.  I just quit my band and have no use for my pro bass gear...(I used to tour) and want to get rid of it.  I will give someone my Sig p229 + my Bass Gear for firearm related stuff.  It is an Ibanez SDGR800 with strap and strap locks ($835 new) and an Ampeg BA-115 combo amp ($385 new).  So all in all you are getting about 1,800 - 2,000 dollars in gear, which I don't expect to get.  SO, 1,100 might not of been what you expected, but would be awesome to acquire in a trade with a gun.  I know some people get angry about it, but I'm not patient and don't want to take the time to sell the gear, so any musicians (or those who want to learn) that want guns and guitars.  Call or text me at 269-598-71four7 (I am an ohio resident...never changed my number).  I promise that you will not be disappointed when you receive the huge package of stuff."

Ruger","Maryland, Maryland, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Sunday, March 24, 2013",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,270 Winchester                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"To appreciate this Ruger Mini 6.8 Remington Special, you have to know something about the cartridge. I am convinced that this will probably be the round that will become the new standard issue military round for American Military Rifles. As good as the 6.5 Grendal is, this round has developed a serious following among American sportsman. The 6.8 mm Remington SPC . is a rifle cartridge that was developed by Remington Arms with collaboration from individual members of the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit and United States Special Operations Command as a possible replacement for the 5.56 NATO cartridge in a Short Barreled Rifle/Carbine. Based upon the .30 Remington cartridge, it is midway between the 5.56√ó45mm NATO and 7.62√ó51mm NATO in bore diameter and velocity. It uses a .277 (7.036mm) diameter bullet, which is the same diameter bullet as the venerable hunting cartridge .270 Winchester uses. It is particularly adaptable to current 5.56 mm NATO firearms, the cartridge overall length being comparable. It may very well become the next standard cartridge for the U. S. military given its development in conjunction SOC and the Army Marksman Unit, as well as its increasing popularity with sportsmen. The advantages of this round are: ‚Ä¢ The 6.8mm SPC has superior terminal performance when compared to similar intermediate cartridge calibers, delivering significantly more weight down range. ‚Ä¢ Nearly 50% higher energy than 5.56mm in short-barrel AR‚Äôs. Because the cartridge length of the 6.8mm SPC is the same as the 5.56mm, the weapon systems are nearly identical, yet the 6.8mm SPC‚Äôs energy delivery is nearly double. ‚Ä¢ Extensive variety of projectiles for military and law enforcement operations to meet a variety of needs. ‚Ä¢ 6.8mm SPC can be used for hunting popular game, where 5.56mm cannot. ‚Ä¢ Available Jacketed Frangible projectiles avoid over-penetration. ‚Ä¢ Several 6.8mm SPC rounds meet barrier blind standards for FBI. ‚Ä¢ 6.8mm SPC OTM round has excellent fragmentation that meets US military requirements. No longer made, this rifle was manufactured in Southport, Conn. USA by Ruger in 6.8 REM Special. Like the Mini 14, it is a Semi-automatic Rifle with a Barrel Length of 18"" The Length of Pull is 13 1/8"" Stock is a black synthetic while the barrel finish is Matte Stainless Steel."
