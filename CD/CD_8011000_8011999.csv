This gun has been fired 16 times (1 full 7 round mag, 1 full 8 round mag, and the one they shoot at the factory). Included is a Crossbreed ITWB holster in horsehide leather for carrying at the 4 O'Clock position. Never worn - brand new - break it into your own butt.Also included is a Weber Tactical Apendix Carry holster with magazine holder so if that's more your style or you're looking to see which you prefer, there's both options right there. This holster has also never been worn.Two mags included - one 7 round flush fit magazine and one 8 round with the mag extension and grip extension.Trigger is an Apex Tactical TriggerFrame was also custom done - did the stippling and then lightly sanded it down afterward so it is much grippier in wet conditions or with clammy hands than before, but doesn't feel like you're holding a porcupine.The slide is the most unique part about this firearm because it is a custom slide from Jaegerwerks. They don't do Smiths anymore, so it just might be the only SHIELD with a Jaegerwerks slide out there. After they did the cut work, they finished it in this distressed style. There is a full layer of grey cerakote underneath which is topped by a layer of black cerakote that is scraped partly away to reveal some of the grey underneath - That's all brand new and not worn at all (Though it looks like it) Jaegerwerks also installed the Vickers Tactical sights from Wilson Combat while they were at it which further makes it a unique pistol in that those sights aren't exactly designed for the SHIELD. They made them fit so now you get the rear U-Shaped sight with one tritium tube at the bottom, and a gold bead sight at the front."
