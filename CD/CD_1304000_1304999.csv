It is not a salt wood, but has three areas of mild corrosion which is indicative of spending its life in the PNW. The magazine well and trigger guard are perfect with no corrosion. It has been very well controlled and I oil it regularly to keep it from getting worse. One other issue is that someone has engraved the trigger guard in front of the magazine well with the initials RLR. 
This is a gun from a WA resident and really enjoy it, but I already have a new T-Bolt that I use more often so this one goes. 
Shoots great with the stock Browning peep sight. The 5 round magazine is included, it fits kinda tight in the reciever, so you need to wiggle it a little to get it out. Stock is in great shape and shows almost no wear. I am asking $400 for this neat little piece of history.
I would like to only do Face To Face transactions, WA residents only please, I have had some bad experiences mailing guns and would not like to repeat that, in the Fort Lewis area of Western WA. I am not looking for trades since I am selling these guns in order to trim down my collection, thanks. You can text or call me at REDACTED anytime during the day before 10PM, I do not regularly check emails so those are the best ways to contact me.

I paid various prices so I'm averaging the prices I paid and will sell it for $0.65 per round ONLY if you buy a minimum of 3000 rounds or $0.70 per round ONLY if buying between 1000 and 2999 rounds and $0.75 per round ONLY if buying between 500 and 999 rounds, I'm not looking to make a profit, just recover my costs.

The most notable feature of the SP2022 is that the frame has a Picatinny-type rail to accept tactical lights or laser sighting systems. Unlike many other DA/SA pistols, SIG positions the hammer decocking lever at the top of the left-hand grip panel where it can be depressed with the right thumb without having to change your grip on the pistol. The slide stop is just above this and can also be manipulated easily.

This rifle is a tac driver. This rifle will shoot 1/4 MOA at a 100yrds. I have shot various small game with this rifle and it performs well above par. The polygonal rifling allows better performance and long barrel life that surpasses other manufactures. I have shot less than 300rds through this rifle. I got it sighted in and from then out have just delivered precision shots at small game. 

There are few if hardly any of these polygon rifled barrels on the market.
Check out www.blackholeweaponry.com

This barrel will last longer, out perform any other brand that you buy from your gun store, and is cleaner.  Polygon rifling the same rounds that you shoot from other guns 100 plus fps faster, plus you can load hotter loads.  Look up "" black hole weaponry LTM AR 15 barrel review"" for more specs.

This is one killer .40cal Glock package, your carry pistol and nightstand queen! What I have is:


(GLOCK 23 Gen 4 FDE): BRAND NEW IN BOX! It comes as it came from the factory with all paperwork, three 13rd mags, and a brand new/opened Factory Glock 22rd mag. This one is RARE and VERY hard to get your hands on PERIOD! The Glock 23 Gen 4 FDE (not Gen 3), has been going for $700-$850 (minus shipping and FFL) on gunbroker and that‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôre getting one of these! You cannot order these online and I was told today by Vance‚Äôs today, Glock has limited the production of these due to the 8 month back order that they are trying to fill, and that they could order me one at $649.99 if I wanted a nice Christmas gift to myself (you can call and verify)!! 

(GLOCK 27 Gen 4): LIKE BRAND NEW (100rds fired) with Trijicon night nights. It comes in box with all paperwork, three 9rd mags (all have pinky extension), and it has two brand new/opened Factory Glock extended mags (13rd and 15rd with XGrip extentions to make it a full size grip). Glock 27‚Äôs are nearly impossible to get right now as we all know let alone with the Trijicons already installed so please consider all factors. These are going for $600+ online (minus shipping and FFL), add Trijicon Night Sights and you‚Äôre at $800 with paper trail!!

Also included is a like brand new Crimson Trace laserguard, LG-436, that can be used with the Glock 23/27 models. I also have a custom made kydex crossbreed holster that is fitted to the Glock 23/27 with the crimson trace laserguard installed.

Also included is 317rds of ammo:
(not full) Gold Dot LE Duty HP 165gr (21rds/50rd box)
(not full) Champion FMJ 180gr (59rds/100rd box)

I believe this to be very old, probably manufactured in the 50's.  The Toggle-Knee action works like a real Luger and the magazine release works to release the magazine.  The magazine has a spring and follower, and the safety lever works, locking the action.  The trigger pulls, but doesn't do anything because it's a replica.   It has a realistic weight, weighing the same as my actual luger. It looks to me like some of the parts are original luger (possibly surplus parts back when they were cheap) like the magazine, mag release, safety lever/catch and grips. I might be wrong on this, that's what they look like to me. The mag will even fit into my real Luger.   The replica has a nice feel, but it's in used and fairly rough condition. The bluing is mostly worn off and there is some dings and damage here and there, but for the most part it works as it's intended purpose, as an accurate replica.  The barrel looks real on the muzzle end and the breach side, but is solid in the middle, so there is no way it can shoot a projectile or chamber real ammunition.

This is one killer .40cal Glock package, one to carry one to be a nightstand queen! What I have is:


(GLOCK 23 Gen 4 FDE): BRAND NEW IN BOX! It comes as it came from the factory with all paperwork, three 13rd mags, and a brand new/opened Factory Glock 22rd mag. This one is RARE and VERY hard to get your hands on PERIOD! The Glock 23 Gen 4 FDE (not Gen 3), has been going for $700-$850 (minus shipping and FFL) on gunbroker and that‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôre getting one of these! You cannot order these online and I was told today by Vance‚Äôs today, Glock has limited the production of these due to the 8 month back order that they are trying to fill, and that they could order me one at $649.99 if I wanted a nice Christmas gift to myself (you can call and verify)!! 

(GLOCK 27 Gen 4): LIKE BRAND NEW (100rds fired) with Trijicon night nights. It comes in box with all paperwork, three 9rd mags (all have pinky extension), and it has two brand new/opened Factory Glock extended mags (13rd and 15rd with XGrip extentions to make it a full size grip). Glock 27‚Äôs are nearly impossible to get right now as we all know let alone with the Trijicons already installed so please consider all factors. These are going for $600+ online (minus shipping and FFL), add Trijicon Night Sights and you‚Äôre at $800 with paper trail!!

Also included is a like brand new Crimson Trace laserguard, LG-436, that can be used with the Glock 23/27 models. I also have a custom made kydex crossbreed holster that is fitted to the Glock 23/27 with the crimson trace laserguard installed.

Also included is 317rds of ammo:
(not full) Gold Dot LE Duty HP 165gr (21rds/50rd box)
(not full) Champion FMJ 180gr (59rds/100rd box)

I'm asking 1900 or best offer, even a year ago this rifle was nearly 1,000, and it comes with 1,000 in accessories.. Won't be able to buy any of this new, possibly for the next year due to shortages and huge backlogs of orders. So prices will remain high on the used guns. My price is very fair considering, it's practically what I paid when the items were available.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today‚Äôs shooters demand. The SIG SAUER¬Æ 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

It has a Tapco stock, Tapco trigger group, but I have a Bulgarian hammer off to the side as well. I also have a Bulgarian AK74 muzzle brake on it as wellBullet guide is installed but a little unsightly. I have bought a second bullet guide due to this, but the appearance has no effect on performance. It feeds and functions flawlessly. There is a little under 300 rounds down the pipe, Wolf ammo only. Nothing corrosive at all. I've got 5 magazines as well, 2 Bulgarian Circle 10's and 1 Circle 21, as well as two Pro-mag 40 round magazines that function fine. Overall, the rifle is in good shape. I am just not interested in it anymore. I also have about 900 rounds of Wolf 5.45x39 FMJ and Softpoint ammunition with it as well.

I am looking at anything interesting really for trade. AR15's are neat but I'm not too eager to own one. I would like an AK47, however, so that I can consolidate my ammunition down. I will take partial trades for any interesting handguns / .357 revolvers. Otherwise I am asking $1450 for the whole shebang, with minimal wiggle room really. I'm not in a hurry to sell it and if it doesn't sell at all, no biggie for me. I'll eventually get interested again.

Cosmoline has been removed from exterior of the stock, but internal parts still have it.  I did run a cleaning jag down the bore to clean out the cosmoline and the rifling is mirror finish.

Great for night shoots, and for showing you when your mag is empty. A common misconception with tracer rounds is that they scratch/damage the barrel more than your average range ammo. This is simply not true. The reason tracers light up is because of a solid chemical compound at the base of the round that is lit by the ignition of the powder in the brass. The ""tracer"" part never actually touches the barrel. One of the cans was opened, and some of the rounds taken out of the clips, but all were returned to the stripper clips. The stripper clips come in 120rd bandoliers inside each can. They also come with metal followers, which allow you to quickly load magazines, both PMAGs and G.I. mags. Each can costs $650 dollars, and comes with an unused, N.I.B. 30rd G.I. mag. $1200 for both cans, with the G.I. mags. Please no low ball offers.

The proposed assault weapon ban has been shot down because our voices have been heard. The battle is not over yet however, we are winning but have not won. We need to stick together and keep fighting the good fight.  Do not hurt our own by price gouging and taking advantage of fellow gun owners and 2nd amendment supporters.  The truth is we are causing the firearm and ammunition shortages and panic buying prices because we are preparing for a potential ban.  We have to put an end to this madness.  For the last 3 months prices on firearms and ammunition have been outrageous. Those of who are demanding ridiculous premiums for your firearms have every right to do so, but the panic buying days are over. I understand supply and demand has an affect on prices, but that does not justify someone asking well over msrp prices for firearms that wouldn't even be affected by an assault weapon ban. If you are new to the firearms world I urge you to do research and shop around before you are taken advantage of by a private seller here or anywhere else. Things are slowly but surely getting back to normal. Stop panic buying and do not overpay.  Lets get things back on track by selling at normal reasonable prices and not taking advantage of fellow gun owners."

Why I am writing this is that if you don't sell yours before that you will be forced to keep it or have to sell it for before scare  prices or maybe even lower to get rid of it.  that's just economics 101remember the housing bubble and how home prices plummeted 4-5 years ago the same is going to be true for guns.  Don't believe me but back then when some common sense economist predicted that home values would go down everybody said they were crazy.  My suggestion is to sell a little lower now rather than sell for a lot lower later.  AR's were 600-900 for entry level new in store before November and AK's 500-600 and use was less usually un less it had extras.  also stores will have stock again and theirs even during this rush on guns have stayed reasonable they just don't have any stock but they will.  so how much will your used or even worse Frankenrifle home build AR be worth then.  So get ahead of the pack Because you don't want to be the last group that still has theirs overpriced when the supply is back to normal or oversupplied.

For sale is a Remington Model 700, 100% stainless steel barrel, bolt-action, 7mm Remington magnum rifle with BOTH a synthetic stock AND a walnut wood stock.  
This is a firearm that can give you the best of both worlds when choosing the best hunting gun for your taste.  You don‚Äôt have to choose between the modern look and ruggedness of a synthetic stock and the quality feel and finish of the recently refinished walnut wood stock.  Both stocks are included in this auction and can be switched very quickly.
Great time went in to refinishing the walnut stock for this gun.  A careful selection and treatment of oil and finish have made it ready to stand up to the elements, while still showing a beautiful flame pattern and still retaining that well used look.  The walnut stock basically looks like Grandpa‚Äôs old faithful gun that he has used for years, but restored so that it is ready for another lifetime of weather.  Very much like what Fender does with their 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs reissue guitars giving them the worn look but they are going to hold up like they are new.   Both stocks have the raised cheekpiece and a recoil pad.
The stainless steel barrel was recently polished along with the bolt and shows no blemishes.  This barrel will last forever.  The inside of the barrel is clean, and in great shape having been scrubbed down as a part of the refinish process.  Barrel is drilled and filled with stainless screws to add open sights if you wanted.  Receiver is drilled and tapped for two piece weaver scope mounts(which are included).  There is a recessed muzzle crown without any blemishes.
Action is smooth as you would expect from a 700, reliable feeding.  Trigger is a crisp break consistently at 5 pounds.
The 7mm Rem Mag cartridge was developed and introduced along with the introduction of the Remington 700 bolt action rifle.  This is a great pairing to have these two together.  So much in fact that when Remington introduced their 50th anniversary 700 edition, it was in 7mm Rem Mag.  The 7mm Remington Magnum offers ballistics better than the .30-06 Springfield with bullet weights of 160 grains and less, due both to the higher muzzle velocity of the magnum compared to the Springfield and that .284 diameter bullets tend to have better ballistic coefficients than .308 diameter bullets of comparable mass.  However, the 7 mm Rem Mag can be loaded with bullets up to 220 grains.  The 7mm rem mag is about a flat a shooter as you are going to get without going to something like a 338 Lapua or 50 BMG."

Comes with the box, a magazine with mag extension & a holster. It weighs 14 oz. unloaded and 20 oz with loaded magazine. It also has, glow in the dark, night sights.
The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 
The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."
