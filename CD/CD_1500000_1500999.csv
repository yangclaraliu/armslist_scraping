________________________________________________
AR-15/10 .223/.308 Screaming Banshee Muzzle Brake Pressure Reducer 1/2x28 or 5/8x24 Pitch Thread
Product Description:  This can brake is based off of the Russian Krinkov design, it is in essence a suppressor with 1 baffle and an open conical face, it does not suppress sound but it does suppress flash and also directs all concussion down range at a 20 degree angle. This is important if you are defending in close quarters, a regular ""bird cage"" will direct concussion virtually 180 degrees from the muzzle thus blasting your squad with a physical concussion report. 

Specs:

Industrial Grade Steel
Heat Treated
3 piece Krinkov design
Solid Machined Construction
Black Oxide Finish
Reduced back pressure
Measures 3.4""
1/2""x28 or 5/8x24 Pitch
Overview

Black oxide finish, solid precision machined construction. The AR muzzle brake will reduce recoil & climb which will improve shooting and control. The AR Krinkov style muzzle brake redirects propellant gasses and reduces recoil and flash dramatically. Wraps around your threaded barrel and threads on 1/2""x28 pitch. This muzzle brake is great for an AR pistol, SPR, and a SBR AR15."

I now the market vaule of all this ammo and I know what I paid for it.  They arent to far off.  I'll throw my trade vaule in the middle of them and that is $1,600 in ammo.  I will put the numbers here..  I paid $1,500 for all this and market is about $1,750.  And that is coming in lower than the gun show I was at today.  Thats figuring the 22LR at $35 a box when some idiots at the show ( Medina Ohio show) were asking up to $80 a box.  Unreal..  anyways..

I am NOT willing to sell or seperate.  UNLESS... you have a deal for a TRADE that I want.  I do not want to sell this, just trade ammo for guns. many things I would consider.

Some items I would like:

M1 in decent shape.  I will value those between $300-$600 depending on condition. I know what a $1,000 M1 looks like, I live close to Camp Perry and go off of their market prices.  So if you have an M1 and ammo or something...

AK47 and tons of ammo.  I am not going to value your $750 AK at $1250, assault bill ban was tossed out and prices are settling so lets me real

NICE 1911's.  I have a Rock Island and a Para, got the cheap ones covered, now looking for Kimbers, Les Bears or things of that nature.

Desert Eagle/Magnum research in 357 Mag and up caliber,  Used to have a 50 cal and loved it.

FnH 5.75 and ammo.  Would love one of them,.

NICE long colt.  45 Long colt. Not a $400 Uberti or whatever that brand is.  

Smith and Wesson revolvers.  I have a 686 and a 44 mag 10"" dont know the model # off hand.  Other ones.  No Snubs.  6"" is a nice barrel.

Any Snake, Python, Boa etc..  again 6"" barrels.

Shotguns, rifles other than ones listed.  I do not want pets, electronics or anything not gun related.

Consists of a polymer upper receiver and magazine both with MILSPEC size perfectly interchangeable with all models of M4 - AR15 - M16 now available on the market. The M4-22 Conversion allows semi-auto .22LR fire in ANY milspec AR firearm platform. Conversion takes a few seconds to transform your weapon into a .22LR caliber. Without any permanent modification you may now use your M4 with inexpensive ammunition. Two 28 round magazines. Black.

Chiappa firearms, famous for their unconventional revolvers, are now selling a dedicated .22 LR upper. More and more shooters are turning to the .22 lr to get the most bang for their buck. Some have turned to .22 LR conversion kits for their AR-15, but that can come with some consequence. Although the diameter of a .22lr and a .223/5.56 are microscopically close, a .223 barrel is still not made for the .22lrâin terms of size and the bullet itself. The .223/5.56 are jacketed bullets; they have a copper-nickle jacket around a lead core bullet, most .22lr is not jacketed. After repeated shooting with .22lr in a rifle chambered in .223, it can lead to a degradation of barrel life and accuracy; not to mention the accuracy of shooting .22lr itself can be sub par due to the 1:9 or 1:7 twist rate of your AR.

These guns are like Rolex watches, Rolls Royce Automobiles, everything on the gun is hand-fitted, and the pistol goes through a rigorous testing program, and will not pass unless it is perfect. We have every confidence stating that Korth Revolvers are the finest revolvers in the World âbar none! For the Collector in the know, this pistol is chambered for .38 Special, and it has the RARE 2â âSportâ barrel. The pistol has faint turn marks on the cylinder, also one tiny service mark on the cylinder, but otherwise the pistol is NEAR-MINT (98%) condition with an absolutely MINT bore, and a double-action trigger pull that is so smooth it almost makes you cry! The pistol comes in the original factory cardboard box, serial-numbered to the gun (no paperwork or other accessories). Korthâs rarely come up for sale, if you want the exclusive bragging rights of owning this pistol, do not hesitate, buy it now â you will NOT regret your purchase!"

 (Wikipedia)..Swedish company Interdynamic AB of Stockholm designed the Interdynamic MP-9 9mm submachine gun. Intended as a cheap submachine gun based on the Carl Gustav M/45 for military applications, Interdynamic did not find a government buyer, so it was brought to US market as open-bolt semi-automatic KG-9 pistol. Because of this, ATF forced Interdynamic to redesign it into closed-bolt system, which was harder to convert to full-auto. This variant was called the KG-99. It made frequent appearances on Miami Vice, where it was legally converted to full-auto by Title II manufacturers."

Can be converted to 9 MM using STEN Magazones by changing bolt head, barrel, and installation of a magazine well adapter. These parts are still available (I will sent the buyer to the source for them). The Demro carbine was one of the last of the open bolt designs made before the BATF ruled any further production of them to be a machine gun. These are not a NFA item, but are kissing cousins. Many were legally converted and registered pre-May 1986, leaving unconverted ones like this one rare collectors items. If you are an 07 FFL with a Class II SOT you can convert this to full auto in about five minutes without a permanent receiver modificvation, and then de-convert it and remove it from the NFA register when you surrender your license without needing to destroy the receiver. If you are not an 07 FFL with a Class II SOT you can enjoy ownership of a very neat plinking carbine that will always appreciate in value, as no more open bolt carbines can be produced. This one is in very good condition, shoots well, and is provided with one M-3 magazine. Unlike other ""high capacity"" magazines, there was not a run on M-3 mags, and they are available cheaply from several sources. In addition you can swap barrel and bolt head in about 5 minutes to a 9mm set, slip in a magazine well adapter, and shoot 9mm using STEN mags. Wire stock folds, and removes to become a magazine loader. I am not highly motivated to sell for cash, but prefer mature and high quality trades of equal value. Propose offers, don't waste my time with immature ""tacti-cool"" SKS's with kitchen sinks bolted on, or other childish stuff. Will consider quality tactical rifles, precision AR-15 flat top rifle, .300 Blackout rifle, WW-II era military rifles (unaltered, no sporters), or a high quality 5.56mm or 7.62mm precision bolt action rifle. My lowest preference is cash. You must have a Wisconsin CCW for local FTF sale, or transfer thru an FFL at your expense."

CORBON's Bonded Core Soft Points are designed to retain their weight and stay together while crushing through heavy bone and tissue in large game. CORBON's Penetrator and Hard Cast loads are designed for very large, tough-skinned and heavy-boned animals. The Penetrator loads use a heavy, full jacket with a hard linotype core. The Hard Cast load is made from a hard linotype lead with a proven LBT nose design. These two loads cause a through-and-through hole, breaking even the heaviest bones.

To think that of all the sperm in your pathetic excuse of a father who couldn't teach you how to be a man, you were the fastest swimmer haha!!
