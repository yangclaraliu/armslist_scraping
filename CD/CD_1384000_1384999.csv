It will fire both .223 and 5.56 NATO rounds.  Best of all, it weighs in at 5.5 pounds, giving you plenty of room to customize and optimize while still keeping the weight manageable.

This is a BRAND NEW rifle.  Not “brand new but I've fired it a few times,” or any of the other excuses you've been seeing lately.  Brand spanking new, with factory oil still on it.  I bought it as an impulse buy, but decided after I looked at it at home I wanted something else.  Now I'm looking to get my cash back for the rifle.  Don't pay the $1100 some people are selling these packages for with only one mag!  These are selling online for $978.75 for the base package.

If the ad is still up, this is still for sale (if you ask, you will be ignored).  Cash only, face-to-face transaction.  Prefer you have a CCW permit, but not required."

The gun is in good shape with some scuffs and a few scratches on the right hand side of the grip from carry and has a very small scuff on the right hand side of the slide, but overall gun is in good shape and has been fired very little since I got it (150 rounds exactly).  Im not looking to sell or make money on this deal, I would trade the whole kit for a nice glock 19/23 with 2 factory ""Standard"" capacity magazines. Im adding in the glock 33 round mag to entice trades and to compensate from the wear on the gun, you truly are getting the better end of the deal as these mags are still hard to get and they are still selling for 50-75 bucks so you could potentially make money on this deal. I will not throw any money into the deal, this is a bargain in of itself for anybody willing to trade. Just email or call/text at REDACTED with offers.

P.S. If you have a glock 23/32 to trade, tell me if you have any ammo available for it as I will trade you 9mm ammo for 40 s&w/.357 sig and I have a nice varied lot to trade for it."

Night sights, ambi-safety, special slide machining, checkered front strap and custom wood grips make this a sharp looking pistol with everything I wanted, and nothing I didn't.

To get the Kimber Pro size in a stainless steel frame, you have to step up to the higher priced models.  To get the special machined, flat top slide and meprolight sights with one-handed cocking ability and the series 70 style (instead of the II) firing system, you're reaching up to the Super Carry HD Pro category.  [This model does not have the rounded butt for easier concealment, but neither does it have the $1700 price tag, and it's available now.]

I don't think this gun has been fired.  It looks brand new. 

If you respond to this listing, but it's clear that you didn't read it carefully, I will not answer you.  Please don't ask me to ship it.  If I later decide to sell it on Gunbroker, then I'll ship it.  If you're reading this, the gun is available.  I'm not interested in trades or lowball offers.

Night sights, ambi-safety, special slide machining, checkered front strap and custom wood grips make this a sharp looking pistol with everything I wanted, and nothing I didn't.

To get the Kimber Pro size in a stainless steel frame, you have to step up to the higher priced models.  To get the special machined, flat top slide and meprolight sights with one-handed cocking ability and the series 70 style (instead of the II) firing system, you're reaching up to the Super Carry HD Pro category.  [This model does not have the rounded butt for easier concealment, but neither does it have the $1700 price tag, and it's available now.]

Because the demand for rifles could not be met by their own industry, France contracted with Remington Arms to manufacture the Model 07/15. For unknown reasons the Berthier's magazine capacity was three rounds while German rifles held five rounds, and British 10 rounds. When World War I began the French quickly realized the problems with the Berthier. The Model 1907 was modified by adding a metal extension to the bottom of the rifle so a five round clip could be loaded. Thus the rifle Model 07/15. It became the primary rifle of the French army during World War I."

Product Description Ideally suited for informal target shooting, plinking, small game hunting, and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. The 10/22's heat-stabilized, glass-filled polymer trigger housing assembly is precision-made of high-tech material for improved manufacturing tolerances, impact, and abrasion-resistance, and has an unmatched ability to withstand the elements. The hammer-forged barrel is locked into the receiver by a unique two-screw V-block system and the A380 aluminum alloy receiver is precision-machined to provide long-term reliability to the 10/22 action. Ruger's patented, detachable 10-shot rotary magazine features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding. The easy-to-use extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss removal of the unique flush-mounted magazine without leaving it exposed to dent or creating uncomfortable protrusions at the rifle's balance points.

I am moderately flexible on timing but if not gone before the 15th, I am keeping it.  (new law goes into effect on the 15th)  You WILL have to sign a guarantee and provide valid ID, NY CCW permit would be a huge plus.  

Oh yeah, text or call 585-208-ninetytwo zero 5.  Due to overwhelming spam, I will not respond to information requests that are answered herein.  Also not interested in trades or offers below $440.

I have 2 10rd magazines (new in Ruger package) available as well for $40/ea.  They are available only to the purchaser of the rifle.  I will not sell seperately unless Rifle buyer does not want them."

I bought it new a few years back, and just don't need it anymore. And, i owe money on my taxes, so my loss is your gain. 

This thing is a track driver, even though it is a pistol round. I can hit beer cans all day at 75 yards with the scope, and that's as far as my backstop will allow. And, since it is pistol chambered, you can take it into freedom firearms and shoot it inside, which is huge if you don't have outdoor property to practice on. 

I've seen these things jump sky high in price the past few months, so get it now while you still can. They go for 600 new now at gun shops, which I personally think is ridiculous. 

I'm asking 460 for the whole lot, scope included, since that's what I owe in taxes. There is a little wiggle room, but not a whole lot. Please text at 260 two six seven 193seven or email at LimitlessComputer at Gmail.Com"

Here's the FACT.....there is absolutely NO difference in a pre ban and post ban Semiautomatic Assault Weapons (SAW). The value of the two are EXACTLY THE SAME!! The only difference is one was made before Sept. 1994 and one was made after Sept. 2004. The SAWs made in that 10 yr period had specific restrictions on them. So if anyone in looking to buy an ""assault rifle"" type of firearm.....an AK-47, for example, is worth about $300-$400 and a so called ""pre ban"" AK-47 is NOT worth $1200-$1500......It is worth the same $300-$400.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Four 20 round magazines is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Four 20 round magazines is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle."

It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference."

For your consideration I have a lightly used Advantage Arms .22lr conversion kit that fits Glock models 26/27/28/33.

I've shot 5 full magazines through this kit using 40gr CCI Mini Mags. I'm getting out of 9mm all together and no longer have a need for this kit. I'm fairly certain this kit will fit both gen 3 AND 4 pistols because there wasn't a modification to the recoil springs for the g26 between generations. It functioned awesome on my gen3 Glock 26.

I'm looking for cash offers or firearms trades and a FTF transaction in the Manhattan area.

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

I have a brand new Palmetto State Armory PA-15CR Carbine for sale. The description from PSA is below. This AR has no sights included but the trigger has been upgraded with an ALG group and the charging handle is a tactical ambidextrious unit. The Midwest Industries free floating handguard is the thinnest I've ever seen, barely wider than the upper receiver itself, and comes with three additional 2"" rails to place wherever you wish. I've also installed an Ergo Grip and a MagPul CTR 6 position stock that locks up almost like a fixed stock.

This is Palmetto's description:

Finally a complete rifle ready to go for one low price. Our PA-15CR Carbine starts with one of our Premium chrome-lined Mil-spec steel barrels in the versatile M4 profile, mated to our forged aluminum upper, and finished off with a Midwest Industries SS12G2 12"" lightweight free float rail, low profile gas block and A2 Flash hider. The forged lower is built with our 6 position Mil-spec size buffer tube and stock, Standard PSA lower parts kit with A2 grip and aluminum trigger guard. It comes with one 30 Round D&H Magazine so all you have to provide is the ammo to start having fun.

Barrel: 16"" chrome lined mil-spec chrome moly vanadium barrel, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine gas system. M4 style profile is phosphate coated to mil-specs, and is High Pressure tested, and Magnetic Particle inspected, to ensure quality and dependability. Barrel is finished off with a Midwest industries SSG2 12"" Lightweight free float rail, low profile gas block and A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer, and are marked with the Palmetto State Armory logo on the left side, up front, just below the rail.

Bolt: Bolt is made of Mil-spec Carpenter 158 steel, Shot peened, and MPI. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Bolt carrier is parkerized outside and chrome lined inside.

Lower: These forged lowers are quality made using 7075-T6 aluminum and are marked ""MULTI"" for caliber. Finish is Black Hardcoat Anodize per MIL-8625 Type 3 class 2. Mil-spec sized buffer tube is forged of 7075 aluminum, is dry film lube coated on the inside, has 6 adjustment positions, is finished with an M4 stock and has a staked castle nut."
