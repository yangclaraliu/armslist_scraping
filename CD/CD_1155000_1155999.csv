Please read the whole post before replying.

I have a small of land that was my grandpa's for 40 years, and it's in Wood County, Texas, near Hawkins, in the Land of the Lakes subdivision, and the closest I can figure out its location is ""FM 778 and CR 3854 Hawkins, TX"" on Google Maps. I'm trying to get a copy of the plat from the county so I can say exactly where it is. It's small, surely a quarter acre or less, and as it hasn't been seen in years, I would imagine it's wooded and has no improvements.

I want to trade for a gun. I'm really looking for a handgun right now:
Glock 19
Springfield 1911
Any 1911
.357 magnum revolver

I could also consider:
Mossberg 590, 9 shot only
Scary black rifles

If you're interested, let me know. I will update this listing when I know the exact location.

Located in Evansville, IN but posting here for broader audience. 
All matching Norinco Chinese sks. Sporter version. Non thumbhole stock and does not accept ak mags. Is 100% matching, original and real. Have green sling, cleaning kit that fits in stock, screwdriver type bayonet. Comes with about 700 rounds of various factory ammo (norinco steel core, Winchester, brown bear, golden bear, silver bear, Tula and wolf). I have owned for over 22 years. Less than 500 rounds shot thru it. Well taken care of and pristine condition. Again all numbers match. Is stamped Tucson AZ. Is also a legit DB stamp. Here's the history:

In 1989 sks were stamped sporter or sks-m to be allowed for import after a 1989 ban. These rifles were fitted with Monte Carlo or thumbhole stocks. Also made and adapted to accept ak mags. Also had the bayo lug removed. The rifle I have has had none of the cosmetic changes yet is stamped sporter. Plus it has the DB stamp. That means deport Bangladesh. Some Chinese made sks were stamped this or DP(Pakistan) or DK(Kampuchea). DP typically adds 10% value. DK about 15-20%. And the most rare DB adding up to 50% based on condition. Many DP have been forged to appear DB. They are easy to tell due to the mis proportion of the humps of the B. so the sporter mis-stamp, DB stamp and #'s matching drives it to a collectors rifle.
And when I mention the 1989 ban I don't mean the 1994 awb. The 1989 ban also ban import of norinco ammo which some is included with the rifle. A 20 rnd box of norinco was fetching 35-40 bucks before the paranoia after conn.
Also another change was the bolt carrier was changed on sporters with no slots for striped clips since they used ak removable mags and no stripper clip was needed. 
Most sporters had barrels shortened too.

The bike has 24k miles on it, newer dunlop tires, fork seals, dust seals, ignition switch, brake pads, all fresh fluids( fork oil, motor oil, coolant, and brake/clutch fluid), and the bike was painted about a year ago. 
The bike runs and rides, but the clutch is going out so will need replaced soon, and the paint is peeling on the gas tank in one spot and the frame has a few small scratches but other than that the bike looks good for a 13 year old bike.
I am not in a hurry to get rid of this bike, but would let it go for other interests. If it doesnt sell it wont bother me. If your interested email me your offer and a phone number if you prefer to text."

The reason for the 30274 ejector and RSA, is because as before with the previous old ejector 336 and RSA, spent casings were known for ejecting onto the shooter's face, erratic ejection issues, failure to feeds, failure to extract, and stovepipes. It has happened to me before with previous Gen 3 and older Gen 4 models with 336 ejectors. Current RSAs has a bushing at the end of the recoil spring assembly. With previous older RSAs, the recoil springs wraps around to the face of the RSA."

Gun has a nice deep blue plus I believe it is walnut furniture, I believe it to be in very good shape with low round count. This is one of the few BLR'S that was made with a wider forearm grip that does not have the band that goes around the forearm and barrel. The raised scope mounts are included and the gun has nice iron sights so even with a scope on it they are still usaeable. The barrel measures just under 24"" from muzzle to reciever. LOP is about 14 1/2"". This is the best of both a bolt action and lever action.
