even a year ago this rifle was nearly $1,000, and it comes with $1,000 in impossible to find accessories.. Won't be able to buy any of this new, possibly for the next year due to shortages and huge backlogs of orders. So prices will remain high on the used guns.

Lots of people have a lot to say about Taurus, but this little revolver has been a flawless companion to me for DECADES without a hiccup. Based on the S&W 36 and made in a factory built by S&W for the Brazilian military, I've found this 85 to be better built and better shooting than many Smith 36s from the same period. And though I've never had to use it, the lifetime warranty follows the gun. Then why sell it? I probably shouldn't. Truth be told, I just don't use it any more. When carrying concealed (where legal, of course) it's usually a 442, LCP, or PM9. The stainless is nice for damp or salty environments, but I don't find myself in them too often and alloys and polymer ""don't rust neither"". It's too nice a gun for the tackle box and it's taking up space in the safe. 
Comes with original wooden stocks and Hogues.

Now, don't write to tell me you can get a new one for that. That may be true, but I don't think they are built as well and they've got those damn locks.

The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 7 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75"" shells each, for a total capacity of 7+7+1=15 rounds.  The reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.  The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in.

It is used but is in excellent condition. I'm estimating it to have under 500 rounds of quality ammo through it and has been well maintained. This is NOT the easy-to-find SR556E model with the modular rail, this is the model with the free float quad rail. 
It has a chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system. The 4-position, chrome-plated gas regulator allows operator to tune rifle to specific ammunition or rifle conditions. It features a chrome lined barrel, hard chromed bolt carrier group, Hogue rubber grip, and Troy flip up iron sights. The MSRP is $1995 but these have been going for up to $3,000 on Gunbroker (when you can find them).  As I mentioned, the SR556E model is easy to find but the standard is a bit more difficult to find. 
I don't have the papers or the cardboard box but I have the Ruger soft case and it will come with 3 PMags. I just used a stock photo of the gun but if you send an email, I'll send some pictures of the actual rifle for sale.

To add to the weirdness, the serial number on this rifle indicates it was made in 1970; before this model existed. My 39D is nearly perfect. I know it has been shot only because after I got it, I took it out and put a box of 50 through it. It is a fantastic little rifle. That said, I believe it belongs with someone else. It's too nice and too uncommon for me to throw over my shoulder and tromp around the woods. I also prefer the straight stock of the Mountie or 9422 to the pistol grip of the 39D or A.

Brand New Complete Chiappa Firearms .22LR Upper for AR-15 for sale. Don’t let the price of .223 and 5.56 ammo stop you from shooting your AR-15. .22LR is easier to find at 8 cents a shot. When prices and supply levels out it should be less than 3 cents a shot. .223: 60+ Cents A shot < .22LR 5 Cents A shot. This is a Complete Upper so all you have to do is put it on a Complete Lower. .22LR Uppers are impossible to find right now in shops and online they are all out of stock and don't know when they will have one. Manufacturers are holding back on selling uppers in order to make more money on selling complete guns. Complete uppers are currently on back-orders for 6+ months - 1 year. So take advantage. This Upper also comes with a magazine (Most Uppers Don't).

DESCRIPTION: 
The Beretta 3032 Tomcat Inox builds on a long line of compact pocket pistols for self defense manufactured by Beretta. 

This blowback-operated pistol is designed with a double-action/single-action (DA/SA) trigger mechanism.

It is fitted with a frame-mounted manual safety, which also acts as a slide stop when engaged.

The frame is anodized aluminum alloy, and the slide and barrel are stainless steel. 

The Beretta 3032 Tomcat Inox is a self defense pistol designed for concealed carry. The barrel can be released to pivot on a pin under the muzzle ('tip-up' barrel). 

This feature allows a round to be inserted into the chamber directly without manipulation of the slide. 

The chamber can also be easily inspected to verify whether a round is present by using the tip-up barrel. 

The pistol lacks an extractor, relying upon the expanding gasses to force the spent casing rearward. 

Beretta recommends that ""+P"" ammunition with a muzzle energy of greater than 130 ft·lbf (176 J) not be used in the 3032 Tomcat Inox.

NIB with sling bayonet cleaning kit pouchs over 500 rds most on striper clips 2 reprodution paratrooper neck bandoliers I have COA from Mitchells Mauser looks fresh from factory I have never fired it  

An Exciting Rifle to Own, the M24/47 is an excellent variation of the venerable German Mauser K98k that followed 10 years later. Strong, reliable, accurate. An efficient bolt-action rifle you’ll be proud to own.

LSB#: 130125FM01

Make: Colt

Model: Model 1908

Serial Number: 112171

Year of Manufacture: 1933

Caliber: .380 ACP

Action Type: Single Action Semi-Auto Pistol with Detachable Magazine

Markings: The right side of the slide is marked ""Colt Automatic / Calibre .380 Hammerless"". The left side of the slide is marked ""Colt's PT. F.A. Mfg. Co Hartford, CT. U.S.A. / Patented Apr. 20. 1897. Dec. 22. 1903"" followed by the Rampant Horse logo. The left side of frame is marked ""112171"" with an ""I"" and a “VP” on the left trigger guard bow. The right side of the trigger guard is marked ""75"".

Barrel Length: About 3/4""

Sights / Optics: The front sight is a fixed blade. The rear sight is a dovetail set notch.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are ""Sile"" made and checkered wood. The grips closely resemble the original Colt panels. The checkering has worn and the panels have darkened a bit from age and handling. There are no splits or cracks. The grips rate in about Good overall condition.

Type of Finish: Nickel

Finish Originality: Reapplied

Bore Condition: The bore is a bit fouled, but otherwise almost bright and the rifling is only lightly worn. There is only very mild erosion in the bore.

Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 95% of its reapplied metal finish. There is some flaking in the serrations and general surface dulling and frosting. The metal was very smooth and apparently free of erosion before the refinish. The safety notch on the slide is battered a bit. Most of the wear described is to the surface/finish and does not penetrate into the metal. The screw heads are only a bit worn. The markings are clear, and but for the Rampant Colt logo would almost look to have not been refinished at all. Overall, this handgun rates in about Very Good condition.

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We did not fire this handgun.

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: One blued reproduction magazine is included. Also included is a soft and pliable black clip holster. The holster has been modified at the heel for this pistol, but is otherwise in Very Good condition and is great for this gun.

Our Assessment: John Browning designed it and Colt built it – what more needs to be said. The early Colt automatics are in our opinion the best series of firearms ever produced, and from a partnership like Colt & Browning they better be. Everyone has come to appreciate these guns, carrying them even today, as they are one of the few compact automatics with a slide lock. This pistol shows a lot of finish and is in the ever loved .380 ACP."

Ignore the ""Single action"", the action for this gun is actually supposed to be ""Blowback"" but there was no option for that.

Gun is in great condition, fully functional, and original wood handgrips. No ammo included, but it's fairly easy to come across .25 ammo. I'd like this to be in a new home by Friday the 22nd, and am asking $200 OBO. I do have a ""lowest price"", and if you offer too far below that I'm probably just going to ignore you because I've spoken with several people who have told me what my range should be; And my asking price is in the middle of that.

To all of you selling PSA lowers for anything over $120, go fuck yourself. Items like these dont magically gain value when you buy them. They arent collectors items, they arent old, it depreciates just like any regular item. ""Oh but this is a place to sell gun stuff and to make a few bucks."" Sure, make a few bucks, not scam the shit out of people.

Save money and stop shooting that overpriced .22lr ammo.  This is a precission air rifle with match grade accuracy.  Velocities match .22lr!  Plus you can shoot anywhere...EVEN INDOORS!

INCLUDES
Mounted Beeman Blue Ribbon 3x9 variable match grade scope

When RWS first introduced the Model 48, we expected it to become a classic. What was unexpected was its rapid rise to classic status among knowledgeable air gunners. At 1110fps in .177 (750 mps), this rifle propels pellets at .22 rim-fire velocities! This tremendous power is generated by the use of a very robust spring piston power plant cocked by a side lever action. The action is mounted into an extended beech stock to reduce felt recoil and to aid in achieving accuracy potential. Not designed for the faint hearted, this is one impressive air arm, both in performance and presence. It fulfills its purpose as a potent, full-size sporting airgun suitable for either pest control or field target shooting, yet it does so with both balance and grace. The substantial one-piece stock allows for comfortable offhand shooting and adds to the overall sensation that the Model 48 is a force to be reckoned with. The rifle is fitted with a finely rifled, fixed barrel system loaded via sliding breech opening. Its full accuracy potential can be realized by the use of a quality RWS airgun scope mounted to the scope rail. Other standard features include an adjustable trigger, an adjustable rear sight, and an automatic safety."

If you have been looking for a 9mm AR platform, then you would have already read that the CMMG set up is one of the most reliable platforms out there. We fired less than 50 rounds from this to zero the red dot optic and magpul sights and it perdormed flawlessly.

This will come with a charging handle but I'm keeping the bolt group for the AR pistol replacing it. The red dot sight and magpul sights are not included but it can be arranged. They are zeroed for the upper already. The bolt group is sold for 179 at the CMMG site.

My price reflects the actual price you will spend if you found one right now but there is none available to order or purchase right now. My price in not inflated out of proportion.
