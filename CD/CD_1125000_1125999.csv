Before you is the famous Czech CZ82.  You can Google this pistol, it was based on the 
Soviet makarov pistol, but the Czech's went all out.  The barrel has polygonal rifling. This is very different than traditional
groove rifling and looks different to the eye. However, it is very accurate and creates a rifled barrel that will withstand
many more rounds through it without starting to wear. Without getting extremely detailed here, let me just say you can look 
up polygonal rifling on any search engine and find a ton of information on it, but trust me when I say the bores are as they 
should be and these pistols are amazingly accurate.

Additionally, unlike most makarov's pistol, these were manufactured with a safety.  The safety was not installed clumsily and poorly in an after market warehouse.  A good safety is required for a good Conceal Carry pistol.

Also, the pistol comes with 3 double stack magazines (12 rds each).  The pistol is chambered in 9x19 makarov round. This round
sits squarely between 380 and 9mm. The ammo is easy to find, I found some this weekend at Cabellas.  In fact 300 rds are included in this package.

-Remington 870 Express Home Defense model, purchased new in 2011 (will include original paperwork).  Has NEVER been fired, but I have dry-fired it with snap caps and worked the action to break it in.  It's extremely smooth!  There are some minor handling scratches/ blemishes, but nothing big; just your typical closet-bites.
-18 1/2"" barrel, with full-length extended tube.  Holds 6+1 (2 3/4"" or 3"" shells), and uses the older and more desirable magazine extension, meaning that you can add a longer extension for competition, or move to a shorter one for legal hunting, unlike on the current version.
-Added an ATI heat shield with ghost-ring sights.  Set up fits the barrel like a glove, but there is a little paint scrapped off around the mounting bolts from removal and installation, which has been touched up.
-Added a 6-shell side saddle.
-Added a Blackhawk! collapsible AR- style butt-stock/pistol grip set.  I modified the fore grip so that it would work with the heat shield and the side-saddle.  I also added a rail for attaching a tac-light, and a Vecro strip for the pressure switch.
-Painted the original furniture OD Green.  I also added rail sections at the 4 and 8 positions for mounting a tac-light and/or laser.
-The tac light is an M3X, which runs for $120-$150 new.  It is like-new, and comes with the original packaging, pressure switch, spare bulb, spare batteries, etc.  This is a MILSPEC light, and holds up very well, unlike most cheap knockoffs (TacStar, etc)
-I'm including 150 Rds of #6 target load, 30 Rds of 1 Oz hollow point slugs, and 50 Rds of 00 buck (all 2 3/4""), for a total of 230 rounds).  Will also throw in 2 snap-caps, as well as the stock mounting tool.

All things considered, I'd say it's an awesome gun to have fun with at the range, or for home defense.   ASKING PRICE IS $700.00, which is less than I have invested in the firearm, accessories, and ammunition!  

Original purchase prices:
Remington 870 Express Home Defense: $400+ tax and background check ($475 or so, total)
M3X tac-light, with case, pressure switch, accessories: $130
Side Saddle: 35
Blackhawk! stock set: 75
Heatshield: 30
Ammo: 110
Total: $855

Other notes (good, bad, and ugly):
-Again, weapon has never been fired.  I do not know how to rate firearms, but I'd say it's in excellent shape, with only a few scrapes/blemishes/mars/whatever, from storing, handling, and disassemble/reassembly.
-The mods I did were solely for functionality, and I never got around to cleaning them up.  The rails are mounted with epoxy, and are never coming off...they are on there solidly!  I roughed up and then washed the polymer furniture before mounting, and didn't skimp on the epoxy.  I meant to clean up, polish, and paint the seams, but never got around to it, so you can see some epoxy beads where the rails join the hand-guards.  I had to remove over 1/8"" from the insides of the rail guides on the Blackhawk! hand-guard to get it to cycle smoothly without rubbing the heat-shield, and i removed 1"" of the rear-end of the hand guard so that it would work with the side saddle installed.  I didn't polish or paint when done, just smoothed it out.  One of the below-pictures shows the final job.  Pump is incredibly smooth and function is flawless; also, everything fits like a glove! 
-The best thing about the Blackhawk! hand-guard is that it is large enough to mount a light, hold the grip comfortably, and work the pump without an issue.  Thanks to modification, this is about the only extended handguard out there that allows you to use a 6-shell sidesaddle!
-ALL ORIGINAL PARTS/HARDWEAR WILL BE INCLUDED!  Pins, nuts, bolts, wrenches, etc.  Will also include a basic cleaning kit.

168,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1125168,For Sale:  Huntertown Guardian 22 LR suppressor,"Ellisville, MS, Hattiesburg, Mississippi",$ 199,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 13, 2014",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale to Mississippi residents only.  Low price point. Great suppression.

The suppressor that launched a company. The Guardian 22 was the first suppressor in the Huntertown Arms lineup. From its earliest inception the goal was simple - create a great quality suppressor with best-in-class suppression that could be purchased for the price of a tax stamp. You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, multi-caliber usage, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 22 has it all.

Suppression

The Guardian 22 compares favorably to suppressors costing twice as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian utilizes K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest suppressors available.

Maintenance

Just because you can take a suppressor apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable suppressors, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted an extra $50.

Even if the tool worked, you can't get the suppressor apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.

And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.

Longevity

There are several features designed into the Guardian 22 to ensure safe and enjoyable use beyond a lifetime.

Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. Our end caps are made of softer aluminum so that if there is an end cap strike, the end cap will give way causing minimal if any damage to the rest of your Guardian 22 suppressor. The affected end cap, and any damaged baffles can be easily replaced without having to replace the entire core.

Upgradability

The Guardian 22 shares the same dimensions as our Kestrel 22, a premium level, heavy duty suppressor providing best in class suppression along with unparrelled maintainence and longevity options. Your Guardian 22 can be upgraded at any time to use the Kestrel core, giving you a path to to most capable rimfire suppressor we offer.

Multi-caliber

What's your caliber of choice? 22LR? 22 WMR? 17HMR? Whatever it is, rest easy knowing your Guardian 22 was designed to handle the pressures generated.

Other Options

The Guardian 22 can be configured with a stainless steel endcap (on the muzzle attach side) and/or stainless steel blast chamber. 	Specifications

This is an Italian made rifle that is a blast to shoot and gets great reviews. It isn't a Chinese pile. 
Don't pay 600 for an M&P 15-22 with one mag. The only feature this doesn't have is an adjustable stock. But who really adjusts them anyway?

Can ship to an ffl near you. No charge for shipping.
But add 3% for credit card payments. (sorry)

I do take my ads down as soon as I sell out on a gun. So any emails asking if it is still available will be ignored. (I think they are all spam emails anyway)"

1992 Anaconda $1400


**Edit: To answer a few questions, I do not have boxes or paperwork. I do not care to collect them, I collect the guns. As far as price, it is VERY FIRM. I have had an offer of $2600 for Python alone from a dealer in Ohio. If you collect Colt you know the price of these guns and I can get more than I am asking on auction boards. I just would like to try local sale/trade first. Not trying to be a rude or short but I know what I have and their value. I’m only selling because I like my Royal blue Colts better than the STS as I get older. **"

P308 Tactical Rail Series T Rail .308/7.62x51 NATO
14.5"" Barrel With Permanently Attached Muzzle Brake (16"" Total) O/D Finish.
POF P308 rifle chambered in 308. Everything about POF is high-end, and Patriot Ordnance Factory changed the game with their revolutionary short-stroke gas piston design. This is a new in box P308 rifle in olive drab green with black Magpul furniture including the STR 7 position stock with two water-resistant battery storage tubes located on the left and right sides of the stock , MOE Grip with storage area, and MBUS flip-up sights. The gas piston settings allow you to shoot both sonic and sub-sonic ammunition without impeding the normal cycling of the weapon system. This is especially important for use with suppressors. For you snipers, they have top of the line Geissele triggers and monolithic rails to keep your optics rock-solid and more mounting options. This rifle is truly ambidextrous with safety, magazine, and bolt releases on both sides. They also feature KNS anti-walking pins.

I will sell the rifle and above items for $3,750. All factory items case, paperwork and 20 round pmag.
For additional $500, ($4,250) I will include new 3x12x40 waterproof scope, burris mount and mini shot red reflex sight. Original boxes and paper work included. Rifle/scope has been bore laser sighted. The reflex sight will help with close up targeting. Bought everything new recently and have not fired the P-308. Factory safety checked on P-308 was 2/4/2013.

For full price offer I will throw in 60 rounds of 308 winchester, PPU fmjbt,145 grain rounds.

The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard Picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year pesronal use warranty.

Taurus has expanded its popular Tracker series of revolvers with the 405.  

Taurus has made its name by producing revolvers that are both economical and innovative. Guns such as the Raging Bull and Judge opened up new potential in revolver design, power and performance. A new revolver shows that Taurus still travels that same path. The 405 is a snubnose chambered for .40 S&W.

Built on the same-size steel frame as the 992, the Taurus 405’s .40 S&W chambering and 2-inch snubnose barrel were chosen with another purpose in mind, namely, self-defense. Large-bore, snubnose revolvers have always had a small but passionate group of followers. Revolvers in that class are usually chambered for .41 Rem. Mag. or .44 Spl., but modern defensive loads in those calibers are hard to find. One could argue that greater bullet mass and increased bore diameter more than make up for outdated projectiles, but the 405 offers the big-bore enthusiast the opportunity to carry a snubnose revolver chambered for a round that’s available with the latest modern bullets.

YHM Phantom FS

Rifle is in very, very good condition. There is one or two minor scuffs on the castle nut/Sling plate but the receivers/barrel/optic, everything else looks brand new. You can rest assured this is a well built, reliable rifle.

There were 400-500 rounds put through it before I got sidetracked by another build, and in the process since then of finishing it up I've put exactly 180 more rounds through it. I put 6 mags through it of various types of ammo, from NATO green tip to Hornady plastic tip hunting rounds to several brands of standard FMJ, with no failures. Serious buyers are more than welcome to shoot it as well, I've just stopped personally putting rounds down the barrel since the ammo test to keep the round count down.

Rifle comes with a soft case and 2 windowed FDE pmags. Asking $2800 or best reasonable offer. I'm open to some negotiation/trades but any deal needs to be primarily cash to fund an upcoming project."

Hi all,
Up for sale or trade is a Brazilian Mauser reworked by the Springfield Armory. I must admit, I really don't know very much about Mausers, and even less about this one. It seems that any similar ones I can find from the Springfield armory seem to be in .308. I AM NOT SURE OF THE CALIBER OF THIS RIFLE....JUST ADDING INFORMATION I HAVE FOUND. It came to me without the bolt and will be sold that way. If you happen to know more about this rifle than I do feel free to PM some info, or have a bolt for sale that will fit, I may be interested in purchasing it for this rifle. It does have a LYMAN sight on the receiver as seen in the picture. The receiver looks to be chrome or nickel finished and it looks like Springfield painted the barrel black...almost like a powder coated finish. I realize that a price is necessary as a starting point, but I really am just looking the best cash offer or trade I can get. I guess we can start at a million dollars and just say I'm very negotiable. Looking for cash, silver, gold, other firearms or who knows...try me, I can always say no."

The subject of this review is my own Bushmaster XM-15-E2S that was made in Windham, (I got mine!). It is an A3 model with an A2 style fixed buttstock, handle sight, inch heavy barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch twist rifling, bayonet lug, birdcage flash suppressor and it came with a 30 round magazine.
This Bushmaster rifle is chambered for .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO rounds and is marked as such, so both may be safely used. I don't recommend that these rounds be used interchangeably in any firearm that is not specifically marked for both. There are many that believe that the .223 Remington and the 5.56mm NATO round are the same but in fact they are not. According to Small Arms Manufacturers Institute, Inc, (SAAMI), it is unsafe to fire 5.56mm NATO rounds in firearms chambered for .223 Remington. If you do a little Google searching around the Internet you can find the technical information related to that subject if it interests you. Be careful and only use the ammunition your firearm is designed to fire safely. new in box trade value 1600  REDACTED"

Overall, the finish is about 97% with some scratches due to handling and use on the range. It is in perfect working order but does have extraction issues with some factory and reloaded ammo (see below). I have fired about 20 rounds through the rifle and found that some ammo (notably Federal black box XM33) tends to get stuck in the chamber and requires a cleaning rod to remove. I also found that some reloads I purchased from TMI also would not extract without cleaning rod assistance. Other types of ammo, notably Summit, PMC, and Brazilian surplus, have no issues extracting.The recoil of the rifle is significant (comparable to a heavy 12 gauge load) Heavy AR-15 Hammer Spring (to reliably ignite the .50 BMG primers)Upper Receiver Details: -Bohica FAR-50 MK III upper with 36 inch fluted blued barrel, standard .50 BMG chamber, and factory Bohica muzzle break -Bohica factory steel adjustable bipod

$20.00 each  (12 available)

Magpul is pleased to announce the latest addition to the PMAG family: the PMAG 30 M3. Like its predecessors, the PMAG 30 M3 is a lightweight 5.56 x 45 NATO / .223 Remington 30-round polymer magazine for the AR15/M16 platform, but with a number of new features which improve its durability, compatibility, and overall performance for the most demanding professional shooters. By combining the knowledge gained from years of PMAG production, extensive research and development of materials and manufacturing processes, and incorporating feedback from a broad range of end-users, the PMAG 30 M3 pushes the envelope of magazine performance one step further.

The PMAG 30 M3 features a corrosion-resistant stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower, pop-off Impact/Dust Cover that snaps onto the floorplate when not in use, and easy tool-less disassembly for cleaning and maintenance. Low-profile ribs and aggressive front and rear texture provide positive control of the magazine while helping ensure compatibility with common double and triple magazine pouches. The easy to disassemble standard flared floorplate provides drop protection and aids extraction from magazine pouches, but can be replaced by a PMAG Ranger Plate for improved handling, or the new M3 Slim-line floor plate to minimize bulk (not included). A paint pen dot matrix (click here for marking guide) has been added to the bottom panel of the magazine body for easy marking by the end user for magazine identification.

Ultra-high capacity magazines keep your rifle running longer between mag changes during competition or tactical operations. These magazines meet NATO STANAG 4179 specifications and are compatible with all rifles that accept AR-15/M16/M4 magazines. Less than two standard magazines wide, so they’re easy to hold and handle with one hand. 60-round model fits most dual-mag pouches for 30-round magazines. Weight is centered under the weapon to help you maintain a normal shooting grip and stance. Seats fully loaded on a closed bolt. “Nesting” nylon followers require no lubrication and fully support the round stack to aid in reliable feeding. Cadmium coating on springs reduces friction and resists corrosion.

I've owned it for over 20 years and fired exactly 92 rounds through it. It comes with two magazines, the leather holster, two set of grips (OEM brown plastic and Pierce rubber) and an optional two 50-rd boxes of FMJ ammo. When I purchased it I paid the distributor extra for special hand select. With only very slight bluing wear at the muzzle and safety, I estimate this gun to be 98%.

This is a rare pistol as it has a fixed rear sight. Only a small amount were imported before importation was cut off. Only pistols with a very cheap, low quality adjustable rear sights were allowed to be imported afterward. This one is the real deal. The bore is chrome lined an excellent and the inside of the slide and frame shows little to no wear. The letter code shows this pistol was made in 1960.

From the web: East Germany
The Ernst Thaelman factory in Suhl, Thueringen made what are considered by some to be the finest pre-fall-of-the-Berlin Wall Makarovs. The finish is nice, the fit and machining is of quality you'd expect from a German shop, and they shoot like a dream. Almost all that came into this country had already seen service, so their quality varies by how they were treated by the person who carried them. Nonetheless, most have more holster wear than bore wear. They occasionally still pop up at dealers and at gun shows.

If you check Gunbroker.com right now, you'll find one just like mine already with one bid at $550 before shipping, not to mention the dealer fees for NICS after you get it here. So the price is firm at $495 for the pistol alone or $545 with the two boxes of ammo. But..	I will entertain trades up or down so let me know what you have. No offense intended, but no response means no interest. And I can send larger pics if desired. Thanks for looking."

924,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1125924,For Sale/Trade:  Lots of Surplus Tactical and Bug-Out Gear...,"Lacey/Olympia, Southwest Washington, Washington",$ 10,"Listed On: Saturday, February 23, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Huge lot of surplus tactical/bug-out gear up for grabs. Most items shown in photos, some are not. Priced individually or by group, but I'll give a HUGE discount if you buy the lot! See bottom of description for details.

(1) Large lot of ACU-pattern military uniforms. All uniforms are in serviceable condition, but show some fading and/or light stains, small tears, etc. They are in ""field condition"" at worst (ie, still very usable), and ""garrison"" (inspection) condition at best. Selling as a lot: No less than 5 complete sets of ACU tops and bottoms, with various (matching) sizes: M-R, L-R, L-L and M-L (R is regular, L is long). Also included are several ACU patrol caps and boonie caps. I say ""no less than 5 sets"" because there are actually several more tops and bottoms, but I haven't sorted them yet. You'll get them as well. Price is $50.00 for the lot, and I'll throw in a few pairs of desert-tan combat boots (for free) in men's 10-R and 10 1/2-R if you want them. BTW, I'm 69"" and 190 LBs with a 36"" waist, and all of these uniforms it me decently...the mediums are just right, and the larges are loose but not poncho-like.
(2) CVC liner/commo system (for tanker's helmet). If you've ever had to buy one, you know how much the Army charges for these. Comes with the liner, commo system, and detachable cable. $25.00
(3) BDU-pattern NBC/CBRN suit (jacket, trousers, suspenders). Not in sterile packaging, so issued as ""training"" uniform. Pretty thick material, similar to a canvas Dickie's or Carhart. Believe these are mediums, but may be larges (don't recall at this time). Like-new condition, and meant to be worn over clothing, so they'd be great for hunting, working around the yard/farm, or messy chores. $25.00 for the set.
(4) 2 field-knives. One is a decent sized ""hillbilly toothpick,"" and the other is a small dive knife. Dive knife is stainless, but has some build-up on it that you'll need to scrub off. Other one has a slightly bent tip, but is still very usable. $10.00 for both, and would be great for bug-out bags and heavy cutting that you don't want to wear down your favorite blade on.
(5) Really nice, very large, ACU assault pack. I'd actually call this a ""frame-less ruck sack."" It's in really good shape, holds as much (or more) than an ALICE pack, has MOLLE and ALICE attachments, 2 large side pockets, and 3 medium pockets on the face. Also has a removable internal frame (plastic sheet), and a built-in water resistant liner. Only flaw is a small section on the flap where the stitching has torn, but that's a quick and easy fix. I've carried over 100 LBs in this thing for several miles at a time along ridge lines, and it was surprisingly comfortable. Was $140.00 new. Selling for $50.00.
(6) 2 ACU pattern 3L hydration carriers with bladders. One is used, and one is new. Both are fully functional, and I'll include a new Camelbak cleaning kit with the used one. The new one is Gerber, and I believe the used one is as well. If not, it is the exact same style. I prefer these to the Camelbak ones, because they're much easier to refill. $15.00 each, or $20.00 for the pair. Also have some ACU 3L Camelbak brand hydration pouches with bladders if you're interested.
(7) MILSPEC ACH (Advanced Combat Helmet). Size Large. Comes with ACU helmet cover, band, rabbit ears, chinstrap assembly, helmet pads...100% complete. This is the original ACH, meaning it's pretty similar to the current issue, but is slightly lighter. $50.00 (not pictured)
(8) ACU-pattern sleep system. Complete 5 piece set, with 2x compression sacks, heavy bag, light bag, and waterproof bivy cover. System is either new or like-new. $100.00 (not pictured)
(9) 1 set of M-R BDUs (top and bottoms). Excellent/like-new condition. $30.00.
(10) Complete IOTV, ACU pattern (not pictured). Slightly used, but in good shape. Includes the entire vest assembly and the kidney pad. Will include the throat/neck protectors, if I can locate them. Has kevlar inserts, and includes front and back class III plates, which are commercially-available MILSPEC plates, rated for 7.62 APM2. Plates and IOTV are size Medium, and sizes for these are pretty similar, as they are adjustable. If you are of fairly average size (say M-XL top), it'll fit you. $200.00
(11) 2x BDU large sustainment pouches (for ruck) and radio pouch (similar capacity to sustainment pouches). $10.00 for the set. 
(12) All ACU: 2x large sustainment pouches, 2x med sustainment pouches, 1x 200-rd SAW pouch (great for a drop pouch, and measures 4x4 rows MOLLE), 2x 100-rd SAW (or 6x AR-15 mag) pouches), hand-held radio pouch (works as quick graw AR-15 mag pouch, too). The large and medium sustainment pouches above are designed to utilize the entire side of a MOLLE ruck: 1x L and 1x M per side. $50.00 for all.
(13) Holsters: ACU drop-leg holser that attaches to a duty belt (right-handed). Multicam ambidextrous holster that has MOLLE straps on the back. Both are designed for large sidearms. Used, but fully serviceable. $10.00 each.
(14) Multicam pouches: 2x large sustainment pouches, 1x Tactical Tailor ""possibles"" pouch, and 1x knife/gerber/pistol mag pouch. $40.00 for all.
(15) Big bag o' chemlights: Estimate 3 dozen, in varying colors, including amber, orange, red, green, and IR. Old, but still in original wrappers. $10.00 for all.
(16) WWII-era pack frame. Got this for the big pack listed above. It's a pressed frame, with a canvas backing. I replaced the original lacing with paracord, and put on a removable padded waist band. I really like this frame, because you can mount anything on it; bags, game, bundle of firewood...it's pretty handy. I seem to think I saw a 1940s date-stamp on it, but don't recall with certainty. $15.00
(17) BDU IBA shell. Size is medium. No kevlar or plates. Includes kevlar groin protector. Works as a tactical vest (MOLLE webbing), and will accept a plate from vest listed above (giving you two vests with front coverage). $30.00
(18) Tactical Tailor ""tough case,"" and hard-shell eye protection case with safety glasses. Both are ALICE and MOLLE compatible (tough case uses MOLLE straps, and eyepro case uses clips). MOLLY case painted light tan to match multicam gear.
(19) 2x water/fuel cans. Both have been used for water only. One is a MILSPEC 5-gallon can, the other is a commercial 6-gallon can. Both are tough, durable plastic. Will include an unused screw-on spout that fits all MILSPEC cans. $20.00 or the set.
(20) IFAK (Improved First Aid Kit) in desert camo or ACU (you pick). Includes 2 one-handed tourniquets, Quik Clot, and a lot more. $50.00

Now for the best part: Even though I'm not in a big rush to sell, if you want to buy the lot, I'll knock the price down to $450.00 cash/trade value. The only items I would be keeping (if I sell at that price) would be the 4 multicam pouches and one holster (you pick the one you want). Really good price, as you get one of the best bug-out bags on the market, a water-proof sleep system rated down to -40F, full protective gear, some basic survival tools (water carriers, knives, chem-lights, etc), and quite a bit of very durable clothing! I'll even throw in some cold-weather thermal tops and bottoms, a wet weather bag, 100-feet of Para-cord, and more.

Now for the terms: I won't ship. You will need to meet me in the Lacey/Olympia area. I might be willing to travel a bit for the right offer, but I value my time more than selling off a couple pouches that have been taking up trunk space in my man-cave for a couple years. Next, I have tried to represent everything listed as honestly and accurately as I can. I haven't gone through everything and written down all the sizes, but will for someone who wants to make a serious offer. This is stuff my wife and I have purchased over the years, and much of it has been swapped out for other stuff that better suits our needs. Some is military surplus from local shops, other stuff ordered online, and a few items were actually found at Value Village (the WWII pack frame and the CVC liner with cable, for instance). It's all serviceable, though. Point I'm getting at is that in several places I've said ""I think it's Medium,"" etc. I listed my size above, and I can wear either a large or a medium comfortably."

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
 (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years."
