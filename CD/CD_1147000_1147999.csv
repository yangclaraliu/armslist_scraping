I love this revolver but its not very practical for me and seeing how out of balance our country and government is it may be best to trade it in for another combat pistol.
And to be honest I prefer semi automatics to revolver anyway.

I value this gun at 650 to 725 but I will not offer cash unless you got one hell of an offer.

LWRC® M6A2 5.56 NATO 16"" Semi-Auto Rifle Flat Dark Earth

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories. The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

Nosler Ballistic Tip Hunting bullets have been trusted by hunters for nearly 25 years. They are precision made and individually inspected for the utmost quality which translates to incredible accuracy with every shot. The heavy jacket base prevents bullet deformation during firing and holds together at extreme velocities as well as a polycarbonate tip that resists deformation in the magazine and initiates expansion upon impact. The bullet's mid-section keeps it together at any velocity until impact, and a uniform, pure lead core eliminates possible imbalance and erratic flight caused by air pockets. Great for thin-skinned game like deer, antelope and sheep. This is not loaded ammunition."

The 8 inch models are very hard to come by. This one is in excellent shape with only a couple of minor handling marks. No box or paperwork.
The Colt Python is a double action handgun chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge, built on Colt's large I-frame. Pythons have a reputation for accuracy, smooth trigger pull, and a tight cylinder lock-up.
The Colt Python was first introduced in 1955 as Colt's top-of-the-line model and was originally intended to be a large-frame 38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Originally, Colt manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up for the duration of the hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity. Each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser and was the first mass-produced revolver to do so.
In October 1999, Colt Manufacturing Co. announced the termination of its production of Python revolvers. In a 2000 follow-up letter to distributors, the company cited changing market conditions and the costs of defending lawsuits, as the reasons for the discontinuation of the Python line as well as a number of other models. The Colt Custom Gun Shop continued making a limited number of Pythons on special order until 2005, when even this limited production was terminated.
The Python was originally available in two finishes: Royal Blue and Bright Nickel. The Bright Nickel model was discontinued with the introduction of the more durable satin stainless and mirror-polished Ultimate Stainless models. The stainless steel and Royal Blue finishes were offered until 2003 by Colt on the Python ""Elite"" model.
Pythons were available with 2.5-inch (6.4 cm), 3-inch (7.6 cm), 4-inch (10 cm), 6-inch (15 cm) and 8-inch (20 cm) barrels. The six-inch model was the most popular generally, and the 8-inch model was intended for hunting. A 3-inch barrel version is very collectible, although not rare. 
The Python Hunter model, with 8-inch barrel and factory-installed 2X Leupold scope, was made in 1980. The Python Hunter was the first field-ready handgun hunting package made by a major handgun manufacturer. The scope was mounted on the barrel using Redfield mounts and the gun was packaged in a Haliburton case.  It was discontinued by 1990 and briefly offered as a ""Custom Shop"" model afterward. A Python Target model was made for several years in .38 Special only, in blue and nickel finishes.
Two variants of the Python were made in small numbers by Colt. The first was the Colt Boa of 1985, a limited production .357 Magnum revolver, made for the Lew Horton Distributing Company in Massachusetts. It used a Python barrel mated to a Trooper Mk V frame. Six hundred 6-inch revolvers and 600 4-inch revolvers were made, of which 100 were matched sets. Though it resembles a Python visually, it is substantially different internally. The second was the stainless steel Colt Grizzly of 1994, another limited production .357 Magnum revolver. It used a Python barrel mated to a Colt King Cobra frame. 500 of these revolvers were manufactured, with 6-inch Magna-Ported barrels and smooth, unfluted cylinders. The ported barrel includes a bear footprint. Similar to the Grizzly was the Colt Kodiak, which was a Colt Anaconda with a Magna-Ported Barrel and an unfluted cylinder. Approximately 2000 Kodiaks were8According to Colt historian, R.L. Wilson, Colt Pythons have been collected by Elvis Presley and various kings in the traditional sense: ""H.M. (His Majesty) Hussein I of Jordan ordered a limited number of Pythons, in 4-inch and 6-inch barrels, as gifts to his selected friends. Casing and barrel were embossed with His Majesty's crest. The Python for King Juan Carlos of Spain bore his name in flush gold on the sideplate. Among other celebrated recipients: King Khalid and Prince Fahed (Saudi Arabia), King Hassan (Morocco), Sheik Zyed (United Arab Emirates), President Anwar Sadat and President Hafez Assad (Syria)."""

The highest magnification riflescope we make, the 12-42×56 provides optical resolution comparable to the highest quality spotting scopes and unsurpassed clarity across the entire magnification range. The 56mm objective is specifically designed for optimum resolution under all conditions—its resolution outstanding even at the highest magnification. In the past, accomplished long-range shooters could only wish for a scope equal to the capability of modern flat- shooting calibers. The question now becomes, does your rifle measure up to the 12-42 x 56 NXS?

This was built by HD Rifles out of Del Rio, TX.  Was ordered in 2005, I did not receive until 2007 due to inner company disputes and finally the collapse of HD Rifles (which then turned into Cactus Weapons).  Look up Cactus Weapons on the internet and see a pic of rifle.

It is built from a Remington 700 base chambered in .300WM and sits on an Accuracy International AICS chassis (retail about $900).  I believe they used a Weatherby (as opposed to Remington) 26 inch heavy barrel 1:12 twist fully free-floating.  Badger over sized bolt lug, Nightforce mount and rings, Harris bipod, and an AI muzzlebreak.  HD Rifles is stamped on the barrel.  ALL parts of this rifle are painted in a digital camo pattern which I had custom done, not as light as sand but not as dark as woodland.  Oh, and 2 mags.  THIS RIFLE HAS HAD TONS OF ACTION WORK, I will have to find the original build sheet for the proper specs, I do not want to misspeak.

I also have a Genuine Luepold (called and verified SN today) Mark 4, 4.5-14X40 that have not really decided to sell or not yet (retail $935).  It is currently attached to the weapon.

I have put less than 50 rounds through it since it was delivered to me.  I just bore-sighted it last month in prep for taking it out this spring and doing some long range shooting.

Please keep in mind I am just seeing what offers I get if any.  Not 100% dead set on unloading this rifle.

I will entertain serious offers only!  Please do not waste my time and I vow not to waste yours.
I only put $10 in asking price because there is no 'make offer' choice.

Thanks for looking!"

AccuBond represents the most advanced bonded core bullet technology to date. Through a proprietary bonding process that eliminates voids in the bullet core, AccuBond marries Nosler's traditional copper-alloy jacket with its special lead-alloy core. The result is a bullet that flies true, penetrates deep, won't cause extensive barrel fouling, and will retain 60-70% of its weight. The polymer tip helps protect against deformation while initiating expansion upon impact. This is not loaded ammunition."

The bullet that started the company, Nosler Partition Bullets feature a fully tapered jacket that ruptures instantly at the thin jacket mouth, yet the gradual thickening along the bullet's axis controls expansion and curls the jacket uniformly outward at high or low velocities. 

Nosler's integral Partition supports the expanded mushroom and retains the rear lead alloy core. The enclosed rear core retains more than half the original bullet weight for deep penetration. The special crimp locks in the rear core section, adding strength to resist deformation under the pressure of heavy magnums. This is not loaded ammunition."
