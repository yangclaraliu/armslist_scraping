The bolt is magnetic particle inspected and came with the barrel. They were headspaced to be a perfect fit for each other from the factory. This barrel and bolt have never been used or fired. I was going to use this in a build for deer hunting but I decided against it because I’ve had the rifle built for 6-months now and still have yet to find factory ammo for it in stores and I’m not really interested in reloading another caliber. Paid $450 for both the barrel and bolt about 6.5-7 months ago. I’d take $300obo cause I’d like it gone fast so I can get something else to throw on the build. The pictures are of the barrel on the rifle but this listing is just for the barrel and the bolt. I’ll include a 5-round magizine from Alexander Arms as well cause I will no longer have a use for it.

This scope was mounted on an airgun that was barely used - maybe about an hour, and is in like-new condition. There is some slight residue from the tape on the UTG rings that were used, and these are the only markings that I could find on the scope. The glass is extremely clear, and the turrets operate as they should. The magnification dial and parallax adjustment operate firmly and precisely. This would cost about $200 to purchase new. The scope is in the original box with the rings (unused), batteries, and manual included.

The hydros boast of an 18mph traveling speed and 13mph mowing speed, and the 34hp Kawasaki provides all the power you would ever need. Only selling because we're moving in a couple weeks and won't need it at our new location. You won't be disappointed with this machine! Can deliver for a fee.QUALITY WORKING LINE GERMAN SHEPHERDS - $1000These two girls were my holdbacks but we're set to move in two weeks so we're making them available to good homes. Both have medium to high drives and come from excellent working bloodlines with several imports and titles. Good hips and elbows. They are 5 months old, vet checked, up to date on shots and de-wormings, well socialized, started on house, crate, and basic obedience training, and fed a premium grain-free diet. They have been exposed to stairs, slick surfaces, noise, etc. and will be suitable for active pet or protection, work or sport, or service. You won't find better dogs for the money! Price is $1000 firm and includes full AKC registration as well as a written health guarantee/contract. Their siblings sold for $1300 so this is a steal for the two picks of the litter. Price will go up on 5/6/18 so you better take advantage of this deal while you can!

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.
The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.
Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.Feel free to email me an offer.  I will not ship, please don't ask.  Face to face ffl trasnfer in CO only!  Buyer responsible for transfer fee and background check."

It looks like there may have been some wood added between the lock and tang.  The brass saw-tooth inlay is actually applied to the top of the wood and not inletted.  The barrel is 39 ½-inches long and has a 3-screw tang.  It looks to be about a .38-caliber, give or take. I have no idea what the bore looks like.  I feel sure that the ram rod is a replacement.  The double set triggers don’t always set and the lock won’t hold. Not intended as a shooter.  Just a nice example of a southern rifle from a little recognized maker. Let me know if you need additional pictures or have questions."
