This is your SHTF type of ammo because first of all is NON corrosive ammo so the salts won’t combine with moisture and eat away your rifles internals. Second is “boxer primed” not “berdan” primed so there no risk of snapping your firing pin on your AK varient or SKS varient. Third they are sealed brass case not cheap steel case. Fourth this ammo won’t wear or rust as easily as steel case if not weather protected. Fifth brass case can be reloaded. Sixth and finally PPU shoots much cleaner than Tula or Wolf ammo so it makes for a quick clean up. If ou take care of your rifle it will take care of you. I got these for $14 + tax at Cabelas but will let them go for $12 ea or $90 for all.

It's the best looking gun I own, and my wife loves it. This is a picture I took at the range, where I was shooting a small plate at 200 yards. Quite a few people have been curious to see me shooting at 200 yards with a 22. It is pushing pretty far for the little 22lr, but this rifle and scope can do it easily, with any ammo. Of course, you'll get better results with feeding it nicer stuff. CCI standard velocity works well with this rifle and is very clean, but tends to run out of energy at longer ranges. Aguila super extra standard velocity has a bit more muzzle energy and is better for longer ranges. It's also one of the cheapest types of 22 ammo, but is has very waxy lubricant, and tends to jam up semi-autos. That's one of the benefits of a bolt action 22 - you can work with more types of ammo. Just keep the chamber clean - this is a target gun and has tight tolerances. I just brush the chamber out a bit if too much lubricant has accumulated."

The result is a truly extraordinary everyday carry knife with serious swagger. The linerless scales of this knife are meticulously machined from solid carbon fiber to create a beautiful sunburst pattern that also offers a subtle non-slip texture. They are fitted with four sets of threaded stainless steel inserts that allow the attachment of a four-position pocket clip to support all possible carry preferences. Together with the knife’s high-strength back lock mechanism and the blade’s fully accessible Trademark Round Hole™, the versatile clip makes all aspects of the knife’s carry and one-handed operation completely ambidextrous. Not to be outdone, the blade of this knife is crafted from premium CPM S90V stainless steel. This advanced particle metallurgy steel is enriched with a high vanadium content to promote the formation of hard vanadium carbides instead of chromium carbides. This enhances the steel’s wear resistance and edge retention, leaving more free chromium available to provide superior corrosion resistance.

Frame marked: made in Germany. This harder to find ""blue box"" German 9mm in excellent condition has EVERYTHING, Sig Lites, Nitron finish, DA/SA, de-horned with cockable bobbed hammer, 3 mags, 2 sets of grips (factory composites) and Sig badged hogue's, Sig branded Israeli made fobus OWB holster and matching double magazine carrier. The Sig P 239, although a little smaller (for concealment reasons) than its big brother, the P 229, also has a proven track record with numerous U.S. as well as international governmental agencies ranging from the FBI, Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE),  Dept. Homeland Security and countless other undercover agencies ranging from NCIS to Israel's clandestine elite Mossad and numerous others, especially when configured in the CCP variant. Furthermore, Sig's P 239 routinely ranks high on most lists and reviews of the best conceal carry pistols.I have had this gun in addition to another P 239 and also its big brother the P 229. My observations: the 239 is an absolute joy to shoot and has excellent weight distribution, giving the operator exceptional accuracy, a large trigger guard opening large enough to fire it with most gloves should the need arise and as seen in the photos, this oversized trigger guard which angles to the front of its aluminum frame contributes to nice weight distribution as well as making it rather comfortable in the waistband even against skin. The P 239 is slimmer and has much cleaner lines than the larger P 229. As the gun was intended for concealed carry from its prototypes day one. A very different concept from other high-end contenders, which are essentially a full-size pistol chopped down at the barrel and the bottom of the handle, which works but unfortunately sacrifices performance most all of the time. This is NOT a concern with Sigs P 239 CCP. I have numerous high-quality handguns, many in 9mm, I assure you whether you're at the range or, God forbid, a real-life scenario, the P 239 will not disappoint. Of all my pistols of this kind, only one out-performs this Sig, that gun is an HK P7 M8. The P7 M8 is a totally different animal, however. Although they are similar size-wise the HK P7 M8 costing about twice the price, the P7 M8 is a fixed-barrel steel frame ""gas gun."" Its groupings are a little tighter than the Sig but by no means are they substantially tighter and most shooters probably wouldn't see much difference on the target. And even for a great shot, the HK's tighter grouping doesn't compensate for the many advantages the Sig P 239 has over the HK. The Sig is a good bit lighter due to its alloy frame, neither have ever given me any ""FTFs"" (Failure to feed) and/or ""FTEs"" (Failure to eject). Nor are either ammo picky. The Sig is not only a good bit cleaner but also easier to clean, unlike the HK a gas gun, which are notorious for carbon build-up, (not range-friendly). In my opinion, the Sig is a much more carry-friendly pistol, because it's a lighter gun and has far more options holster-wise. If you really want to shoot an HK P7 M8, ideally you need a pair as this gun gets hotter than any pistol I've ever shot, this is also a non-issue with the Sig. Lastly, parts for a Sig P 239 can be easily located. That said, if I did not have two P 239s I would NOT sell or trade this gun especially because not only is this a fine German Sig, but this is also a full set with everything including its blank lifetime warranty paperwork. German Sigs, in general, are becoming harder and harder to come by, forget about a 9mm P 239 in pristine condition and a complete set. This Sig was my desk drawer gun and the pictures attest that it's been carried only a handful of times. Round count 5 boxes of 50 brass FMJ and 3 magazines of various PP loads while deciding which I'd use. *Note the other P 239 also 9mm has been shot 3 to 4 times more, and is now my wife's primary carry gun. The CCP variant really doesn't matter to her as the gun is kept in her purse. As for trades, I'm a bit picky as I know what I like and what I have so trades preferred: a bull-barrel high-end single-stack 1911 .45 ACP, Benelli M1 or M2, Colt revolvers and perhaps a Belgian Browning Hi-Power 9mm. I may be open to other hard to find high-quality pistols. Although not a pawn shop, I will also consider fine Swiss-made mechanical watches, diamond solitaires, solid gold and platinum jewelry, Morgan and Liberty silver dollars and various gold coins. Being a collector, I am interested in a variety of neat and cool items so feel free to message me but I'm really looking for the items above or cash. (As much of what I'm looking for is more valuable than this Sig, cash or additional trade on my end of course.)Face-to-face transactions preferred with proper ID either your CWP or driver's license, Missouri only. You must also be of legal age and lawfully able to purchase a firearm. I am not an FFL dealer, law enforcement or military. Still, verification of MO residency and a bill of sale will be completed. If you do not know whether you have a warrant for your arrest, or are unable to lawfully possess a firearm, I would advise you contact the MO Highway Patrol or your local sheriff's department for this information. Lastly, if this ad is ""POSTED"" then the gun is still available. Please do not send emails asking whether the gun is still available. I will remove the listing once it's sold. I am by no means desperate to sell nor need assistance in selling. All reasonable offers will be considered.  -Thank you"

Molded, one-piece chassis and adjustable buttstock assembly are manufactured with glass-filled nylon for strength, stiffness and stability, making a solid foundation for accuracy each and every shot. Adjustable buttstock features a flat Picatinny bag rider making it easy to affix a rear monopod. A molded-in window provides a tether point for your squeeze bag, and a metal QD pocket makes it easy to secure a sling   Quick-Fit adjustable Precision Rimfire stock allows length of pull and comb height to be quickly and easily adjusted to get proper fit over a wide range of shooter sizes, outerwear and shooting positions. Indicating marks molded into the chassis help you quickly return to a previous position.   Big-Gun bolt throw adjustment enables shooters to change from a rimfire 1-1/2'' bolt throw to a short-action centerfire 3'' bolt throw, reducing the chance of short-stroking your bolt in competition.

Oversized bolt handle for positive bolt manipulation (same as the Ruger Precision Rifle®).   15"" free-float handguard is made of hard black anodized aluminum and features Magpul® M-LOK® slots on all four sides, for improved scope clearance and easy mounting of M-LOK-compatible rails and accessories.   18"" target barrel is cold hammer-forged from 1137 alloy steel to create ultra precise rifling for excellent accuracy. Barrels can be replaced easily by a competent gunsmith using AR-style wrenches and headspace gauges.
