I need a press, powder measuring equipment, dies the whole nine yards.  So if anyone has anything, a full set or just pieces by all means please feel free to toss it my way.  

I am very interested in Hornady Presses, especially a 5 Stage press.  Those get top priority and if you have the dies that I am looking for then all the better.  If you have a press with extra dies I am afraid I am not willing to pay extra for those as I do not intend to expand my arsenal anytime soon so if you need to get rid of it altogether then I am sadly not the person unless you just want to unload the dies.

Also, please include the exact model number and type so that I can go online and learn all about your press myself so I know exactly what you have without having to yack your ear off for details.  A history of the press as well would be appreciated, how long you have had it, condition, rounds put through it, did you buy it new or used and is the warranty still in effect.  All valuable information.

I am willing to pay for shipping if you are not local so near and far offers welcome.Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.  Cell Phone is nine seven O, two seven O, nine 2 four seven.  I check email daily and multiple times unless I am at work so expect an answer the day you contact me."

Look at the photo below of the serial number.  The letters “SF” in the serial number is Wilson Combat’s designation for Special Forces.  
If you are a serial number collector, or just like very nice 1911s, I have the pistol for you!
History of this gun:
I was approached by someone at my local range in December who shared the history of the limited run of Wilson ""Cave Guns,"" which were developed for a custom order placed by our Special Forces units heading overseas. According to conversations they had with Wilson Combat, this select run with the SF prefix ended up never being delivered and went up for private sale.  I am NOT the original owner and I do NOT have the build sheet/test target.  I personally called Wilson Combat to see if they could mail me a copy of the build sheet to include with the sale of this pistol.  Wilson had a fire at their factory in 2006 and lost every piece of paper they had.  What Wilson COULD verify was that the gun was born in 2004 for the Special Forces.

This pistol has about 500 rounds down the chamber, and the finish is in fabulous condition. Please see the pictures and you'll be able to easily see the great shape the gun is in.


Included:
Streamlight TLR-1 Flashlight 
3 Wilson Combat Magazines 
Wilson Combat Bag
3 holsters I have for it.

The pistol comes with THREE 8-round Wilson magazines. Two of the Mags are new and have the bumper designed for a smaller grip size, and if you get a new bumper on there, it will work perfectly. 

The most exciting extra is a Raven Concealment custom molded holster designed for this pistol, as well as a Streamlight TLR-1 flashlight with option for an extended, threaded barrel.  These holsters take 6-8 months to receive on custom order, so this is a real steal.
There are two additional holsters I'm throwing in with this. One is an IWB, as well as a Blackhawk holster with paddle attachment.

Why am I selling? I'm trying to downsize my collection to fewer pistols. Otherwise, I love the way this baby shoots!

I really cannot answer any other questions about this pistol, as I don’t have the spec sheet from Wilson.

107,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1273107,For Sale/Trade:  REMINGTON 721 RIFLE .30-06,"westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 550,"Listed On: Saturday, March 16, 2013",Handguns,Remington,no type,no type,no type,"""F.E.P."" is actually ""R.E.P."" for Remington English Proof. Remington adopted that term simply to add a little cache to their product; their proof practices use SAAMI specs the same as everyone else. 

The history of those rifles is interesting. From 1921 up to WWII, Remington made sporting rifles (the Model 30 and variations) using Model 1917 receivers and parts left over from WWI production. They made only such parts as they had to. At the end of WWII, they decided that the M1917 ploy had about run its course. Even though they used some tricks to disguise the origin of the rifles, customers were aware that they were buying what was essentially a warmed over military rifle.

So they turned their engineers and designers, including the famous Mike Walker, loose with blank sheets of paper. The result was not one, but two rifles, the standard length 721 and the short action 722. The 722 was released with a brand new cartridge, the famous ""triple deuce"", the .222 Remington, from which came a whole slew of cartridges, including the military 5.56mm, aka the .223 Remington.

The 721/722 rifles were made to be affordable, a contrast to the Winchester 70, famed as the ""Rifleman's Rifle"" but quite expensive. The result of the desire to keep the price down was that the rifles were plain. While special treatment, even engraving and inlay, was available, the standard rifles had no checkering, trigger guards were stamped steel, and so on.

But they shot and shot well. A lot of owners wanted to upgrade, and for a while gun shops had bins full of take off stocks, replaced by better grade custom stocks. Eventually, Remington got the word and, using the same basic action, produced the Model 700, now I believe the best selling CF sporting rifle in the world.

There is a sad sidelight to the Remington success story. Winchester (Olin) was unable to admit that it was losing sales to Remington and began to focus on military surplus rifles as the source of their economic woes. So they persuaded Senator Tom Dodd, of CT, father of the current CT senator Chris Dodd, to include a ban on military surplus imports in his Gun Control Act of 1968, not hard to do after JFK was killed with a surplus rifle. In a nasty example of special interest lobbying, Winchester's attorneys even wrote that part of the law. There were hints that Dodd received more than thanks and campaign support, but nothing was ever proven.

This is an awesome item! Ruger came up with an innovative design to couple two magazines together. It comes with a rubber dust cover to prevent the intrusion of dirt and debris for the on deck magazine. Once the first 25rds. are used, all you have to do is remove the dust cover and flip the mag. over. As reliable as the standard BX-1 10-round Ruger rotary magazine. Stainless steel feed lips are designed to present cartridges into the action at a 30 degree angle for better feed reliability.

The guy walked back to the counter and told me that the last one, that I had sitting on the counter in front of me, was just sold.

I'm willing to pay a fair price for one and let someone make a little money if they were one of the guys in front of me who got either of these pistols, but I just can't pay a unreasonably high price.  They are VERY nice pistols, but not on any ban list, so they will be in stock again and won't go up in price like firearms destined to be on ban lists.  Having said that, I have a LOT of firearms I would be willing to work a trade on or I have cash in hand.  I'd strongly prefer to meet face to face in IN for the transaction.  I have a lifetime LTCH and have had a LTCH for over 30 years along with proper ID.  I just like these two commander sized pistols and would like to buy one.  Want a destined to be banned high cap brand new stainless Para Ordnance in trade? Got one of those two.  If you have one of these two pistols, hit me up and let's see if we can work a deal.  I don't care if your pistol has been shot some, but if it's scratched up or has broken parts, I won't be interested.  Hope to hear from someone soon!"

 POF P308 rifle chambered in 308. Everything about POF is high-end, and Patriot Ordnance Factory changed the game with their revolutionary short-stroke gas piston design. This is a new in box P308 rifle in olive drab green with black Magpul furniture including the STR 7 position stock with two water-resistant battery storage tubes located on the left and right sides of the stock , MOE Grip with storage area, and MBUS flip-up sights. The gas piston settings allow you to shoot both sonic and sub-sonic ammunition without impeding the normal cycling of the weapon system. This is especially important for use with suppressors. For you snipers, they have top of the line Geissele triggers and monolithic rails to keep your optics rock-solid and more mounting options. This rifle is truly ambidextrous with safety, magazine, and bolt releases on both sides. They also feature KNS anti-walking pins.

Factory safety checked on P-308 was 2/4/2013.

For full price offer I will throw in 60 rounds of 308 winchester, PPU fmjbt,145 grain rounds.

Yesterday was the deadline for legislation to be voted out of its chamber of origin.  Thanks to your hard work and relentless opposition, House Bill 1588 failed to come up for a vote on the House floor.  The fate of the so-called “universal background check” legislation and your rights came down to the wire.                               

On Tuesday, the state House of Representatives came to a halt for more than seven hours as House Democrats tried to round up enough votes to pass this anti-gun measure.  As NRA-ILA previously reported, HB 1588 could have criminalized all private sales of firearms.

HB 1588, introduced by state Representative Jamie Pederson (D-43), was nothing more than a regulatory scheme that would have created a huge burden for law-abiding citizens, been unenforceable, and ignored by criminals.  This bill was nothing more than a precursor to Universal Firearm REGISTRATION. 

Your participation in the legislative process was essential to this victory! Although your Second Amendment rights were defended in Olympia during this round, the attack on your inherent right to self-defense and right to keep and bear arms is far from over.  Gun owners and sportsmen must remain vigilant in order to preserve our freedoms!

The following anti-gun bills are also dead for this session:

House Bill 1676, introduced by state Representative Ruth Kagi (D-32), a so-called “child access prevention” bill which would have singled out the storage of firearms for criminalization under certain circumstances. 

House Bill 1703, introduced by state Representative Laurie Jinkins (D-27), would have levied an outrageous tax on all firearm and ammunition purchases to create more bureaucracy in the form of a “firearm safety” education program.

Senate Bill 5737, introduced by state Senators Ed Murray (D-43) and Jeanne Kohl-Welles (D-36), would have banned commonly owned firearms mischaracterized as “assault weapons” and magazines that hold more than ten rounds.  This extreme measure would have also allowed in-home inspections by law enforcement.

Your NRA-ILA will continue to keep you informed as this legislative session continues and draws to its adjournment.  Caution: legislative rules can always be waived, so until the legislature adjourns on April 28, we must remain vigilant."

JP rifles builds the finest tactical and three gun match rifles in the world. Period. The PSC-11 is the dual charging system with the standard top charger AND a side charging handle. Tactical end users and match shooters know over 90% of malfunctions clear via the charging handle. A side charger allows you to stay on target to charge/recharge/clear your system whether in the prone, sitting, standing, bench.. a top charger does not and in fact forces the shooter to do a contortionist routine to clear the weapon. This awesome speciman with dust cover and forward assist has a 14.5"" supermatch cryogenic lightweight contour black stainless steel 1-8 twist barrel with a pinned JPTRE2 compensator so legal at 16"" OAL, long rapid configuration modular handguard, modular rail with backer plates, 45 degree offset rail mounts with back up iron folding sights AND tritium front inserts for night use, silent captured buffer system, high performance bolt assembly, competition match trigger w/ 3.5lbs no creep release, Magpul ACS adjustable stock, textured MIAD grip kit, 2 high capacity Magpul 30 round mags and one 20 rounder, topped with the number one rated tactical end user/match scope the Leupold Mark 6 1-6x20 34mm CQBMRSS close quarter battle mid range sniper scope. At 1x works as an Aimpoint for CQB (close quarter battle) yet you can dial up to 6x for those 800 meter silhouette shots! In addition this version has a built in BDC or ballistic drop compensator for the .223 5.56mm enabling fast kill shots at longer distances. Target at 500 yards? Put the 5 on it! 800 yards put the 8 on it! This number one rated match and tactical end user scope demands the proprietary Leupold Mark 8 IMS mounting system which allows the scope to be mounted further forward with the proper comb height. Rifle with all options including the 45 degree offsets and tritium back up sights if ordered direct today from JP would be $3495.. but you would have to put 1/2 hard down (no credit cards) and wait til maybe next year til it maybe shows up! COST for the IMS mount alone is $375 and MSRP cracks $500! Leupold Mark 6 scope in stock MSRP is $2666 with the BDC reticle, certificated barrel break in, scope mount, and zero for the BDC runs $318. Custom fit three gun match laser cut hard case holds all priced at $444. IF you could put this together it would cost you approx $7247 and you could touch it next year maybe!!Note: THIS IS NOT A JP-15! The JP-15 series is their entry level rifle"

Pre-WWII Mossberg&Sons Model 44b history?,"Colorado, Colorado, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, March 16, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have recently received a Mossberg&Sons Model 44b in mint condition that does not have a Serial Number stamp, only the ""Mossberg&Sons m44b"" on the forward top portion of the barrel ""no US stamp"" and a hand stamped ""Q"" on the underside of the barrel just forward of the receiver. 
The rifle also sports what I can guess is the original Mossberg&Sons 4 aperture peep sight ""that does not interfere with the removal of the bolt"". Has a Lyman non-US stamped leather & brass sling just like the ""US Property stamped"" slings found on the M1 in WWII. I have a boat load of parts for this rifle as well including just about every type of sight ""that I can tell"" made for this gun both peeps & posts. the other interesting part is that there are signs of hand tooling between the trigger and bolt guide post and compared to several other M44b's I have handled the action is flawless and requires almost no effort to work.

Is there anyone out there who is still alive who may know about these early guns? I would most certainly appriciate any help in determining the origin and year of manufacture of this beautiful rifle! I can also provide high quality photos of any part of the rifle that may help in this search.
I thank you for your time taken to read and furthermore anyone who can help me track this history!

The history that I know of is that this rifle was used pre-WWII in Boy Scout Competition shooting teams as well as during and after WWII in the US Army Competition shooting teams. The man who owned the gun was a brilliant patent designer holding many patents for tools and equipment during and after WWII."

Factory description: The Saiga-12 IZSL- 433 is a 030-type semi-automatic shotgun based on the famous design of standard Saiga IZ-109. The shotgun is equipped with a magazine guide (magwell) and an automatic last round bolt hold open device in order to help facilitate easy reloads and insertion of the magazine. It also has a self regulating gas system, which is unique from all other Siaga-12 shotguns. The top cover features a Picatinny rail on top allowing various optical devices to be attached to aid in sighting. The top cover is also hinged to the rear sight block in order to provide the top-mounted Picatinny rail with the ability to hold zero. An adjustable rear notched sight and front sight post are also standard on the shotgun to assist in accurate firing when no optical device is affixed.

2) Browning Citori or Winchester Model 101 Shotguns (I will give you additional cash, of course)
3) 7.5x55 ammo
4) Eddystone M1917s
5) Possible other milsurp rifles

That's pretty much it. Let me know what you've got, the worst I can do is say ""no thanks.""

Also, be advised that these pics are REPRESENTATIVE. The spam cans I have are still in their cardboard boxes from when I bought them for my AR months ago.

For the people who've been asking, NO. You can't have 'em BOTH for $275. Nice try though. The price is EACH."

I am looking for a general hunting lease for myself, my wife, and one occasional guest near Lawton (30-40 mi). I would also entertain purchasing a parcel of good hunting land.  My preference is to lease.
I am a local doctor, responsible, non-drinker, non-smoker, raised in the country, very experienced hunter. I have the highest respect for landowner rules and private property. Safety conscious.  Can provide references from several well known local figures and families in the area. Please email me through the site and I will respond in kind.

My primary interest is everything besides deer. I wouldn't mind taking a cull or a doe for meat but I would rather hunt trophies with a camera. I would also like to shoot an Elk someday if possible.  I am not a trophy hunter.  I like the sport and like wild game on the dinner table.

Would also consider trading services for a family who could use a good primary care doctor.

Thank you for your consideration."

I have for sale brand new in the box Colt M4 LE 6920 LE carbine chambered in 5.56mm/.223 This is identical to the M4 used by the US armed forces with just one exception; this rifle only fires semi-automatic . All the internals and components are the same as the US Government rifles, the only difference being semi auto v. select fire. This is the rifle Colt markets to law enforcement agencies across the world. Again, this is a true Mil Spec rifle, not a civilian knock off AR. The rifle is absolutely brand new and was only taken out of the box to take the pictures. The rifle has never been fired and comes with TWO factory Magpul 30 round magazineS, rear flip up sight, fore grip, box, papers, and all accessories from the factory. Simply put, the LE6920MP series delivers the high performance you’d expect from Colt with the accessories you want from Magpul. Now that’s a powerful combination.

Throughout the world today, Colt’s reliability, performance, and accuracy provide our Armed Forces the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt’s new LE6920MP-B shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel. With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip, MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine.

THESE ARE SELLING ON GUNSAMERICA FOR $1995-2400. (without the 200 rounds of ammo and the extra 30 round Magpul) KEEP YOUR MONEY IN NEVADA. PRIVATE SALE TO NEVADA RESIDENTS THAT CAN LEGALLY PURCHASE FIREARMS. WILL ONLY SHIP OUT OF STATE TO AN FFL."
