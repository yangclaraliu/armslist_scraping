Used very little for a Block II clone, shot enough to zero Irons and Eotech I would say probably 60 m193 and 40 m855 rounds down the tube. It has been finished with flat black norell's moly resin for a very tough finish which requires little maintenance and long life. The flash hider was removed and looks brand new with clean threads. Daniel Defense is quality so no reason to speak much on it other than pristine bore, M4 extension, and 1:7 5.56 NATO CHF M4 profile. The Flash suppressor is amazing at both recoil mitigation, flash suppression, and is easy on the ears for the shooter and others. I have these devices mounted on several other ar's just not the extended version for sale in this thread.

I have come accross several boxes of the old Sellier & Bellot .32 with Mild Steel core. It's been banned from import, and it is not legal to own in a few states.... It will shoot thru car doors without much issue, and penetrate body armor at close range. That puts the balls back into your .32 carry pistol for sure!

This stuff is really, really rare.. I've only seen it for sell 3 times.

the frame is straight, has 2 descent tires that hold air and a spare that's flat, brakes work once they're wired back onto the harness, and the lights worked before i took them off, so the harness is fully functional.  all you'd need to do is add some decking and a $20 light kit from autozone and you could have a nice little toy hauler or flatbed trailer.  or you could do what i was going to do and build a mini-cabin, duck-blind, etc. on it and have something that's portable and handy for the outdoors.

i also have a very nice ibanez acoustic/electric guitar that i bought less than a month ago for $500.  i've only picked it up once....i have other guitars that are my main players and i haven't done anything but tune it and strum a couple songs to see how it sounded.  bought it as a backup, but i'm no longer going to play anywhere but family functions, so i don't have to have a backup guitar now.

*edit*
Some of the N-PAP rifles have received negative attention for allegedly poor conversion jobs in the mag well, and using single-stack 'thin-lipped' bolts that don't strip rounds very well from double stack magazines.  This rifle has neither of these issues. The bolt is a normal double stack shape, and the mag well does NOT have bare metal exposed or ground-down rivets.

I bought this gun brand new from Jerry's Outdoor Sports in Grand Junction.  I have the receipt still in the box along with the original Browning paperwork; I purchased the Browning BDM on 07-08-93.  I am firm on the price of $600/cash, which is what I paid; I am NOT looking to gouge anyone, if nobody wants it for that price it can sit in the safe for another 20 years.  I have sold all my 9mm's and gave all my ammo to my Dad, I am out of the 9mm business.  I have struggled to sell this one, but it's time to let her go.

I have never shot this BDM; it has been a safe queen for almost 20 years.  There is a little bit of wear from cycling the action (but NOT firing) the box has a little bit of decal wear overall I would rate it at 95% with error on the conservative side.  The new owner won't be disappointed.

More photos at request, $600/cash firm (I should be asking more). Only reply if you are legal to own a firearm and I will require a photocopy of an official Colorado state id and a signed wavier that states you are legal to own a firearm in the State of Colorado.  If you are considering buying this BDM you better buy it before it becomes more difficult than my terms above.

NOT looking for any trades at this time. Unless you have a realistic trade price on your FNH FiveseveN 5.7x28 or Browning HighWall in .454 Casull.

The 2-1/2"" barrel is ported to control muzzle flip. Combine that with the Taurus Ribber Grip, and your practice sessions at the range will be more pleasant, even with this potent load. The Model 415 holds 5 rounds and features the Taurus Security System, yoke detent and full length ejector rod.

BRAND NEW - Fail Zero EXO-TREATED NICKEL BORON AR15 Bolt Carrier Group and Hammer


“Self-Lubricating Surface Treatment Provides Smooth, Reliable Function. Drop-in bolt and carrier group has a self-lubricating surface that eliminates the need to apply oil or grease that can attract dirt, dust, unburned powder, and carbon and lead to cycling failures. Proprietary EXO-treated Nickel Boron finish produces an exceptionally hard surface that’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. Surface is actually harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off. EXO-treated Nickel Boron finish bolt/carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additional lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. Reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean, too—fouling brushes right off. Before treatment, parts are shot peened for surface uniformity and magnetic particle inspected to make sure there are no hidden flaws. Gas key is hardened to USGI specs, chrome lined to resist erosion, and comes already staked to the carrier.“

All items are brand new except two of the scopes.  Not “new with only 100 rounds through it,” or any of the other excuses people are using, but completely unused and ready for you to break in, modify, or register as you wish.  Many components are still in their unopened packaging and have the warranty paperwork where applicable.

Do Not Ask:
If this is available – if you see this ad, this is still for sale
If I'll sell the ammo separately.  I know it's still hard to find ammo, but this stuff goes with these guns


The Guns:
1.  Bushmaster XM-15 (not the cheap Carbon model) with two Bushmaster 30 round mags (comes with 1 in store).  MSRP $1,391.48
2.  DPMS Panther Oracle with Magpul furniture and flip up sights (front and rear, not installed yet), Hogue pistol grip, 30 round Pmag with window, and 30 round DPMS mag.  Also includes a Magpul verticle foregrip (not installed) that attaches to the hand guard.  Base model (without Magpul extras) is around $1,000 from dealers
All rifles come with manuals, paperwork, locks, and whatever other accessories normally come with them (i.e. sling and rail risers for Bushmaster, etc).

The Accessories:
- Black Midway USA padded zippered rifle bag with room for 4 30-round mags, a velcro pocket, and a zippered pocket on the outside.  Has a carry handle and shoulder strap on the back.
- Green NCStar padded zippered rifle bag with outside pockets for 4 30-round mags covered by a velcro flap.  Has a carry handle on the side and a shoulder strap on the other.
- 4 Tapco 30-round magazines for the AR-15's
- CAA 30-round magazine
- CAA triple rail system to mount to standard AR 15 hand guard
- Laser/flashlight combination with rail mounting system and remote pressure switches.  Flashlight has a red flip-cap filter to preserve night vision.
- BSA red dot sight scope with built-in sun shade (42 mm)
- UTG CQB reticle intensified red/green dot scope sight (30 mm) (used once on one of my other rifles, but comes with battery, soft case, tool, etc)
- 4x Weaver Marksman scope with 1” rings (rings are new, scope is used and shows some wear and small spots of rust on the outside but has clean glass inside)
- 2 stacking 45 MTM ammo cans with rubber gaskets
- 2 M-16 bayonet's with leather sheathes

The Ammo (only available with purchase of a rifle!!!!):
- 600 rounds of Independence 5.56 ammunition
- 500 rounds of American Eagle AR .223 ammunition
- 60 rounds of Tulammo .223 ammunition


Everything is new except for the UTG and Weaver scopes.  If you buy the whole package I'll include a package of 20 zombie targets for free.  I prefer to sell the collection as one lot, or split the rifles up into packages, but I'm open to selling some of the stuff off individually (i.e. the extra mags as a lot, or a rifle and ammo).

I'm not looking to gouge anyone, but I am looking to get out near what this is all worth.  I can even give you itemized prices if you think this is too high and don't want to do the research yourself.  Keep in mind this is a chance to avoid sales taxes, fees, and putting down your information for the government to follow.  I'll knock a couple bucks off the individual prices if you buy the whole collection.

Face to face cash sales preferred, but I can ship the guns to your FFL dealer and the various components to you directly for an extra fee (no shipping on the ammo).  I prefer dealing with a CCW permit holder so I know you don't have a criminal record, but it's not absolutely necessary.  I'm willing to drive a little bit to meet you if you're coming from over an hour away.
