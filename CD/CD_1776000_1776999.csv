See photos for layout of the gear.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I purchased this pistol 5-6 months ago because I was expanding my pistol collection.  However, since then I realized that well....being a retired Marine (and a guy of course), I just had too much stuff.  So the pistol is in the case - never been fired.  I also wound up getting 3 brand new Sig Sauer mags (not the 3rd party types) and you know they can be expensive.  Since I'm not using this pistol I'm selling it with the addition of the extra magazines, a tactical carrying case, and the very difficult to find anymore Aguila Supermax Hyper Velocity .22 ammo (copper tipped - not lead cased) that shoots at a staggering 1700 fps (close to .22 mag).

PRICE:  $435 Cash - Please, no trades or checks considered (this saves you $125 off of what I paid for all a few short months ago).  Please don't text or email me asking to trade.  I'm trying to thin out my collection - not trade for something else.

TERMS:  Although the NC Legislature has just signed off on no longer having to obtain a permit for pistol sales, until it's signed into law, the purchaser will still need to have a pistol permit or a concealed carry permit in order for this deal to go through (making it legal of course).

CONTACT:  I reside in Fuquay Varina, which is 30 minutes south of Raleigh.  You can respond to this listing, or better yet - if you're serious, you call me on my mobile anytime between 9 AM and 10 PM daily - REDACTED.  Ask for Ben.

The upper is a flat top with front sight post (see picture.) Includes a black Magpul MBUS flip-up rear sight.  Less than 200 rounds through it.  Upper is an aluminum receiver, not the plastic that you normally see.  This is NOT a conversion unit, meaning this upper was meant for .22LR, and the barrel has the proper 1x16 twist to stabilize the .22LR cartridge.

The lower is an Aero Precision Lower Receiver. This lower has always been used with this upper, so only 200 rounds.  It is NOT a ""blemish"" model.  Also, this is a standard lower receiver, meaning you can pair it with any standard AR-15 upper in a different caliber and it will work just fine.  It does NOT have to be used only with a .22LR upper, as many of the .22 rifles do.

Lower comes with a Gen 2 Falcon Ergo Grip, black Magpul CTR stock, and a JP Enterprises 3.5 trigger spring.  Buffer tube kit is an ATI mil-spec.

Magazines I believe are Black Dog.  One is a 10 round, two 15 rounds, and two 25 rounds.

Two notes-it comes equipped with the standard bolt catch, but I've found that it doesn't do a great job with the .22LR bolt. The bolt does lock back on an empty mag, but the bolt catch doesn't engage.  Not really a big deal, and with a standard 5.56 upper, it will work just fine. It also comes with a dust cover that I couldn't get to stay closed.  To me these are minor issues.  I am selling the gun because I could use the money right now."

I thought I had it traded so I pulled the ad but it didn't work out.(twice). Third time's a charm I hope, lol.

What I have is a nice clean New England SB2 Handi Rifle in 30-30 WIN that I took in on a trade. I am more into milsurp rifles so decided not to keep this. 
It is set up left handed with a butt stock cartridge sleeve, hammer thumb extension, Uncle Mike's Sling w/QD swivels, and a Tasco World Class 4-16x40 scope w/Front AO and Butler Creek flip up lens covers mounted with Weaver Quad-lock medium rings. The scope is basically new. I bought it to mount on my 22 for 100yds target shooting but ended up with a sweet 22 instead on it so put the Tasco on here after selling the cheaper 3-9 that was on it before.
Anyway, for a cash sale I want $280 as you see it. I am willing to negotiate on price by removing accessories off the rifle.

Call, text or reply. If emailing or texting expect me to call you back because I really prefer to talk to someone instead of messaging back and forth. If you can't take a call right away then let me know and if emailing give your name and number so I can call back or I won't respond. Thanks for looking."

MARKED DOWN FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND!!

I HAVE TWO OF THESE TO SELL!!

Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.

Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in Black and Camo finishs. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

THIS IS A CASH/EQUIVALENT PRICE - CREDIT CARD ORDERS WILL INCUR A SLIGHT ADDITIONAL COST TO OFFSET BANK FEES.

SELLER IS AN FFL HOLDER SO BUYER WILL NEED TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK.

It has 5 mags 2 are 9 rounders with the pinky extensions and 1 glock 23 12 rounder brand new never used. The two flat based short mags are actually glock 26 9mm mags bc I was going to get a conversion 9barrel and never did. I know what your thinking well those are worthless, HOWEVER they do feed and function properly using 40sw rounds..I know it sounds crazy but they work fine I've function check them thoroughly enough to trust them and range tested them a couple times. I'm asking 600 firm with the night sights all mags and everything included..REDACTED pick up in franklin tn or meet close by. Text any offers for quick response.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano's sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

Product Details:
This is a .30 Caliber WWII M-1 carbine that is literally right off the boat! A GI brought it home from the war and put it under his bed where it sat for years. It was found by his son at which point it was sold to the current owner whom has had it meticulously stored ever since. It is in excellent original condition with early features. Made by Inland Division of General Motors, the barrel is dated 12-43 and the serial number is 4896514. The overall metal condition is excellent and all markings are correct throughout. It has the typical early flat bolt, a push-button safety and flip-style peep sight. There are a few imperfections in the wood around the grip and rear sling, but nothing excessive especially considering the age of the piece. If you are looking for an authentic early WWII M1 carbine, this is a great find!

PLR-16
The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It’s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. The estimated retail price for the MP5 A5 is $475.
Operation

The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety switch rotates in the same manner as the 9 mm M"
