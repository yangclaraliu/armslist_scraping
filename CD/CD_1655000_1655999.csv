I have 1 box 25 auto 35grain xtp hollow point that cost $40 before all this crazy gun stuff going on. I also have around 80 cci blazer loads non reloadable rounds. Than I have around 350 Winchester brass shell casing bullets factory loads. The gun has been mechanically check out and taken apart and cleaned. The gun shoots and fires like brand new. I believe some of these guns were carried during WW1 the guy I got it from said his grandpa brought it back after the war. It was handed down through his family and than to me because his sons are anti guns. Might be able to come down some on price for a serious person interested in it?

Up for consideration is a HK93 clone build from a parts kit by parabellum combat systems. The Barrel is a HK 93/33 Cold Hammer Forged Barrel by RCM man from hkparts.net. The barrel specs are.
Specifics
•Overall Length - 16.1 inches 
•Chambered - 5.56 NATO (.223) 
•1/7 twist 
•Fully Fluted Chamber - To HK German Specifications
 It has 350 rounds through it and is the best barrel you can put on any 93 build. Installed on it is a PWS compensator that works very well with this rifle. Down the rifle we have a new charging handle lever and spring from hkparts.net as well. The grip is a correct steel hk93 lower with a POF black grip from robertrtg.com The trigger is a nice tight 4 pound trigger pull done by a gunsmith.  The butt stock is a  a2 style stock original hk. This rifle comes with 5 aluminum 40 round magazines (1 is beat up the other 4 are almost mint) and 2 hk steel 25 rounders in used condition. The rifle will also come with a side folding stock with a buffer put in place. Again the rifle is in great shape besides the minor scratches from a mount that was on it and the original forearm that has some nicks. The rifles bolt gap is at .22 so has plenty plenty of life left againt with only 350 rounds through it."

346,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1655346,For Sale:  Colt series MK IV series 80 upper on a size 70,"washington, Southwest Washington, Washington",$ 800,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 22, 2013",Shotguns,no type,no type,no type,Shotgun,"The slide is a Colt Officers ACP with a 3&1/2 inch barrel. Because the slide is so short there was no room for the bushing to go when the slide went back. Therefore a larger bushing was made that slips over the barrel lugs during recoil, and the barrel diameter was belled to match. Another reason is with the shorter slide and barrel, the barrel angle would be too steep for the slide to function properly during recoil. A straight barrel would wedge the slide back during recoil. The shape of the bell keeps the barrel angled properly for slide function, and then realigns the barrel to the slide as the slide closes; there is a considerable amount of torque in a barrel and this is more evident in a short barrel. This barrel is beautifully bright. The ejection port is opened way out for trouble free ejection. Why put a series 80 on a frame size 70. A challenge I would say. A single action with polished receiver and trigger job. The grip is surrounded with a molded rubber grip sides and front. Rubber checkered easy grip under the grip safety. This is built on a series 70 size Federal Ordinance Frame.( mostly known for the VietNam era M-14) The safety is left side with a high grip safety. It took alot of time and work to make this series 80 fit atop a basically series 70. But it works and it works well. Easily concealed, plenty of knock down power."

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

I need to sell my Armory USA AK-74M. The rifle has Plum Furniture, fixed stock, and is 100% 922R Compliant.

Rifle is from Bulgarian kit with matching serial numbers on everything but the US Made Receiver. Tapco G3 Trigger Group, issue cleaning kit in stock etc.

I am including 1 Plum Ishmash Magazine and 5 Bulgy Circle 10 Mags. Also included are two sight adjustment tools (Tapco & Arsenal), DDR Mag pouch & Rifle Sling, cheap Midway USA OD Green Assault Case.

Last but not least, I have 480 rounds of Russian 5.45x39 surplus remaining from the spam can. I would prefer to keep this as one package sale even though the ammo has been posted separately.

Suffice it to say this rifle is not/was not a safe queen, but she was well cared for and with the exception of the few paint scratches, is in perfect running condition. NO RUST! This is a ""Quality"" AK not your WASR or Century Arms type, and would be a bargain in this package before the hysteria.

Asking $850 cash/money order/cashiers check from Wisconsin Residents only. In order to ensure this will  not fall into the wrong hands, a bill of sale will be completed for the purchase and I will discount further if you are a LEO or possess a Wisconsin CCW permit."

It is in immaculate condition with under 300 rounds fired through it. I bought it for my wife, but it was still too big for her to carry, so we opted for a smaller .380.

It is a wonderfully shooting gun. It has run flawlessly from the start, but was sent in to Springfield to feed smoother. It has had the following work done by Springfield: new barrel link, steel firing pin to replace the titanium (more reliable), pinned ejector, reamed barrel and polished feed ramp. I am very, very picky about my 1911s. This is now the smoothest, most reliable 1911 I own, and I have full house custom 1911s.

This is one of the smoothest feeding, firing and ejecting 1911s I have shot. It has a 4.5 pound, crisp trigger. I have all documentation and original accessories, including Springfield work orders, original receipt.

Mostly interested in selling, but will consider trades for HK USPs and HK45s (Especially Tactical models, both fullsize and compact), or SIGs (M11, 220s, etc) I am looking for a solid suppressor host.

I will add cash to the trade if necessary. I can also add pmags, ammo, and  gear."

We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Remington’s Eye Ball R1 offers 360° vision for Homeland Security, SWAT, Narcotics, SPECOPS, EOD... virtually any tactical team. Remington’s Eye Ball R1 is a compact wireless 360° mobile display system. It can be used in tactical operations where law enforcement personnel need to see the situation before entering a building, floor or room. The Eye Ball R1 is tough enough to allow officers to roll, toss, lower or throw it as needed. It transmits streaming video and audio to a Personal Display Unit (PDU) up to two hundred yards away...

Includes two camera balls and one dummy. 
Cameras have chargers, all the works. Surveillance pad turns on but the screen isn't working right now and will need to be fixed. Thus why my asking price is so low. I've seen them for $3000 in used condition and even $500-700 for each camera alone!

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm magazines for a full 30 round capacity. Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

I am asking 700 and I am a little flexible on the price or will trade for Glock 27 40 Cal or 1911. Must be willing to sign bill of sell. Please no calls after 10pm.
