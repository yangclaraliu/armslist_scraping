When they were the best damn AR-15 platform on the market, prior to selling out. Many prefer this over Colt or other higher priced AR's. This was prior to moving operations to New York - and prior to Walmart beating the quality down.

This is not the newer, cheaper $750 Walmart Bushmaster or the carbon/carbine version that others are trying to sell you for $1500. This is the sought after and more desirable weapon back when they built them tight and heavier in Windham, ME. If you are not familiar, do some research and you will quickly gain an appreciation for this weapon and why they are desirable! (Read ""HISTORY"" below).

It also reads 5.56mm-.223 on the lower, indicating you can shoot 5.56mm rounds out of this gun, unlike some of the newer uppers.
Other notable details:
- 16"" barrel.
- Flat top, optics ready.
- Larger charging handle.
- Full float aluminum forearm Tri-rail system.
- Aluminum tube with 6 position stock.
- Conformed Grip.
- CMI recoil pad.
- 30 round C- Products USGI hi-cap High capacity magazine.
- Dust Cover.
- Forward Assist.
- GG&G aluminum Sling mount.

BUSHMASTER HISTORY: In the beginning, Bushmaster Firearms International made their name as a well known maker of quality AR-15 type rifles owned by Richard Dyke. In 2006 he sold the company to Cerberus Capital Management, which in turn owned Freedom Group, which became Bushmaster's parent company that also owned other firearms manufacturer's including Remington and Marlin. Bushmaster production continued in Windham, Maine until March of 2011 when it was moved to Ilion, New York, to consolidate operations with other Freedom Group manufacturing. The facility in Windham was closed and the employees were laid off. (Source: http://www.grampasgunreviews.com/WindhamWeaponryMPC)

MARKINGS: ""B.F.I. - Windham, ME, - U.S.A."" = Bushmaster Firearms International.

SERIAL AND DATING: After contracting Bushmaster, it was determined this serial number (L223620) indicates it was made in 2001. Right in the heart of when these weapons were sought after and desired.

BARREL: 16 inch barrel with good bore and rifling. I *think* it is a 1/7 twist by other models I have viewed, but I could not find the stamp to tell you with certainty.

ACTION: Very smooth and crisp action. This was not test fired, however we did fire it with a snap cap and the trigger feels good and sounds like the hammer hit the snap cap appropriately.

This is the best information I have on this unique piece. I encourage you to do your own research or ask any questions you have. I will do our best to answer with the information we were given. Please view all pics carefully to appreciate it's condition."

I even have a real deal M9 military issue leather shoulder rig and extra mag pouches, mag and extra holster that are included in this package. 
These collector edition pistols were produced concurrently with the actual GI M9's being made at that time. They are EXACT duplicates of the USGI M9, every GI marking, assembly numbers including the hammer and proof mark (PM on the slide) is there. They also have a steel guide rod whereas the current ""civilian"" M9's are plastic. 

And unlike the current run of civillian M9's the only use of plastic in the special edition is the grips, everything else is metal like in a real M9. All of the current M9's that are produced for civilians are Model 92's stamped M9. The markings, back strap, dust cover etc are not identical to real military M9's....... unlike my pistol here. 

I only am trying to go into detail for those who may think the current civi is no different than this older special edition pistol. My M9 also has a very low serial number. So if you want a real deal M9 then this one is just about as close to a real M9 that you can get! Low serial number of 3##3 made in 97 or 98 will have to double check . Again this is NOT a current run civilian model and they only released a few thousand of these!!!!!!!"

It is MUCH NICER than the WASR-10 AK-47's, which are basically junk. This is a very very nice gun. You cannot find these anywhere nowadays, I looked all over the internet and my listing was the only one I could find of this model. I'm extremely hesitant to sell it, but I could use the money. 

It has a under folding metal butt-stock which makes it maneuverable, more concealable, and more convenient to store. It has an ergonomic pistol grip, adjustable sights, and a recoil suppressor which all make it highly accurate. If you desire you can easily remove the recoil suppressor to add a different attachment if you have one (it is not welded on, like many are). Obviously its semi-auto. These are all features they are currently trying to ban, so you won't be able to get these types of guns forever.  

The AKMS is basically an improved model of the AK but it looks just like an AK. You can find pictures of it anywhere online, this one is the exact same model you will find in a google images search. It comes with 3 30rd clips and 30 rounds.

To whoever flagged my last post, you want to actually contact me about why or you can continue to hide behind the Internet. I've sold ammo from ""flagged"" other posting to over 5 people. So how was it a scam?

This ammo was all bought back when I had 40S&W guns. Since I don't like the caliber, and have sold all my guns in 40S&W, there is no point in keeping it.  These prices are so because its what I would require to get a decent, somewhat comparable, amount of 9mm or 45 acp. 

Don't like it? Then please don't make an offer. Considering the current climate these are very reasonable prices. I'm not like most charging .75 a round."

FROM VIKING TACTICS SITE BELOW:
Unlike any sight on the market, the Revolutionary design of the Viking Sight will enhance your ability to close with and destroy the threat, day or night. The Viking Sight from Viking Tactics, Inc. features a tapered front sight that will draw you immediately to the correct aiming point. This sight is not only tapered for speed, but to help with accuracy at distance when needed. The tapered sight leads to an indestructible fiber optic that will help to drive your focus where it is needed. These sights are extremely fast. The rear sight notch has also been cut lower than normal to not only enhance speed, but to allow the shooter to see the tritium vials that have been inserted below the fiber optic. The Viking Sight will allow you to have the fine aiming point that you want and need, coupled with fiber optic to help draw your attention. If the sun goes down you are now able to use the tritium that is slightly below the fiber optic.
Tapered Front Sight; Serrated Front and Rear Sights; Fiber Optic Speed Sight; Tritium Night Sights."

I am also extremely handy with a wrench. Brakes, clutch, motor,ect. I can work on most vehicles built prior 2002 and some after. Jack of all trades just needs a rifle. Also will work for other guns.  especially a good .357, 1911, M&P shield 9mm, 12 ga. double barrel over under, or???"

The stock had decent grain, but of course had the nasty slash on the butt and a little on the forearm. Kimber apparently finished the rifles with some type of finish that had an orangish coloring mixed in. Not bad, but it certainly didn't let the grain come through. The pic showing the rifle and all parts is before the stock refinish. 

I stripped the factory finish, raised the grain, and sanded the stock to remove the cut mark. I then stained it dark walnut, and put on about 10-15 coats of tung oil. I finished it off with a steel wool buff followed by a coat of Minwax. It has a nice, satin finish. It is not perfectly smooth as you can see evidence of the grain in the finish. Unfortunately, there are a couple of minor handling marks already. 

The rifle was completely disassembled and the rust inhibitor removed from all parts. The barrel, bolt and trigger group are all rust-free and look just like they did when shipped from Kimber. The barrel has been cleaned and the trigger group disassembled, cleaned, and adjusted. There is very little creep or over travel now and the safety works perfectly. At the moment, I'd guess the trigger has an approx. 4-6 oz. pull and is set up for benchrest. For anything else, I'd suggest increasing the pull weight to 1 pound or greater. It is very easy to adjust the trigger on this rifle and factory instructions are included.

All of the documentation, tools, sights, packaging, etc. that came with the rifle will be included. I am not an FFL, so you'll have to make certain the FFL on your end will accept the shipment from me. I will need a copy of their FFL to present to UPS. Payment has to be made by USPS money order before the rifle will ship. I typically get it out via UPS ground the next day. My Ebay user is ferrarif1racefan and I have 100% feedback. I've sold a number of firearms online and have never had a single problem. 

If you have specific questions, please feel free to email me at: ferrarif1fan at hesenergy dot net. I also have plenty of other pics I'd be happy to send to you."

You can see the condition it's in from the pics. It was laying on its side somewhere before I bought it, but there is only pitting- no active rust. It's to be expected when the thing is 70 years old, is made of steel that was not heat treated, and is not finished in any way.

The reason this rifle is so unique is that it was a part of a lot that ParaOrdinance made called the TTR. It includes a piston that moves with the bolt forward so that the gun is much lower in recoil than a regular AR. The Direct Impingement Gas System, also blows the gasses back over the barrel and keeps the unit cleaner when shoveling through a dirty brand of ammo. Another benefit is that it is one of the only AR's on the market with a folding stock and is fully operational in this mode. I also have Midwest matching flip up sights with yardage settings for up to 200 yards. Price is firm, no FFL for South Dakota residents only, prefer to deal with CCW holders. I may take trades on AK 47 and cash or ammo in 223 caliber, but no other trades please. This rifle is priced right, please no lowballers."
