And choose any color!","Poulsbo, Washington, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, December 1, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"We provide coating services for all types of metal, polymer and plastic products. We can coat anything from firearms and knives, to industrial and automotive parts. If you want it coated, we can coat it. Testing Performed by an independent military approved testing facility proved that Cerakote™ is 7.5 times more wear resistant than other coatings including, but not limited to, duracoat, gunkote, parkerizing, powder coating, blueing, ion bond, etc. You can coat your items in virtually any color you want.

We also offer Micro Slick services. Cerakote™ Micro Slick is a dry-film lubricant that is able to withstand high temperatures and extreme pressures. The Micro Slick coating is able to lubricate, resist wear, and also act as an anti-seize agent while preventing galvanic corrosion or bonding of the metals. Micro Slick is virtually unaffected by temperatures ranging between 800 and 12000 degrees fahrenheit. When two adjoining surfaces are coated with Micro Slick it prevents surface-to-surface contact, which reduces friction and wear between the two surfaces. An example of this would be to coat a bolt carrier group on an AR 15 and the inside of the upper receiver. This combination would reduce the amount of friction between the parts and help the firearm to function more smoothly.

Micro Slick is generally applied, but not limited, to internal, moving parts such as bolts, bolt carrier groups, trigger groups, rails, etc. This product comes in a dark grey color only.

According to the Ruger handbook, a rare and collectable combination of sights, and caliber.
It does have some wear from the previous owner, but is still in about 98% quality. Only scratches in the wood are just in the finish. Blue-ing is beautiful.

I have the Ruger custom scope rings, if you prefer taking your game at a distance, leather sling, recoil absorber, hard case, and a 9 round sleeve, for quick follow up shots. Though I doubt you'd need one, while firing one of the 19 500gr, 5,000+ft/lbs rounds that I have.

The round puts out over 4/3 as much power as the 7mm Magnum, and is good for any game that walks this Earth. 
For hunting, you can take any game you please, as long as you have the permit.
 For home defense, it is a heavy gun, to absorb the recoil, but single shot weapons are 4 inches shorter than respective lever or bolt guns, due to not needing the action, making it shorter than an 870 shotgun. And the .458 round can shatter an elephant skull. I'm sure that it can make short work of any armor any intruder will wear.
Worried about zombies? I'm sure this will make chunky salsa out of a line of them.
Plinking? Honestly, no. At $100+ for a box of 20, you better be rich if you plan on taking this to the range every weekend. But if you reload? From what I've read, .45 ""Long"" Colt rounds will work, allowing you to shoot for much cheaper, if you're not worried about Dangerous Game.

Single action sucks? A skilled operator can use this rig just as fast as a bolt action rifle.
Also, if you see a man taking a single shot rifle out of the case, and on a hunt, it says something about him. The silence of any onlookers tells you that they know you're both a more skilled hunter, and a better marksman than any of them."

The exact meaning of the chamber markings are disputed. Refer to this explanation from a referance book:

""There have been several theories put forth as to the origins of these lugers with no real discernable explanation. In all there were three theories: 1) the ""K.I."" markings actually stood for ""Kadet Institute"", which was an early ""SA"" or ""SS"" officer's training school. That theory was discounted as no early training schools could be identified; 2) was that these were actually Concentration Camp Guard's pistols and that the ""KI"" is actually ""K.L."" and stands for ""Konzentration Lager""; 3) the most recent theory, which seems to be the most plausible, is that the ""K.I./1933"" actually refers to some rework facility or factory responsible for rebuilding/overhauling left over WWI Lugers that were intended to be issued to early Reischeer Pioneer units or even early ""Police or SS"" units. The last theory could be plausible as all noted example have been from different manufacturers and have shown various rework proofs mark, mostly likely associated with the Simson & Co, who was responsible for reworking all Weimar era luger pistol from 1924-1930.""

Over all condition is excellent, no mechanical issues. The pistol is matching, and all correct details are in place. Even though the markings are disputed, there is no dening the rarity of this pistol"

Case colored wide grooved trigger & a checkered target hammer both boasting strong colors. The blue shows no wear & shines brightly with the only flaw being a slight cylinder ring & a very small handling mark at the muzzle. It is deep & rich, bright & shiny. The wood grips are checkered with nice grain & finish & the checkering is still razor sharp. Mechanically like new as is the bore, the past owner claims to have only fired a box or so through it. This is built on a medium sized frame & looks just like a Smith & Wesson. It is well balanced, nice trigger pull, is dead accurate & a pleasure to shoot as a single action or double action. A nice revolver that can shoot the powerful .357 magnum round or the inexpensive .38 Special. Nothing to explain away, it is as new as a used pistol can get & it is hard to beat the Taurus Lifetime warrantee. See the pics; we show it all so you know exactly what you are bidding on, nothing hidden & NO surprises."

COMES WITH 1 X 10 ROUND CLIP.

This handgun began as a joint-venture between Colt and CZ, with Colt's one requirement being that the finished product must retain outward similarity to the 1911. However, any similarity between the 1911 and 40B end with the externals. In actually, the internal workings of the 40B are adapted from the CZ 75 line of pistols. The CZ 40B sports a lightweight alloy frame with an all steel slide. As opposed to the 1911 and most other western firearms, the 40B's slide rides inside the frame which helps to increase both reliability and accuracy. The standard magazines hold 10+1 rounds of .40 S&W in a double column design, although higher capacity aftermarket magazines for other CZ pistols are reported to function in the 40B. The pistol is finished with a black polymer coat which is supposed to be more durable than standard bluing during normal service usage.

The 7.62×54mmR is a rimmed rifle cartridge developed by the Russian Empire and was introduced as a service cartridge in 1891. Originally designed for the bolt-action Mosin–Nagant rifle, it was used during the late Tsarist era and throughout the Soviet period to the present day. The cartridge remains one of the few standard issue rimmed cartridges still in military use and has the longest service life of all military issued cartridges in the world.[4]

The American Winchester Model 1895 was also chambered for this cartridge per a contract with the Russian government. The 7.62×54mmR is still in use by the Russian military in the Dragunov and other sniper rifles, as well as some modern machine guns like the PKM. Originally, the round was designated as ""Трехлинейный патрон образца 1891 года"" - (Three-line cartridge model of 1891). It then became widely known under the designation ""7,62мм винтовочный патрон"" (7,62mm rifle cartridge). The round has erroneously come to be known as the ""7.62mm Russian"" (and is still often referred to as such colloquially), but, according to new standards, the ""R"" in the modern official C.I.P. designation (7.62 × 54 R) stands for Rimmed, in line with standard C.I.P. designations. The name is sometimes confused with the ""7.62 Soviet"" round, which refers to the 7.62×39mm cartridge used in the SKS and AK-based (AK-47) rifles."

Myth No. 1: A gun in the home is more likely to kill a family member than an intruder.
This is probably the most widely circulated gun control myth ever. It’s been argued that a gun in the home is 43 times more likely to kill a family than an intruder. You’re actually safer, argue anti-gun folks, in a gun-free home. That may help them sleep at night, but it isn’t true.

Despite this myth’s popularity, have you ever noticed politicians and journalists never cite a source to go along with it? Perhaps that’s because it’s derived from a seriously flawed 1986 report in the New England Journal of Medicine, “Protection or Peril?: An Analysis of Firearm-Related Deaths in the Home.”

Most notably, the study only accounted for cases of self-defense with firearms in which the criminal was killed. If the bad guy was wounded, held at gunpoint for police or ran away, it was not included in the data. That is a rather incredible oversight since, according to Florida State criminologist Gary Kleck, criminals are only shot dead in about 1 percent of firearm-defense incidents. Fact is, according to Kleck’s exhaustive research, a gun in the home is three to five times more likely to help stop a crime than commit one.

Myth No. 2: Forty percent of guns are purchased without a background check.
In pushing for “universal” background checks, Obama has repeatedly said, “As many as 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check.” Vice President Joe Biden has also pushed the stat, and their lapdogs at The New York Times, USA Today and other media outlets have reported the stat as fact without questioning the source. As professor John Lott demonstrates, the number is actually closer to 10 percent.

To reach the 40-percent number, one must count family inheritances and gifts as “purchases.” The number is also based on a Clinton administration survey in which many respondents erroneously indicated they had not undergone a background check to buy a gun.

Myth No. 3: Fewer people own guns today.
Given the spate of gun buying over the last few years, it’s hard to believe anyone could perpetuate this myth with a straight face. According to FBI data, there have been a rather incredible 70,291,049 background checks for gun purchases since Obama took office. Gun control advocates argue it’s merely existing gun owners making all the purchasing. However, according to a 2011 Gallup poll, at least 47 percent of Americans own guns, compared to 41 percent in 1993. By most indications, gun ownership is on the rise.

Myth No. 4: Criminals obtain their weapons at gun shows.
The Brady Campaign and others have fought hard to convince us that criminals and even terrorists purchase their wares at gun shows. But what do the facts say? A Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) study from November 2001, “Firearms Use by Offenders,” found only 1 percent of criminals obtained their firearms at gun shows. An earlier BJS study found that only 1.7 percent of federal inmates made their purchases at gun shows. The numbers are backed up by a National Institute of Justice survey, which found only about 2-percent of criminals bought at gun shows.

So how do most bad guys obtain their guns? They’re forced to steal them.

Myth No. 5: People hardly ever use guns for self-defense.
If gun control advocates can convince the public that guns are rarely used for self-defense, then they can portray those who keep them for protection as misguided or paranoid. Fact is, according to a study by Kleck, guns are used up to 2.5 million times per year annually in the United States for armed self-defense. Often these incidents are unreported to the police or the media.

Why? In many cases the would-be victim draws a gun, the criminal immediately runs away and the event is never reported. Gun control advocates should keep in mind that self-defense doesn’t necessarily involve actually shooting a criminal, as this is gun owners’ last resort. There is also, of course, media bias that influences under-reporting of self-defense incidents, but we’ll save that topic for another feature.

Myth No. 6: Your gun is more likely to be used against you by an attacker.
According to Kleck’s book, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America, attackers only disarm armed citizens in fewer than 1 percent of cases. This is especially true in cases of concealed carry, because the attacker often didn’t realize the target was armed, had no plan to disarm him or her, and flees in search of easier prey. By contrast, according to U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics data, armed resistance against an attacker—especially with a firearm—is the most effective means to prevent injury, or to thwart robbery or assault. In other words, “just doing whatever the bad guy says,” is often poor advice.

Myth No. 7: We can’t trust people with concealed carry.
Those who often perpetuate this myth don’t realize their state allows concealed carry—unless the individual is a citizen of Illinois. Criminals, on the other hand, do seem to notice the freedom by which the law-abiding residents of their locale can carry guns. Research by Lott, for instance, found that when shall-issue concealed carry is introduced, there are decreases in the rates of murder by 8.5 percent, rape by 5 percent and aggravated assault by 5 percent. While some academics dispute Lott’s findings, most concede that concealed carry—at the very least—has not resulted in the “blood in the streets” predictions of anti-gun groups. In his story, “‘More Guns, Less Crime’ Thesis Rests on a Flawed Statistical Design, Scholars Argue,” author David Glenn concludes: “Mr. Lott’s research has convinced his peers of at least one point: No scholars now claim that legalizing concealed weapons causes a major increase in crime.”

Myth No. 8: Urban areas especially need gun control.
There tend to be differing views on gun control in rural areas compared to urban centers, but it is wrong to suggest—as Obama has sometimes done—that gun control can be more effective in cities. To suggest honest American citizens living in metropolitan areas cannot be trusted with Second Amendment rights is not only misguided, but in some cases, may have racial undertones.

According to research by Lott for his book, More Guns, Less Crime, when the gun rights of a given population are restored, violent crime actually goes down. This is especially true, Lott found, for high-crime urban areas and neighborhoods with large minority populations. The greatest reduction in violent crime occurs when law-abiding citizens of the population are allowed to carry concealed handguns.

Myth No. 9: Guns teach kids to be violent.
Anyone who grew up in a gun-friendly household knows firearms teach discipline and other positive attributes. But how do we quantify that when our opponents are so willing to spread mistruths?

Well, we have studies to cite. Arguably the best is, “Patterns of Adolescent Firearms Ownership and Use,” by Terence P. Thornberry, Alan J. Lizotte and James M. Tesoriero. Among other findings, the researchers found that children taught about firearms and their legitimate uses by family members have much lower rates of delinquency than children in households without guns. Additionally, R. Tonso—head of the Department of Sociology, Criminal Justice and Anthropology at the University of Evansville in Indiana—found that children introduced to guns associate them with freedom, security and recreation—not violence.

Myth No. 10: Gun control prevents crime.
We’ve saved the ultimate myth for last. Here are but a few examples of failed gun control policies in action:

    Washington, D.C.’s ban on handguns (since repealed, sort of) took effect in 1977 and the city’s murder rate tripled by the 1990’s. According to D.C.’s own police department, every firearm murder was committed with a handgun
    Chicago copied D.C.’s handgun ban in 1982 and, according to city data, within 10 years its handgun-related murders doubled.
    Maryland and California have both imposed waiting periods for gun purchases and restricted sales of handguns and semi-auto rifles. Yet according to FBI Uniform Crime Reports, their murder and robbery rates that far exceed the rest of the country.

There are plenty more cases in which gun control has backfired, even as nationwide gun ownership has increased and crime has decreased."

ALG Defense Combat Trigger - ACT

The ALG Defense ALG Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.

There is scratch on the foreend shown in the pictures.  Based on the serial number this rifle was made between 1972 and 1974.  Rifle was made in Japan.  The 9 lug bolt is smooth and the trigger breaks about 4.5 lbs.  The crown shows no nicks, with a bore light the rifling and throat seem to show very little usage.

I will be selling this gun at the end of the summer one way or the other because I will be moving out of the country in September. I just don't really have time go shooting right now as it is so i figured i would try my luck. I don't really have an asking price in mind but i'm not looking to capitalize on the recent political climate, just looking for a fair deal. I would also consider partial trades for a nice 9mm, 1911,  AK 47/74 underfolder, CZ 527 in 7.62x39 or maybe even a nice target rifle. Feel free to email me with offers and questions.

With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a red laser sight and a 150/200 Lumen-LED light module. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light. Being a modular unit, users may separately purchase a green laser module for direct replacement. The MVF-515 Red won the 2010 Academy of Excellence Award for ""Self-Defense Product of the Year"".

These are available to be shipped or picked up at our store within three days."
