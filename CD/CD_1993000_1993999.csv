The barrels have a .750"" gas block seat with a properly sized gas port and the muzzle is threaded perfectly concentric with 1/2x28 threads. These CHF barrels are made to the Mil-Spec for the M249 SAW. The Cold Hammer Forging process Work Hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves. These barrels are chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 Twist Rate. The barrel blanks are the correct Certified CMV material and they are also Hard Chrome lined to the M249 SAW Mil-Spec, which is almost twice as thick as the Hard Chrome on a Mil-Spec M4.

Its important to me to teach my wife to shoot but I live in a neighborhood and while I frequent shooting ranges, bottleneck rounds at most are not allowed.

I would consider trading everything in the pic for a nice precision long range rifle with optics. I will not trade for anything else, period.  I will not sell anything for cash, except the AK. If your offer wasn't worth all of what is pictured I would consider trading parts of this collection.  What I am looking for:  A Savage model 12 in 308 or Remington 700 tactical setup.  Optics are a plus.  I would sell the AK plus 800 rds for $1,000.

Description:

Top- Mint condition, all original, all numbers matching including stock, unissued condition Norinco SKS with bayonet and sling.  Also comes with Chinese chest rig.  This gun is immaculate and original.  Comes with 20 stripper clips.

2nd from the top- Romanian Wasr GP 10-63 AK-47- comes with 3 30 rd mags, 1 20 rd mag, and 1 5 rd mag.  Features a brand new russian red timbersmith furniture set.  Polished bolt and sling.  It is a quality build and has none of the sometimes complained about issues associated with wasrs, except for some minor mag wobble.  Gun performs excellent.  NEVER has jammed on me.  I smoothed out the action and it is fantastic.  Has the classic look, stamped 1988.

Included with SKS and AK- Almost 2000 rds of 762x39 ammo.  All russian steel case non-corrosive, FMJ- 1000 rds in ammo can and the rest in boxes (not pictured)

Third from the Top- 1929 Tula Hex receiver, Ex-dragoon Mosin Nagant 91-30 in great original condition.  All numbers matching!  It has a rare value of 4 on 762x54r.net. Bayonet included (not pictured).  Bore is bright and shinny.  Great shooter.  It was hand selected and comes in the box it shipped from the factory.  Great example of a Mosin.

Bottom- 1954 Chinese Type 53 carbine- Very good condition.  All numbers do not match but the bore is bright and shinny.  Most of the type 53s are so beat up.  The stock on this one is great.  Hardly a mark on it.  Smooth action.  Great example of a T53.  Swing out bayonet.  This is the Chinese build of the M44 carbine.

Included for the Mosins- 540 rds of 762x54r ammo.  440 rds are in a spam can and then I have 100 more rds in boxes (not all pictured)

So that's 4 rifles and about 2500 rds of ammo.

This is a great collection of rifles.  All function flawlessly and have been meticulously cared for and cleaned.  I won't let go of it easily but I am a sucker for sniper rifles.

339,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1993339,"For Sale:  Barrett M99 50 BMG, NF Scope, Spuhr Mount, Ammo","Kalispell, Montana, United States","$ 3,450","Listed On: Monday, August 19, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is the second 50 cal I’ve owned, I’ve decided to build a 338LM or NM (haven’t decided) and don’t need 2 extreme long rang rifles.  Unfortunately I can’t shoot the 50 at local long-range matches, but I can shoot a 338.  Although I will miss shooting the 50 and will surely get another at some point down the road.

I’m willing to sell this as a “ready to shoot” package, or separate out the different items.  I’m easy and willing to work with you.


Rifle:

Barrett M99 with the 29” fluted barrel.  40 rounds down the pipe, shoots very well and it has been fired out to 880 yards with great results.  Trigger breaks clean, although the pull is a bit heavy for my liking.  It breaks so clean I never messed with it, but I’m sure it can be lightened.   Rifle is in excellent condition, no marks that I can find.  This is the newer model that has the hole for a Barrett monopod.  I shot it off my tripod and Hog Saddle or off a bench with a MOA bag, so I never invested in the monopod.

Includes the fitted pelican case (and cool stickers shown), bore guide, stainless cleaning rod, stainless cleaning jag (all from AAA-Ammo).  Also includes the original Barrett 30mm rings with 1” inserts.  These rings came with the rifle from the factory, they have not been used.


Scope/Mount: 

Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 Mildot, Zero Stop, High Speed, Mil turrets.  Scope is in great condition, includes the bikini covers, sunshade, box, paperwork, etc.  I don’t know if I can find the little cleaning cloth, if I can it will also be included.

Spuhr SP3016, 0 MOA.  Also like new, this mount is perfect for this rifle.  Gives the ideal cheek weld and is very robust.


Ammo:

I will include any and all brass I can find.  As I said, this is my second 50 cal so I have more brass than what’s been fired in this rifle.  I won’t give a count of brass, because I have no idea.  I will not add any $$ to the package price for the brass, it’s a gift to the next owner.

Also included are three of the 10 round Voodoo Tactical 50 cal ammo pouches.  These are a nice way to carry ammo around since the cardboard boxes the ammo comes in are a bit flimsy (actually the boxes are sturdy, but 10 rounds of 50 is just too much for them to take).

85 rounds American Eagle XM33C, 660gr FMJ

90 rounds PMC Bronze 660gr FMJ-BT

60 rounds HSM (Hunting Shack) 647gr FMJ

10 rounds HSM 750gr AMAX Match

149 rounds 647gr Barnes TSX HP Reloads from Mike’s Ammo Depot (I’ve shot plenty of this and it is great ammo)

50 rounds API

82 rounds mil surplus 650gr Ball, factory ammo from Igman

That’s a total of 526 rounds of loaded ammo and a good mix of ammo for plinking, hunting and fun.



Pricing:

We can work out payment details, I’m fine with certified bank check (will wait for it to clear before shipping), USPS Money Orders, wire transfer.  Open to other ideas, let me know and we can work something out.

Rifle/case/Barrett rings/cleaning items:  $3450 + actual shipping & insurance

NF/Spuhr: Not for sale without rifle (I will used it on the 338 if they don’t sell with the 50)

Ammo: $1950 + actual shipping & insurance


Package deal for all shown: $7500 and we split actual shipping & insurance

Of course local pickup is also welcome, I’ll help you load it up in your rig and we can drink a beer or two while exchanging lies.

See description below. 


Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns at SHOT Show 2011 came from Mossberg in the form of their Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built on the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip.

In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories."

Shoots good and is a decent hunting, or sport shooting rifle. This rifle, for those who don't know, is the Indian reproduction of the British Lee-Enfield No.3 rifle. Rifle comes with soft camo case. Rifle dated 1968. The Lee-Enfield action is known for its speed. Though it is not a Lee-Enfield, this action is still quite rapid since it is a reproduction by the then British colony of India for military and police use. Another plus is that is shoots the .308 cartridge which can be cheaper and easier to find than the .303 British that the Enfields use. All numbers are matching on this rifle.

PF-9
The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

The PF-9 retains the best features from the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

The short-barreled variant is in fact a purely commercial one, a modification of existing No. 2's for the US market. I have concluded that a now-defunct importing firm did this conversion as a way to increase their sales. The guns are merely British Army surplus with the barrels cut off and the front sight re-positioned. But the conversion from a 5"" to a 2"" barrel is so well done that someone who comes across these rather scarce No. 2's assumes it was originally made that way.  To the best of my knowledge the conversion was done only to a small batch of the DAO guns: I've never encountered nor have I ever seen advertised a similarly-modified No. 2 with a hammer spur.
