 DHS Purchases 21.6 Million More Rounds of Ammunition

Federal agency has now acquired enough bullets to wage 30 year war

 February 7, 2013

The Department of Homeland Security is set to purchase a further 21.6 million rounds of ammunition to add to the 1.6 billion bullets it has already obtained over the course of the last 10 months alone, figures which have stoked concerns that the federal agency is preparing for civil unrest.

A solicitation posted yesterday on the Fed Bid website details how the bullets are required for the DHS Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Artesia, New Mexico.

The solicitation asks for 10 million pistol cartridge .40 caliber 165 Grain, jacketed Hollow point bullets (100 quantities of 100,000 rounds) and 10 million 9mm 115 grain jacketed hollow point bullets (100 quantities of 100,000 rounds).

The document also lists a requirement for 1.6 million pistol cartridge 9mm ball bullets (40 quantities of 40,000 rounds).

An approximation of how many rounds of ammunition the DHS has now secured over the last 10 months stands at around 1.625 billion. In March 2012, ATK announced that they had agreed to provide the DHS with a maximum of 450 million bullets over four years, a story that prompted questions about why the feds were buying ammunition in such large quantities. In September last year, the federal agency purchased a further 200 million bullets.

To put that in perspective, during the height of active battle operations in Iraq, US soldiers used 5.5 million rounds of ammunition a month. Extrapolating the figures, the DHS has purchased enough bullets over the last 10 months to wage a full scale war for almost 30 years.

Such massive quantities of ammo purchases have stoked fears that the agency is preparing for some kind of domestic unrest. In 2011, Department of Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to prepare for a mass influx of immigrants into the United States, calling for the plan to deal with the “shelter” and “processing” of large numbers of people.

The federal agency’s primary concern is now centered around thwarting “homegrown terrorism,” but information produced and used by the DHS to train its personnel routinely equates conservative political ideology with domestic extremism.

A study funded by the Department of Homeland Security that was leaked last year characterizes Americans who are “suspicious of centralized federal authority,” and “reverent of individual liberty” as “extreme right-wing” terrorists.

In August 2012, the DHS censored information relating to the amount of bullets purchased by the federal agency on behalf of Immigration & Customs Enforcement, citing an “unusual and compelling urgency” to acquire the bullets, noting that there is a shortage of bullets which is threatening a situation that could cause “substantial safety issues for the government” should law enforcement officials not be adequately armed.

As we highlighted last month, the DHS’ previous ammunition solicitation was awarded to Evian Group, an organization that was formed just five days before the announcement of the solicitation and appeared to be little more than a front organization since it didn’t have a genuine physical address, a website, or even a phone number.

While Americans are being browbeaten with rhetoric about the necessity to give up semi-automatic firearms in the name of preventing school shootings, the federal government is arming itself to the teeth with both ammunition and guns. Last September, the DHS purchased no less than 7,000 fully automatic assault rifles, labeling them “Personal Defense Weapons.”

This pistol shoots exceedingly well using std ammo like CCI Standard velocity, CCI Blazer or Remington Target. My bench tests show that it will hold the 10-Ring on the NRA 50ft target using these lower priced ammunitions.

The pistol is 98% due to some light bluing wear from the factory case.

M4 feed ramps are incorporated into the barrel extension and upper to enhance reliable feeding, while a true 5.56x45 NATO chamber ensures that both commercial and higher pressure surplus mil-spec ammunition may be safely used. The bolt and carrier both pass a thorough Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) test for guaranteed structural integrity, and the gas key is properly staked to its mil-spec bolt carrier. All steel parts feature a heavy Mil-Spec Phosphate finish for superior corrosion resistance and durability, while aluminum parts are Type III Hard Coat Anodized. 

The DDM4v7 comes equipped with the new Daniel Defense MFR 12.0 Modular Rail Handguard system for adding tactical accessories while also free floating the barrel for increased accuracy potential. With the exception of a full length, uninterrupted top rail surface that accommodates virtually any desired sighting arrangement, the MFR's body is a small diameter modular tube that will accept add-on rail sections only where the shooter needs them for accessories. This allows the handguard to remain snag-free, uncluttered and devoid of unused rail space, making for a more comfortable off-hand point of contact than full-length quad rail designs. The 12"" handguard covers a pinned, low profile gas block at the Mid-Length gas port position, offering the dual benefits of a longer sight radius and increased gas dwell time for a softer recoil impulse upon firing. This DDM4v7 upper comes complete and ready to shoot with a charging handle assembly, Daniel Defense Flash Hider, and 3 Modular Picatinny Rail Sections."

Description:
New Lancer Systems l5 AWM (Advanced Warfighter Magazine) 30rd .223/5.56 caliber magazine for AR/M16 type rifles. The L5 AWM is a hybrid magazine that combines the best features of polymer and steel magazine designs. Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

Made in Washington, DC, these mini 1911 s had an interesting history but this web site gives the background better than I can explain: http://www.star-firearms.com/firearms/guns/d/index.shtml. Made by or for Colt, Star, Iver Johnson and FI. Locked breach, adjustable rear sight, all steel consruction. Serial number CPA 023*** (Colt Pony Automatic = CPA). In the middle 1970s, Colt decided to offer a .380 auto, and chose to partner with Star. The gun (to be called the Pony) was to be assembled in the US, presumably by Colt, from a Star DK slide & associated internals, with a U.S. made frame. A fixed lanyard loop was added to increase height of the gun and the adjustable sights are typical of features added to get points for the 1968 Gun Control Act, which placed restrictions on importation of small handguns. Safety cams hammer off sear for extra protection. Mechanical condition is excellent, pictures tell the story. No operational issues, and everything works as it should. I have shot, cleaned, and lubed it, so it's tested and ready."

I read the Firearms Industry Reports yesterday, guys its not looking good and their meeting in Texas indicated that Americans are not collecting firearms, they are preparing for war.
In that report, reloading components are not a priority, primers, powder and bullets are going to ammunition, ammunition to military, then law enforcement and what is left to the civilian market.
S&W is producing only 300 handguns a day, the M&P line only, no revolvers or rifles.
Remington, Armalite at capacity, FNH will be at 100% in March, Ruger is @ 75% capacity moving to 100%, MagPul is 1,000,000 mags behind, Federal is producing a Billion rounds a week but mostly for military and government contracts, probably 9 months before it reaches the civilian market. Springfield Armory is maintaining, people are hoarding those rifles to get the market artificially up more than likely.
That said, I have some primers, I will sell no more than 2.5 cartons (2500 primers) at my cost, I will not sell them to the same person.

Beretta JMN9S15 BU9 Nano 9mm 3.07"" 6+1 Black Poly Grip/Frame

The Nano's extremely low profile, snag-free design makes it easy to carry
and draw from concealment. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis
the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is
simple to disassemble and maintain. The light, durable frame employs
thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass-reinforced
techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user-adjustable with a 1.3mm hex
wrench. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine
release button can be easily reversed. Modular structure, ergonomics and
ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The USA, the Nano frame is available in multiple colors.

I am not looking to pay the crazy prices that are listed currently ($18 to $25 a box of 50 rounds) considering when you catch them in stock at Fleet, they are $11 to $16 as they were a couple of days ago when I bought 2 boxes before they were out again.

I am not looking to clean out your stock by any means, realistically about 2, 50 (1, 100) round boxes a week give or take. However if you require more to be bought, I can do that too as I have friends that could use some too.

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol delivers concealed carry handling
with large frame firepower. The Px4 series is built around a modular
concept so these pistols can be adapted to different needs. The Px4 Storm
Sub-Compact uses a locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more
compact and lighter weight system. The stainless steel barrel requires less
maintenance and is corrosion resistant. An ambidextrous manual safety
lever, reversible magazine release button and interchangeable back straps
make shooting the Px4 Sub-Compact easy for all shooters. The light frame
employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced polymer with a milstd-1913
picatinny rail for an array of aftermarket accessories.  The Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion
and wear.

The success of the Cajun Fryer is the design of the Burner/Flue. The burner is positioned 6"" above the bottom of the oil reservoir and is at a 45 degree angle. This prevents the food batter from collecting on the burner and allows it to fall to the bottom. Since heat rises, the bottom never gets hot enough to burn or scorch the batter. This keeps the oil clean, cooking after cooking. The fryer will pay for itself in oil savings alone.

Several sizes available including 2, 4, 6, 8 1/2, 12 and 17 gallon, custom sizes available by special order.

Polymer tip ensures reliable feeding.

Lighter weight projectile  exits the bore at significantly higher muzzle velocities. Bullet has a core of very tightly packed lead pellets. On impact, the bullet fractures along manufactured stress lines in the jacket—imparting all the bullet's energy very quickly. 

 The bullet design can produce large  wounds in flesh while failing to pass through structural barriers thicker than drywall or sheet metal. These qualities make it less likely to strike unintended targets, such as family members in another room during an indoor defensive  shooting scenario. 

When projectile strikes a hard surface from which a solid bullet would glance off, it fragments into tiny, light pieces and creates much less ricochet danger.

Price is 10 dollars FIRM. Bring exact change.

The Miami Classic™ is quite possibly the most imitated shoulder holster system in the world. A direct descendant of the original shoulder system first introduced by Galco in 1970 (then the Famous Jackass Leather Company), the Miami Classic has since become the favorite of professionals worldwide. 

A key component of this patented shoulder system is its spider harness. All four points of the spider harness pivot independently and are connected by our unique clover shaped Flexalon™ swivel back plate, which is a Galco trademark. This results in a perfect fit and lasting comfort for all sizes and shapes.

This system is constructed of premium saddle leather and includes holster, harness, ammo carrier and a set of system screws. The Miami Classic is fully modular. Optional accessories and components may be purchased separately.

Harness fits chests to 52"".
