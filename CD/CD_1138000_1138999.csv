Test fire cartridges included with a date of June 2012, so it has all up to date GEN4 parts.. PLUS I also have:

2 Pearce grip extenders with no added capacity
2 Pearce grip extenders with +2 capacity (making the factory mags 12 RDS)
1 XGRIP adapter for a 15 RD magazine

The XGRIPS are for 15 and 17RD mags I have on order but haven't received yet.

WOULD PREFER CASH BUT POSSIBLE trades I might consider are another CHEAPER 9mm pistol, with you adding cash to make up the difference.....

Those are the only trades I will consider.

I understand High Capacity firearms are a valuable commodity these days but don't expect me to trade my Glock for a Hi-Point just because it holds 17 rds.   Please be realistic in your offers.  I also saw a M&P Shield at Academy for 399 this weekend but for some reason they are 5-600 used on Armslist.  To be fair.  I paid 579+tx=630 for this Glock at Academy.  Thanks for looking."

Most of them have a Harrington & Richard stamp on them, or INTERARMS, Alexandra VA. However the H&R guns have the INTERARMS, Alexandra VA as well so I am assuming they are H&R but I’m not sure. You are buying the entire lot, I will not separate it. The lot includes the following:

•	3-Topper M48 Harrington & Richardson Gun bodies
•	1-Matching Forend to the Topper M-48
•	1- Appears to be a Topper M-48 however, it does not say it on the body, it is a little different looking. It is a Harrington & Richard. Says Pat. May 14 1901 on the side.
•	1- Gun Body and Forend. Says Leader Gun Co. on the side. Says 12G on the side.  
•	4- Gun bodies. Appear to be the same. There are not many markings on them. However 2 of them have an “H” stamp as shown in the photos.
•	1- 20 Gauge body. Says Springfield manufactured by J. Stevens Arm Company
•	1- with a unique gun body. It does not have many word markings on it, however you will see in the pictures all the etching in the body. It looks to have been repaired at one time where the stock would mount.
•	11- Shotgun Bodies not many markings on them other than INTERARMS, Alexandra VA. They appear to be very similar to each other with slight differences.
•	7- forends in all some don’t fit anything I have so I don’t know what they are to. Some of them have numbers inside.
•	3- Shotgun bodies that seem to be the same. Again not many markings they do have  “ INTERARMS, Alexandra VA” on them.
•	2 metal stock butts, no stampings
•	Miscellaneous parts. 12 gauge pump body, shotgun magazine and trigger guard and some things I can’t identify.

The bolt, magazine, everything except barrel is the same as a .223/5.56, it's just a .30 caliber bullet stuffed in a .223 or .221 shell case. You can find ammo with a 110 grain bullet all the way to a subsonic 220 grain bullet. People are commonly shooting these rifles with a suppressor and subsonic rounds for extra quiet shooting. You use regular .223/5.56 magazines. 30 rds. of .30 caliber fire power. Changing the barrel to a .223/5.56 barrel will automatically put you to shooting .223/5.56. My original plan was to have an alternate .223/5.56 upper to swap back and forth. I can't keep the rifle for financial reasons, this rifle is brand new never fired (except from factory of coarse.)

Sold my M11/9 years ago. Capacity 30 rnds. This thing is ugly but it works, guaranteed. If this doesn't run in your gun you can return it for a full refund! I forget what machinegun these were made for originally but it wasn't the Cobray M11/9. Cobray did modify a batch of these same type of mags by notching the top so the stock could slide inside the frame (for the SMG) and stamped them with the Cobray snake. They are the only ones I ever found made of steel that functioned flawlessly in M11/9s without modifying the grip, etc (e.g. sten conversion) The only problem with these was that they wouldn't lock into the magwell with the stock closed. Thus everyone grinds a bit off in one place on each side to allow the stock to slide closed. I did mine with a dremel and then sprayed with bbq grill paint. It's NOT pretty but it works 100%.

One of the most popular systems ever, and for good reason. Current U.S. military issue, the versatile 2nd Generation starlight AN/PVS-4 is a workhorse! It's the choice of agencies and teams requiring state-of-the-art, high resolution vision capability at night. The AN/PVS-4 mounts on virtually any assault or sporting firearm, as well as to both video and photographic cameras for unmatched cost-effectiveness. You can use our Photo Adapter to connect it to a 35mm SLR's step-up ring, so there is no need for a costly relay lens assembly for 35mm photography. 

You can use the AN/PVS-4 with an optional relay lens unit on any C-mount video camera, using the optional Bi-Ocular eyepiece for extended visual surveillance. Take the same ""modular"" system with a Weapon Mount adapter, choose Reticle cell patterns for either .308 cal., .223 cal., or just plain cross hairs and mount it on the weapon of your choice for tactical needs. 

The AN/PVS-4's are designed to recover rapidly enough from muzzle flash to allow the user to see the round hit the target and maintain uniform image illumination during changing light levels. The projection-type Reticle is internally adjustable for Windage, Elevation, and Reticle Brightness. 


With a wide field of view, the AN/PVS-4 can detect traces of light normally unseen by the naked eye and electronically reproduces the near infrared image onto the eyepiece, with an adjustable illuminated reticle to take accurate aim. This rugged, and portable battery-powered Night Vision Device can be tripod mounted for surveillance & scanning"

No rust or damage.

The Beretta M 1951 pistol, also known as M951, had been developed as a military pistol early in 1950s by Pietro Beretta Armi SpA, Italy, and had been in use by Italian, Egyptian and Israeli forces. The production of the M951 started circa 1953 and continued until 1980, when M951 had been replaced by Beretta M92. The select-fire version of the M951, known as M951R, had been developed circa 1955 and been in limited production until early 1980s, when it was replaced by Beretta M93R.
Technically, M951 is a recoil operated, locked breech pistol. The short recoiling barrel is locked to the slide by vertically tilting locking piece under the barrel (Walther P38 style locking). The trigger is of single action type, the gun features cross-bolt safety switch at the rear of the grip. The magazine release button is located at the bottom of the grip. Magazine is single stack and holds 8 rounds.
The M951R is a select-fire version of M951, that featured longer barrel, heavier slide and extended magazine that holds 10 rounds (standard 8 rounds magazines also will fit). To achieve better control over the full-auto fire, additional front grip can be installed. M951R had been used by Italian Carabineri and some anti-terror units.
Egypt produced licensed copy of the M951 under the name ""Helwan""."

It's a Smith and Wesson Air weight double action only revolver. Made out of Aluminum and stainless steel so it has very little chance of corroding. The fixed sights are easy enough to use and is accurate.   I was able to hit the bad guy on hostage targets from 20 feet away, as long as you know how to squeeze the trigger, the double action only isn't a problem.  The trigger also lets up on weight as the shot gets closer, hard to describe but it is a much easier double action than hammered revolvers.

It was originally designed by Sweden and produced as the AG-42 Ljungman for the Swedish Army. The tooling and design were later sold to Egypt, and the Hakim was produced there during the 1950s and 1960s. The gas operated system is adjustable by use of a special tool on a valve at the front of the gas tube. The gas system is very simple direct impingement type whereby the flow of gas impacts directly on the front face of the bolt carrier, propelling it to the rear, which unlocks and moves the bolt as it does so. The U.S. M16 rifle utilizes a comparable system, except the flow of gas into the system is not adjustable and a self regulating device of the Johnson/Stoner type is built into the bolt carrier assembly.

When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal.
When BROWNELLS decided to build their own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was the first priority.

This is from their site:
""Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. 
All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions.
With stainless steel spring for best durability.
$25.50 per piece or $240 takes them all.
NO TRADES - Very FIRM price."

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine. 
When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal.
When BROWNELLS decided to build their own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was the first priority.

This is from their site:
""Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. 
All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions.
With stainless steel spring for best durability.

$25.50 per piece or $250 takes them all.
NO TRADES - Very FIRM price."

says I can't have both. This is the latest version of the Colt Gold Cup series model 05070X. From Colts site: The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950’s to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealer’s showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National Match® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard. It is your responsibility to know if you are legally allowed to own this gun in your state. I will ship fedex 2nd day air for a flat rate fee of $40. I will only ship after payment has cleared and I have verified the FFL you will use for the transfer. I accept money order. Magazines are a 7rd and an 8rd. It is stainless steel.Thank You."
