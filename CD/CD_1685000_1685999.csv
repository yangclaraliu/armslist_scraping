This is the desirable 15-round magazine Thunder 380 Plus, only 40 rounds fired through it. Cleaned and ready to go, it has a host of safety features:

1) Slide mounted manual safety and decocker that blocks the hammer
2) Magazine disconnect safety that prevents firing if a magazine is
not inserted,
3) Long double-action (DA) first trigger pull, then it remains
""cocked"" with a very light trigger pull.
4) Integral key-operated trigger lock.

Note that the safety disengages the trigger completely, and it comes in the original box from Davidson's with the original, blank warranty card so you can register it with them to take advantage of their excellent warranty. Has original trigger gaurd lock and original (separate) trigger lock key with blue Argentine flag painted on it.

Holding 15 in the magazine and one in the chamber makes this a great CC firearm."

I have not shot this on paper, but it has been reasonably accurate when shooting random stuff on the range. Ring securing top hand guard has loose tolerance and slides off easily (see pic)...this is a minor problem that a layer of tape where the ring goes will create a tight enough tolerance for it to stay on by itself..comes with a bag full of stripper clips, probably at least 20, some yugoslavian, some authentic german.

Thanks to the compact shape of the block, the rifle can be held in a super-slim line in spite of its extreme strength. The block is easy to remove for cleaning or for securing the rifle against unauthorized use. Safe, Fast Operation The K 95 is always carried uncocked, making your hunting experience as care-free as possible. The safety slide cocks the rifle smoothly and silently immediately before the shot. If you decide not to shoot you take the safety slide back noiselessly and uncock the rifle. Reloading is just as easy and silent. Fine Single-Stage Trigger The K 95 trigger enables you to fire each shot in a controlled, concentrated way. Such precision and reliability is reassuring in every possible hunting situation. Distinctive, Functional Finish The velvet black barrel surface embodies the elegance of the whole rifle. The action is anodized and coloured steel-grey. Quick and Easy Exchange of Barrels A wide selection of calibers is available. After sighting in, the interchangeable barrels will always maintain zero. Designed for the master hunter, the K 95 is the rifle of choice for those who need to stalk through difficult territories. The Blaser K 95 blends high precision with a short, light-weight design and simple, safe operation BLASER TROPHY DEALER. 1-(510) 689-1772 ALL AUCTIONS SUBJECT TO IN STORE SALES.

I am getting rid of this rifle honestly because I already have an F model with the fixed stock and 18in barrel as my DMR, and I kinda wanted to look in other directions.  My primary goal is to sell, and the price is pretty firm-ish.  This rifles MSRP is $1,915, without the optic, mount, or mags.  I know I am going to take a hit on the cost, especially on the optic, which was purchased specifically for this rifle, and is therefore pretty much brand new. 
I am willing to consider all offers, so long as they are reasonable and firearm related.  I can also ""trade up"" in the form of more mags and ammo, if the deal is right, but any changes will have to be arranged separately.  Believe me, I do get it the panic phase of stuff is over, and this is an OBO kind of event, but I have to hope I won't get totally screwed."

The PLR-22 and SU-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.

he next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Comes with numerous extras. I am selling this as a WHOLE Package only, I will not split the gun up and all that it comes with. You must buy everything. I do not need to sell it, but wouldn't mind getting back to a Kahr.

Package includes:

-MP Shield 9MM 
-N82 Tactical Holster (Top Quality holster, look them up)
-Kydex OWB Holster 
-OWB Panckage Holster 
-IWB Neoprene Holster 
-Apex Tactical Trigger Kit. Not on the gun, still in the package.
-Box, Manuals, etc.
-2 Mags

Gun has only been carried maybe 2 or 3 times. In great shape as well as all the holsters. The trigger kit is suppose to reduce the gritiness of the trigger and decrease the pull a small amount.  I am asking a FIRM $650 for the gun package. There are MP Shields going on armslist for $600 by themselves. This includes entire package with quality holsters and quality trigger kit. Please do not ask me if I will take less. $600 cash buys it, no less. You must be 21 years of age or over, Ohio citizen with valid ID, and be legally able to own a firearm. 

You must be willing to sign a Bill of Sale as well. No exceptions. All questions please contact me via email"
