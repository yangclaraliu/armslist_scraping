I have shot this 9mm ammo for many years and never had a misfire or failure to feed. It's a tad on the hot side in my opinion.
I'm not looking at the current off the charts prices when comparing the value.
 Give me a fair deal and i will reciprocate as well."

This is an original, Belgium Made, all numbers matching, excellent condition 1926 Browning A-5  16 gauge shotgun with a 37,xxx serial number. The barrel is 27 inches and has a solid raised rib with the markings, ""Browning Automatic Arms Co. Ogden Utah"", ""Browning Patent"", ""Cylinder is Special steel"", ""Made in Belgium"" and several other proof marks.  The receiver is engraved on both sides in the lower and upper areas  as well as the tang and trigger guard.  It has a ""jeweled"" stainless bolt and the safety is  on the front of the trigger guard.  The receiver is marked with ""FABRIQUE NATIONALE D'ARMES DE GUERRE HERSTEL BELIQUE"" with ""Brownings Patent Depose"" underneath.  The bluing on both the barrel and receiver is 95% + by my estimation and the walnut stock and  forearm are in exceptional condition with no cracks, dings or repairs.  The only thing on the entire gun that does not appear to be original is the butt plate, which I am guessing was replaced at some point.  This gun was very gently used when it was used at all and is in unbelievable condition for a 87 year old firearm.
The pictures do not do the gun justice and I will try to get better pictures posted and will take high definition pictures of anything specific upon request

Again, this is an Original  Pre-World War II , Pre-Sweet Sixteen , Made in 1926, Matching Serial Numbers, Belgium Browning A-5 16 Gauge in fantastic condition with a 37,xxx serial number, making it one of the first 40,000 A-5's ever produced!
Although this gun is not ""Mint"" nor in ""flawless"" condition, it is certainly the finest example of an early Browning A-5 that I have ever seen and if there is a better one out there I would love to see it !"

Here is what sets this AR apart from the rest.

In addition to the rigid quality controls of manufacturing, the feature that sets the Anderson AM15 Rifles apart from the masses is the proprietary RF85treatment allowing Anderson weapon systems to operate efficiently without “Wet” lubricant. In a coefficient friction test performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the reduction of friction on all steel surfaces was reduced by 85%— without traditional “wet” lubricant, hence the name RF85. An RF-85 treated weapon cycles faster and more reliably, operates at cooler temperatures, experiences significantly less wear and, without traditional “WET” lubricant, doesn’t experience failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action.

Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive X-Frame, and was the basis for the Model 500, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. What followed was a Model 500, strong enough for the biggest game, yet easy to carry.

It is only about 2 months old and had less than 20 rounds passed through.  It includes both the 9rnd magazine and the 15rnd magazine that came with the gun.  I have the case and all original documents including the manual and original bill of sale.  I paid $470 for the gun.  This gun is a good choice for either concealed carry or home defence.  It currently has a Crimson Trace Laser Guard mounted on it.  It activates with a very light pressure of the middle finger.  It can be easily removed.  The laser cost $200 by itself and is newer than the gun.  I will no longer have any need for the ammo I purchased for this gun.  I am including over 600 rounds of Blazer Brass, Winchester, and Fiocchi 40 S&W worth $300.  All the ammo is regular ball ammo.  Considering shortages in ammo lately, this combination of gun, ammo, and accesories is a good deal.  Consider also the potential/pending ban on magazines with capacity of more than 10 rounds.  Guns with high capacity magazines are being purchased quickly and are difficult to find in some areas.

The reason I am selling this gun is because I have opted to carry a different gun and I honestly do not need it.  I don't use it.  Everything is in perfect condition.  Altogether I paid about $970 for everything.  I am asking $800 which is reasonable considering everything is like new and only a couple months old.  I am willing to negotiate and can sweeten the deal.

It has two Grease Gun Lower Receivers (shown below) and the factory lower.  One of the Grease Gun lowers is aluminum and the other is polymer (like the factory USC lower).

I have never shot it and I am selling to fund other projects.

I have had a few people ask me so I will add this into the for sale ad. These lowers and conversion kits require minimal, if any, fitting. Mine are pretty much drop in. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask.




I know the process of selling a firearm over state lines and if needed I can ship to your FFL from my FFL for the cost of my transfer (I will pay shipping...).  So this is a deal that extends beyond Texas.

Methods of payment are Paypal, Certified Cashiers Check, or Cash for face to face, and can be discussed further in email.

I am asking $2,650 OR BEST REASONABLE OFFER shipped to your FFL for this new set up. This is a good price since these range from (with less accessories) $2,500-$4,000+....

I am pretty firm in the price. Reasonable offers will be considered and though it is not preferable, I am open to trades...

750,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1252750,For Sale:  Kahr CM40,"Miami, OK, Oklahoma, United States",$ 449,"Listed On: Monday, September 23, 2013",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Kahr CM40 

The CM Series, which debuted in spring 2011 with the CM9, takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel, 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel.

The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1"" barrel and an overall length of 5.47"", with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses.

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today:
- The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds.
- Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design.
- Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

Testing the waters on selling/trading my Makarov. This is an extremely accurate and reliable weapon, perfect for concealed carry or a great .380 range pistol. The weapon is in excellent condition and comes with 3 factory magazines. Most Maks fire the 9x18mm round, this model is chambered for the more common and easier-to-find .380ACP.  Most of the ones you see these days only come with 2, and mags are pretty hard to find. Also includes a Fobus paddle holster. Cash price is $400 OBO, but please keep the offers reasonable. I do not need to sell this, and low ball offers will be ignored. Cash is king, but I would also be interested in trades. All transactions are face to face only in the Indianapolis area. I am not willing to ship the firearm. Will need to see Indiana ID, and you may not buy or trade if you are a prohibited person. My ONLY trade interests are as follows, in order of prevalence:"

Also included is a Blackhawk Serpa concealed carry holster (both belt and paddle attachments included).

HORNADY XTP BULLETS WERE DESIGNED FOR HUNTING, SELF-DEFENSE, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE XTP BULLET IS RELIABLE PERFORMANCE, IT FEATURES CONTROLLED EXPANSION WHERE SIX SERRATIONS DIVIDE THE BULLET INTO SIX SYMMETRICAL SECTIONS. THESE SECTIONS WEAKEN THE JACKET TO ALLOW CONTROLLED EXPANSION AT LOW VELOCITIES AND ENSURES FRAGMENTATION DOES NOT OCCUR AT HIGH VELOCITIES. THE XTP BULLET IS REALLY KNOWN FOR ITS STOPPING POWER. THEY WERE DESIGNED FROM THE BEGINNING TO EXPAND RELIABLY AT A VARIETY OF HANDGUN VELOCITIES AND DELIVER DEEP, TERMINAL PENETRATION WITH EVERY SHOT. MOST HANDGUN BULLETS ARE DESIGNED TO PERFORM AT A SINGLE FACTORY-SPECIFIED VELOCITY WHERE THE XTP BULLET IS DESIGNED TO OFFER CONTROLLED EXPANSION OVER A RANGE OF VELOCITIES.

EACH XTP BULLET HAS A SWAGED CORE AND DRAWN COPPER JACKET TO ENSURE UNIFORM EXPANSION AND IN-FLIGHT STABILITY. ADDING A CANNELURE TO THIS BULLET KEEPS THE CORE AND THE JACKET LOCKED TOGETHER WHILE ALSO ALLOWING THE CARTRIDGE CASE TO TIGHTLY CRIMP, ADDING SECURITY AT HIGH VELOCITIES. THIS IS NOT LOADED AMMUNITION.

It's hard to find ANY brass cased 7.62. The ammo itself is worth $250 for the 300 rounds. Also comes with original Norinco sling and a UTG quad rail system with spacers to ensure fit. I have more pictures but do not waste my time unless you have a reasonable offer or trade. More details below."

Flag |  Edit | Favorite PCA Spectrum 223 collector ammo. I was going through some things and came across some ammo in a ammo can. I forgot I had this stuff. After researching a little bit about them. I see it has been discontinued and is now collector ammo. The ammo has a metal base for the primer, plastic body, and a normal bullet. I see the 20 round boxes on gunbroker for $30 + shipping. I also have a 50 round box. I dont see any of those anywhere. I'll will sell them for $1.50 a round. Thats $30 for the 20 round box and $75 for the 50 round box. If you buy both I'll let you have them $100 even. I wont sell individual rounds. Again this is collector ammo . No shipping and local pick up please. I'm not hard up for the money so price is firm. Thanks I'm in Fairfield."
