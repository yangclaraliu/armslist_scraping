Not $20 $40 or up to $120 more than the new from the guns store price of $305 that is ee some people listing these for. Just because you paid too much for it 3 months ago when the craziness was at its highest doesn't mean it is worth that. These are $305 new and SHOULD be worth less used since they are not rare or hard to find and are being produced every day. If you have one and want to sell it let me know. I have CCW cash and will travel a reasonable distance on the weekend.

I listened to two people come in to a gun shop last night that had been waiting ten weeks to the day for their guns and still hadnt got anything from state police. BS!
Anyway....

This gun is a DSA ZM4 5.56X45 Brand new never fired with lots of extras.
Hogue pistol grip, super comfortable!!
Utg quadrail
Utg 4 position foregrip
Flip up rear peep sight.
Chrome lined barrel
8-30 round mags as rebuild kits, brand new, all parts included.

Lots of ammo-

700+ rounds, mostly high end brass

8-30 round mag rebuild kits. All parts included just need assembly.

This gun is in perfect condition, never fired. Just stuff added.

I also can build medical supply grab bags/bugout bags.

Im friends with several guys that work for ffl dealers and they are tellng me that most are planning on pricing rifles over $2500 dollars in the few months before the ban, thats without accessories, just the gun, no ammo no nice package.

I have 9mm ammo as well as bug out bags."

Once your check or money order has cleared, we will ship your item out with optional insurance.

Just needs some TLC to get it back in great condition. Runs and drives fine as it sits.

The Good:
It runs great, under 3000 original miles
Shifts through all the gears
Newer head (not the cylinder)
New tires and tubes, still have the knobby's on the edges
New cam sprocket cover/gasket
Seat is perfect. Not a single tear
New front sprocket
Original engine guard, chain guard, etc. 
Great original vinyls
Kept indoors most of its life

The bad: 
Top end speed is poor, it will hit 25-30 mph max on the street. The clutch needs to be adjusted or rebuilt. The front sprocket was replaced, so the good bottom end/bad top end could be a result of that.
The key is broken off in the ignition. I will have a new one in the next week or so most likely. As of right now I'm just using the handlebar killswitch.

Also included are all original documents including manuals, etc. The price is $585 plus tax @ 6.75%. Our prices are determined both by our cost and what we see the guns selling for on the marketplace in our area. We always try to come in below MSRP and hopefully below the other guys. Due to our current business model, we unfortunately cannot offer price matching.

We are a newer FFL dealer in the Nursery/Mission Valley area just outside of Victoria. We only do sales face-to-face at our location, so we do not offer shipping. Our prices are listed as a ""cash price"", meaning there is a 3% surcharge for debit/credit cards, and we do not accept American Express or checks. You can always call ahead for the total if we know you're coming (you'll already have our phone number and address at that point).

As we are an FFL holder, you will be required to fill out Form 4473 and undergo a NICS check. If this is going to be a problem, we will regrettably not be able to do business.

If you are interested in any of our listings, certainly go ahead and shoot me an email and I'll be happy to help you in any way I can. For those curious, unfortunately we have not yet been able to obtain any sizeable quantity of ammo so we do not advertise ammo for sale...yet. We are able to get you pricing if you're looking for specific guns and we may be able to snag a few things if you let us know what you want. We do require a prepayment for items such as these."

We will ship to your FFL or you can pick it up.

We have a NIB Glock 26 9x19mm with 2 mags, loader, case, and lock. Also included are all original documents including manuals, etc. The price is $575 plus tax @ 6.75%. Our prices are determined both by our cost and what we see the guns selling for on the marketplace in our area. We always try to come in below MSRP and hopefully below the other guys. Due to our current business model, we unfortunately cannot offer price matching.

We are a newer FFL dealer in the Nursery/Mission Valley area just outside of Victoria. We are willing to ship to your FFL (if a firearm or lower receiver) or house if you're buying an accessory, but we do charge shipping. Our prices are listed as a ""cash price"", meaning there is a 3% surcharge for debit/credit cards, and we do not accept American Express or personal checks, although cashier's checks and USPS money orders are fine. Once your check or money order has cleared, we will ship your item out with optional insurance. 

As we are an FFL holder, you will be required to fill out Form 4473 and undergo a NICS check if you are purchasing a firearm. If this is going to be a problem, we will regrettably not be able to do business. 

If you are interested in any of our listings, certainly go ahead and shoot me an email and I'll be happy to help you in any way I can. For those curious, unfortunately we have not yet been able to obtain any sizeable quantity of ammo so we do not advertise ammo for sale...yet. We are able to get you pricing if you're looking for specific guns and we may be able to snag a few things if you let us know what you want. We do require a prepayment for items such as these. We currently have accounts with a few of the higher end gun manufacturers as well so it never hurts to ask, sometimes you'll be surprised at what we can get."

The Sidewinder Conversion System is a unique accessory for your Mossberg 12 gauge shotgun. This kit allows you to use 6 round magazines without the need to permanently alter your shotgun. Simply remove the barrel, unscrew the factory magazine tube and install this custom tube. With the Sidewinder installed, you can instantly reload your shotgun by dropping the empty magazine and inserting a full one. Perfect for the 6-shot Mossberg 500, 590, 590A1 or Maverick 88. Use with the 590 will require the purchase of an adapter tube (sold separately). No gunsmithing or permanent modification of the shotgun is required.

REVIEW SUMMARY

2/25/2010
By Greg

from Plano, TX
WOW! I really like the Sidewinder. While the drum looks great, holds 10 rnds, and functions well... I personally like the 6rd. box mag best. (they are a lot easier to carry and handle). Best bet... Start with the drum and reload with boxes if you like to be ""high speed low drag""

By Arnie

from Newark, NJ

You wanna talk about fun. I loaded up my two drums and fired all twenty rounds in about 15 seconds. After practising, I can change mags in about 2 seconds. It took 40 seconds off my match score in the last 3-gun match I shot. I'll never go back to tube-fed shotguns.


This kit has never been assembled. Comes complete with everything you need to convert your Mossberg 500/590 to use the 6-round magazines. The kit is the later model so it has been better produced for reliable, smooth action.

It does not come with the 10 round drum but there are 7 new, unused, 6-round magazines.

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5 barrel). It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

It is less than an inch thick and the shield is the first in the M&P line of pistols with the upgraded trigger for smoother pull and reset so you are not getting the creepy typical m&p feel.  Only reason I am putting it up online is that i just moved up to an M&P pro.

Rifle is in great condition , around 400rds down the tube and cleaned after every range session. If you havent tried a chinese double hook trigger , they are the cream of the crop . Best shooting ak i own. 922 compliance parts are buttstock , pistol grip , slant brake and i use us mags. The rest is original chinese . Have 3 poly mags and original chinese sling . I also have an original chinese blonde stock and a super rare chinese 40rd mag if the price is right. but those would take the gun out of 922 compliance .

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

THESE ARE A FEW COMMENTS I HAVE FOUND FROM RELOADING FORUMS ON SUBSTITUTING MAGNUM PISTOL PRIMERS FOR STANDARD

 drop your powder by a tenth or two and you'll be fine. 9mm +P is 10% over anyway. I never had a problem with Mag primers in anything.

That's all I use in my small pistol loads....but I've worked the loads up with them also. Drop it down a little and you'll be fine.

What does it all mean?
Using magnum primers in 9mm will not do you any good, and likely cause no harm, and you will likely not notice a difference.

When to Obama induced component shortage reared its ugly head I ran out of standard primers for everything!!!!! Had several thousand magnum primers so I switched to those and reduced my loads just a scoch. Works fine and I didn't see any difference in accuracy or pressure signs. FRJ"

This rifle is modeled after the AR platform however the take down pins are farther apart than the AR-10 and AR-15 rifles causing the rifle to not accept an interchangeable upper like the AR-15 and AR-10 platform. This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed.

The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine.

The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform.

Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .3oo Win Mag ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots.

In the AR tradition, the Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reassembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle virtually seamless."

“Why yes, that’s really five shots.” Tell your friends it’s genetics. Fact is, when it comes to precision, there’s no finer pedigree in the industry than Remington® varmint rifles. And with the introduction of our new Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint, staking claim to our legendary accuracy is a more attainable feat than ever.

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.
Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.
Key Features:
Newly designed SPS Varmint stock with vented beavertail fore-end 
Sling swivel studs included 
26"" heavy-contour barrel (0.820"" muzzle O.D.)

***NO TRADES***  Up for sale is a COLT model Three-Fifty-Seven.  These are very unusual to find as Colt did not make many of them.  It has the same basic internals as the original Python, with the same basic frame shape.  The biggest difference is in the barrel shape and of course in the finish.  Notice the trigger and hammer are identical to the Python.   The trigger pull in single and double action is identical to the Python.  BTW, The Python IS NOT FOR SALE, and is only shown for comparison!  Has Elliason rear sight and Colt Presentation Target Grips that are like new.

This is a very nice shooting revolver...  Has about 80% finish, and dates to around 1960.  At one point it had a scope mount which was removed that exposed a single thread tap on top of the cylinder block.  It does not effect anything mechanically.
No trade, cash only $595 including shipping to CONUS or $550 local FTF.     Posting on several Forums, so may sell elsewhere.  I will honor the date stamp of the first taker no matter which Forum the purchaser replies from...  Thanks for looking!   No box/papers, revolver only...

Piston reliability, tack driving accuracy LWRC barrels are known for, ultra lightweight design and barrel profile makes all day movement a breeze. Incorporate all the aforementioned features, and you have the best AR on auction arms for hard training, practical use, and of course for those zombies. No expense was spared in creating this beast of an AR. Only scratch on it was inside magwell from inserting a magazine to see proper seating. This gun is unfired. Lubed and ready to rock (I suggest using SLIP 2000). This is the BEST ar on armslist, and an absolute steal at $2350.
