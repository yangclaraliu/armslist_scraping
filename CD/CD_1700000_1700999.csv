Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button.

It's the solution for those who prefer a smaller model 1911, but insist on complete reliability. The slide has been reduced to the minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. The frame has been modified with the innovative Ed Brown Bobtail™ housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. The Bobtail™ minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability. These problems are eliminated with the Ed Brown Commander Bobtail™ configuration, which reflects the genius of John Browning with an innovative modern flair. The functional simplicity has yet to be matched. Unique with the Executive series pistols is the 25 LPI checkered frame and ""half checkered"" Bobtail™. This pattern is not too rough on the hands, but not too fine for a secure grip. The Executive Carry is truly at the top of it's field. Get promoted to an Executive Carry - it's a serious tool for the competent professional!

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots."

And if you reload, you should know by now to check and re-check your favorite online outlets because bullets and powders are back in stock now if you just have them ""notify"" you when stock becomes available.  Prices aren't back to the good old days, but sure beats the lowlife scum trying to jack $800 for a lousy case of Federal .22lr that he got for under $200 last fall at the gun show.  Armslist won't pull these ridiculous ads even if everyone flags them as ""overpriced"" because that's their business.  If enough people flag them as ""scam"" I'll bet these clowns will get tired of posting their stupid ads every day.  Good luck and have fun shooting."

Sorry, too many of the wierd ones have been coming out of the woodwork this time.  ......................................................................................................................................................
This is a Mossberg 500a 12 gauge pump that has been sitting new in its box since the 90's. I bought it to turn into a rifle.  I sold the 28"" vent-ribbed barrel and bought a slightly used, 24"" fully rifled, cantilevered barrel for shooting metal hollow points.  This is a powerful rifle. Shooting a Hornady SST through it can take out an elephant.
  Now,  while the gun and 24"" smooth-bore slug barrel are new, this fully rifled barrel has been shot.  Not much at all, in fact, it looks superb with perfect rifling. ISince I bought it I have cycled the slide several times, so the magazine has a couple of fine scratches on it now. This 90's shotgun has a deep, rich color with bluing still unaffected by the years.  Asking $300

Do some internet searching if you're not sure if you need one - law enforcement loves these!

Shipping on these brakes is about $6, (optional) insurance brings it to $8. 

VG6 Precision’s Gamma Tactical Brake uses a combination muzzle brake / compensator to virtually eliminate recoil and greatly reduce muzzle climb.  Works on all 5.56mm rifles with 1/2 x 28 RH threads.  Optimized for AR-15s with 10″ – 18.5″ barrel lengths.  It also works great on AR-pistols with shorter barrels. 

100% CNC machined
17-4PH® stainless steel construction
Black Nitride finish
Engineered using state-of-the-art techniques (CAE, CFD) and extensively field tested
For 5.56x45mm and .223 Remington calibers only
Dimensions identical to A2 birdcage flashhider (Length: 1.2″ not including threads)
Please note that while the Gamma works very well on a short-barreled-rifle,  is not long enough for permanent installation on 14.5″ barrels to bring up to legal barrel lengths.
Manufacturer’s warranty exists on this item for manufacturing defects. 

We are a newer FFL dealer in the Nursery/Mission Valley area just outside of Victoria. We are willing to ship to your FFL (if a firearm or lower receiver) or house if you're buying an accessory, but we do charge shipping. Our prices are listed as a ""cash price"", meaning there is a 3% surcharge for debit/credit cards, and we do not accept American Express or personal checks, although cashier's checks and USPS money orders are fine. Once your check or money order has cleared, we will ship your item out with optional insurance. 

As we are an FFL holder, you will be required to fill out Form 4473 and undergo a NICS check if you are purchasing a firearm. If this is going to be a problem, we will regrettably not be able to do business. 

If you are interested in any of our listings, certainly go ahead and shoot me an email and I'll be happy to help you in any way I can. For those curious, unfortunately we have not yet been able to obtain any sizeable quantity of ammo so we do not advertise ammo for sale...yet. We are able to get you pricing if you're looking for specific guns and we may be able to snag a few things if you let us know what you want. We do require a prepayment for items such as these. We currently have accounts with a few of the higher end gun manufacturers as well so it never hurts to ask, sometimes you'll be surprised at what we can get."

For those of you who are familiar with Extreme Shock Ammunition, they are producing their own line of high quality copper plated, lead core ammunition under the brand name “Allegiance Ammunition.”

Each Allegiance round undergoes the same strict quality control procedures as the Extreme Shock tactical line.

This round nosed ammo has the case mouth and primer sealed, or waterproofed to US mil spec standard. According to the manufacturer, this procedure will give the Allegiance brand of ammunition an estimated 20-year shelf life.

You get the best of both worlds with Allegiance as it is excellent for target shooting, yet performance enhanced for self-defense situations.

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

I need some money to make a down payment on some work we're doing to our house since our family is growing. Everything is brand new unless otherwise noted.

Do Not Ask:
If this is available – if you see this ad, this is still for sale
If I'll sell the ammo separately. I know it's still hard to find ammo, but this stuff goes with these guns


The Guns:
1. Bushmaster XM-15 (not the cheap Carbon model) with two Bushmaster 30 round mags (comes with 1 in store). MSRP $1,391.48
2. DPMS Panther Oracle with Magpul furniture and flip up sights (front and rear, not installed yet), Hogue pistol grip, 30 round Pmag with window, and 30 round DPMS mag. Also includes a Magpul verticle foregrip (not installed) that attaches to the hand guard. Base model (without Magpul extras) is around $1,000 from dealers
All rifles come with manuals, paperwork, locks, and whatever other accessories normally come with them (i.e. sling and rail risers for Bushmaster, etc).

The Accessories:
- Black Midway USA padded zippered rifle bag with room for 4 30-round mags, a velcro pocket, and a zippered pocket on the outside. Has a carry handle and shoulder strap on the back.
- Green NCStar padded zippered rifle bag with outside pockets for 4 30-round mags covered by a velcro flap. Has a carry handle on the side and a shoulder strap on the other.

- 60 rounds of Tulammo .223 ammunition


Everything is new except for the UTG and Weaver scopes. If you buy the whole package I'll include a package of 20 zombie targets for free. I prefer to sell the collection as one lot, or split the rifles up into packages, but I'm open to selling some of the stuff off individually (i.e. the extra mags as a lot, or a rifle and ammo).

I'm not looking to gouge anyone, but I am looking to get out near what this is all worth. I can even give you itemized prices if you think this is too high and don't want to do the research yourself. Keep in mind this is a chance to avoid sales taxes, fees, and putting down your information for the government to follow. I'll knock a couple bucks off the individual prices if you buy the whole collection.

DPMS rifle with Magpul furniture, green tactical rifle bag, 6 30-round mags (1 pmag, 1 DPMS, 4 Tapco), UTG red dot scope sight, 1 ammo can, 560 rounds of .223 ammunition, bayonet.

All this 2A attack bullshit has done is break the community a part and make guns that are barely worth 600$ now apparently worth some made up number of 2000 plus. - I remember when a SKS fresh out of the box was 180$ and a M14 was 300$ new. You're all idiots if you honestly believe your shitty gun is worth what you're asking on here. 

No your SKS and AKs aren't worth 1200-2000, neither is your M14. Chances are that if your AR isn't a Armalite or a Bushmaster or another big name it's not even close to what your asking. Same with ammo, good lord guys, it's a community not a damn gun store quit price gouging the same people who are sitting here fighting for the same damn rights as you are.

These are now available in what they call an Express Tactical Model. It is 12 gauge, 2 3/4 or 3""

Since this is a factory pistol grip, it may be converted by a Class II manufacturer and transferred to you as an AOW with only a $5 tax stamp. I paid $419 plus about 8.5% sales tax and got the only one that Academy Sports had. I will include a new tactical case.

The only marks I note are where the bbl retention screw marred the bbl or factory extension tube as I took it on or off to clean. 

I cleaned the weapon after firing and wiped it down with a silicone cloth which, if you enlarge, will show some of its fibers. [Prior to firing, I disassembled and cleaned it to ensure there was no Cosmoline; I refinished for a class II for about 15 years on weekends to be around exotic weapons and of about 400 riot shoties that I sold that we took in on police trades, the 870s are my favorite).

Just sold the gun and sight will not work with new handgun.  $95 new at several mo retailers.  With box, ppwk, tool in original box.    The Mueller Quick Shot sight has 2 built in sensors in the front that detects the surrounding lighting conditions and automatically adjusts the brightness of the dot to the these conditions, unlike all other Red Dot Scopes, which require manual adjustment. This new, innovative concept so important as lighting conditions change the user no longer needs to worry about manually adjusting the brightness of the dot, checking to see if it is adequate for the existing lighting conditions and continually making manual adjustments like all other Red Dot Sights. In rare cases there may be instances where the user could be in an area that is darker or brighter than the target area so we have also provided 10 manual brightness adjustment settings, which over-ride the auto setting, making this sight optimum for any situation. No other Reflex Style scope offers this many features. Select from 4 different Reticle styles with the flip of a switch. The Quick Shot is one of the most versatile illuminated sights ever produced.

The FNX™-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.
