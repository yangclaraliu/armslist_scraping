Fusion Ammo Details: Federal Fusion MSR Ammunition is specifically designed for the most versatile class of firearms in history, the Modern Sporting Rifle. Fusion MSR Ammunition is engineered for hunting MSR's. Each round performs its ballistic peak through 16"" to 20"" barrels which are the common lengths found on these rifles. Each load features a low-flash, fast-burning propellant and primers compatible with the free-floating firing pins that are characteristic on MSR's. Each brass case features a harder case head for exceptional primer retention, military-style colored iris gives visual confirmation or proper case metallurgy. These rounds will feed and function perfectly from magazines and exhibit velocities that are tailored to the unique ballistic tendencies of these rifles. 

These loads are loaded with a specialized fusion bullet that is perfect deer sized game. Each bullet features an electrochemically bonded lead core to copper jacket, eliminating the possibility of a core/jacket separation. The boat tail rifle bullets feature a slight dimple in the nose that delivers exceptional accuracy and devastating terminal performance which delivers an impact that radiates lethal shock throughout the target. This energy is optimized through mass weight retention, a top-secret tip-skiving process and superior bullet integrity. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases."

Never been fired since it arrived from the factory.  Original case and paperwork.  Gun is 100%

In 2005, Ruger introduced the 50th anniversary Flattop 357 Magnum to commemmerate their first centerfire revolver.  It was built on the smaller Colt Single Action Army size frame, the same that the original Flattop 357's were made on.  This makes for a handier, lighter packing size sixgun.  Starting in 1974, Ruger changed to the New Model Blackhawks and incorporated the transfer bar safety.  They also started building all the Blackhawks on the larger frame size including the 357 Magnum.

For 30 years, if you wanted a ""mid-size"" frame Ruger Blackhawk you had to acquire one of the Old Model 357 Magnum Blackhawks.  Noted gunwriters like Skeeter Skelton and John Taffin popularized the converting of Old Model Blackhawk 357 Magnums to 44 Special as Ruger never chambered this cartridge, instead just making a larger frame 44 Magnum.  So in 2005, Ruger created quite a stir when they re-introduced the mid-size frame, albeit in the New Model format.

Simply put, TriNyte delivers scratch and corrosion resistance dramatically superior to standard stainless steel as well any protective coating by any other manufacturer. The Model 700 XCR II is also optimizedfor sure handling in adverse climates. Its feature-laden olive drab green synthetic stock is a technological marvel that looks and feels the part with patented Hogue rubber overmolding featured at the grip and fore-end areas. These revolutionary enhancements give you a positive grip in the slickest environments. And shots are made infinitely more comfortable with our SuperCell recoil pad - the most effective on the market today. X-MarkPro Trigger System gives you a level of crispness and shot control once only available through high-dollar customization.

OK With all that said- I like getting deals too- BUT I WILL NOT ENTERTAIN A LOWBALLER- IF YOU OFFER ME AN INSULTING PRICE OR TRADE I WILL BLOCK ALL YOUR FURTHER EMAILS.

If I wasn't willing to sit on these investments that I have listed then I wouldn't be trading for silver (which silver is low right now).

Basically I know you will probably try to offer me a pric a little lower than other sellers on armslist and that is fine, that is called competition, which is fine.... But I know what I have so please don't insult my inteligence. Offer a reasonable trade or price or get blocked. 

With that said, email me, let me know what kind of silver you have and what you are looking for and we will see if we can set something up.

Also please no emails with lines like ""What all do ya got?"" I have listed most of everything if you have a specific question I am happy to answer it and update this listing.

As mentioned its a s&w model m&p 15. Has a bushnell red dot, new upper, quad rail, and a few more extras. Look at the pics. Will come with a bulldog carrying case, and 3 30 round pmags.
I'm asking $1600 for all, but I would like to get at least $1,400 plus a 12 gauge shotgun or a bolt action rifle. 

I can throw in around 900 rounds of ammo, a bore snake, plus 5 more 30 round pmags, 1 20 round pmag,  for an additional $600

SABER®-FORSST® modular rifle chassis’ are manufactured to ISO:9001-2008 standards principally from 7075-T6 aerospace grade alloys, advanced composites and lightweight high-strength carbon fiber materials.

It has a carry handle at its top and D-rings at its corners that could accommodate backpack straps, but they are not included. The case’s size and shape allows for discreet transport of the rifle along with spare magazines, ammunition, tools and other supplies.

If I wasn't willing to sit on these investments that I have listed then I wouldn't be trading for silver (which silver is low right now).

Basically I know you will probably try to offer me a price a little lower than other sellers on armslist and that is fine, that is called competition, which is fine.... But I know what I have so please don't insult my inteligence. Offer a reasonable trade or price or get blocked. 

With that said, email me, let me know what kind of silver you have and what you are looking for and we will see if we can set something up.

Also please no emails with lines like ""What all do ya got?"" I have listed most of everything if you have a specific question I am happy to answer it and update this listing.

Thanks and have a great day"

The gun is a couple months old but hasn't been shot even once by me yet. I got this because I love the dark earth glocks but I have other glocks in 40 s&w so this isn't being carried or used. I'm looking to trade this for a glock 21 SF Gen 3 or a Gen 4 g21. Preference given to a glock21 SF with a picitiny rail. I'd prefer the Gen 3 over the Gen 4. I have more then enough money to go buy the g21 but its not around and either is the g22. So trade only!!!!!!! I will make a reasonable deal on a gen4 as they are.worth a little more. Your g21 doesn't have to be brand new but it must still look perfect. as. far as the finish. I don't want one with holster wear. If we can make a deal contact me. Thank you.

This gun is a late model, manufactured in 1975, making it one of the highest-quality and most reliable Commandos out there. It uses 30-round M3 Grease Gun mags, which are still cheap and plentiful on GunBroker - much cheaper than actual Thompson 20-round stick mags. The receiver, 16-inch barrel, compensator, and magazine have been recently refinished in DuPont Teflon black at a cost of $250, and look excellent. It has been thoroughly cleaned and lubed, and only 5 rounds have been fired since the refinish to ensure proper function. 

I am also including a spare lower receiver, which I had planned to refinish and convert to use a genuine Thompson wooden handgrip and trigger, as well as the mechanism required to convert the stock to a push-button release, again emulating a genuine Thompson. The wooden buttstock can be easily removed with two screws, and the gun is quite fun to shoot without the stock. I am also including a spare ejector, ejector pin, and ejector spring, good spare parts to have around. It has the rock-solid feel and fun of a Thompson to shoot, at a significantly lower cost. 

33rd-edition of the Blue Book of Gun Values places the value of this rifle in good condition at $825, which does not include the spare parts. I am willing to accept offers in the neighborhood of $725. Full and partial trade offers will be considered, but I am most in need of the cash. As much as I don't want to admit it, it may not be possible to sell this gun (or mag) without a costly FFL transfer in Colorado soon, so this is a good opportunity to pick this gun up before that nonsense goes into effect."
