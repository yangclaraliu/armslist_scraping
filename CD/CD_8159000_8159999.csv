Bad ass.It holds 17+1Ambi controls.Accessory rail.Adjustable sights.Black on black.Hammer fired.The mag doesn't just drop free... It ejects!Super accurateEasy takedown3 different backstraps for hand sizeFinger grooves grip.It basically looks like the top half of a CZ sp01 mated with the bottom half of an H&K usp.It's easy to shoot.  It's more accurate than I am.Its recoil is pretty light for a polymer framed gun.You literally cannot find a negative review of this pistol anywhere.I hate to get rid of it but I'm desperate for money.If I get the money I need elsewhere this pistol will no longer be for sale.But... If the ad is up I probably still have it for sale.It has been tested with six different types of ammo. Never had one hiccup or malfunction.  Reviews online suggest it never will.The trigger is also great in double and single.Takes the cheap, reliable, easy to find CZ 75 magazines.  Just has to be 17 round or more capacity.17 and 19 rounders fit flush.Comes with factory hard case and about 50-60 rounds of self defense hollow points.I need $300 for it.If you buy these online they're that price or more... Plus taxes shipping and FFL transfer fee.So believe me... This doesn't look like a deal but it is.  If you buy online it'll be $300+25shipping+25ffl fee and depending where you buy it from possibly sales tax as well.  That's all if you get cheap shipping and send it to an FFL that will do it for $25.Some places charge $40.If you find one in a gun shop in town... It's gonna be around $320-350+taxes.  Plus you'll have to buy the ammo that already comes with this one.Over $350 no matter how you plan it out.So yes.  My $300 is minimum $50 cheaper than anywhere else.Wonderful gun.Will come with all tools all accessories and hard case that came with it new a month ago.$300."

Made in 1959 this model has the same frame and mechanics as the Python Snake gun. 
The new medium frame revolver was built on a modified and strengthened Colt medium frame.  Colt had used this basic medium frame since the Army Special of 1908.
For use with the Magnum round, Colt changed the medium ""E"" frame with it's hammer mounted firing pin to a new design with a spring loaded firing pin mounted inside the frame.  To withstand the much higher pressures of the .357, Colt gave the frame and cylinder of the new gun special heat treating to increase it's strength.
This new frame design was named the ""I"" frame.
The new gun was ready in 1953 and Colt gave it a unique name: The Colt 357.  This was both the name and caliber.
 
The 357 outwardly had a close resemblance to the new Trooper models, since they used the same frame size and action.  The new 357 and Trooper were virtually indistinguishable without a close inspection.
While the Trooper was to be a lower cost model, the new 357 was to be Colt's premium model holster revolver with a more carefully fitted and tuned action and a better external finish.
The idea was that law enforcement and civilian buyers wanting a less expensive adjustable sight revolver would buy the Trooper, buyers wanting the .357 Magnum cartridge or wanting a higher quality gun would buy the 357.
Things got confused in 1955 when Colt introduced the ""Super Premium"" Colt Python.  Buyers wanting a cheaper gun continued to buy the Trooper, but those wanting a better gun were buying the new Python.  This left the 357 as odd man out, and in 1961 Colt discontinued the 357 model after about 15,000 had been produced. This gun is a pristine example of this model.MN Buyer needs MN state ID and Permit.Out of MN residents pay $30 shipping to local FFL for transfer."

735,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8159735,For Sale:  Japanese Type 2 Paratrooper Rifle,"Clarksville, Nashville, Tennessee","$ 2,500","Listed On: Tuesday, April 3, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For your consideration is this Japanese type 2 Paratrooper Rifle. The primary difference between this rifle and the Type 99 was the fact that it had a bolt that locked the two pieces into place rather than being made of a single piece. The purpose for this was to allow the Japanese paratroopers to carry them in a bag while they jumped and then piece it together on the ground. There were only 17000 of these types of rifles made throughout the duration of the war. Compare this to the millions of K98s, M1 Garands, Nagants, and even T99s and you can understand why it’s a unique bird. The rifle still has a full imperial Chrysanthemum that has not been defaced as well as anti aircraft sites on it. Both halves Match however the bolt is ~50 numbers off from the remainder of the rifle. This is commonly seen on rifles brought back from the Pacific Campaigns as it was common procedures to confiscate the bolt while in transit back to the states. Once back they often just grabbed a random bolt assembly from a large group of readil available ones. This rifle displays well and will be a great addition to any advanced World War 2 firearm collection. I will be bringing it to the WW2 Militaria show this Saturday (Easter Weekend) if you would like to see it. Primary reason for me letting it go is to fund a WW2 era Luger, matching holster and magazines."

The M2 Field is the workhorse of the Benelli semi-auto line. Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the Benelli M2 is built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven bolt mechanism. The Inertia Driven system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12-gauge cartridge, from 2 3/4 in. target loads to the heaviest 3 in. magnums. Benelli engineers have also adapted the ComforTech recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48%, and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the you back on target up to 69% faster than any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new ComforTech system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you ever will shoot. The M2 is a workhorse with the speed of a thoroughbred.
