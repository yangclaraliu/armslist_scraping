 The two-piece modular construction of the 30 round magazine allows for maximum strength and integrity to be achieved while simultaneously allowing the magazine to drop free as well as solve feeding issues. The straight upper piece of the magazine allows the magazine to drop free while also presenting ammunition to the chamber in perfect form. The curved lower portion of the magazine allows the remaining rounds to stack naturally which breeds precise feeding. The functionality of the magazine is only half of the battle, this magazine is constructed from the latest aerospace polymers which are impervious to the detrimental effects of solvents and lubricants. The waffle style molding on the exterior of the magazine helps ensure a positive grip.

At the time I did quite a bit of riding, but don't get the chance much anymore. Would rather see it go somewhere to be ridden than to be sitting in the garage taking up space.

For the sake of disclosure: it was stolen for a short amount of time and recovered. The kid that stole it had to pay restitution, so I fixed it back up. He flipped it doing a wheelie and tore up the subfame and handlebars in the process. Replaced with a subframe off an '05 (has removable grab handle where the '03 did not) and an aftermarket set of handlebars.  

It also has skid plates and nerf bars.  Plastic is in good condition, but has some marks from riding.  No bends, creases, or anything like that.  Motor and exhaust is stock.  Still a lot of rubber left.

I have riding gear (helmet, goggles, pants, boots, etc. in red) I'd throw in. Also has a set of Sandshark tires/wheels to go with it. The paddles are worn, as that's what's on it when it was stolen then rode through the woods, but there is still quite a bit left on them.

I have lightly used Sig Mosquito .22 LR with less than 400 rounds thru. It is the tactical version with a threaded barrel. It also comes with all the accessories including additional front sights and a spare recoil spring along with the case and all paperwork.

These were imported by Richland from about 1963-1985.  This one has some beautiful engraving work done to it.  It is in very good condition, having been fired only a few times over the years.  This was a more popular gauge in Europe, where they used it for waterfowl hunting.  The 10 gauge was estimated to add about 10 yards to the length of the kill zone shot.  Don't see these come up very often, they are becoming quite rare these days.  And ammo is actually still available.  I have not fired this, nor do I plan to, but I found shells in stock here in Atlanta for around $30-$40 a box.  The engraving work is amazingly well done.  It was even done to the screw heads which makes them blend right into background of the scrollwork.  It's engraved all the way around, including the bottom of the trigger guard. I have posted the maximum 3 pictures here, but I can send more to interested buyers.  Price is $800 cash, no trades.

Also, I have had several inquiries about shipping this shotgun and out of state buyers wanting to pick it up face to face.  Current BATFE rules and regulations state I CANNOT sell a firearm to anyone not a resident of my home state (GA) without going through a licensed FFL dealer and filling out a form 4473.  I can ship it to your local FFL dealer of choice after receiving a copy of the FFL dealers license, and the buyer will have to pay the $25 outgoing FFL transfer fee from my local dealer.

All meeting to view the item will take place at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming, just off GA400 exit 13.  If the ad is still up, the gun is still for sale."

If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

498,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1145498,For Sale:  URGENT MESSAGE FROM GRNC,"KEEP UP THE PRESSURE ON CONGRESS, North Carolina, United States","$ 1,000,000,000","Listed On: Tuesday, February 26, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"“I don’t think we’re that close to a deal…”

 In an about-face, Senator Tom Coburn, who was previously said to be close to a “deal” with Sen. Charles Schumer and others on a “lite” version of registering private gun sales, now says: ““I don’t think we’re that close to a deal…” That is according to “Roll Call” on Sunday, suggesting your input is having an impact.

But is Coburn just trying to deflect you? Bloomberg News today sees it differently:

“New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, and Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma have worked out 90 percent of their differences over a measure that would expand criminal background checks to most private sales of guns, according to two Senate aides who asked for anonymity to discuss the talks.”

Either way, it is time to turn up the pressure with a new round of calls to Congress saying: “No deals on background checks.”



GRNC obliterates left-wing attack on Pittenger

Barack Obama has brought his left-wing supporters to bear on gun control by turning his campaign organization into “Organizing for Action,” using $100,000 to target 13 pro-gun legislators, and mobilizing MoveOn.org for Friday’s “National Day of Action.” In New York, the left even threatened to throw the head-banging thugs of the SEIU into the fray by sending them to a gun rights rally.

In North Carolina, Obama supporters tried to run a Twitter war against Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-9, GRNC ****), but were overwhelmed by pro-gun input after GRNC issued an alert telling people to tweet “I stand with Pittenger against the Obama onslaught.”

Moreover, it seems that whatever Twitter input Obama turned out was largely faked. In an article in “The Hill,” Texas Rep. Steve Stockman described how low Obama supporters are willing to stoop to attack your rights:

""Obama's anti-gun campaign is a fraud,"" Stockman said. ""Obama's supporters are panicking and willing to do anything to create the appearance of popular support, even if it means trying to defraud Congress … I call upon the president to denounce this phony spam campaign.""


Gun banners on the run? Turn up the heat!

Maybe Obama’s left-wingers are desperate, maybe not. Maybe Coburn, having “felt the heat,” is now “seeing the light.” Maybe not. Whatever the case, having once again seen Obama’s deceit, you must redouble your efforts!

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED!

The message was not posted by GRNC it was merely forwarded here by me. One other thing that frequently goes unmentioned regarding so called ""universal background checks"" is that if all sales are subject to background check then all sales can be stopped simply by taking the NICS system offline.

Also comes with 2 mags. The ammo is Hornady XTP/HP, these rounds are 90 grains and designed specifically for short barrel pistols. They chronograph out of this guns barrel at over 1000 FPS!

This is a 1st focal plane scope with the Horus 58 reticle included is a pair of larue tactical SPR SCOPE RINGS which run 210.00 and the original Nightforce rings 
For you of the persuasion of the old mil dot reticle this might not be the scope for you. But if you are looking for something new and modern that replaces the last 40 years of long range precision shooting or hunting. Read on. Currently this scope is being fielded and used by our special operations forces all over the world. I am selling due to new ventures in other weapon systems.

The Horus reticle is a patented grid system replacing the 40-year-old archaic mil-dot shooting method. The Horus reticle is an optically precise uniform grid etched on glass. The ergonomic design and lay-out of the reticle includes a built-in rangefinder, providing a clear picture and numeric information about the target.
Horus reticles are based off the following data:
Measured in USMC milliradians (mils), where a circle = 6283 mils
1 mil = 3.60 inches at exactly 100 yards
1 mil = 10.0 centimeters at exactly 100 meters
H58 Reticle
The H58 is a unique design incorporating all the benefits of a Horus reticle with new features for additional benefits. 

The H58 has extended wind dots placed at each 1 mil mark outside the main hash grid. These wind dots are unobtrusive, providing a clearer view than an extending grid, but still allows accurate holds in high winds.
The H58 also incorporates the Accuracy 1st Speed Shooting Formula. This is the staircase looking pattern in the upper half of the reticle. This allows the shooter to quickly establish a hold for his rifle. These increments are in 1/10 mil and start at .5 from the outside and go up to 1 mil at the middle line.
The mover numbers under each speed mil mark can be used to associate which mil to hold.
Here is a lesson from Todd Hodnett, Founder of Accuracy 1st, on how to use the H58 reticle:
Build your Accuracy 1st Speed Shooting Formula
By using the ATrag software, one can build his own speed shooting formula for his gun. After zeroing and then truing the gun. The user then can go to the TR under TARGET and place the target size in inches (12”). Then go through the following
1.2 = 254m = 1 mil
1 = 305m = 1.5 mils
.8 = 381m = 2.2 mils
.7 = 435m = 2.9 mils
.6 = 508m = 3.9 mils
.5 = 610m = 5.2 mils
By doing this, we have now built a dope sheet to perfect match our gun for these mil measurements. This will work out to 610m without ever having to know the distance of the target.
As you look at your holds you have just gathered. You will notice if you take the size of the image mil of the target and remove the decimal and then add the actual hold to it. The actual holds nearly equal 10, within a moa. So, 10 doesn’t mean anything, it just becomes the numbers that allows you to remember your hold.
Example:
Target mils .6, hold 4 mils: 6 + 4 = 10
Target mils .7, hold 3 mils: 7 + 3 = 10
This works really well out to 600m and allows the shooter to quickly engage a target with an accurate hold using the mil system, with an MOA, without ever having to know the distance of the target. It is a mil association drill.
So when I designed the reticle I placed the speed shooting formula above the main stadia line. These stair steps are actual tenth mil exact measurements starting at .5 on the outside and going up to 1 mil in the middle. I placed them over a mover speed number that when cut in half, gives you a proper mil hold to equal 10.
Example:

One can also use this with a gun that doesn’t equal 10. If you are using a 300wm and the actual holds equal closer to 9. You would just find where the target fits in the stairsteps and take that mover number and cut it in half and subtract 1 mil.
Example:

A target fits above the 6 mph mover mark, cut 6 in half which gives you 3 and then subtract 1 to now have a 2 mil hold. Easy
What this means is that you build the Accuracy 1st formula to your gun based off your trued performance parameters. This way, the only way you can miss, is if you miss-mil the target.
