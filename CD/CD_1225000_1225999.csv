Burris 6.5-20x50mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope have a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel image adjustment system, and Hi-Lume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris Full Field II 6.5-20x50 riflescope is even more for giving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification on Burris 6.5-20X50mm Fullfield II Riflescope w/ 1/6 MOA Adjustable Parallax simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Riflescope Fullfield II Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Fullfield II is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adustment system compared to the original Fullfield.

Remington began producing the 870 in 1951, so this is one of the earliest years. As a result of being older, the action is very smooth, loose, and well-broken in. It functions perfectly and handles everything fed to it. These were the days of excellent craftsmanship and quality. Unfortunately they just don't make them this way anymore. 

The gun has a few surface rust and wear spots here and there, but it is mostly in good condition. The forearm is a little loose and needs to be tightened, but I don't have a wrench to do so--that would be a 15 second fix. Due to the small surface rust spots and the loose action and forearm, I would rate this shotgun at approximately 75% of its original condition. The stock is a folding ATI stock, and the barrel is an 18.5"" barrel. The stock/barrel combo mske it perfect for home defense! 

If interested, please call or text me at (8six5-7sixsix-7555). The price is negotiable. I am not looking for any trades. Please NO emails! I do not check it, so you probably won't a get a reply until next year. I will ship through your FFL if you are not local. Thanks for looking and God bless!"

Designed specifically for military-issue MK11/M110 rifles and mil-spec ammunition (including M118LR), the PMAG 20LR is less than half the weight of standard issue steel magazines and maintains a service life round count approximately equal to the rifle barrel itself."

319,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1225319,For Sale:  VLTOR Basic EMOD MilSpec Stock - Black  & FDE,"Ft Worth, Dallas, Texas",$ 126,"Listed On: Friday, July 5, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The EMOD is based on the same rugged and practical design as the original Vltor Modstock - with specific features designed from lessons taken from the modern battlefield. The EMOD is about one inch longer than the original Modstock and with the rubber butt plate installed, is about a quarter of an inch longer than the CRANE SCB. The increased length of the EMOD is a major benefit when used on scoped rifles (SPR/DMR), as it increases the available comb for any given length of pull. The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks. The toe of the buttplate is rolled under; giving the EMOD a superior feel when the weapon is held in the ""out of pocket"" heads up hold. The buttplate is covered with a removable rubber buttpad that is molded over a metal strike plate. The shape of the buttplate and the rubber buttpad give a solid stock purchase in all situations. The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts. Constructed from the finest materials, the EMOD will stand up to the most rugged demands. The EMOD is available for either the standard ""MilSpec"" receiver extension tube, or for the aftermarket ""Commercial"" size tube. Available colors include Black, Foliage Green and Flat Dark Earth (tan). The EMOD is only available in the Clubfoot model. Product# VLAEB-M-B

Mossberg International brings an AR-style platform to you for a great price. Shooting has never been more fun and affordable. Mossberg International’s new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today’s AR-style platforms with Mossberg International’s reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 16” barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13” length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights.

Improved Modstock, appropriately named the “IMod”. Since 2002, the original Modstock has become well known and respected by Military, Law-Enforcement and sports shooters worldwide. Even though the Modstock is considered the best on the market, Vltor believed it was time for improvements. The improvements are subtle but necessary. Feedback from end users will make the IMod the choice over the competition. 

When compared to the original Modstock, the IMod series is now available to fit either the Milspec or Commercial diameter receiver extension/buffer tube. Unfortunately, the IMod will not fit both receiver extensions, so when ordering, pick the correct item and part number. 

Like all Vltor stocks, the IMod is available in the three most popular colors; Black, Flat Dark Earth (tan) and Foliage Green. As with the original Modstocks, the IMod is offered in the conventional, “Standard” configuration and the unconventional, “Clubfoot” configuration. Even though the Standard model is the most well-known model amongst the shooting public, the Clubfoot version is a hybrid model that bridges the gap between tactical and prone shooting positions. In other words, the Clubfoot portion of the stock allows the shooter, with his/her off hand, to support the stock and to control the rear of the weapon, while shooting in prone or rested position. 

The improvements of the IMod are as follows: Integral, but removable non-slip buttpad (color matched to stock components) 

•Rolled/angled buttpad toe with wide traction area. This will assist in running the stock high on shoulder, making the IMod system more user friendly when using web-gear and/or body armor. 
•Improved lock paddle, making it easier to operate and making the contact surface non-slip when operating the lever. 
•Removed most sharp edges that may cause “snag points” to web-gear or other vital equipment. 
•Improved strength throughout construction of the stock chassis. This will provide maximum strength during “Mortaring exercise” or unexpected impact. 
•Integral, but removable non-slip buttpad (color matched to stock components) 

Installation note: The installation of the IMod stock should only be performed by a qualified gunsmith and/or certified armorer. 

IMOD at a glance: Details 
Design Removable rubber buttpad and storage compartments. A true Modular buttstock for the AR15/M16/M4 carbine series. 
Construction Impact and temperature resistant polymer, specially blended for Vltor. Metal components are either carbon steel or stainless steel (depending on the application) 
Compatibility Milspec IMods will only fit receiver extensions/buffer tubes with the outer diameter of 1.150”, while Commercial IMods will only fit 1.170” diameter receiver extensions. 
Weight - Nominal Less than 9.4 oz. (Milspec and Commercial with storage compartment and buttpad installed) 
Dimensions Length: 6.250” (without buttpad) 
Length: 6.626” (with buttpad) 
Width: 2.500” (with storage compartments installed)Height: 5.210” (with buttpad installed)

Color Finish All stocks have a matte (anti-reflection/glare) finish. IMods are only available in the following colors: Black, Flat Dark Earth (Tan) and Foliage Green. Foliage Green is more of a “grey” green versus Olive Drab. 
Special Features Storage capacity: Each side compartment can hold at least two AAs or three lithium CR123 3-volt batteries. The internal diameter of each compartment is 0.685”. 

Sling mounting: All Modstocks, including the IMod will accept a push-button, quick detachable sling swivel or a conventional web sling, measuring up to 1.375” in width.

This German Army (Heer) Officer Dress Dagger model 1935 is in very good condition. This is a classic WKC Solingen piece all around from blade, crossguard and scabbard. Also includes original portepee knot, although it is fairly worn and showing it's age. Featuring the 12-count oak leaf type and they look incredible. Raised swastika and eagle look very nice. The patina is really beautiful. This is as authentic as it gets. Similar daggers sell for between $550 - $750 online based on condition.

The orange grip shows some wear and has a small fracture where it connects to the eagle/swastika. I have tried to show this in the photographs. The grip is fully intact and nothing is loose or missing. Scabbard is very straight and I do not see any dents or damage to the metal. The pebbling is very nice as well. This is a fine example of an early officer dagger. 

This is an extremely rare authentic piece of nazi history. While this was a terrible time in history, these items are highly collectible to military historians. I, in no way, endorse the philosophies or actions perpetrated by the nazi party. 

I have many other items for sale/trade from WW2. Everything is guaranteed authentic with a two week inspection period / return policy. Here is a running list of what is currently available.

I purchased the weapon last month brand new from the store for $799.99. It has had a total of 7 rounds through the barrel and has been cleaned after taking it to the range. The weapon is in perfect condition.

I am selling this weapon due to the simple fact it was an impulse buy. I thought it was an excellent weapon for the price and it proved itself from the few rounds I put through it. I think someone more into shotguns would be better suited with it. 

The weapon has a ceracoat finish along with the Magpul furniture. I am including a 4 reticle, 7 brightness level, rail mounted Barska optic. The optic is red-colored only but has a small dot, large dot, ""plus sign"" + reticle and a ""holographic-style"" reticle. It was brand new with the weapon for $96 with the $10 protection plan from Barska. 

The package comes with the original box, shotgun, 3 stock size adjustments, length of pull adjustments, trigger lock, Barska optic, Magpul MS3 sling, 5 round box of Police grade 00 buck shot and ALL paperwork. 

Will drive 30 minutes to meet FTF. Buyer must provide Ohio Drivers License, be legally allowed to own a firearm (at least 18 years old) and be willing to sign a bill of purchase. 

--The weapon brand new was $799.99 - I'll value at $700.00-$725.00
--Barska Optic and Protection Plan total to $94.98 - I'll value it at $75.00
--Magpul MS3 Sling (Coyote color) brand new was $69.99 - I'll value at $60
(HAVE ALL RECEIPTS)

-I'll part with the Weapon by itself with no optic or sling (will include the 5 00buck shells) for $700 firm.

-I will take $70 for the optic with protection plan firm.

-I will take $55 for the Magpul sling firm.

-For the whole package I am asking $820.00 firm. That is very fair figuring brand new everything cost me $1,019.92. And that was last month.

Serial is 67925 and everything matches.  To the best of my knowledge, it was made in 1945, but is unique in that it is built with some pre-war parts, such as the barrel and front site post.  The barrel is immaculate and looks like new with strong rifling.  The beechwood stock shows some occasional wear and markings, but nothing to be concerned about and it is also VERY SOLID AND TIGHT, no movement in the forend whatsoever, which is a concern with these rifles and barrel harmonics.  I wanted to preserve the history of the rifle and did not refinish it.  The action is very smooth, and I was surprised by the bolt.  It doesn't look ergonomic, but it is one of the fastest bolts I have ever cycled, especially when still shouldered.

It shoots 7.5x54 french, which can easily be found online or reloaded.  Surplus ammo can be found online for as low as $5 for 20 rds on stripper clips (avoid syrian ammo though, it's shitty).  You can also reload using the same load data as .308 and same powder, primers, and bullets.  Casings can EASILY be had as you can resize 6.5 swede casings, 30.06 casings, or buying PPU 7.5 brass.  This is one of the cheaper milsurp rifles to feed, aside from a 7.62x54r.

I have shot around 50 rds through this rifle with absolutely no malfunctions (except for 5 rds syrian ammo with bad primers)  It is very accurate at 100 yards, making nice round groupings with about 1-1.5 moa with french surplus ammo.  Could probably get sub moa with handloads. 

The rifle includes its original spike bayonet and a reproduction (non-leather) sling.

These rifles are somewhat rare, and definitely underrated as they never got the chance to be proven in battle with the french army. More pics available, Asking $350 OBO"

Package includes rifle, 500 rounds of ammo, Bushnell Sportsman 3x9 scope, 10 round magazine, and soft rifle case. 

Rifle has Synthetic stock in 17 Mach 2 caliber. Very good used condition. Will include 500 rounds. Valuing gun + scope + ammo around $400. Its zeroed in at 100yds. Rifle has small recoil, but the bullet actually rises an inch to 100yds, then levels out.  Very accurate and practical varmint rifle. Good for teaching wife or kids. 

With the rare ammo, this rifle needs a real collector who will allow it to gain value over the years. I'll trade for something I can take to the range every other weekend.

It is chambered in .38 Special and has a 4in Barrel. The Military & Police model was built first in 1905  - 3rd Change which was manufactured from 1909 to 1915.  This pistol was built in 1909 (Verified with the S&W Historical Department).  The pistol is in very good condition with the only real wear being from its life in a holster.  The chrome is about 85% and maybe a little better.  There is no rust and the barrel bore is very bright and free of any pits.  The pistol is cleaned and serviced, the hammer and trigger are as smooth as glass and the cylinder locks up perfectly.  The trigger in the single action position is 1.5 to 2lbs and only about 6 to 7 pounds in the double action function.  This is a classic S&W that is used just enough that you can shoot it without hurting its value.  These old frames were not built to handle hot loads so Plus-P loads should not be used in this pistol.  It's a pleasure to shoot and you can feel the quality.  I am asking $500.00 May consider other firearm trades.  5O5 440-8522

Beretta Design and Tested Performance, Engineered and Made in Italy. THESE HANDGUNS ARE GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND SINCE BERETTA RELEASED THE PRODUCTION RIGHTS TO STOEGER FOR PRODUCTION IN THE U.S.
The 8045 is an All Steel Mid Size Double Action Frame like the Beretta PX-4 with an Ambidextrous Safety like the Model 92SB. This is One of the Best ""CCW"" with Unbelievably Reduced Recoil Due to the Technologically Advanced Rotating Barrel Design. 
If you’re not familiar with the “Mini” Cougar, It can be Converted to a Full Duty Weapon with just a Change of the Magazine to the Full Size Grip Extension. It Gives You the Option (best of both worlds) of a Full Size Carry or a Compact without any Added Time or Expense; Just Change the Magazine. This is a Well Made and Accurate Handgun. 

Comes with Two Magazines. One Standard (low profile) and One Extended Grip Mag. (8 round) An Ace Left or Right Handed Convertible Holster that Holds the Extra Magazine and 100 Rounds of Ammo."

The two condo are listed with Brett/Robinson on thier rental program. You can see pics of both condos on their website under complex Seaside Beach and Racquet Club it is units 3404 and 4110. There may be some limitation to the dates because the condos are on a rental program and June and July are high dollar months so I'd prefer not to trade for times during those months.

Also, the pictures below were taken from the balcony of unit 3404. As you can see you will have a beautiful view.

Some people have expressed concerns of this being a scam. So the best way I can figure to ease your mind is once we agree upon a trade Ill reserve the condo and then you can call Brett/Robinson, which is the rental company that I let rent out my condos,  to make sure you have a reservation. They should even be able to tell you hat the owner made the reservation."
