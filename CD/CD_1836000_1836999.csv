With this you can reload: 38 Spec, 357mag, .45, .380 (I think it's same size as 9mm?), .308.

Comes with primers, powder, brass, bullets, reloading booklet, etc etc.

Few quick specs on the things I know:

Reloader is a Dillon RL-450B I think it may have an aftermarket add on that streamlines it a little better but I'm not sure. Dillon equipment does come with a lifetime warranty, and from what I hear their customer service is excellent. There is a slight issues with the primer tube. I think it's missing a few of the small plastic retainers to keep it functioning properly. 

The 308 dies are RCBS Goal Medal Dies. These are a match grade dies that allow for extreme precision. This is the only thing I'd consider selling separate, as it was over 100 new. 

Not pictured is a Dillon scale to help weigh the powder. Tumbler and media to clean the brass. 

I recently moved to Indy and am just not shooting as much as I did back home. I have no problem holding onto if it doesn't sell, but I will listen to reasonable offers.

The Beats By Dr. Dre- Beats PRO Aluminum On-Ear Headphones sell for $399 plus tax at Best Buy and Walmart. They also sell for $399 on Amazon.

FEATURES:

THE SOUND OF THE STUDIO.
Beats Pro professional headphones sound so good because they put back the quality lost in modern-day file compression. That means you're really hearing music the way it was originally heard by the artist in the studio.

CLEAR HIGHS AND DEEP LOWS.
Beats Pro are made of steel and aluminum, giving you an interior sound platform more solid than most. That's why you'll feel the kind of bass that resonates deep in your chest when you play your music.

PRACTICALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE.
No cheap plastic, no frayed cords. Beats Pro headphones are made with an aluminum gunmetal frame, encasing overstuffed leather ear cups.

TRUE NOISE REDUCTION.
Because Beats Pro headphones have heavily padded, pivoting ear cups, you get the noise cancelling effect without the need for power switches or batteries. It's the real studio monitor experience in a headphone."

When you are ready to be serious about your competitive rifles, the Colt “Pro” CRP – 18 is all about features and performance. 

You only need to look at the “standard features” to understand that standard means extraordinary to everyone else. From the match-grade, air-gaged, polished 416 stainless steel 18” custom-fluted mid-weight barrel to a forged and precision-fitted upper and lower receiver to a matched bolt and bolt carrier with H-buffer. This rifle means business. And consider that Colt competition “triple port” muzzle brake along with a Magpul MOE grip and enlarged trigger guard and Geissele two-stage match trigger breaking at 3.5 lbs and you know you also have a performer in your hands. Go ahead. Check the specs. It’s all in there. It’s time to get serious about your rifles.

Hand built in the United States.

Really not too choosy on models. Nothing smaller than a 9mm and no subcompact pistols, prefer 4""+ barrels. I do really want to find another 1911 but also like the style of the Beretta 92 and PT92. So any of those models I am definitely ready to deal with cash in hand.

I am located in Brunswick, but may be willing to travel for a good deal within a 2 hour drive. No dealers or Marketing. And please no Spam or scammers. Just looking for an honest cash deal with no games, the more accessories you have the better(extra mags, case et cetera).

Please email me with what you have and your bottom dollar you will take plus pictures if you have them or best description possible. Looking for best deal on models listed above. No hassles on my part and expect the same. I certainly won't waste your time as I hope you would feel the same. Real easy to deal with. :)"

The Rem 870 EXPRESS  when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

Don't really want to sell it, but I'm not using it nearly as much as I thought I would, and can use the money toward other things.  I bought this gun brand new last fall, and have fired exactly 40 rounds through it in one range session.  I have a bunch of loading supplies, reloading tools, ect available for purchase separately either with the gun or after the gun sells.

The gun is set up as follows:

-Remington 700 .223 Rem.  BDL setup (hinged floorplate), matte finished metal.  26"" bull barrel, 1-12"" twist rate 

-Timney 510 trigger.  Adjustable from 1.5lb to 4lb.  This specific trigger was custom tuned by Timney, so its a little bit nicer than one you'd get directly out of the package.

-Bell & Carlson M40 stock.  Specific model number is 1000-23.  It is grey with black webbing.  This stock has an aluminum bedding block.

-Simmons Whitetail Classic 6.5-20x50 scope.  Obviously not a top-of-the-line scope, but it is one of the most popular scopes, regardless of price, on Midway, and I think its a great ""bang for the buck"".  I'm not a scope snob, and I think this scope would be more than adequate for the range of a .223

-DNZ Dednutz one piece scope mount.  A real slick setup that combines the bases and rings in one setup, so the rings are guaranteed to be straight and parallel, minimizing scope movement and all but eliminating any risk of scope damage.

-Score High Benchrest Single Shot follower.  This makes benchrest work much more convenient, just drop the cartridge in the action and close the bolt, no fumbling around if you want to load one shell at a time.  Installs and removes in seconds.

-Tactical Component Mfg Mag-Xtender.  This replaces the OEM floorplate (which is included) and increases the ammunition capacity from 5 rounds to 9 rounds.  Easily interchangeable with the OEM floorplate.

-Hornady stock pack.  It is left handed, so if you don’t want/need it I can knock $30 off the price.

-Butler Creek Flip-Up scope cap covers

-Harris BRM 6-9 Notched Leg bipod, Series 1A2

Every component of this built was purchased brand new, no used parts were used.  Not interested in parting out at this point.

This gun would cost well over $1300 to replicate, and is close to a new gun as you could get without buying it new.

Willing to ship, buyer to pay actual shipping costs.

I'm happy to take additional pictures at your request or answer any questions."

If you want a compact rifle that is sure to hit the target every time this is it. This model is the sar-b18 . It has the 18"" barrel. here is what IWI has to say:

TAVOR Assault Rifles
Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a  last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.
Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability"

WARNING do not waste your time for this Bozo from Washington. I did, and I am advising you. If you want to spend over retail.... then have at it. Or if you can't get one legally this may be your chance. 
He had a listing last week for his one week old Glock 26 for $560.00. I contacted him via the phone # in his listing and asked for ""Nick"" per the listing. We agreed to meet at his house(he sent me his address) and the price of $560.00. So I drive about 20 miles and get a few blocks away and he sends me a text that he has had a family emergency and he will need to leave. Ok, things happen. So I send a text back, can we do the next day? He says yes, so I try to call on last Friday. No answer, wont reply to text message. I move on. (glad I did. Really want a Springfield XDS) Then I see his new listing for the same item this week and now the price is $660.00. So I send him a text of good luck getting that much. What fool would pay full price and tax and more from a stranger? If I am paying that much I darn sure am going to buy from a dealer ( a dealer listed the same thing the next day $549.00) who I can go back to if there is any problem. So this Bozo calls me today calling me a  broke doush. REALLY?? Saying I am too cheap and need to learn how to read.
His phone # is (253)370-518x. Not even from Texas. Looser from Seattle WA.
Here is his listing this week................... Now he is Mark. Mark, learn to type.

Brand new and has never been fired.Excellent for conceal carry,subcompact,carries 10 + 1 rounds.I am firm on the price.I also have a crossbreed Supertuck that I purchased brand new a few weeks ago if your interested but that will be a separate cost of 75$ I also have ammo available that I just picked up...I DON'T WANT A PENNY LESS THEN WHAT IM ASKING OR ELSE FIND A GUN WITH THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE.LEAVE YOUR NAME AND NUMBER AND ILL FET BACK TO YOU.

 Mark 
....................................................................................................................................
Mark or Nick or whatever your name is, you need to go back to the left coast. Acting like this, you won't make it in Texas. Good luck getting every penny. 

If anyone wants a copy of his texting, let me know.... I do not lie. I am a man, not a child.
One more thing........ I asked him why are you selling this brand new gun. He replied that his girlfriend would not stand for it. That he had to get rid of it or she was leaving. Dude, grow some balls and show her the door."

I have decided to part with one of my Mosin Nagant PU snipers.

This is not a reproduction or one of the CAI (Century) put togethers.

If you know about Mosin PU sniper rifles you may also know that 1942 is a rare and very difficult to find production year (because of it being a transitional year from PE and PEM sniper production) as PU sniper production didn't start until later in that year.

This rifle is all stamped matching with the letter prefix's although the magazine floorplate has been lined out and renumbered to match.

It is a wartime issue rifle and unlike many others this PU rifle may have a history behind it.

The scope is numbers matching to the mount and rifles barrel shank.

Bore and crown are in good condition with no counter-bore.

More pic.s are available to seriously interested parties.

So if you want an good example of a WW2 PU sniper rifle that few people can say they own, this one may be for you.

I would like $800 for this very collectable and shootable rifle and I am looking for a FTF sale in the Richmond, Virginia (Tri-Cities) area but may travel a short distance to help with the sale.

Last picture is of this rifle in a more natural setting."

A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V-shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenges of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition. 
ArmaLite's great .50 has been refined, with smoother action, attractive new bolt stop, and even greater strength than the original AR-50.  The same great accuracy, but now even more Beautiful.

This rifle has been out of stock at Armalite for the past year and there are only 2 other rifles for sale in the US on Armslist. Supply and Demand is dictating the small premium on this rifle.

I have accumulated a fair number of scopes over the years and figure it is time to let go some of the ones that do not have a home.

All of the scopes have been used some and have some exterior wear. As far as I know all the scopes are in working condition and the glass is in good shape, but most have not been used for years. Each scope with IR will come with a fresh battery.

I have tried to provide accurate links for more detailed descriptions, where possible, but some models may have changed between the time I purchased them and the last update in the link.

Note: If a scope is shown in rings, those rings will come with the scope.

I'll sell it with 2 snap caps and the original leather Boyt case (it's really beat up). The gun itself is in great condition for a gun of this age and must have sat in a safe because other than the recoil pad being compressed, there is only minimal wear. While this may be a collectors item to some, it is a very huntable rifle and produces tight groups. If you're thinking of buying it, you probably already know all about it. First $1,000 takes it, no deals, no bartering unless you live in the Northern Virginia area and are trying to get rid of a duck boat.
