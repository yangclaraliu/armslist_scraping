That alone changes the market on Armslist dramatically.  The fact you have to walk into a gunshop sucks but since you do why dont you realize Sellers that gun dealers  are selling your Glock , M&P , 1911 cheaper than you are here.  So sellers I know it sucks , but keep in mind your loaded 1911 can be had for much less than you are asking for here.  If you sale a  pistol or rifle with mags that carry 15 rounds or more they cant legally come with the firearm. I hate the laws, however  I certainly dont want us to loose armlist or hurt the cause to ovrrturn this nonsense.  So in closing lets price things fairly and carefully.  We can still trade , but of  course that has to be done at an FFL. If you guys know of FFLs that will help us through this garbage please share. But folks be aware the gungrabbers are out there so be careful and dont shoot yourselves in the foot.  I miss trading on my off time on Armslist, hopefully will be doing this again soon."

Keller

I listed this before, but since I got it in a trade, I decided I better remove the post and take it to the range before I sold it.  Apologies to anyone who made an offer previously.  

I believe in describing equipment accurately, so here is what I know about this gun.

-The handguard is aftermarket, because no Bushmaster that I know of comes stock with this type.  
-I put a new milspec buffer tube, detent spring, castle nut, retention plate and Magpul Stock on it ($125).
-The barrel is 16"" without the suppressor and 18"" with it, and the suppressor is pinned.
-Bi-pod is bolted to the handguard, and the legs fold forward with spring assistance.
-There is a small scratch on the lower receiver (see picture).  I removed the touch-up paint on it...ridiculous.  Those of you who use that stuff aren't fooling anyone btw.
-The case deflector paint is scuffed (see picture)
-It's one of the smoothest shooting, most accurate AR's I've fired.  Very very good recoil absorption...better than my Sig or RRA.  Really very little kick at all.   Open sight grouping at 50 yards was excellent.  I enjoyed shooting it so much I considered keeping it, but I don't need a 4th one. 

Please let me know if you have any questions."

The rifle has been professionally Cerakoted in Burnt Bronze and Black; if you aren't familiar with Cerakote, it is by far the most durable, corrosion-resistant, rust-resistant, abrasion-resistant coating on the market. Simply put, it is a high dollar armor coating for your rifle. 

*** I will sell extra mags and/or ammo to the buyer for a discounted price if they choose so (as pictured below). I have 24 additional magazines total available (all 30rd): there are 9 PMAG's, 10 unissued steel GI mags--the same mags currently issued to the Army, and 5 Clinton-era Mil/LE-Restricted steel mags. In addition to them, approximately 700 rounds of .223/5.56 ammo are also available. There are 30 rounds of Remington soft point and ballistic tip hunting type cartridges, and the rest is Wolf 62gr hollow point .223.***

You can call or text me at 865-766-755five. Texting is much quicker and easier; please leave a voicemail if you call and I don't answer. Please NO EMAILS!! They tend to go to my spam folder. I REALLY want to trade for a Springfield M1A in either the full size or preferably the Scout length, or I could include all of the ammo and mags for an M1A in a Sage EBR chassis. Aside from those, I would just prefer cash. I will gladly ship everything to the FFL of your choosing if you cannot meet locally. Feel free to text me for more pictures or with any questions you may have. Thanks for looking and God bless!"

I'm asking $725.00 and you'll get the ammo as well, no going to cabelas at the crack of dawn and waiting in line just to hope you can find ammo in stock. I also have the 5 empty cases so if you reload you'll have 60 brass total!!

Preferably with scope. 

I have (2) 1911s I would trade for the rifle. I would only be willing to trade (1) of the pistols, not both. 

First is a Springfield Armory 1911-A1. I got it in trade a little while ago and it was completely reworked by a previous owner. All Wilson combat parts: Trigger, barrel bushing, full length guide rod, spring kit, hammer, beavertail, main spring housing. Serial number is from Feb 1987 according to Springfield. No markings for assembly outside US like many Springfield 1911s. Comes with some extras.

Second would be a Colt Officer's ACP. Fairly rare 1911. Most are stainless but this one is parkerized. Haven't been able to specifically date but from what I can find it is around 1992. Entire spring kit has been swapped out with Wolfe springs. Have all the original pieces. If you do research you might find that these are the original Colt small frame 1911. 3.5"" barrel and shortened magazine well allow it to be far more concealable then your typical 5"" 1911. Also comes with extras."

The clipdraw is what you need! Made from specially tempered spring steel with black powder coated finish. The mounting plate can be located for preferred depth of carry, low for maximum concealment, high for maximum accessibility. The “Universal” Clipdraw attaches in seconds with 3M Corp. #4941 VHB (very high bond) double coated tape. VHB tape is used in the construction and aircraft industries as a replacement for rivets. It provides a 20 lb. continuous bond that resists oil, solvents, heat and vibration. Heavy recoil and rapid slide movement have no effect on the bond strength between gun and Clipdraw. The Clipdraw stays solidly in place with adhesion actually increasing over time. The “Universal” Clipdraw consists of two parts. The mounting plate attaches to the gun with the double coated tape. The clip part screws to the mounting plate with two 1/8″ button head screws.

Included with each Universal Clipdraw are:

    Six strips of tape (one required and five extras)
    Six alcohol prep pads for cleaning surfaces prior to applying the tape

The slide has been cnc'd, with two large side windows, and the front of the slide has been milled on the bottom into an angle which takes away the blocky look.  The frame has been stippled, trigger guard has double undercut and trigger guard also slightly rounded.  The backstrap angle has been slightly reduced as well.  The slide has been drilled and tapped up top and a Burris Fastfire II is mounted directly to the slide.  The barrel is a match lone wolf 6-port.  Trigger is the zev-tech fulcrum trigger, which is adjustable for over and pretravel.  The striker has been replaced with a polished striker and safety plunger has been replaced with a polished titanium plunger.  All springs have been replaced dropping the trigger pull to an average of 3.5lbs.  The gun will come with several diff springs an connectors so you can adjust the weight as you like.  The plastic captured guide rod has been replaced with a tungsten non-captured guide rod which was cut to length since the front of the slide has been milled.  Several different weight recoil springs will be included as well.  The gun currently has a 13lb spring installed.  Gun was cerakoted back to black after machine work, the fulcrum trigger is black with a red safety.  The recoil spring is red as well which gives the gun just enough of a second color to contrast well.  Ejector and extractor have both been upgraded.  Extractor was replaced with a hardened piece and ejector is a zev-tech hardened titanium ejector.  Bottom of grip is fitted with 6oz backstrap plug mated to a polished dawson ice magwell.  I think that is everything that has been done or added.  It would cost approx. $2,500.00 to build this gun which is roughly what I have invested.  I am only selling to fund another similar project to a long slide M&P.  I have a glock 20 and 32 that are modded similar as well and are a blast to shoot like this 34.  Gun will come with 2 17rnd mags and 1 33 round mag.  I placed a feeler ad a couple months ago for $2300.00 and I know that is a insane amount of money for a Glock but I have spent a insane amount of money to build this pistol.  I got alot of interest before and thought I had it sold a couple of times but at the last minute the people couldnt come up with the funds.  I had prob 100 people text mke wanting more pictures and asking a thousand questions.  I ask that people only contact me who have a serious interest in buying the gun.  I am lowering price to a more realistic $1200, which yes is still insane, but almost a $1000.00 loss and about all of the loss I am willing to take.  Email replys dont work well for me so I ask anyone to TEXT, 704-902-NINE-TWO-EIGHT-ZERO, who is interested and wants more pics.  Would also consider selling the slide by itself or trading just the slide.  Thanks for looking!! No Shipping"

The clipdraw is what you need! Made from specially tempered spring steel with a silver finish. The mounting plate can be located for preferred depth of carry, low for maximum concealment, high for maximum accessibility. The “Universal” Clipdraw attaches in seconds with 3M Corp. #4941 VHB (very high bond) double coated tape. VHB tape is used in the construction and aircraft industries as a replacement for rivets. It provides a 20 lb. continuous bond that resists oil, solvents, heat and vibration. Heavy recoil and rapid slide movement have no effect on the bond strength between gun and Clipdraw. The Clipdraw stays solidly in place with adhesion actually increasing over time. The “Universal” Clipdraw consists of two parts. The mounting plate attaches to the gun with the double coated tape. The clip part screws to the mounting plate with two 1/8″ button head screws.

Six alcohol prep pads for cleaning surfaces prior to applying the tape

I have a very nice P238 for sale. It probably has 300 rounds through it. It does have factory tritium night sights that are bright. I can't find a cosmetic blemish on it. Please see the photos. In the photos there looks like a slight scratch on the left side of the slide but the mark wiped off with a rag. This is a great carry pistol and I just don't carry it enough. Someone else should enjoy it. If you're looking for a high-quality, deep-concealment pistol, look no farther. The recoil is very light on it too, much better than the Kel-Tec P3AT/Ruger LCP.

It includes:
- P238 pistol
- Original box & papers
- 4 magazines (2 SIG factory and 2 Colt Mustang which work great)
- High Noon Holsters Hidden Ally
- Hogue green grips (these feel great)
- Original SIG rosewood grips
- SIG factory plastic belt holster

 TriStar's NEW TEC 12 Pump/Auto Home Defense 12ga Shotgun is nothing short of amazing.  This shotgun is designed to utilize two actions on the same frame.  The TEC 12 is capable of operating in PUMP mode and in Semi-Auto mode by just the turn of a dial.  The 3"" Chambered TEC 12 uses an inertia Rotary Bolt for smooth action response (in semi-auto).  The TEC 12 is finished in Matte Black and features a picatinny rail mounted on the receiver, ghost ring sight and raised front bridge sight with a fiber optic bead, black synthetic stock with rubber fixed pistol grip, plus 1 set of military sling swivels and one set of swivel studs installed.  The TEC 12 also has an External Ported Cylinder Choke and is backed by TriStar's 5 Year Warranty.

It has only had about 200 rounds through it. It comes with all the original equipment (Laminated stock, 10 round mag, weaver rail, soft case, box, manual, etc...). As you can see I put it in a new stock making it lighter and shorter overall length. I also added an extra long picatinny rail in place of the original rail. I ran this setup with a red dot or scope on top and the 45 degree sights to the side (sights not for sale)...made for very versatile and quick sighting system. Internally, i added in a volquartsen recoil buffer, volquartsen extractor, and volquartsen target hammer. The target hammer made the trigger really nice...thats about it.
I decided I wanted to sell it to purchase a bolt .22lr, so all this accumulation is my loss and your gain. I do have a few Butler Creek Steel lip magazines that I am selling independently. If you want one or two I will hold one for you to buy if you buy this pistol. Yes, legally this is a pistol not a short barreled rifle :)."

M1903A4 Sniper Rifle Remington


First all, this is not an original but one produced by Rock Ridge Machine Works, Ephrata PA.
I obtained the rifle from James River Armory.    
(It is NOT a Gibbs Rifle and Not a Drill Gun receiver)

Rifle Serial Number puts it as a Original 1942 Remington 1903A3 
Scope is a Hi-Lux Optics M73G2 Scope
New Criterion Barrel stamped RR 2012
Nice Beautiful reproduction Leather Scope cover (not seen in photos but WILL BE included)
1907 Military Leather Sling
Printed Copy of the TM 9-270 Tech Manual for the M1903A4 rifle

I already have one that is identical since I bought 2 of these one 
I've been using in matches and competition shoots
and don't need a second one is my only reason I am looking to trade out.

This particular rifle has only been fired with 15 rds. I was at the range late
and was burning daylight, so I fire 6 rds to make sure I was on paper then
fired 9 rds at 100 yds to check scope adjustment.  I ran out of daylight and
had not had a chance to finish fine tuning the scope. I know with fine tuning
of the scope the group will tighten up even more to be a fine group as is my other
rifle.

Trade Value: $ TRADED

Trades should be close as possible to equal value
or supplemented with ammo, or accessories


Thanks for viewing and have a great day ....

I ran this setup with a red dot or scope on top and the 45 degree sights to the side (sights not for sale)...made for very versatile and quick sighting system. Internally, i added in a volquartsen recoil buffer, volquartsen extractor, and volquartsen target hammer. The target hammer made the trigger really nice...thats about it.
I decided I wanted to sell it to purchase a bolt .22lr, so all this accumulation is my loss and your gain. I do have a few Butler Creek Steel lip magazines that I am selling independently.

I also have the Swift 688M Premier 6-18x44mm Mil-Dot Rifle scope on my 223 tc and i believe this scope is better than my Nikon Buckmaster 6-18x40 mil-dot which is on my 300 win tc.and better than my Leupold VX-3 6.5-20 AO on my 280 rem..
These are not for sale, just wanted to say how i feel about the Swift quality scopes they make...I truly believe Swift premiers are great scopes.

The Helical feed magazine can be loaded and stored indefinitely without spring fatigue. The carbine has virtually no muzzle climb, even with rapid firing. Spent cases are ejected straight down in front of the trigger guard for close quarter operation. This is very important in a combat or law enforcement tactical operation as shells ejecting to the right give away your position.

990,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1843990,For Sale:  New Magpul MS4 QD push button multi-mission tactical sling Olive Drab / OD Green RARE,"Santa Monica, Los Angeles, California",$ 49,"Listed On: Monday, December 2, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand new Magpul MS4 QD sling in OLIVE DRAB / GREEN color. 

No packaging but guaranteed to be new and unused. 100% AUTHENTIC, NOT A KNOCKOFF.

The Olive Drab color is only made as a pre-production dealer sample so far, it is unknown if Magpul will enter full scale production in this color which makes this sling exceptionally rare. I was lucky to score this through a friend at one of the big tactical distributors but I don't really have a need for it so I'm letting it go. Secondary prices are upwards of $100 for these green color slings on auction sites like eBay. I'm asking only $49 US, free shipping included..."
