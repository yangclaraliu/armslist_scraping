Info:
The Calico M960 is a 9x19mm (Luger/Parabellum) caliber semi-automatic carbine (fully automatic versions are available to authorized law enforcement and military), manufactured by Calico Light Weapons Systems. Its unique features include its high-capacity, cylindrical, helical-feed magazine and retractable stock. This method allows magazine capacities of 50 and 100 rounds in a relatively small space, making it ideal for law enforcement and special operations units. One of the most interesting aspects of the carbine is that the rear sight is mounted as part of the plastic magazine shell.

""The shotgun was lightly used for one season, and became a safe queen.""

The Citori XT Trap is a serious trap gun. And if you are looking at buying the one shown above, then you probably know more about trap shooting than a lot of us. We all know that shooting trap is great  fun -- but at the same time it can become serious business. Competition becomes heated and the pressure can be severe. The Citori XT Trap is not guaranteed to score more hits, but this model quickly becomes a natural extension of your arms and shoulder, helping you to get on the target faster, with clean, complete follow-through. It swings easily, deliberately, naturally. With its vented side ribs, ported barrel and high post rib, it immediately becomes your own personal trap gun.

The XT Trap also has a beautifully sculptured Monte Carlo stock that goes beyond good looks by raising your eye level with the rib so you have a bit more of a head up view of the bird -- something that can improve scores and essential in doubles trap.

The comfortable finger grooves along the forearm, three Invector-Plus™ choke tubes and the Triple Trigger™ System, all contribute to the ease of shooting you need to compete and have fun -- without ever having to complain about your shotgun.

This firearm performs flawlessly!  The only issue I guess I've had was with some really cheap low brass and since this is inertia driven for the action there wasn't enough powder to fully cycle the next round.  It has seen some use but it is in very good shape.  There was some minor surface rust due to the dehumidifier stopped working in the gun safe/room last summer while we were out of town for a couple weeks and we didn't catch it right away.  I have taken pictures of the worst part near the end of the barrel.  Feel free to shoot me any questions that you might have.  If you would like pictures of internals etc I'd be happy to email anything like that to you.  I may entertain some offers but please no low-ballers.  I am also open to trades for or towards double guns such as O/U and SxS in 12 or 20 gauge.

Of course I would expect you to try before you buy so you don't end up like me selling on armslist. The holster says IWI and Jericho on the side.

This rifle is still in the factory box, and I've actually only opened it once (to take pictures for this add and to make sure nothing was missing). I ordered the gun on a wait list a few months ago but then ended up finding another one locally and jumped on it in case any bans happened, and then this one came in, so now I have two. My ask price is basically what I paid, which is not a bad price for such a nice firearm (especially in the current market). I've fired plenty of fine AR-15's (LMT, DD, Colt), and let me say that my other KAC is the smoothest-firing, most well-balanced, best weapon I have ever handled.

Email me with questions, and I'll provide my phone number for any serious buyers who want to discuss. I will ship to an FFL dealer or meet for an in-person transaction. If you're interested, we'll figure out details that work for both of us."

It is not a salt wood, but has three areas of mild corrosion which is indicative of spending its life in the PNW. The magazine well and trigger guard are perfect with no corrosion. It has been very well controlled and I oil it regularly to keep it from getting worse. One other issue is that someone has engraved the trigger guard in front of the magazine well with the initials RLR. 
This is a gun from a WA resident and really enjoy, but I already have a new T-Bolt that I use more often so this one goes. 
Shoots great with the stock Browning peep sight. The 5 round magazine is included, but fits kinda tight in the reciever, so you need to wiggle it a little to get it out. Stock is in great shape and shows almost no wear. I am asking $500 for this neat little piece of history.
I would like to only do FTF transactions, I have had some bad experiences mailing guns and would not like to repeat that, in the Fort Lewis area of Western WA. I am not looking for trades since I am selling these guns in order to trim down my collection, thanks.

It will go with the factory CASE, 2 MAGS, cleaning TOOL, HOLSTER, MAG HOLSTER and all papers. I can also include a MILT SPARKS VERSA MAX 2 leather IWB holster. The gun is like new. let me know if you have any questions. I live in Columbus and have my CCW.


The Springfield Armory Lightweight Champion Operator 1911 is an all-business pistol for carry or combat. It has a black hardcoat anodized aluminum frame for light weight, and a forged steel slide with an Armory Kote finish to minimize holster wear.

The Cocobolo hardwood grips feature the Springfield Armory logo, and complement the black finish of the pistol very nicely.

The frame is constructed with an integral universal accessory rail for lasers, tactical lights or other accessories. (Please note that a Picatinny or 1913 rail is not the same as a Glock style rail, and devices made for the Picatinny or 1913 rails will not fit on universal rails. See photos).

The sights on the Champion Operator are combat style with rounded edges. Three tritium dots on the sights make picking up targets in daylight or darkness equally easy.

The pistol has a 4"" match grade bull barrel with a fully supported ramp. The trigger is match grade as well, with a pull weight of 4.5 to 5 pounds. The trigger is slightly longer than on most 1911's, allowing most shooters to place the pad of their trigger finger directly on the trigger face.

An ambidextrous safety allows right and left handed shooters to operated the lever easily.

At just 31 ounces, and just 7.5"" in length, the Lightweight Champion Operator will be a comfortable gun to carry in a holster or pocket, and its features will make it easy for every shooter to use.

Sporter version. As can be seen in pic your typical sporter sks had a shortened barrel, bayonet lug removed, thumbhole stock and adapted to accept ak mags which redesigned the bolt carrier with no stripper clip slots. The sporter I am selling has a non thumbhole stock and does not accept ak mags.  Is full size barrel with bayonet and does use stripper clips for loading. It's 100% matching, original and real. Have green sling, cleaning kit that fits in stock, screwdriver type bayonet. Comes with between 400 rounds of various steel cased ammo.  I have owned for over 22 years. Less than 500 rounds shot thru it. Well taken care of and pristine condition. Again all numbers match. Is stamped Tucson AZ. Is also a legit DB stamp. Here's the history:

In 1989 sks were stamped sporter or sks-m to be allowed for import after a 1989 ban. These rifles were fitted with Monte Carlo or thumbhole stocks. Also made and adapted to accept ak mags. Also had the bayo lug removed. The rifle I have has had none of the cosmetic changes yet is stamped sporter. Plus it has the DB stamp. That means deport Bangladesh. Some Chinese made sks were stamped this or DP(Pakistan) or DK(Kampuchea). DP typically adds 10% value. DK about 15-20%. And the most rare DB adding up to 50% based on condition. Many DP have been forged to appear DB. They are easy to tell due to the mis proportion of the humps of the B. so the sporter mis-stamp, DB stamp and #'s matching drives it to a collectors rifle. 
And when I mention the 1989 ban I don't mean the 1994 awb. 

Also another change was the bolt carrier was changed on sporters with no slots for striped clips since they used ak removable mags and no stripper clip was needed. 
Most sporters had barrels shortened too."

The firearm craze has passed and if you have'nt noticed no one is paying those prices anymore. I was at the New Bern gun show today and dealers had tons and tons of AR's and AK's and their prices were back to normal and no one was buying them, so don't think b/c you have a gun you paid twice the retail price for that your gonna get your money out of it. You made a panic buy and your not alone, alot of people did the same thing. So you are either gonna have to suck it up and take a hit or live with your purchase. 

The bottom line is the market is flooded right now and unless you are one of those poeple with more money than common sense your not gonna spend well above retail or even MSRP for a AK or AR. Just look at Armslist, the number of listings has 300 times above it's norm.

Sorry........,just shot Frosty out in the front yard with this. He wasn't doing anything wrong poor guy....,just mad 'cause I can't keep my new toy (I have to mention I was also thinking of some of the economic decisions being made for us by our wise officials. Just got this thing all decked out and had to pay or a truck repair. I digress....Frosty ain't doing so hot
anymore because this thing works AWESOME!!!
Comes with...............,
-Strikeforce Desert Tan Folding Stock
-40 round Tapco magazine
-Sun Optics receiver mounted see through SKS scope mount.
-Sightmark Holograph Sight with 4 reticle selection ($160 one, not one of the $40 economy ones)
-100 rounds of ammo
-The piece of mind that you can fight off the ""zombie invasion""when TSHTF
-The piece of mind that all the stores that I know of have plenty of cheap ammo for this IN STOCK
-A few stray ""Dremel"" marks where I modified the stock to accommodate the scope mount.
(not ugly-but then again, no one ever claimed an SKS was pretty to begin with)
-Shoots great! (did I mention Frosty?)
-The nice warm feeling of knowing that this isn't in the hands of a pinko commie anymore and is
now owned by a PATRIOT that'll use it for whatever he feels he/she must because the 2nd Amendment says it's your RIGHT!
If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750. If you don't like it....you're free to write ""hate emails"" from yer mommy's basement because THIS IS AMERICA!!! I can then delete them and laugh at your sad, poor self.
Seriously....,if you want this, email me stating your intention to buy, a number that I can call or text, and be prepared to show a valid form of ID and sign a Bill of Sale, because I'm ONLY SELLING to a LEGAL, law-abiding CITIZEN! Thanks for playing....,and next time......get out and vote because this crap is getting ridiculous!"

What ever happened to live and let live? Your opinion is all that matters and you think you have the right to impose it on others? You people making posts about flagging and gougers are as ignorant and shameful as it gets. The lowest of the low. It is a well known fact that power corrupts and you people are like a dirty cops, authority abusers. All of you deserve some rotten dirty cop to beat you down and then arrest you for assaulting their fist with your face while they make sure the dash cam video comes up missing and ruin your life. Trust me that is how it works, I know. And you are no better than that. What makes this country the greatest is freedom of choice, free will, free market economy, capitalism, et c. That is what our brothers and fathers and grandfathers fought for and fight for and have died to protect and when you whine and cry and do as one of these such posters literally stated to me tonight, and I quote...We'll see. Watch the gouger's listings. They are dropping like flys because me and several others flag them as a scam as soon as we see them. If they repost, we'll flag them again. I simply think that they are sorry ass gougers and ""I will do everything I can to keep them from making a sale at those prices. That's the bottom line.""... you spit on their graves and on everything that made this country what it once was. What a pathetic person. You know who you are that emailed that to me. If I posted your name here would you be proud of that statement and own up to it?? You are trying to control what others can do, you are trying to take away the rights of others. You are no better than the scum that is trying to take way both my rights and your own every day now in this country and you will reap what you sow. The fight is on and you are on the wrong side, you are just as bad as they are. You are trying to regulate a free market system which is ruled by supply and demand and nothing else. You sound like a bunch of socialists without even knowing it. You are sad, sorry, pathetic, and just begging for bad karma in the worst of way that you do not even understand. When they take away your rights, you effing deserve it for trying to do the same thing to others because you are sore losers and too ignorant to even realize what you are doing. You have the right to buy or pass, but NOT to control or ""allow"" someone else to post or buy or sell. You are shameful. Shut up, suck it up, and quit trying to regulate what others can do you sh*t for brainses. By the way, when you post your commentary and flag these ads and try to control what others want to do it is actually you youself that are the ones violating the TOS. It is your posts that should be flagged (and mine as well) since they are opinion only and not for an item for sale. YOU are the ones I flag and I will be the first to flag this post MYSELF lol since it is not a listing for an item for sale and I am not a hypocrite like you. Who the F do you dirtbag power tripping lowlifes think you are to say your opinions are the only one that matters and try to impose your beliefs on others in the free market. By the way if you werent too stupid to know how there are plenty of guns and ammo available at the old prices if you spend the effort to learn where, you are just dumb and lazy and think you deserve it handed to you. Nobody owes you anything. You suck. Get over yourselves."

Absolutely no Tauruses or Rugers, and im not interested in selling nor shipping the laptop. The Apple MacBook Air ""Core 2 Duo"" 1.86 13"" (NVIDIA/Late 2008) is powered by a 1.86 GHz Intel ""Core 2 Duo"" processor (SL9400) with two independent processor ""cores"" on a single chip with a 6 MB on-chip shared level 2 cache running on a 1066 MHz frontside bus.

It features 2 GB of onboard 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM, a 128 GB Solid-State Drive (SSD), a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M ""graphics processor with 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory"", an integrated iSight video camera, a full-size backlit keyboard with ambient light sensor, and a 13.3"" widescreen TFT LED backlit active-matrix ""glossy"" display (1280x800 native resolution) in a razor thin (0.16-0.76 inch), three pound, aluminum case.

Connectivity includes AirPort Extreme (802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, a single USB 2.0 port, analog audio out, and video out capabilities (Mini DisplayPort) that support an external 30"" display. It lacks Ethernet (an external adapter is available), Firewire, and optical audio in/out.

The MacBook Air ""Core 2 Duo"" 1.86 13"" (NVIDIA/Late 2008) uses the same housing as the original model -- with the same 13.3"" display, full-size keyboard and single button, ""three-finger"" trackpad. Internally, it likewise lacks an optical drive, the battery is not designed to be removable, and the memory cannot be upgraded beyond the onboard 2 GB, but it has a number of internal improvements as well including a marginally faster processor (in this model), faster NVIDIA graphics, a faster architecture with a faster system bus, and faster memory, and a larger L2 cache. It additionally ships equipped with a larger SSD and swaps the mini-DVI port for a new Mini DisplayPort standard."

I will also CONSIDER TRADES! so feel free to send me a message with an offer. I have sold these from $500 - $900+. I will build your laser to your wants.

I am selling 2W-3W high powered 445nm blue laser. The laser will be built to your wants. This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and this must be treated as a gun, If it hits you in the eye directly or from reflection YOU CAN LOOSE YOUR VISION PERMANENTLY. This laser will cause things to burn within a 10' distance and can even catch things on fire. It produces a blue visible beam the resembles a light saber. You can not purchase a laser like this in any store! 

I have one picture showing different colors of lasers I can make. This laser is the second beam from the right.


This laser has a safe run time of 45secs-1min, then it needs to be turned off to cool for 1 minute. This insures the diode does not overheat and prolongs the life of the laser. 


With the laser you will receive 2 pairs of safety glasses w/hard case, which blocks this wavelength of light. These must be worn inside due to high risks or reflection and the dot's welding arc brightness. You will also receive the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and the charger for them."
