The die set has both the full length and neck sizing die along with the bullet seating die. The factory crimp die does a better crimp than the roll crimp which can be done with the bullet seating die.   I also have 195 cci large rifle magnum primers and 114 cci large rifle primers.  I'd like to trade for some small rifle primers or a dillon super swager. As far as trading for primers, I'd trade the primers I have for small rifle primers 1 to 1.  I value the deluxe rifle die set at $30 since it is virtually brand new, I've maybe loaded 150 rounds with it.  The factory crimp die I would value at $10, it has also loaded around 150 rounds.  I'll take cash for the dies and crimp die, or I would trade them for 1,000 small rifle primers. Before all the price gouging on reloading supplies a brick of 1,000 primers could usually be bought for around $30-$35 so I think that's a fair trade for the dies.  I'd also be willing to trade for powder, specifically H335, reloder 15 or power pistol. I'd put a trade value of $20-$25 on the powder.  I'd also accept .223 Remington or 5.56 NATO brass, we can work out a quantity depending on which items you're interested in.  Thanks for looking and I look forward to any and all offers.

The composit stock was cammo'd and looks pretty good so I tore it down and used some expensive antique goldish colored paint and covered the muzzle. I figured it would be a great wall hanger.   I polished up the rest.  It looks great in my opinion.  It is still a fully funtioning muzzleloader but customized.  Some people don't like to vary from factory finish but I had no choice other than to spend whatever $$ to take it to a gun smith and have it done professionaly and that just ain't gonna happen.  It's a durable finish and I sure wouldn't be afraid to take it in the field.  If you want a good looking, fully funtional Thompson, look no further.  I gotcha covered.

The CAMMENGA MODEL EM3-556 EASYMAG is a heat-treated steel magazine, with tip-proof steel follower, chamfered feed lips, and a stainless steel main spring, which improves upon the reliability and feeding performance expectations for M16 and AR-15 type weapons. Built to last with high-strength 1050 spring-steel finished with a two layer anti-friction coating. The EASYMAG features an open case design that allows for fast loading, unloading, and cleaning. The front half can be unlocked and opened to facilitate rapid loading without the aid of a loading device. The EASYMAG also accepts stripper clips and can be quickly cleaned without disassembly. Also works great with Bump fire!

Heat-Treated 1050 Steel construction is highly resistant to deformation and maintains critical dimensions. This increases the EASYMAG’s service life, feeding performance, and reliability compared to any similar magazine designs. Continuous curve geometry design provides optimal feeding performance and dramatically reduces the likelihood of malfunctions in battlefield environments. Slide-open design allows for rapid loading, unloading, cleaning, maintenance, and inspection without disassembly.
Accepts standard 10 round stripper clips, spoons, and other loading devices.

These magazines were going for nearly $30 before the scare. I am only asking $17 per magazine.  I prefer to meet face to face but I will ship these at the buyer's expense if necessary. I have quite a few of these so I will consider trades for firearms. Cash is preferred. Thanks for looking."

The slide is made from stamped steel, and has a separate breech block held within the slide by the cross-pin. The frame is made from aluminum. The trigger is double action, with external hammer and a decocking lever on the left side of the frame. There's no manual safety, but P245 is provided with automatic firing pin safety."

They are perfectly cut, galvanized so they won't rust, and don't have sharp edges.  None were ever shot at (not that it would even matter.)  I was also considered using them as long range gong targets for a 50 BMG.  

I don't know for sure, but my guess is that the only cartridge that would penetrate the thick ones at any distance would be a 50 BMG.  The thin plates will stop all pistol rounds at any distance, and most rifle rounds.

This is a good starter press. If you eliminate the priming system, & use primed brass (or prime your brass with a Lee Auto Prime), it will produce consistent loads, at about 300/hour. If you use primed brass, be sure to remove the de-priming rod from your re-sizing die.

Included; are 5 tool heads, & two powder measurers, with a micro adjustable charge bar, & set of pre-set charge bars for each.

A case collater, & several bullet feeders. Two shell plates, a package of case feed tubes, & a Multi Tube Adapter Set.

It is chambered for the .223 Remington and features a 18"" barrel with AR-15 style flash hider. The Galil is a modified and improved version of the famous Kalashnikov (AK47) design. It was specifically manufactured to fire the .223 cartridge and to function flawlessly in the arid (and sandy) desert environment of the Middle East. The Galil was selected as the weapon of choice by the Israeli Defense Forces, beating out the M16A1, AK47, and HK33 among others. Other features include a milled receiver, wood handguard, folding carry handle, integral bipod, AK style safety w/ additional left-side thumb safety, and heavy duty side-folding stock.

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at info@freerepublicfirearms or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."
