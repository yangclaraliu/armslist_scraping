49,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1112049,For Sale:  VLTOR MUR Upper Receiver w/ Bolt Assist and Deflector,"Houston, Houston, Texas",$ 199,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 20, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. 

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today. 

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available. 

The MUR comes in two models: one with a Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector and the second with a Shell Deflector only. All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door. 

Construction:
7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved; heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment.

Compatibility: 
Fits all AR-type lower receivers made to Milspec standards. Will fit all select-fire AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. Will fit most of the semi-auto AR-type lower receivers (currently available).

Weight:
MUR-1A (with assist) weighs less than 10 oz. The MUR-1S (shell deflector only) weighs less than 8 oz.

Dimensions:
Height of rail (from the centerline of the bore): 1.215”.

Color/Finish:
Black matte (anti-reflection/glare) Hard coat anodized (Type-III, Class 2). Bore’s surface in coated with dry film lube, over the anodized surface.

Special Features:
Improved strength over conventional forged “flat-top” upper receivers. Stronger than any “billet” upper receiver with similar material and dimensional characteristics. Tighter manufacturing tolerances, when compared to the competition."

Sadly i have to sell due to financial hardship from my parents passing away. i have installed hogue grips but i also have the original G10 grips as well as another set of custom grips. Also included with this gun is the case, a Sticky front pocket holster, 1 extended magazine and 1 factory magazine, 1 box of FMJ ammo and 1 box of Golden Saber hollow point ammo. I am a former U.S Marine and i take great care of my firearms. None the less this one is practically brand new. If your looking for something to carry in your gym shorts, purse, or bra then this is the perfect carry. Especially useful for the summer months. Buyer must have Carry Conceal Permit, or Government ID, or Law Enforcement ID. Serious Inquiries Only, $850.00 or best offer. Cash Only. Contact me if interested. Stay Safe, Stay Aware. Thanks"

Prefer to sell together. These are Magpul's most expensive magazine so I'm not price gouging! Gen3 Emag with dual windows.  Lightweight molded polymer magazine combines features of Magpul’s popular PMAG with exterior dimensions engineered to meet NATO STANAG 4179 compatibility requirements. The EMAG (Export MAGazine) is fully compatible with all AR-15/M16 variants, HK 416, FN SCAR, SA-80, Beretta ARX-160, IMI Tavor, and other .223/5.56mm weapons that use AR-type mags. The crush-resistant, one-piece body of fiberglass-reinforced molded polymer has a slim, unribbed exterior that ensures it’ll fit in magazine pouches and couplers designed for USGI M16 magazines. The EMAG has the same sealed, constant-curve body and self-lubricating anti-tilt follower as the PMAG, and even accepts the PMAG Ranger Floorplate (available separately). A MagLevel window on the left side with numeric indicators (5, 15, and 25 rounds) molded into the body and a bright orange marker on the spring provide instant visual feedback on ammo status. Stainless steel spring is coated with a tough MIL-DTL-13924D black oxide finish. Quick-release, snap-on cover protects the top round and seals out dirt, while preventing mag lip stretching during long periods of storage fully loaded. When the mag is loaded in a rifle, the cover can be snapped over the floorplate to prevent loss; also serves as a floorplate removal tool and a gauge for checking feed lip gap. Flared floorplate removes easily for cleaning and provides a pronounced grasping surface for pulling the EMAG from a mag pouch."

Guys, you might want to look closer at this revolver too!  This is a double action revolver with a light enough trigger just about any woman can operate it with just one hand.

This is a very nice Colt Police Positive Revolver that was made in the mid-60's.  This pistol has a 4"" barrel and is a double/single action revolver that has the quality that only Sam Colt can deliver without the normal high price tag.  The condition of this pistol is between 95% and 98%.  It has been well cared for and always kept clean.  The bore is just about flawless.  There is one scratch in the finish and there is also just a little wear in the bluing on the cylinder and the barrel tip from living in a holster.  I do not have an exact round count but I can tell you it's low because there is no real wear rings on the cylinder where the cartridges will normally leave a pattern mark/rings...  If you've ever seen a 50's, 60's or 70's police show this is the pistol they would have been carrying.  Rugged, dependable and reliable.  

Men...  This is a weapon you can leave with your wife so she can defend her home while you are gone.  The length of the 4"" barrel lends itself to accuracy but still short enough for close quarters use if that becomes necessary.  Light enough trigger and hammer pull that she can operate it one handed, if she must, with ease.  The .38 Special has enough power to get the job done if it comes to that as well.  Teach her to practice with the regular loads and load it with nasty stuff when it will be used to home protection and/or when you're not around.  

I am asking $550 for this Colt, or best reasonable cash offer, but would trade it for a quality snub nose revolver.  I will add cash on my end if it is necessary and expect cash on your end if it is necessary.  I do not want any Poly Frame revolves as it will be a Concealed Carry Weapon for my wife.  My wife can handle this revolver quite well but I would really rather she for a 2"", 2.5"" or 3"" at the longest for a carry weapon.

For $3000 I will include the surefire and a Eotech XPS3 (not pictured).


On the top half of the case is a Stag Arms 6.8 upper and lower. The lower has an ambidextrous single point sling adapter and a single point sling. The upper has the free float forend, and a nickel boron bolt carrier group. I pulled it out in the pic so you can see how clean they keep. They dont get any carbon build up on them at all. The optics is a 3-9x50 basic scope zeroed in at 200yds. Its not a super high end scope, but ARs dont kick like mules either. It has been holding up to the 6.8 recoil for around 200 rounds that Ive put down it. It comes with 2 magazines stamped 6.8 and 1 box of Hornady 6.8 ammo.
The lower half of the gun case is a DPMS 5.56/.223 upper with 1:9 twist. It has quad rail forend with all the rail adapters to put over the rails if you want to use them. Also comes with a fold down foregrip attached to it. Standard bolt carrier in it also. The light is a surefire millenium universal ($350) with the M93 mounting base $175(quick release) and the KM3 light head $250 on it (switches between white light and infrared). It comes with a NcStar 4x32 (not pictured) scope that has a red laser on it as well and has the quick detach/attach lever. I have 2 new in the box GI style mags, 2 used mags, 3x20rd boxes of ammo, and a bag of loose reloaded ammo leftover from a box I got at a gun show last year.
The 5.56 upper will mount to the 6.8 lower perfectly and will take the 5.56 mags as well. Basically 2 uppers and 1 lower to make 2 different caliber rifles. I target shoot here and there with the 5.56 and used the 6.8 to hunt hogs in TX, although I did drop a doe with it a few weeks ago.
The entire set up was almost $2500 BEFORE the stupid rise in value of these 'assault' rifles. The surefire alone was over $500."

I could use the cash, but may be interested in trades or partial trades.  All I would really need is a tactical 870, or maybe a carry 9mm, or possibly a 1911 of sorts.

I also looked up his other listings and he had listings in Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Michigan. And all of the listings were to good to be true. Example a M&P 40c for $300, a Sig AR15 for $1300, AK47 for $650. So if it's too good to be true it is.

The subject of this review is my own Bushmaster XM-15-E2S that was made in Windham, (I got mine!). It is an A3 model with an A2 style fixed buttstock, handle sight, inch heavy barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch twist rifling, bayonet lug, birdcage flash suppressor and it came with a 30 round magazine.
This Bushmaster rifle is chambered for .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO rounds and is marked as such, so both may be safely used. I don't recommend that these rounds be used interchangeably in any firearm that is not specifically marked for both. There are many that believe that the .223 Remington and the 5.56mm NATO round are the same but in fact they are not. According to Small Arms Manufacturers Institute, Inc, (SAAMI), it is unsafe to fire 5.56mm NATO rounds in firearms chambered for .223 Remington. If you do a little Google searching around the Internet you can find the technical information related to that subject if it interests you. Be careful and only use the ammunition your firearm is designed to fire safely. new in box trade value 1700 sig   352.634.2084"

The good -
Previous owner said about 30k miles since rebuild - 351w carbureted, Edelbrock carb, Edelbrock Performer-Plus camshaft, true dual exhaust dumps before rear axle, 4-speed MANUAL TRANSMISSION

35"" tires w/ at least 50% tread left, 3"" bodylift, autolocking hubs, 4wd works great

5 KC Hilites on a light bar - wired but never ran 'em myself (previous owner did)

New cd player, heat works, never tried the a/c (probably not working though)

New tie rods and steering linkage installed last year. New battery installed last year.

New parts not installed but can include to sweeten the deal: High output alternator, pulley, cable kit, and pivot ($200 from RJM Injection)

*Motor runs really strong, tranny shifts great. Reliable truck that never let me down.



The bad - Truck has some rust. It looks pretty rough from the outside, dashboard is not in good shape either. Brakes are soft, need a good bleeding. Still plenty of pad left though.


Don't waste my time. This truck is RELIABLE. You won't be getting stuck in any amount of snow this winter.

It has the night sights, SRT, underside rail, decocking lever, and has had about 1000 rounds go through it. I am the original owner of the weapon. I took it to the gunsmith to have the edges polished and any manufacturing burs taken care of, including the feed throat and slide friction points. I have taken excellent care of this pistol. As a marine, I know the value of proper maintenance and lubrication. The only signs of wear are on the moving parts, the outside is perfect.

Looking for $1000 or will trade for a very nice USGI M1 carbine.  Need mostly correct, no imports, fairly decent muzzle.
