The process WILL NOT work on a Hornady LNL progessive press. In fact, the only way to do it WITHOUT modification is with a Dillon 1050. With a 650 I could machine down the top and bottom of the tool head and the process would work like a dream. If you are out of TN I would be willing to pay shipping both ways.

Full of innovation, his recent alliance with Spyderco results in the Perrin PPT folder. P.P.T. refers to the folder’s three designers; Fred Perrin, Philippe Perotti and Sacha Thiel.
The lock is a crossbreed annexing components of both Michael Walker’s LinerLock and Chris Reeve’s Reeve Integral Lock. It functions as a frame-lock but a black G-10 scale overlaying the lock makes it appear closer to a LinerLock. The black G-10 handle scales are milled with corrugated creases for skid-free and ergonomic handling. Its full-flat ground CPM-S30V steel blade is a modified-Wharncliffe profile with a finger choil and spine jimping and a tapered spine-swedge. Screw together construction makes cleaning and adjustments simple. Left/right deep-carry pocket clip and handle lanyard open the door for endless attachment options.

YIKES!!! Back in the late 1990's, I saw some really cool custom 10/22's. It was ""THE MOST CUSTOMIZED RIFLE IN THE WORLD"". Went to my local sporting goods store and bought mine. I couldn't afford all the fancy expensive B.S., so mounted an inexpensive Tasco 4X32 scope and had as much fun and accurate plinking as the showboats at the club. Got bitten by the cowboy bug and it's been LEVERS FOREVER since. The Ruger has been in a safe for the last decade. It looks LIKE NEW, not a scratch or bonk anywhere. The box must have been worthless because I didn't keep it AND I NEVER THROW ANYTHING AWAY according to my wife. When prices started getting around $500 for ""TACTICAL"" 22's and Hi-point junk I decided I probably wouldn't be hanging out with the $50 a brick plinking gang. I CAN'T DO PHOTOS, if you don't know what a 10/22 looks like, your wife or mom better hold your wallet for you. Available for local cash sale to OHIO RESIDENT ONLY at $250.

I am NOT trading out my ammo at FIVE shells for ONE .22 LR. That is not realistic and I'm not here to get raped on ammo. I have ammo in all the calibers I need, including 22. However, I find it easier to get more of everything but .22 LR and that's what I want to shoot. That said, all of the other calibers are hard to find too - but I have found them. Therefore, I would like to rebalance my ammo with someone who wants more of something else and less of their 22 LR. In normal days, .22 ammo sells for as little as 4 cents a round. In normal days, cheap other ammo sells for 30 cents a round. That is at least a 7 to 1 ratio. I am willing to go as low as 5 to 1. Again, that means I need FIVE of your 22 LR for ONE of what I have above. If you want brass 223, the offer is 10 to 1. The 9mm and 40 is brass, the 7.62 is not.

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed. The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine. The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .3oo Win Mag ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots. In the AR tradition, the Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR disassembles quickly for easy cleaning,"

Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.
GLOCK compensator pistols are equipped with an integrated compensator, rendering the weapon even more controllable during rapid fire and allowing an improved hit pattern. The compensator consists of two longitudinal openings in the barrel and slide of the pistol arranged in ""V-position"". This minimizes front sight blackening through powder gases.

I have for sale a very nice condition Marlin 995 with the checkered wood stock.  This gun takes a NY legal 7 round magazine.  The gun has a little 4X15 tasco scope attached.  The wood has one prominent scuff mark near the receiver but that's about it.  I fired it today and it functions fine.  I bought the gun last week and don't love it so I am looking to sell/trade.  I'm looking to get a newer Marlin or Ruger 10/22 so if you have one you want to part with give me a holler."

SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."

Only the horns were located outside of my suv, the rest of the gear was installed inside the vehicle even though everything including the compressor can be installed to the frame underneath your vehicle. I bought the conductor 540 kit, but payed more for the constant duty 480c viar compressor instead of the 400c that comes with it because its good for 200psi and has a 100% duty cycle. The tank is a 5 gallon DOT tank with plenty of ports for adding accessories, and/or a second compressor for a faster fill time (not needed). Also my setup is running Safely at 200psi, so they are a lot louder than the stock kit. The horns have a lifetime warranty, If something fails or breaks, they will replace it, no questions asked. I had a rock come up and dent the diaphragm in one of my trumpets causing it to make a high pitch buzz. Called them up and they shipped me a brand new horn, no questions asked within a week. They even sent a prepaid shipping label to send my broken horn back. My setup can be heard close to 6 miles away, and up close they will wake the dead!! The solenoid is instant on instant off, so there is no low level warning leading up to the blast like a trains horn, so you get the full blast the second you activate the solenoid! This is nothing like your cheap ebay/china horn kit, everything is high quality, and easy to install.

Manufactured in 1880 by Hopkins and Allen, Norwich, CT, these guns are unique in design and were considered to be of the highest quality. As such they were the most expensive of the large frame handguns of the period. An 1882 dated invoice from the E.C. Meacham Co. of St. Louis shows a standard Merwin .44 billed out at twelve dollars, while a new Remington 1875 Model is eight dollars and a Colt SAA is eleven dollars. Had not Joseph Merwin died in 1879 and the Merwin Company gone into receivership in 1880, Merwin’s precision revolvers may have revolutionized the gun industry around the world. These revolvers had an automatic ejector system that selectively extracted the fired cases while keeping the unfired cartridges in the cylinder. Many considered them superior to their better known competitors of the period, Colt, Remington and Smith & Wesson. This gun remains in excellent original condition, with 90% plus original nickel finish and perfect mechanical condition. Engraved in the classic New York M&H pattern, it has a non-typical and perhaps unique, large Texas longhorn steer head in a circle on the left side of the frame. While other animals and busts of Indians, women and cowboys were more or less standard, the steer head is very unusual. It could have been a special order from a western rancher. Regardless, this is a very rare and interesting gun.  Get back to me if you are interested in this gun.  Only a serious buyer please.

Thank you."

This is Very Important. I have attached an example of a letter along with email addressees

Ms.schwartz , I am addressing you as a fellow Colorado resident. I am embarrassed by how the Senate and House hearings have been carried out in these discussions regarding new gun laws. I am a 47 years old Retired Disabled Veteran who decided to retire in Colorado. I am simply shocked that both legislative branches chose to listen to and give more credence to people testifying from OUT of OUR State. They don't live here I do. The time was split to allow them much more time than our own residents. I am ashamed to even say I am from Colorado. We are going to loose several businesses and JOBS that will simply move out of Colorado to more favorable states. Please look around, see the damage that is about to be done. Please Vote NO on ALL these bills especially Bill 1224. I thank you for your time, I guess you won't even read this letter, but I had to write it. I couldn't just sit by and watch. I can Assure you that I will NEVER vote for anyone, regardless of your affiliation, who votes against any of my 2nd Amendment Rights

I can add cash.

The first, and the nicest, is an essex frame with an essex slide. This is extremely well matched and the internals except slide are all Springfield. It matches up beautifully due to the original owners obsession with finishing it out. It has been lapped and the rails are polished. Its trigger is great and I recently had it cerakoted. This shoots everything but lead SWC, which is what I have decided to change to. I value this in the $625-$650 range.

The second is an essex frame with what a gold cup national match slide (only roll stamped ""Colt, Hartford Conneticut"" the fifties Gold Cups where not marked) with the adjustable rear sights and high rise shark fin front sight. It shoots well but does not like the 185gr SWC bullets I like. I value this in the $550-$600 range (finished out nicely this exact set up goe for nearly $1000 on GunBroker). Not perfect but nothing blatantly offensive and should be easily remedied. I will keep the Delta grips unless you have something great to trade, I still have the ones that came on it.

As far as my interests, I  would love something with a rail, but that is not a necessity. I would do a trade for a Dan Wesson or other higher end guns regardless of the finish and configuration. I prefer Colt and Sig, But I can add cash if needed.
Just a quick mention of 2 things I may have not clearly stated.

I also low value these guns around $1100 together  or so. I am not expecting the sun and the moon. Make a fellow an offer he cannot refuse!"

Product Information

This Wheeler Engineering Delta Series AR-15 Upper Receiver Vise Block is a vital tool that enables the user to securely clamp an upper receiver into a bench vise without fear of crushing, twisting or damaging it in order to perform critical assembly, disassembly or maintenance tasks. It is ideal for use in torqueing barrel nuts to the proper spec, attaching or detaching a muzzle device, and is even useful for cleaning a rifle's bore properly from the muzzle end with a cleaning rod. Manufactured from durable, solvent resistant black polymer, the clamp is compatible with A2 Uppers with an Integral Carry Handle as well as A3 Flattop Upper Receivers. Includes a Polymer Internal Receiver Insert to protect the receiver from crushing when the clamp is tightened, and also a Gas Tube Alignment Pin for ensuring a barrel nut is properly aligned to allow clearance for the rifle's gas system."
