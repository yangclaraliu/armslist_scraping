It's in good shape, and is a solid, accurate shooter (I've taken many squirrels and a few rabbits with it). Good bore, no pitting, or rust, or significant scratching or the like--just the usual marks of use.  It does have a triangular bit cut out of the plastic buttplate (no idea why--it came to me that way), but this does not affect function.

It would be a solid gun for anyone, of course, but it is a good starter gun for a younger shooter (it's a single-shot, with a bolt action and manual cock, so it's about as safe as a rifle can be).

But the coolest part of this rifle is the Toggle Action. It's a straight pull action and its so very nice!   It's so fast and easy to cycle. Perfect with .22lr Suppressors.      Comes just like from the factory with its box and one magazine.   I had it fitted professionally with a nice Redfield Revolution 4-12 variable power scope.  It's sitting in some nice Weaver rings.   This setup is great. Super light and very very different from what your friends have!

I'm looking to sell it for $900 today!!.   With the scope and rings this rifle was well over $1250 plus tax.

I have for sale a great shape Arsenal SGL-21 AK-47. Has less then 500 rounds threw it. Plumb furniture. 

Comes with approx 200-300 ammo ( I do not have an exact count) plus one pre-ban magazine. 

Rifle is in fantastic shape with low round count, only a few scratches on the compensator/barrel, very minor though.

This is an excellent AK, made in the original Kalashnikov plant, imported by Arsenal, arguable one of the best. Great fit and finish, a really great AK47. Only selling to fund another project.

Cash prefered, but open to possible trades. PTR-91, SIG556R (the 7.62x39 platform), currently interested in DMR purpose built guns of most types, PSL, etc. 

Also possibly open to various 1911 trades, 10MM a HUGE plus.

I will trade any combination of bikes for a gun or a single bike for a gun or whatever.  Really only interested in legitimate classic / antique guns, Rem 700's, AR's (.223 or .308), .50 cal, etc.  Bikes below:

1) 1977 Suzuki GS750 street tracker build:

Just finished this thing up after almost 3 years. It has been an on again / off again project for me. Runs and rides great as it sits. Here is the jist:

1977 Suzuki GS750. Clean title. Bought as a project and completed the following: took it apart to the frame and engine, new (used) instrument bezel, new handle bars, 06-07 GSXR front master cylinder and resevoir, front stainless braided brake line, rebuilt rear master and resevoir, rear stainless braided brake line, new valve shims within spec, new front sprocket, new rear sprocket, new chain, new gaskets all around (except for head and cylinder), new air filter, new cylinder head intake boots, cleaned and completely rebuilt carbs, new clutch cable, new brake pads, rebuilt front and rear calipers, new plug caps, new clutch springs, new allen head engine hardware kit, cleaned up and fixed wiring. All electronics work. New tires. New grips. Have tons of spares and stock parts. Also have case savers that are not installed. Painted valve cover caps, head light bezel, headers and slip ons, and rear fender flat black (sand blasted, primed and painted, headers and slip ons were painted with high temp exhaust paint). Oil and filter are new. Battery is new, and kick start works also. New spark plugs.

A test ride is possible with CASH IN HAND.

$2500 as it sits (Rear fender has tail light mounting holes in it, forks need a rebuild...thats about all it needs.) If you want me to complete that stuff, we might be able to figure something out.

Comes With: Case savers, 2 more oil filters, all the stock stuff I removed (rear fender, old brake lines, blinkers, tail light, etc, etc.)

I can take as many pictures of whatever you want on this bike, and will answer all questions, just shoot me an email. 
____________________________________________
2) 2003 Yamaha TTR250:

A little over 2000 miles, new brake pads front and rear, 99% front tire, 75% rear tire, aftermarket rear fender and tail light, newer battery, carb was new a bout 800 miles ago. Ive added a skid plate and a windscreen that stay with the bike. Seat is in excellent condition with no tears.

The first picture shows how I had it set up for dual sport use for Tellico and Citico and cruising around town so that you can see what it looks like kitted out. However the Wolfman bags, bark busters / hand guards, and tank bag don't come with the bike.

I changed the oil with Rotella, lubed the chain, and cleaned the air filter regularly. When the bike was stored for the winter, it was run once a week and had Stabil in the fuel. It comes with a couple extra oil filters and the stock tail section.

$2000 obo, but that doesn't mean Ill give it away. The bike has some rough spots visually, like the plastic over the muffler, but I never cared since it was covered by pannier bags. Mechanically though, the bike is excellent, and I have ridden it to and from Citico and Tellico many times with 0 issues. I rode it all the way to Cleveland TN and back on 411 last summer with no problems.  Clean Title.
___________________________________

3) 1994 Suzuki DR125:

1100-1200 miles (not sure, will check), good tires, rebuilt carb, all original, all lights and accessories work.  This was my wifes bike when we would ride around Citico and Tellico.  Street legal dual sport, clean title. $1200 obo."

This is a Bushmaster AR-15 with a target barrel and a collapsable stock. I've fired it multiple times and never had a problem with it. Shoots very well and cycles cleanly and reliably. I've owned it for probably 10 years and put maybe 3-400 rounds through it. The odd paint job was done by whoever owned it before. It looks a little different but it was at least done by someone that has painted a weapon before because it isn't a mess and didn't leave a textural difference... if that's a word. I will include at least 1 magazine and can include the BSA Red Dot sight and the case if you're interested in some extras/accessories. 

The Deal:
I just got a brand new AR-15 and don't have a serious need for this one anymore. I am not desperate so I don't really want to be low-balled. I would like to trade for the following items... I can throw in some extra magazines if I can get some in return maybe:

Glock 19 or Glock 17 (Generation 3-4 preferred but I'll hear anything)
Double-Barreled ""Stagecoach"" Shotgun (I'm not really picky about the brand but I'd like a side-by side that's pretty short)
Kel-Tech SUB 2000
.22 revolver

Feel free to message me with offers. I'd really prefer to trade for 2 glocks or a glock and a shotgun. I don't need the cash much and the prices are pretty crazy right now anyways. Thanks for looking and send me any questions you have!"

Product Information, Features, and Specifications:

Chambered in the 5.7x28mm cartridge, the PS90 utilizes blowback operation and fires from a closed bolt for greater accuracy and reliability. The PS90’s civilian legal 16.04"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is equipped with an integrated muzzle brake to reduce recoil. Dual magazine latches, cocking handles and an innovative synthetic thumbhole stock with a molded-in sling attachment point help make the PS90 fully ambidextrous.

The Benelli Cordoba is a lightning-fast 12-gauge shotgun or 20-gauge shotgun, especially built for hunting. Inspired by the high volume of dove shooting found around Cordoba, Argentina, the designers of Benelli shotguns engineered this one with all the advanced features of a serious sporting clays model. Incorporated into the Cordoba is the 10-mm tapered sporting rib favored by competition shooters and porting to keep barrel climb to a minimum
The ComforTech® stock cushions the blow when ammo isn’t measured in boxes, but by cases in an afternoon. The ComforTech® system also helps reduce barrel climb and puts the shooter back on target 69% faster, so that the Cordoba just may be the fastest field gun ever built. A Crio® barrel and extended Crio® choke tubes put more pellets on target. And the whole package is finished in matte black GripTight® coating or Realtree MAX-4®, so a reflected flash won’t give you away."

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

Glock 26 Gen4 9mm Pistol - 10rd Trijicon night sights, Front and Rear
GEN 4 Features
The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested
• ""Safe Action"" system
• Durable exterior finish
• Cold hammer forged barrel
• Durability
• Reliability
• Light weight
....that make GLOCK firearms famous!
The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.
The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.
The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.
The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap.
The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.
Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.
Features
• Gen4 G26
• (3) 10rd Magazines
• Reversible magazine catch
• Rough Textured Frame
• 2 Back Straps
• Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design
• ""Baby"" GLOCK, the smallest GLOCK pistol
• Great for concealed carry"

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

MAG5-60
The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."

These pistols were manufactured only during 1985-87, and are very similar to the Colt Trooper. The finish is a matte black, Parkerized in appearance. Legend has it that the Colt factory polishers were on strike, so the initial batch was shipped with the matte finish. When the polishers returned from the strike, Colt put them to work on their backlog of other pistols and continued to manufacture the Peacekeeper with the parkerized look. This particular gun is the six inch model. No box, no papers... just an outstanding gun.

You know people I've been on armslist for a short while now and I don't get it.  You crazy people don't understand the scare is over.  Mosin nagant m44's for 200 and up.  SKS's for 400, or an SKS with a 60 tapco stock for 600.  you people are really out of control.  you people do realize that stores sell mosin's for like $75 bucks.  oh i get it though that requires work, becuase they aren't around here since you people are foolish enough to pay those prices.  go buy it farther away, like up north where they are 75 bucks and have it shipped, still cheaper.  

And they guys adding a bullpup stock to 22's.  good on you for making a fun gun to shoot, to bad you can build these things for about 350, yet again, if you do some work and shop around, not paying 600 for a damn 22 that's home built.  

This stuff has got to stop people.  Stop trying to use Armslist as a small business buy lowballing someone who needs the cash, and selling at a higher price.  this isn't a small business opportunity, its for people who love guns, not douche bags trying to scam and make money.  I hope people stop blowing smoke up others' asses soon. Its not gold when you have it and shit when others do."

It was purchased and received as brand new back in April 2013.  I have shot approximately 240 rounds through it.  It is as accurate as an M4 (I am HIGHLY familiar with the M4 and AK47, used both overseas).  

    Originally, this package is worth approximately $1100, but considering the paint job and use I will knock off $200.  I will not go lower and there will be no trades or negotiations.  I will ultimately keep it and store it if I can not find a good buyer for the listed price.

    The look and purchase will take place at Beech Grove Firearms.  Beech Grove will background check the buyer on the spot (I am not a fan of felons or gangsters with AK47s).  I will cover the $25 fee and consider it included.  You may not test fire the weapon.  You may field strip it.  It is brand new and I completely back its function.  This weapon has NO known malfunctions or defects.  I am really sad to see it go.  I would marry this rifle if I could.

    I need to sell it because very soon I will have a career change and this will take me to ""soviet/Feinstein"" states on either the west or east coast and this weapon will just cause me problems.  I will use the money to purchase a good hunting/sniper rifle.

Inventory:

    IO AK47 Sporter (home painted in a flecktarn style)

    2 steel (30) magazines, 2 polymer (30) magazines

    Original paperwork

    AK47 sight adjustment tool

    240 rounds of ammunition (7.62 x 39mm TUL and WPA Polyformance)

Upgrades:

    Slant flash hider and threaded barrel

    Handguard has bottom picatinny rail



There is an obvious small amount of copper in the bore from firing.

The rifle will be cleaned to the best of a cleaning kit ability.



    Please e-mail me for further questions or directions.  Serious inquiries with cash only.  This is a brand new rifle so please do not meet up, look at it, and claim there is something grossly deficient.  Please do not waste my time or the store's time.

    As per custom of handling, I will not accept returns or future fixes once it is purchased.  I can not verify that the buyer has altered the weapon or misused the weapon to negate function.  I can not verify if the buyer is attempting to cheat.  The weapon after purchase belongs solely to you."
