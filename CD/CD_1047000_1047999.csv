Rifle has some tiny dings in the stock and a few scratches but over all is in very good shape. The original magazine has long since worn out however I only ever used actual ruger magazines, I have 2 10 round magazines and the new ruger 25 round magazine. This rifle was given to my father for a birthday present in 1970 and was given to me 10 years ago. It is a very accurate and reliable rifle. Both my father and I never store a dirty gun so it has been well maintained. 

These older 10/22's are amazing, there is a noticeable difference between an old one and a new one. Because of its age it is worth a little more so consider that when making an offer. 

I have traveled the world and one thing I learned was the rest of the world bargains, in the 1950's this practice became ""rude"" in the US. I am not sure why but I do know that I believe bargaining is the best way to do business for both the seller and buyer. Sorry if that is not your way but it is mine. Pre-warning all original ruger 10/22's go for between 300-400$ (at least that is what I have seen from my research) If you are just looking for a fun .22 I would go to your local sporting goods store and pick one up for between 120-200$.

I have gotten alot of interest already, I have two offers and 2 inquiries. It has only been up for 3 hours so if interested contact soon I will be selling soon"

This is a side lock, percussion rifle. When I bought the rifle the open sights and ramrod were missing and were replaced (NEW). 
I also use Pyrodex 50 grain powder pellets instead if loose power, a new box of the pellets is included plus 18 additional pellets that came with some of the bullets and sabots. There are 3 different weight bullets included; there are 10 - 300 grain copper hollow point bullets with sabots, 12 power belt 245 grain bullets and sabots still new in pack. There are also 11 bullets and sabots, these have been open and I’m not sure of weight but I think they are 200 grain.  
When I began using the powder pellets the #10 nipple was just not hot enough to ignite them consistently so there is a #11 nipple installed plus 2 more new ones still in the pack. A box of #11 percussion caps might be 8 or 10 caps missing (I have shot the rifle but  not enough to even adjust the new sight). There is a real powder horn; it could be made operable but it’s just for looks at this time because I use the pellets. All the above accessories except the powder horn fit in an old army mag pouch that I'm using as a possibles bag.
Also included is a Thompson Center Black Powder cleaning Kit and two knives from Smokey Mount Knife Works that have fake Damascus blades and plastic horn handles. (I had planned to replace the handles with Deer horn and make sheaths and a possibles bag from deer hide.)  

There are a couple of spots on the rifle where the factory finish has come off. I was waiting till I got the rifle lined out and shooting like I wanted before I refinish the stock, but due to sickness, then heart surgery I has not happened. 

The Sued rifle case in photo is not included.

I’m guessing I have about $125.00 in the rifle and maybe $150.00 - $175.00 in the accessories.
I found a Hi-point (40 caliber?) carbine in a pawn shop I’d like to have, Pawn shop offered $150.00 in trade. 

If someone has a 40 cal. HI-point carbine they’d like to trade to a muzzle loader let me know or make a cash offer.
If the pawn shop still has the carbine this weekend I might just take their offer."

I have bought and sold firearms on here numerous times and NEVER had so many stupid people come out of the woodwork. So please dont make an offer then decide you cant afford to shoot it. For the love of God its a .50 BMG and NO its NOT cheap to shoot but be nice and deal honest and I may throw in ammo for it. Not 1 of the over 50 people that offered on it asked if I'd throw ammo in.

This gun functions excellent, bore is clean, and finish is good to very good.

At just a little over 14 inches in length, this exceptional firearm is even more difficult to find than its rare 9mm version. Because of its larger caliper, it came originally with a 22 round clip (which is included). 

The Spectre is an Italian submachine gun that was produced by the SITES factory in Turin. It was designed by Roberto Teppa and Claudio Gritti in the mid-1980s. Production in Italy ceased in the year 1997, with the closure of SITES, but proceeded in very small numbers in Switzerland through Greco Sport S.A., a company founded by one of the designers of the Spectre, Claudio Gritti, until 2001. During the mid 80’s and early 90’s, a limited number made its way to the states via imported by American Arms Inc. The Spectre is used by the Swiss armed forces and by Italian armed forces, and has been exported elsewhere.

The Spectre is a compact and light weapon, designed for instant firepower in close combat at short ranges. The four models have top-folding buttstocks, and were available with or without a forward handgrip ahead of the magazine housing. The largely polymer Spectre has a stamped-steel receiver.

The Spectre is a standard blowback firearm operating from a closed bolt; however it has some unusual features. The barrel shroud completely hides the barrel. The bolt is designed to pump air through the barrel shroud to provide additional cooling. The Spectre is hammer-fired and the trigger group is double action with a decocker. This allows the shooter to safely carry a round in the chamber and fire immediately. As this eliminates the need for cocking prior to shooting no manual safety is provided. Unconventional 22-round capacity, four-column magazine ise provided with the Spectre, but it can also use conventional magazines."

The EMAG (Export MAGazine) is a lightweight 30-round 5.56x45 NATO polymer magazine that features a number of aesthetic and functional changes from the PMAG®. While EMAG remains 100% compatible with the AR15/M16 platform, its unique geometry is optimized for foreign-made weapons such as the British SA-80 (L85A1/A2, L86A1/A2, L22A1, L98A1/A2), HK 416, M27 IAR, and others.

EMAG features the same pop-off Impact/Dust Cover as the PMAG GEN M2 to prevent dirt and debris intrusion and protect the feedlips from potential impact damage during transit and storage. When not in use, the Impact/Dust Cover can be stored on the magazine's floorplate to prevent possible loss.

For easy and accurate identification of loaded round count via the large, dual-sided MagLevel windows, the stainless steel magazine spring is coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color. Numerical indicators are added to the body to identify 5, 15, and 25 loaded rounds.

Made in U.S.A."

The 410:
I've always oiled it regularly There is a scratch in the stock and a few wear and tear nics on the barrel but it's very beautiful weapon. It's also a Pardner Model SB1. 3"" Full Choke made from New England Firearms also a single shot.

The .22LR 
It may have had 200 rounds through it if that. in great condition. Only thing that's wrong with it is that it's missing a clip. It's a rarer gun b/c it's not made anymore. It's extremely accurate, and an all around nice little 22. It's been oiled regularly and as I said in great shape. Also you can get the clip for it for about 15- 20 bucks. depends on where you get it. I've found a few for 10 bucks. but not as often as the 15-20 ones. remington model 77 appache

i also have about 200 rounds give or take in 22 ammo and a small package of about 5 shots for the 410. Feel free to shoot me an e-mail about trades, questiongs, offers etc."

So here is the deal.. I shot 38 rounds thru this there is not a scratch on it..!
It is new.. The TROY stock/chassis is unbelievable awesome.. Feels like and AR-15
but has the fire power of the mighty 7.62 Nato with complete Picatinny rail on all sides for scopes and gadgets/bipods  etc..

The TROY HK style battle sights are the shizzle and fold out of the way of the scope 
and the extended sight radius makes this a long distance performer they are all rust free with stainless springs.

This rifle has the ability to turn the gas port off and it turns it into a bolt action rifle for super accuracy.. It is a new rifle and if you do this, the brass is hard to eject until it breaks in.. [I called Springfield] The scout Sniper are made to be super accurate with tight chamber tolerances.

This is the most solid setup you can get on an M-14 rifle and its the same length as an AR-15 

The USGI mags are mostly in the new wrapper.. 

I have the instruction manuals and TROY instructions for the Chassis install.

What can I say....New weapon without a scratch always in the safe.
This is a 1 MOA weapon for counter sniping and has all the best accessories on it
