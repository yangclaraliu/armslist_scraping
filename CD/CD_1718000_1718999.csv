They don't make them like this anymore. This gun was made in December 1995 - not strictly speaking a pre-ban but made before they stopped using USGI parts. Originally it did not have a USGI flash hider with bayonet lug - but it does now.Also, it was a special model (forget the exact model number) but it was refered to as the GI Collector edition. Aside from USGI parts it came with a collector quality USGI walnut stock. The pictures don't do justice as the stock has a beautiful grain to it - and perfect Defense Acceptance Stamp and P cartouches.

I do pefer a local sale (I am in Fullerton CA). If it does not sell within a day or two I will ship. I need cash only at this time, no trades - sorry.

This gun is 15 years old but has only had a couple of hundred rounds down the tube. It is mint. You won't find a better M1A for a better price - at least I did not.

After years of considering and being driven away by the high cost of a membership to Front Sight, my husband was finally was able to find an enrollment special and purchase a lifetime membership. Recently we were able to buy an affordable block of memberships so that we could enroll my whole family of 7 and we could all go down together as often as we want to any course that we wanted. http://www.frontsight.com/Courses.asp

My whole family had a blast and learned so much. They can't wait to go again in a few months. We see ourselves going again and again. The quality of the courses was so professional and I learned a lot about becoming more familiar and comfortable with my weapon. For those with a lot of previous gun handling experience there are always more advanced things to learn. Many Police and Military personnel attend Front Sight courses to improve their training. Your shooting time and accuracy will greatly improve. Classroom, range time, and even live simulations are included with the courses. 

In the 4-day defensive handgun course I just returned from I learned to draw from a holster correctly, clear malfunctions (FTF, FTE, double feeding), reload, shoot accurately, and clear a room (in case of a home intruder). They also tried to teach us to draw and clear malfunctions quickly with concealment garments, which is very hard to do. I want to make this experience available to any interested gun owner out there. 
The World Class Front Sight Training Institute facility is located in Pahrump Nevada (near Las Vegas).  The staff offer a friendly and supportive environment while maintain a very professional atmosphere. 

There are also a limited number of 2-day course certificates available for $40.

Front Sight's goal is to get everyone who cherishes their 2nd Amendment rights trained on how to safely and accurately use a gun so they periodically offer enrollment specials.

It has already gotten expensive to come up with 5 types of handgun bullet, 8 for shotgun and 3 for rifles per caliber I have on hand. This is not asking for full boxes of ammo, basically I am asking if anyone has similar to the ones I list below that they can spare, would you be willing to sell me a single individual round (one) locally so I don't have to go out and buy anymore full boxes just for this video? I will be in the poor house if I keep doing that at this rate. I don't really have many left to get and I am hoping someone nearby has some of these and is willing to help me out, thanks for looking.

.45 Colt (Long Colt): Any Buffalo Bore, Corbon, or similar Heavy +P load (My gun can take it). 

.40 S&W: Hornady Critical Defense 165 Gr. FTX or Winchester PDX1 180 Gr. or 165 Gr. JHP. 

.303 British: Any non-corrosive factory FMJ or hollow point.

INFO STRAIGHT FROM DD: The Daniel Defense LightWeight Package, part of our comprehensive line of Professional Operator Solutions, is built to meet the continually evolving rigors and requirements of today’s Law Enforcement mission. This package includes the Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, V5 Lightweight with our Cold Hammer Forged lightweight profile barrel, the new Daniel Defense DDM4 Rail™ 12.0, mid-length gas system and is perfectly outfitted with an Aimpoint Patrol Rifle Optic (PRO), fixed front & rear sights and MAGPUL PMAGS. The DDM4v5 LW is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimmed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This is one of the many features that create a rock solid platform that can be reliably counted on to deliver superior duty rifle service. The continuous flat top in conjunction with fixed front & rear sites and an Aimpoint PRO optic combination provides for a maximum field of view in regard to the suspect or target area, as well as the backdrop / potential round impact area.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

Factory New


The Taurus Tracker family includes a full range of calibers and sizes to 

perfectly suit any hunting adventure. Chambered in everything from .17 HMR to 

.22 LR to .44 Magnum, these rugged, durable revolvers also make a practical 

choice for backpacks and tackle boxes, especially where there are bears and 

other predators around. Extremely comfortable to fire and easy to control - the 

Tracker Series continues to grow in popularity thanks to its high level of 

accuracy, rock-solid performance and near-indestructible construction. 

Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and 

makes shooting comfort a reality.


Ribber Grip 
Exclusive Taurus orgonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip 

under virtually all shooting conditions.



Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which 

provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and 

make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, 

the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be 

disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the 

firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the 

revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply 

insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate 

one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety 

cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate 

the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the 

pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it 

yourself and fire the gun.


Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin 

unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

The hammer forged stainless steel Model 627 7-shot in .357 Magnum will be
appearing in backpacks and fishermen's tackle boxes, especially when there
are bears and other predators around. Finished in stainless steel, the
Tracker carries the Taurus Security System and the exclusive ribber grip.

 This certificate which has been signed by the original purchaser, will entitle you to 1, 4-day class in; Defensive Handgun, Tactical Shotgun or Practical Rifle. If you prefer, you can take a friend and split the training with them by using the certificate for 2, 2-day classes as long as you both take the same class. 

 There is a $50 background investigation fee payable at the time of registration which is not included in this certificate. That is the only money you will be asked for at Front Sight unless you rent equipment from them which I would recommend. They will rent you the necessary equipment for the classes for $100 for the 4-day class. Ammunition is of course extra.

 Check out the Front Sight website and think about making a trip with some friends. Splitting expenses like fuel and rooms will make the trip very affordable. 

 Just remember, you can only use one of these certificates once. After that you either pay the full $2000 or join the resort. The 2-day classes are great but the 4-day class is much more than twice as much. The days are around 12 hours long, but they fly by. The instructors are the most informed, practical and intelligent trainers I have ever encountered. The facilities are first rate and everyone involved is professional in every way.

 Front Sight offers different certificates and promotions from time to time for other classes and things. Sometimes I have those available. If there is something Front Sight related that you desire or need, just ask. I might have something available that will fill your need.

 I have several different types of firearms training opportunities available in my other auctions. Please take a look at my other auctions."

RAT-4. Carried and used but never beat on. Has one tiny scratch on the back from me opening a can. (TV $80)

Case Copperhead from 1989 in CV, Been told it's worth $80-$120?

Peerless handcuffs, 2 sets and key. Old school, would take a good bit to get these off me. Come with 3 leather holsters. (TV ???)

[I]This Biatch ain't bending for nothing![/I] :thumbsup: I have 3 so she can go, has a slight smoke smell from the PO and me not carrying it but I'll get it cleaned up.

About 7x57 Caliber:
The 7x57 was developed by the famous German firm of Mauser in 1892, and adopted by the Spanish government in 1893. Subsequently, several Latin American countries adopted the 7x57, including Mexico. In Europe, Serbia adopted the cartridge, and it became a popular sporting cartridge all over Europe. In Great Britain the 7x57 became so popular that the John Rigby Company adopted it as the .275 Rigby. Many bolt action rifles built in the UK were so marked. Under both names the cartridge was used extensively for plains and mountain game in Africa and Asia. Ammunition is manufactured and sold in Europe, Africa, North America and most of the world. The 7x57 is a true world-wide cartridge.

W.D.M. Bell, perhaps the most famous of all African commercial ivory hunters, killed the majority of his over 1000 elephants with the 7x57. He used the 175 grain FMJ bullet for brain shots, and liked the .275 Rigby (as he called the 7x57) for its accuracy and low recoil and report.

Current ammunition catalogs from PMC, Remington and Federal show loads for the 7x57 with 140 grain spitzer bullets (SD .248) at a muzzle velocity (MV) of 2,660 fps and muzzle energy (ME) of 2,199 ft. lbs. Winchester loads a 145 grain spitzer to the same MV for a ME of 2279 ft. lbs. Federal and PMC also load 175 grain RN bullets at a MV of 2440 fps and ME of 2315 ft. lbs. These are the standard American low pressure factory loads.

Here are some 7x57 specifications that should be of interest to reloaders: bullet diameter .284"", maximum COL 3.065"", maximum case length 2.235"", MAP 46,000 cup.

There are a wide variety of 7mm bullets available to the reloader, from around 110 grains to 195 grains. Barnes offers a 175 grain RN solid (SD .310) and a 195 grain soft point spitzer bullet (SD .345). The North American shooter who wants to get maximum utility out of a 7x57 really should be a reloader. The 130-140 grain bullets are generally the best choice for CXP2 class game, while the 150-175 grain bullets get the nod for CXP3 class game. Restrict shots at the latter to 200 yards/meters or less.

The 7x57 is a well balanced and well designed cartridge for which a number of medium burning rate rifle powders are appropriate. Among these are H414, H380, H4350, IMR 4064, IMR 4320, IMR 4350, and W760.

The reloader with a strong rifle who loads to about 50,000 cup can do better than most factory loads. Do not use the maximum loads quoted below in the relatively weak Model 93 and 95 Mauser actions, or in Remington rolling block rifles. According to the Speer No. 13 Reloading Manual the Speer 130 grain spitzer bullet (BC .394, SD .230) can be driven to 2649 fps by 46.0 grains of H414 powder, and 2960 fps by a maximum load of 50.0 grains of H414.

The 145 grain Spitzer (BC .457, SD .257) can be driven to 2501 fps by 44.0 grains of H414, and 2748 fps by a maximum load of 48.0 grains of H414.

The 160 grain spitzer (BC .502, SD .284) can be driven to 2,363 fps by 42.0 grains of H414, and 2582 fps by a maximum load of 46.0 grains of the same powder. All of the above loads used Remington cases and CCI 250 primers, and were chronographed in a 22 inch rifle barrel.

This RRA LAR-15 is amazing. I just shot over 200 rounds through it this past weekend, and not only did it fire flawlessly but it also felt faaaantastic! 

If you don't know about Rock River Arms, you should because after outperforming 10 other manufacturers in rifle abuse tests, Rock River Arms was awarded a contract with the Drug Enforcement Administration for a minimum of 5,000 LAR-15 rifles. As a result of Rock River Arms winning the DEA contract, other federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Marshals, have also obtained Rock River Arms weapons under piggyback contracts.

I don't really want to sell this gun, but unfortunately I'm in pretty big need of the money..

This is not a cheap plastic AR, this is a high-quality rifle with some upgrades as well:

Rock River Arms LAR-15 NM A2 - MSRP $1,335
http://www.rockriverarms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_id=226
+20"" Bushmaster Lightweight M16A2 Barrel - $240

+12"" Rifle-Length Quad Rail System - $85
+Hogue overmolded pistol grip - $30
+Pro-Mag Vertical Foregrip - $15
+Magpul MOE Trigger guard - $15

=This all adds up to over $1,900, and I'm asking below MSRP of the rifle for ALL OF IT!
And keep in mind these prices are when the pieces are available...
Rock River Arms has an indefinite backorder time right now, and they're far from alone in this as I'm sure you all know!

This rifle also comes equipped with the Wylde Chamber, which was designed as a match chambering for semi-automatic rifles. It will accommodate both .223 Rem and 5.56mm NATO ammunition. It is relieved in the case body to aid in extraction and features a shorter throat for improved accuracy. 

So if you have been looking for a high quality AR-15 at a reasonable price here it is!

Here is some info on it:

From the Manufacturer
Incorporating Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology, this Canon 55-250mm telephoto zoom lens captures long distance, low-light shots far better than many comparable lenses, helping you photograph the far-off action of athletes or zoom in for an intimate portrait with a blurred background. The high-zoom-ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). More significantly, the image stabilizer effect creates an equivalent shutter speed of roughly four stops faster than the same size lens without an image stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you can hold a 250mm lens steadily is normally 1/250th of a second, this Canon lens will let you hand-hold shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. The lens also boasts a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration to create excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. Delivering an excellent performance at an affordable price for all photographers.

Specifications
Focal length: 55-250mm
Maximum aperture: f/4 to f/5.6
Lens construction: 12 elements in 10 groups, including one UD-glass element
Diagonal angle of view: 27 degrees (at 50 feet) to 6 degrees (at 15 feet), with APS-C image sensors
Focus adjustment: DC motor, gear-driven (front focusing design)
Closest focusing distance: 3.6 feet (0.31x maximum close-up magnification)
Filter size: 58mm
Dimensions: 2.8 inches in diameter and 4.3 inches long
Weight: 13.8 ounces

This telephoto zoom lens is designed with Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology while retaining compactness and lightness, in response to demands of photographers. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses), and the image stabilizer effect equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. It also uses a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration for excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. This new EF-S telephoto lens with great features delivers excellent performance at an affordable price for all photographers.
