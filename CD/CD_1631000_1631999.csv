GREEN ZOMBIE REAPER

EXCLUSIVE

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

Vintage Trijicon RX01 Amber dot sight with mount. As far as I can tell from my research, this sight was manufactured in the mid to late '90's. The manual says 1996 on the cover. Condition? Absolutely flawless. No scratches, dings, or rubbed finish. It is an original model WITHOUT the ""hood"" in front of the glass. This sight has the ""Corinthians"" markings. You don't see many (if any, at all) of these ""vintage"" sights anywhere. The glass and coatings are perfect. No scratches, or swirl marks. 

The fiber optic works perfectly. Nice and bright, under any bright or low light conditions. The Tritium STILL glows nicely. I have tested the Tritium in a completely dark room, and can pick up the amber dot with ease. This sight could pass for brand new. It comes with the Manual, and an attached warranty card that matches the serial number on the sight. It also comes with a brand new black ""Scopecoat"" cover.

I got rid of the shotgun I was going to mount this sight on, so I don't have any use for it, now. I'm trying to generate some cash for another pistol. If I can't sell it, I'll keep it, just for the collector aspect of it.

•Referencing the GEN 2 AR57-LEM Upper Assembly, the changes are extremely noticeable, first by shaving almost one pound of weight and fluting the barrel, but still keeping the integrity. We have increased the rear rail and updated the charging handle and magazine release and this unit is completely ambidextrous. Another upgrade that you may not notice but is quite significant, we have upgraded the spring and extractor in the bolt. The innovative, low-profile 50-round magazine (sold separately) is positioned conveniently above the barrel for optimum weight distribution. Spent cases are ejected straight down through the magwell to avoid striking other shooters and for easy range cleanup. Simple, reliable blowback operation with a free-sliding bolt that’s the only moving part means there’s no gas system to foul or clog with carbon. Ultra-rigid, monolithic receiver/handguard rail is machined from a single block of aluminum, with nearly 3 feet of Picatinny rail space for mounting optics and other accessories. Plenty of vent holes in the handguard ensure maximum cooling during sustained fire. Free-floating, 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel is 16"" long, with a unique, multi-port flash suppressor. Comes with a correct-weight recoil buffer for use with 5.7 x 28mm ammo; fits in the receiver extension of an M4-style stock"

If you are familiar with SKS drums or have done your homework on them you know you have to tweak the tower and file them down to properly fit and feed ammo correctly (or at all since the 'gap' in the tower wouldn't even allow 7.62x39 shells to pass through!).

This rifle needs no description. If you know big bore classics, then you know almost everything you need to by reading the title alone. The only pertinent info I should have to pass on to you is that although the stock is nice, it may not be the original one. The stock of this rifle bears the initials PLK. Not sure if its a brand or a proud previous owners initials. 

The rifle is in perfect working order and shows less than moderate wear. Bolt slack is typical of a 61 year old rifle. 

These rifles fetch a price up to $1600, but due to the stock, I am asking only a fraction of that price. Cash sale price is $850 and will consider trades for a .40 or .45 cal pistol, preferably a 1911 style .45

487,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1631487,For Sale:  Paracord 550 Adjustable Survival Rifle Sling Strap For AR15 AK47 SKS,"Shelbyville KY, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 25,"Listed On: Thursday, March 5, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Custom made black adjustable paracord 550 parachute cord survival rifle Sling. Adjustable from 22"" to 44"" inches in length. The Universal nylon ends will fit almost any rifle. Will fit most tactical rifles. Some hunting rifles have a quick detach swivel stud, (see pictures above). For those rifles you might need to purchase a set of quick detach swivels to attach this sling. The nylon will also not scratch your gun like the steel clips will. The ends are made of 1"" wide 4200lb tensile strength nylon. You could pull a truck with this stuff. I use the nylon instead of leather for the added strength and will not get brittle like leather over time. The nylon is held together with a black 1/4"" chicago screw. The black finish on the screws are highly scratch resistant, seems to be a black chrome finish. Made of new USA made Mil spec government approved 550 7 strand Paracord. There is a total of about 50 feet of paracord in this sling. In an emergency you can unravel the outer 25 feet of cord and still have a useful black sling. 

The USA made paracord is manufactured to Mil-C-5040H Type III standards. This paracord has seven removable inner strands. Each of the 7 strands of 100% nylon strands are made from two-ply yarns. This is certainly not the lower quality paracord that is made from bulk fibers. Each of these 7 strands are capable of holding 50 pounds. The outer cord is made from 32 strands which are braided together and can hold 200 pounds. Add it up (50x7 + 200) and the cord can hold 550 lbs, therefore it is truly 550 paracord. 
Paracord is like duck tape and has unlimited uses only limited by your imagination. The 7 inner strands can also be removed and used for things like fishing line, or sewing thread.


I usually sell them for $50, but they are now just $25. Shipping is free. I take Pay-pal or can meet in Shelbyville KY.

Up for sale I have a H&K P2000sk chambered in 9mm. There's less than 100 rounds though it. I took it out shooting once with only two boxes of ammo, and I shot my Glock 19 I had with me too. I had Meprolight night sights installed and sighted in with the bullet type laser bore sight. It was produced January 10th 2013 and come with everything in the box: 2 factory magazines, factory sights included, two backstraps, the lock key, manual, and the actual case, literally everything. Oh and the gun is completely ambidextrous, magazine release, slide release, and hammer release.

I prefer calling or texting REDACTED my name is Dave, email is ok too I check it through out the day.

The reason I'm selling it is because my Glock 19 (pictured with the H&K) fits my giant hands better. And my better half likes her LC380 better. So out it goes."

When looking at an item in the left hand column it says ‘Price’: then it says ‘Seller’ (private usually). Under ‘Seller’ in royal blue it says “Listings by this user.” When you hit that, the scammers other items for sale will pop up. One scammer that tends to use ‘Jacksonville’ as his location currently has 14 items for sale. He is very clever in that he changes the backdrop colors (some blue, red, white, military canvass etc) and his print type will change etc. He creates this illusion to deceive you, the would be buyer, that there are many different guns for sale by many different sellers. Just for fun ‘search’ Ruger SR-556. Hit Listings by this user  on some of the newest ones. He has two SR-556’s you will see what I am talking about, but maybe he will pull his ad and move on to Idaho ‘Armslist.’

Bottom line, when someone will ONLY SHIP and not meet face to face or provide info they will be a scam. Don’t send money to anyone unless of course, a dealer.

I hope this helps someone (and no, I did not get ripped off, just passing along info)."

I have a Smith & Wesson M&P 9c Compact with two mags, box, casing from factory, etc.. Only have two of the three backstraps though. In overall good condition w/little to no wear. This model does have the thumb safety.

In addition, I have a Viridian C5 series green laser that was mounted to this firearm at one point. It can be set for solid or strobe operation. Shows no wear and is in good condition. Also included will be the battery that came with it and (3) additional OE Viridian replacement batteries (4 total).

The IWB hybrid holster is made by Theis Holsters and was custom made by Mr. Theis to accommodate the M&P 9c with the Viridian attached. It works great with or without the laser actually mounted to the firearm. It also has the upgraded ""extreme duty kydex clips."" Shows some minor wear from firearm insertion and general carry.

Both the upper and lower receivers are all metal, unlike many of the other dedicated 22LR AR training rifles.  This definitely feels like a rifle when compared to an S&W 15-22.  I purchased this because it has a collapsible stock enabling it to be adjusted so my 8 year old could use it at the range.  However, because of the metal construction, it weighs approximately 7 lbs, which is too heavy for him to hold.  However, this does closely approximate the weight of an actual AR, making this a realistic dedicated 22LR trainer.  I am including 500 rounds of Winchester M-22 ammunition designed for AR-style rifles because what fun is it to buy a new gun and not have any ammo to shoot in it!

798,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1631798,For Sale:  Dillon Square Deal Progressive Machine,"Colorado City, Pueblo, Colorado",$ 350,"Listed On: Friday, May 17, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Dillon Square Deal – Compact Progressive Reloading Machine

This setup is in good condition and works great.  Remarkably faster than any standard reloading press, and easy to use (but not as easy to set up).  More information is readily available on the Dillon website, including a demonstration video.  It really is that easy to use.  These Square Deal presses are also covered by Dillon’s “No BS” warranty, which provides lifetime warranty protection.  Dillon will even rebuild the machine upon request and without charge (except for shipping).  I’m not sure why that would ever be needed as it is very well built and I don’t see anything that would wear out except maybe in commercial use.

This is the solution to these repeated shortages of pistol ammunition.  It is much cheaper to stockpile primers and powder than it is ammunition.  Bullets always seem to be available, although delivery times are currently slow.

I have the press, with the standard auto powder and auto primer accessories.  It also has a low primer alert and a nice custom knob on the powder measure, which is a big improvement when using the press.

I am selling it set up to run one cartridge.  I have dies and tool heads for .38 Special, 357 Magnum, 9mm, and .45 acp.  Your choice on what you want set up in the press.  I will also provide a free Lee powder scale if you don’t already have one.

I will also be selling the extra dies and tool heads and whoever buys the press will have first choice.  Although it is obviously possible to change the dies in a tool head, but having everything set up in its own tool head greatly facilitates changing the reloading machine to a different caliber.

The only reason I am replacing this machine is that I also want to be able to reload rifle cartridges with the same kind of Dillon setup.  The Square Deal press will only reload straight wall pistol cases.

I am asking $350 for the press and related equipment with everything required to load one of the above listed cartridges.  I’m sure this seems high compared to simply ordering a new one, but Dillon is currently running a 6 to 8 week backlog and that is impacting prices.  $350 is a pretty average current sell price on Ebay.  If I don’t sell it in the next week or so, I will just list it on Ebay.

I will sell any remaining toolhead/die sets for the current Dillon delivered price ($133.39) as soon as the press is sold.  Your advantage is no 6 to 8 week wait, and everything is already installed in the tool head and ready to run.

Call me at REDACTED or email me at REDACTED   I am located in Colorado City (about 25 miles south of Pueblo).  I will be in Denver on May 22 and could deliver the press to the metro area, but would much prefer to have the new owner pick it up here so I can go through the operation of the press with them."

New Gun Laws Took Effect July 1! 
Here's what I've learned that the news is not disclosing---

State law limits the amount the FFL Dealer can charge for Background Checks to only $10. It's basically a tax; the store must turn it over to the State.
The store must retain records for 20 years
The store must inspect the weapon; deeming it safe to operate.

I believe Corral Pawn on Main St. in Trinidad is doing the BGCs. Also, I was told Artic Gun, on 6th St, in Pueblo is doing them. Or, paid in full first, I will agree to ship UPS OVER-NITE to your FFL Dealer for Transfer; at your expense.

805,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1631805,For Sale:  Supressor/Silencer 22LR,"Missouri City, Houston, Texas",$ 199,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 5, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Guardian 22 the goal was simple - create a great quality suppressor with best-in-class suppression that could be purchased for the price of a tax stamp. You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, multi-caliber usage, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 22 has it all.

Suppression:
The Guardian 22 compares favorably to suppressors costing twice as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian utilizes K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest suppressors available.

Maintenance:
Just because you can take a suppressor apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable suppressors, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted an extra $50. Even if the tool worked, you can't get the suppressor apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired. And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.

Longevity:
There are several features designed into the Guardian 22 to ensure safe and enjoyable use beyond a lifetime. Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. Our end caps are made of softer aluminum so that if there is an end cap strike, the end cap will give way causing minimal if any damage to the rest of your Guardian 22 suppressor. The affected end cap, and any damaged baffles can be easily replaced without having to replace the entire core.

Upgradability:
The Guardian 22 shares the same dimensions as our Kestrel 22, a premium level, heavy duty suppressor providing best in class suppression along with unparrelled maintainence and longevity options. Your Guardian 22 can be upgraded at any time to use the Kestrel core, giving you a path to to most capable rimfire suppressor we offer.

Other Options:
The Guardian 22 can be configured with a stainless steel endcap (on the muzzle attach side) and/or stainless steel blast chamber.

808,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1631808,For Sale/Trade:  Ruger 10/22 Charger Archangel 'Stock',"Wamego, Topeka, Kansas",$ 70,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 23, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Archangel 'Stock' for Ruger Charger.
Used, great condition, comes with the packaging.

Here's the manufacturer's page for it on their store.
http://www.promagindustries.com/product-p/aa556p.htm
You could pay them $135 to ship you one, or you could swing by Wamego and take mine for $70 and hardly be able to tell the difference.

This 'stock' is a pistol grip and freefloat handguard for a Ruger Charger Pistol, but it will also fit on the 10/22 rifle. Since it was made for a pistol, though, it does not have an actual buttstock for shouldering, or a drop in mount for one.
There's solid material where you'd want a mount, though, so with a little ingenuity, you could get a buttstock on it, adapting it for use with a rifle.

Basically the only noticeable wear is that the mag well is not as tight anymore, but it's still TOO tight, if anything; the mags still don't drop free.
So the gist of the condition is, it's not even broken in!

The archangel 'stock' included a mag release, but I don't have any other mag release of my own. I'll still include it if you want it, but I'll knock $5 off the price if you don't want it, or if you want to trade mag releases.

I'm only interested in face to face sale/trade, for now.
Shoot me an email if you've got questions or an offer."

 Hello and Thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a brand new in box Barrett M107A1 CQ .50 BMG with a 20"" barrel. Mounted on this beast is a Japan Vortex Razor 5-20X50 ILL. Please check availability before bidding.

 A whole new legend.
 It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

 Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

 The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

 Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability.

 Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side.

 The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

 Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

 Features:
 Suppressor-ready muzzle brake.
 Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. 
 Accepts M1913 accessory rails.
 Thermal cheek guard.
 Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail.

862,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1631862,For Sale:  Silencer/Supressor 556 .223,"Missouri City, Houston, Texas",$ 449,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 5, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"User serviceable centerfire rifle suppressors have been longer and heavier than their sealed counterparts. That's changed with the introduction of the Kestrel 5.56. Engineered from the ground up to maximize serviceability while not compromising on weight, length, or strength, the Kestrel 556 provides the most user friendly centerfire rifle suppressor in existence. Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, ease of maintenance, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Kestrel 5.56 has the features you are looking for.

Suppression:
The Kestrel 5.56 had one goal - provide a hearing safe centerfire rifle suppressor that can be easily maintained and repaired. It does not disappoint.

Maintenance:
Cleaning the Kestrel 5.56 is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors. With the Kestrel 5.56 full user servicability is truely a reality. The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core.

Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it. And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.

Longevity:
There are several features designed into the Kestrel to ensure your safe and enjoyable use of the Kestrel beyond a lifetime. Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. The Kestrel design separates the end cap from the registered part so that if there is an end cap strike it will be more likely your suppressor can be repaired or replaced without having to replace the registered part.

We are huge proponents of stacked bafle technology for another reason. With a monocore, there is only one blast baffle. When that blast baffle erodes, the core has to be replaced. This may or may not be a warranty repair, but in any event you have lost the use of your suppressor while it is at the manufacturer for repair.

Kestrel core baffles should be rotated (like tires) whenever the core is cleaned. With four baffles available to act as blast baffles, the Kestrel will allow up to five times the number of rounds fired before re-coring.

Safety:
The Kestrel core is fully encased in an inner stainless steel wall. In the event of an internal baffle strike, the inner core is strong enough to capture the damaged projectile and baffle material, protecting the tube as much as possible against catastrophic failure.

Boat is in great shape and the cabin and cushions still look new. Now for the story...... brand new engine placed in it last year, boat ran excellent but the outdrive started making noise so I pulled it to get it fixed however didnt get around to it until early this year. Outdrive was completely gone through, new seals, all bellows replaced. gimbal bearing replaced , u joints replaced. the outdrive is now at 100%. (Can give you the number to the shop that did the work) so... got the boat and outdrive back from the shop and found the trim pump was bad so that is also new. get the boat fired up (runs excellent still) getting water in the oil. (mad) well come to find out I cracked my brand new engines block by not winterizing it last year because the outdrive wasn't on it. so the block needs to be replaced all internals and accessories have less then 10 hrs on it so my plan was to buy a 100 dollar block from the junk yard (always used auto said they would give me one for that price)and just switch everything over. only reason I'm selling is because I just picked up a newer deck boat that fits my fishing and family boat needs. This is easily a 5000 dollar boat just need money right now to take care of some fines. Boat still runs excellent and I can show you, just gets water in oil because the block is cracked. I'm not willing to give it away so lowballers keep it moving. If I don't sell I will rebuild it. Just figured someone would like a great deal on a very dependable boat once the block is replaced. as cockpit enclosure, vhf radio and fish finder(screen needs replacing)Also waiting on title to come back in my name to sign over, so willing to take deposit until you receive the title.

 Hello and Thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a brand new in box Barrett M107A1 CQ .50 BMG with a 20"" barrel. Mounted on this beast is a Japan Vortex Razor 5-20X50 ILL. Please check availability before bidding.

 A whole new legend.
 It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

 Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

 The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

 Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability.

 Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side.

 The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

 Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

 Features:
 Suppressor-ready muzzle brake.
 Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. 
 Accepts M1913 accessory rails.
 Thermal cheek guard.
 Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail.

 Hello and Thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a brand new in box Barrett M107A1 CQ .50 BMG with a 20"" barrel. Mounted on this beast is a Japan Vortex Razor 5-20X50 ILL. Please check availability before bidding.

 A whole new legend.
 It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

 Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

 The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

 Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability.

 Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side.

 The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

 Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

 Features:
 Suppressor-ready muzzle brake.
 Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. 
 Accepts M1913 accessory rails.
 Thermal cheek guard.
 Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail.
