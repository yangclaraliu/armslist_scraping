Comes with the usual factory items and then some, six mags (1-18rd CZ, 5-17rd Mec-Gar), extra custom aluminum grips (pictured), 1-Kydex IWB holster, 1-Kydex OWB holster (not pictured), and the factory parts are also included (pictured).  This CZ 75 has at least $400 worth of custom job done to it.  It has the defensive carry package parts from Cajun Gun Works. Including an extended slide stop, and a trigger job (trigger pull is so smooth). It also has the TruGlo PRO TFX fiber optics/night sights, and a CGW 10X barrel bushing. I like this gun a lot and it is set up for competition. But I don’t compete and too nice for me to shoot. Traded this gun and thinking about keeping it for a little while. But it was more like an impulse trade...lol. I’m more of a collector than a shooter, and need some funds for another project. Overall, the gun is in mint condition. Must have a CCDWL to buy/trade this gun. I do have a CCDWL if you need to check. Face to face deals only. No shipping. Meet within the surrounding counties only. Package sell or trade only. Will not separate the extras from the gun. $1,000 for all. Cash price is FIRM. Trade value is $1,100. No low ball. Way over $1,300 invested on this gun and the extras. Low ball offers will not get a reply or will be ignored. No calls or texting (I’m not giving my number out to a total stranger). I need to know you first. There are too many scammers out there. I’ve been burned before. Corresponds via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting. Thanks for looking."

The sale/trade will include the G17 which has truglow night sights and a tungsten guide rod installed, the oe sights/guide rod, original Glock “Tupperware” case it came in, 4 mags - (2) 10 round and (2) 17 round, a desantis intruder iwb holster (very comfortable) and around 400 rounds of ball/defense rounds.   The gun fires beautifully - no jams, misfeeds, or anything like that. It’s very accurate and the tungsten guide rod really does reduce muzzle flip.   I’m mainly interested in trading for a nice hunting rifle chambered in 30-06, possibly .308, but will sell for the right price. Ideally I’d like a Remington 700 BDL, but will definitely take a look at other offers. Please, no cheap rifles. The ammo alone is worth a few hundred dollars so don’t offer me a $250 rifle.   If I sell/trade, the transaction will be done LEGALLY with proper paperwork. Don’t hesitate to email me with any questions."

572,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8261572,For Sale/Trade:  Diamondback DB9 – “YJ” Series - Black - 9mm,"College Station, Houston, Texas",$ 225,"Listed On: Saturday, May 5, 2018",Handguns,Diamondback Firearms                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Almost NIB Diamondback DB9 (9mm) in black. You can see from the photos this gun is in excellent shape. The serial number begins with “YJ” which is the most recent series Diamondback makes.  They finally got it right with this series of the gun and this one has performed flawlessly.  I'm the original owner.I bought it new a few weeks ago and it has approximately 50 rounds through it. It really didn’t need any breaking in and has worked just fine from the start.I truly wanted this gun to work for me but it’s a little snappy for my old arthritic hands. That’s a shame because this one’s very reliable, unlike some of the older series DB9’s out there.The DB9 is an outstanding pocket-carry design with a smooth trigger, very similar to a Glock (even down to its take-down method). It's light weight with an ultra-flat profile (11 oz. weight & 0.8 inch width) and that makes it the lightest, slimmest, and smallest 9mm available.  Even though it's the same size as a Ruger LCP, you won’t have to settle for a .380. It's easy to pocket carry and just disappears in your pocket or purse.I’ve found that the DB9 likes a steady diet of Remington UMC 115 gr JHP’s. These rounds run toward the lower end of the SAAMI spec for overall length. I’ve put a digital caliper on these rounds and they average about a thousandth of an inch shorter than most other 9mm rounds…certainly within the SAAMI spec but just short enough to accommodate the tight tolerances of this micro-nine. This DB9 loves them and if you feed it well, it will perform for you.The full package comes with the original Diamondback box, soft case, trigger lock, all paperwork that came from the factory (as shown in photo). It also includes two 6-round mags supplied by Diamondback, with a pinkie extension on one of them and a +2 mag extension on the other.  Both mags are the good ones made in Italy. The gun includes the lifetime factory warranty.  The gun also has a Talon grip installed (easily removed if you don't like them) and a nice leather pocket-carry sleeve for the extra mag.I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas without shipping. Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TX driver’s license or permit.  I’m in College Station so the triangle formed by Austin, DFW, and Houston is do-able.  Let's meet halfway or even partway to reduce our driving time.  That would be much appreciated.If I don’t respond to your email immediately, it only means I’m at work and I’ll respond soon after I get home. If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.The price is firm.  My only trade interest would be a Glock-42 (with cash added on my end).  Low-ball offers will be respectfully ignored. Thanks!"

The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel – not plastic – and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro 9 includes en extended 7-round magazine.Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro 9 pistols are the right choice for many applications.

Resembles a Beretta with the open top slide. All steel with wood grips.Holds 12 + 1, comes with 2 magazines. Made in Italy by Armi Tanfoglio Giuseppe, imported by Excam. Tanfoglio still makes guns as most people know, but this model was discontinued in either the 1980s or 90s. You can still find plenty of parts for it on Numrich or elsewhere online, though.Hammer fired, single action. Has a firing pin safety, half cock, and a magazine disconnect safety (which I’m sure you could take out if you so wanted). Has a takedown switch that’s a little interesting. Just like the takedown lever on a lot of handguns (like the Bersa Thunder), but it functions as a switch instead of being spring loaded, so you don’t have to hold it down to pull the slide off. It also disconnects the trigger when you activate it, so they’ve labeled it as a secondary safety. Has good sights, overall condition looks very good with some slight wear on the wood grips and a small scratch near the chamber.This gun does need a little bit of gunsmithing attention, however. The disassembly switch works as a safety, but the firing pin safety does not work. Might need a new safety switch for it.UPDATE: I currently have this firearm at a gunsmith in order to fix the issue with the primary safety. When I get it back, I will remove this line of text."

Its patented Impulse Diffusion design minimizes side blast and rear-directed concussion effects. The ProComp 556 duplicates the design of the SureFire SOCOM SFMB-556-1/2-28 muzzle brake, but unlike the latter it cannot be used to mount SureFire SOCOM suppressors.  Precision machined from US mill-certified steel bar stock—including high-precision cut threads for optimum thread interface—the ProComp 556 muzzle brake has a black Melonite finish that provides maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions.  The SureFire ProComp 556 muzzle brake has a blind pilot hole at the 3 and 9 o’clock position to enable fine-tuning of recoil characteristics for individual shooting styles or ammunition characteristics.  Each ProComp 556 muzzle brake is covered by SureFire’s No-Hassle Promise.  FITS: M4, M16 and variants with 1/2-28 muzzle threads  NOTE: SureFire ProComp muzzle brakes are stand-alone muzzle devices and do not serve as mounts/adapters for any SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors.

Includes practice and home defense ammo, plus an adapter that allows the weapon to fire Aguila Mini-Shells, nearly doubling its capacity. Bought this new a month or so ago. I've had it out of its box for about five minutes total. It's still in its box with everything that came with it.You probably know this, but the Shockwave has a 14 inch barrel, making it look like a sawed off shotgun. But it qualifies (for now at least) as a pistol, so you don't need tax stamps. For what it's worth, I have two friends who own these, and they say shooting them is the most fun they've had at the gun range in years. I'm asking for $425 cash, since this includes ammo and the adapter. I may be open to trades; I'd probably throw in some money to move up to a Kimber 9mm Nightfall, an H&K or something else sweet.

I am hesitant to sell it but at $600, I'd be comfortable letting it go because I don't shoot it much and I like to shoot any gun I own. I am firm on the price and only open to trades for other appreciating guns but I'd prefer cash. I have no problem keeping it as a collector's piece so take into consideration the manufacturing date and the condition before contacting me. If it sells, it sells. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Won't bother me either way. I want to let another gun enthusiast have the chance to own it."

I have used this kit for training and competition purposes, it has done me very well.  The reason I am selling is to get gear that is more focused on what I do and to clear up some space.  This kit is very good for training and competition and the retention on the mags and pistols in phenomenal.  the inner belt helps keep your belt from bouncing around and makes it much easier to toss on and toss off.  The first picture with it all decked out just is present to give you an idea of how you can run it.  This would make a great set up for a LEO or an informed civilian.  If you only run a pistol and two mags the rifle mag carrier is adjustable and could be used to hold a notebook or modified IFAK.  The whole set up is modular and things can be moved around at your leisure.  Please note this is being sold as a set up for right handed shooters, sorry left-handers (I still love you)."

All serial numbers match.  Comes with an original Czech Military / Police CZ 82 tan leather pistol holster, one (1) set of extra black leather quick-release holster for the CZ 82 and mag pouch made in Prague, and two (2) extra grips (wood and plastic).Manufactured by the Czechoslovak firm Česká zbrojovka the vz. 82 replaced the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 52 pistol in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. “Vz” is an abbreviation for “vzor”, which translates to “model”. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous."

CZ Model 1924 (vz. 24), in .380 ACP, was the standard Czechoslovak Army pistol of the inter-war period manufactured by Česka Zbrojovka (CZ) in Prague (as displayed on a rib on the top of the slide “Česka Zbrojovka A.S. v Praze”). There is something special and intriguing about this pistol. Extremely low Serial Number: 1259. No import marks. All components match: barrel, frame, and slide. The pistol has 98% of its original bright blue finish remaining. The trigger, hammer, and extractor retain about 98% of the original straw color. It is fitted with one-piece, smooth and well-preserved walnut grips. Excellent overall condition. Overall, approximately 200,000 CZ 24 pistols were made. According to most sources, the regular serial number range for the CZ 24 pistol is: 12,000-190,000 (according to the book “Know Your Czechoslovakian Pistols” by R. J. Berger, there were some pistols produced as part of small international orders/contracts in a separate serial number range, for example, all 9-shot CZ 24 pistols range from serial number 1 to about 3,100, and are dated from 1929 to 1931). The serial number of this pistol is 1259! However, it is not a 9-shot pistol. The three nearest lowest serial numbers we have seen in years were in the 10,000, 11,000, and 12,000 range…and nothing in between. Again, our pistol’s serial number is 1,259. Based on the proof marks, the featured pistol seems to be a part of the original order for 20,000 CZ 24 pistols completed in June 1926. The pistol is factory dated 25 (1925) and it stayed in the factory warehouse until purchased by the Military in 1926. It displays the 1926 acceptance “J, rampant lion, 26” mark of Czechoslovak Military. The pistol is unit marked to the Czechoslovak Army’s 17th infantry regiment (17P 39). If this pistol wasn’t a part of a small international contract, it had to be captured by the British Army during WWII. In June 1945, the British Army stood at 3 million men, and with its Allies, it was victorious against Nazi Germany in Tunisia, Italy (1943), France and Germany (1944-45) etc. But then how did the featured CZ 24 end up in the United States? The British have laws, dating back to 1813, relating to the sale of guns that go some way to protecting the public from unsafe guns of any age. All British guns are tested before they can be sold by a system known as “proofing”. This takes place in one of the UK proof houses: Birmingham or London. Pistols that received British proofs prior to being disposed of in the 1950s, should have matching proofs on the slide, receiver (frame), and barrel. Britain has used two commonly found sets of proof marks. One is from the Proof act of 1925-1955, the other is the Proof act of 1955. The 1955 proof act removed the requirement to mark the pistol “Not English Make”. Our featured CZ 24 pistol displays the “Not English Make” mark underneath the 1926 acceptance “J, rampant lion, 26” mark of Czechoslovak Military. Therefore, the pistol was brought to Britain before 1955. Our pistol displays the Birmingham Proof House marks: crown over “BP” on barrel, crown over “NP” on barrel, and a crown over ""BV"" on barrel, slide, and receiver (frame). These Birmingham Proof House marks date back to 1925-1954. The circle around the marks means “Not English Made”. “BP” surmounted by a crown represents “Provisional and Definitive Proof”. “BV” surmounted by a crown is a “View Mark”. “NP” surmounted by a crown is a “Definitive Nitro Proof”. The CZ 24 was an improved version of the CZ 22, which had been licensed from Mauser. Production of the CZ 24 started in August 1925. The original order for 20,000 pistols was completed in June 1926. More orders followed, and by the end of 1929, 100,000 pistols had been accepted by the Military and Gendarmerie, called in Czechoslovakia the “Četnictvo”. An inventory on January 1, 1939, showed the Czechoslovak Army and Air Force had on hand 171,756 CZ 24 pistols. CZ 24 is a meticulously crafted, well-built, robust, and reliable pistol that was very highly thought of at the time. During the German occupation (March 1939 – May 1945), the Czechoslovak Armed Forces were disarmed, and all the weapons were utilized by Germany and its allies. The CZ 24 pistols were not marked by the Germans, in any way, except for those used by the German Navy. CZ 24 pistols were also issued to the German Air Force, and Waffen-SS. The pistol is fitted with one-piece, smooth wood grips. Magazine capacity is eight rounds, and a Mauser Model 1910-style safety switch is mounted to the left of the pistol. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap holster containing one extra CZ 24 magazine."

The barrel has been shortened and all metal has been refinished. The wood may or may not have the original finish but has no splits or cracks. There are some small dings and scratches and chips and someone has carved a small “W” on the left side near the receiver. The bore has some light pitting but is bright and has plenty of rifling remaining to make a good shooting rifle. The action is tight and really feels good when you work the lever with no play or sloppiness. To sum up here you are looking at a good tight Winchester model 1886 with a decent bore that should make a good shooting rifle.
