I'm selling my S&W Model 10-6 .38spl 4-inch barrel revolver.  I'm also including a box of Speer Lawman 158gr +P flat-point FMJ ammo.  (This load is extremely accurate in this revolver.)  This Model 10 has the heavy barrel (as opposed to the thin pencil-type on other Model 10s), and has a factory matte blue finish.  It has a smooth-faced trigger, locks up tight, and is in perfect mechanical condition.  As you can see in my photos, it's in excellent cosmetic condition as well.  This model revolver was used by police departments for decades until most of them switched to semi-auto pistols.  It is cleaned, lubed, and ready for use.  This revolver makes an excellent home-defense handgun.  My price is $400 cash.

The flexibility of such force multiplication makes the SAW-MAG™ the most dominant accessory for the M4/M16/M27/HK416 family of weapons.

The SAW-MAG™ is a hybrid design externally constructed of thick walled long glass polymer and steel. This allows the magazine to have the durability to survive real world conditions. The hardened steel USGI tower allows it to fit into any weapon that accepts the 30 round standard magazine. All parts are from production tooling for precision and economics.

The SAW-MAG™ was designed to have the lowest operating drag due to friction. The ammunition is contained individually inside the drums on sprockets, each cartridge gets its own separate space, the ammunition is picked off the sprockets when they spin, not a typical high friction convergence found on cheaper designs. This is why our system does not require graphite lubrication to work. Instead of funnelling the ammunition, the SAW-MAG™ uses a proprietary design that allows the ammunition to always be in a singular stream which results in a very low friction operation."

The flexibility of such force multiplication makes the SAW-MAG™ the most dominant accessory for the M4/M16/M27/HK416 family of weapons.

The SAW-MAG™ is a hybrid design externally constructed of thick walled long glass polymer and steel. This allows the magazine to have the durability to survive real world conditions. The hardened steel USGI tower allows it to fit into any weapon that accepts the 30 round standard magazine. All parts are from production tooling for precision and economics.

The SAW-MAG™ was designed to have the lowest operating drag due to friction. The ammunition is contained individually inside the drums on sprockets, each cartridge gets its own separate space, the ammunition is picked off the sprockets when they spin, not a typical high friction convergence found on cheaper designs. This is why our system does not require graphite lubrication to work. Instead of funnelling the ammunition, the SAW-MAG™ uses a proprietary design that allows the ammunition to always be in a singular stream which results in a very low friction operation."

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories. The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

I have a Mossberg Maverick 88, 12ga. Very little use on my part, I am the 2nd owner though. The overall condition is 9/10. The barrel and mag tube has some scratches on it. This was one of my builds I did earlier this year, I bought her in 100% functional used condition.   I was going to cerakote it and thread the barrel for a muzzle break but money is tied up with a baby on the way. I am a gunsmith so I affirm this firearm is functional, but it could use some cosmetic touch ups.
Here is what I have done with her:
-Barrel is cut and filled to aprox 19"" (its about 1/4"" over 18.5"") 
-Blackhawk! 6pos stock, pistolgrip with KNOXX recoil system (google it, its quality+)
ONLY WILL INCLUDE THE STOCK IF I SELL IT FOR THE $500. WILL SELL IT WITH STANDARD STOCK FOR $425.
-B-Square scope saddle mount.
-Fiberglass resin molded heatshield. 
-Magpul BUIS (only rear installed, because lacking front sightblock. I have the pair)
-Magpul AFG1 mounted on the pumpaction using a Magpul rail and hardware drilled, tapped and loctited into the pumo. (the pump action has two other holes in it from where I originally had another rail attachment.) 
-UTG light or laser rail, mounted on the magtube
-One point tactical sling (Daniel Defense I believe)
-quick release sling swivel.

I have the original stock, all hardware KNOXX recoil system forend(does not fit this model because forend grip is not removable without replacing the entire action). I also have an NcStar reddot/laser sight that is broken(will throw it in for free), laser works, red dot does not. I bought it like that and I believe NcStar will do an exchange for you because they have a lifetime warranty. I can include 50-75 rounds of mixed 12ga ammo. Some home defense ammo but most field/target.
I have about $675 invested in it. Willing to sell her for $500 Obo. I prefer to trade it, but I'm willing to sell it and ofcourse trade+cash *I have alot of 12ga ammo that I will add if your trade includes ammo!

1) Weatherby PA-08 Synthetic shot gun
Weatherby is not as well known for their shotguns as they are for their rifles but they make shotguns just as well. The PA-08 synthtic is a solid rifle that shoots true. It has a 28' vented rib barrel and takes up to 3"" shells. I have one modified choke that came with it when I bought it. 

2) Trius 1-step clay thrower
I am going to include a like-new clay thrower with the shotgun. Works perfect.
