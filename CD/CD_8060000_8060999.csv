No problems,  low round count.  Always fun at the range everyone wants to try it,  great way to stir up conversation. also a great choice for carrying 9mm very comfortably in your pocket..  What really impressed me the most is the quality,  it is top notch.  Constructed of 7075-T6 aluminum such as your high end AR15 receivers,  with stainless steel barrels. Also has a long smooth trigger pull with no safety levers or hammers to fiddle with.  You get 2 very quick effective shots with this little pistol,  it has 3"" barrels so you can expect the same performance as your sub compact pistols from each round. Also the break action makes this gun very safe to operate when loading/unloading and is great for the wife because there is no slide to rack. Being in 9mm it is not too punishing to shoot,  and if you want more all you have to do is switch barrels and convert it to the worlds smallets .45 ACP!  I have ""too many"" pocket sized guns and work has been very slow so I think I need to part with the Doubletap..  Also I have installed a Hogue grip that makes it feel better,  easier to shoot and makes the grip not so square.. Thanks for looking!

I field stripped it, greased and oiled it, and put 20 rounds in it. Shot great. When I field stripped it appeared to have never been fired, no residue and Barrel was gleaming. My local gun smith said the same as it looks to never been fired when he looked down the barrel. $900Can meet locally I have more pictures if needed.  Message me and I can get you more pics."

There is a couple light impression marks on the forearm. Will probably come out with steam. The stock is perfect. Bluing is very strong and dark. Almost no wear on the muzzle. Id say this was a babied rifle. I have taken several high mega pixel pictures that can be copied and enlarged. This will give a better description of the rifle's true condition than I can. These pictures will show details the naked eye can't. And in most cases will show flaws worse than they actually exist. These pictures were taken outside in natural sunlight. There may be some specs of dust that reflect the sunlight. If you have questions or need additional pictures PLEASE contact me. I don't want you to be surprised when you get your rifle"

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Starting in 2016, Scorpion Pistols feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.
Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.
Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.
The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag.LOG:51458"

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Starting in 2016, Scorpion Pistols feature 1/2×28 threads hidden underneath the factory flash-hider, meaning users can fit either 1/2×28 or 18×1 accessories to the muzzle. Also added is a QD sling swivel pocket integrated into the rear sling attachment point.
Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.
Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.
The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag.LOG:51459"

The Precision MSR buttstock attaches to an AR-style buffer tube on a left-folding hinge, and adjusts for length of pull and comb height. The buttstock features QD sling attachment points, a bottom Picatinny rail, and rubber buttpad. The buffer tube accepts any AR-style stock. A medium-contour barrel is shrouded by a free-floated KeyMod® handguard for attaching aftermarket tactical accessories. The upper receiver and one-piece bolt are precision CNC-machined from pre-hardened 4140 chrome-moly steel to minimize distortion; and a 20-MOA Picatinny rail is secured to the receiver with 4 #8-40 screws. The bolt has 3 lock lugs, resulting in superior strength and a 70º throw. The bolt handle is oversized for positive engagement, and is replaceable with a 5/16""-24 thread. An extended trigger-reach, AR-style grip, and a 45º reversible safety selector provide ease of operation, and the rifle is compatible with any AR-style grip and selector. The cold hammer-forged 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel has 5R rifling, and comes with an attached hybrid muzzle brake that effectively reduces recoil, while minimizing noise and blast (thread protector included). The barrel nut enables close-tolerance headspacing, and a Marksman Adjustable™ trigger breaks clean to enhance accurate shooting. The Ruger Precision Rifle utilizes a multi-magazine interface that functions with AICS, polymer AR-10, and Gunsite Scout magazines. Includes 2 10-round magazines. LOG:45523"

Also included is a Sig X-change kit that will turn it from a .40 into a 9mm just by swapping out the slide (I used it mostly as a 9mm) which comes with another mag. So, you get a p226 that can shoot either .40 or 9mm and 4 Sig magazines. It’s really a nice system. I’ve never had a single issue at the range.I’m only selling because I’m wanting to get myself and my girlfriend each a P320. I don’t have to (nor want to) sell it, but it’ll help me get 2 p320s it’ll make her happy (which let’s be honest, will make me happier in the long run). Asking $850 obo. Obviously also interested in partial or full trade on other Sig products, particularly p320 and/or p938. Let me know what you got and make me an offer. Thanks for looking!"
