I bought this with the intention of shooting it. Little did I know that ammo would be harder to find than the gun was. Never shot. Never cleaned. Still has the oil on the barrel from the factory. The only thing I did was to instal the battery into the optic and hand-tightened it to the rail to mock it up. If you buy it I wish you luck actually finding ammo to shoot it. No trades. I can send a picture to your phone if you want one, but you could just google the model number. It's brand new, in the box.

Gun Ban Bill was approved 10-8 and will now go before the entire Senate for a vote. If the bill passes, you will no longer be able to buy this weapon. Think it won't pass?

The whole thing has been fitted into a makeshift synthetic stock, presumably for testing purposes and I was told it shoots very well.  The original owner/maker is a local (still practicing) gunsmith who was going to turn this into a benchrest/long range rifle.  The Douglas barrel is long and heavy.  I have not measured it but I am thinking 26-28"" long and as heavy as a bull barrel.  I was going to buy an aftermarket stock and new bottom metal for it (with no lock screw holes) and have lost interest in doing so. The current bottom metal is fine, it just has the lock screws that I do not care for.  It is in excellent shape, the barrel is brand new and the action has been drilled and tapped for scope mounts.  I will include the mounts that came with it.  It has also been fitted with an additional safety unit on the trigger assembly.  Open to trades and offers if you'd like a project.  The barrel alone is a nearly $400 unit, plus the action and proper fitting.  I would guesstimate it's value in the $600-800 range.  New stock and bottom metal can be procured through Brownells or Midway and you could spend anywhere from $150/both to $1,000/both depending on what you wanted to do.  Gun shoots fine in the synthetic stock it's in, it's just not pretty."

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Sig P229-1 Mags (for the Newer P229 pistols in 9mm with the post December 2010 frame) - CURRENTLY SOLD OUT

Also have the Sig Pro SP2009 / SP2022 17rd 9mm Magazines.  Compare these 17rd Mec-gar magazines to the (IMHO) less desirable ""checkmate"" magazines and you'll find that . . . there is no comparison.

Prices on magazines varies, starting at $59.95  - please email if interested in any other magazines not listed above.  If I don't have it on hand, I will do my best to find it for you.

They are all Brand New, New In Packaging, Genuine Mec-gar Magazines.

The Sig Sauer (Mec-gar) ""Super High Capacity"" Magazines (i.e., the 15rd magazines for Sig P226's chambered in 40/357 and the 20rd magazines for P226's chambered in 9mm), come with a ""Plus 2 Extension/Adapter."" The Plus 2 Extension/Adapter adds 5/8"" to the bottom of the grip, but is shaped to contour the grips of your Sig.  The other magazines have a flush flat floor plate.

Please contact me if you have any questions."

DetailsSpecificationsDownloadsReviews New for 2010, the Model 92A1 and 96A1 represent Berettaâs evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol.
Combining the best elements of the 92FS and the 90-Two,these pistols feature:
A. Higher capacity magazines: 17 rounds in 9mm.  Completely interchangeable with other 92 family magazines. Two  magazines included per pistol.
B. Removable front sight: Allows the user to easily replace a damaged sight or replace it with an accessory sight.

C. Accessory rail: The frame of the A1âs have an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D. Internal recoil buffer: Increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver created by the more powerful .40 S&W caliber ammunition.
E. Captive recoil spring assembly: The single-piece design simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss.
F. Rounded trigger guard: Updated styling to conform with current pistol gripping practices.

The cheapest that I saw across the nation is $55....... up to $100 per thousand.
I refused to sell mine for less than $60 because a buyer would be buying them to resale instead of using them.
I was trying to help, but now, I'll just pull them from sale,
I have been accused of gouging.   ""your type makes me sick""  ""I hope you choke on your profit""
Well, first, in legal definition, price gouging is ""rapid increase in price for necessary goods during a civil emergency"".
Otherwise, in a free capitilistic economy, it's just windfall profits.
Is it price gouging if you invest $100 in stock market and, 12 months later, your investment is worth $600? No! You'll be bragging to relatives and friends about your great investment.
This is what we have today, a free market. Some, like me, have invested in weapons and ammo their whole life, while others bought video games, ski boats and other crap that today is not worth a dime. It was YOUR choice.
When an item is offered and it is too expensive for you, don't try to buy it. The market will regulate what an item is worth.
Check out .22 ammo. In the past 10 years, I have bought maybe 75,000 rounds for $16 - $18 per box. That's less than 3 cents per round. Today, You'll be lucky to find any for less than 15 cents per round. It doesn't matter to me. I already have all that I need.

Just a little economic lesson for the day for the finger pointers that speak with an uneducated voice........ or maybe, they really are that stupid.
I  am amazed at how many people publish this ""price gouging"" garbage."

-Winchester Proof Steel-

-Model 94- 30-30 Win.-

Also, this gun is fully functional. It feeds rounds, goes bang, ejects rounds, and feeds the next one to continue its intended process. The action and buttstock are from 1915, but the barrel is from somewhere between 1950 & 60. What this means is that the rifle will have no trouble with copper jacketed ammunition.

STG 44 in 22 lr with 25 round magazine. It is all metal and wood made in Germany by GSG (Only thing Poly is the mag on this gun). The StG 44 is a full weight, almost exact replica of the original 8Ã33 Kurz rifle that is said to be the predecessor to the Kalashnikov AK47, as well as all of the other assault rifles spanning the decades after WWII. It comes in the Amish handmade wooden crate you see here in the pictures. As a collectorâs item, the original StG 44 is out of the reach of most American collectors, in part because the original was select fire and therefore banned from import by the 1986 machine-gun law. In semi-auto .22LR rimfire, not only can you own a gun with the original look and feel of the real StG 44, you will be able to shoot it cheaply, and it will itself be a big collectorâs item as we go down the road.

This is 100% real and what you do with this information is obviously a personal choice. Information is what allows us to make those choices that best serve us, so, here you are; ""you may not know this but George Soros owns most of the ammunition manufacturing companies and many arms manufacturers as well. He's selling ONLY to the government right now, per  WH & DHS orders. My son works for ATK, who owns just about all the rest of the ammunition companies that Soros doesn't own. He tells me ATK has been ordered by the federal government to curtail sales of ammunition, primers, and powder to the retail market. What you see currently on the shelves is old stock and what's left in wharehouses since the CT shootings and new stock will NOT be appearing anytime soon. ATK and Soros' companies have more than enough government contracts to keep them going for years to come.  Like Soros' companies, ATK is a huge defense contractor and they have been told to ONLY to sell to DOD, TSA, FBI, DHS, and local/federal law enforcement agencies.
My son has seen the proposed pricing schedule for Federal, CCI, Hornady, Remington, Winchester, and several other ammunition manufacturer's lines of ammunition, components, reloading equipment (ATK owns Outers, RCBS, Hoppe and a host of others) and he is shocked. We will be experiencing 300-400% increases across the board when and if avail. My boy is in management and they firmly believe this will shut down the civilian market while leaving the government as the only purchaser of their products. He saw the government pricing for the centerfire ammunition they've been stockpiling and their prices have actually dropped from a year ago so as civilian supply lines are drying up the federal govt. is buying ammo cheap....As an aside, here, I deal a LOT with Midsouth Shooters Supply for my reloading components. Two weeks ago I ordered 500 cases each of .45 Casull, .44 Magnum, .357 Magnum and 9mm Parabellum. I was told EVERYTHING I had ordered was out-of-stock and no in-stock delivery date was being forecast. They would not accept my backorder..."" ...So there you have it. It has begun. Do your own research. There is no reason for panic, calmly contact your local political representative and ask them to stand up and speak for you. Let's be kind to one another. Now is the time we share, not gouge. Please pass this along to anyone within your sphere that you care about. This has been happening for months behind your back. Secure ammunition as if this is the last opportunity in America to freely purchase in a private manner, and at a reasonable cost. The government believes we are not sophisticated enough to have the ammo to support the weapons we have chosen to own. Their plan is to ""starve us out"" and then offer gift cards to encourage citizens to turn over weapons they can no longer reasonably find ammunition for, and by offering an attractive price, during the declining economic period we are facing,(see Biden quote ""all we have to do is to make it too expensive...""). Game on."

 The Rapid Reticle Action-4 is not your typical red dot system. It was designed and built with the same rigid specification as the SOPS-33mm but with several unique features of its own. The Action-4 can be used with any type of firearm including handguns, whose shooters have won many accolades and competitions. With its 4 different reticles, users can be more versatile with the ability to adjust to different conditions and ranges without a second thought and on the move as proven in the 2009 Bianchi Cup. Rugged and versatile, the Action-4 comes with a set of sunshade extension, protective lens covers, and 33mm aluminum rings. Its stainless steel threaded drop drum turrets are strong and will never move from zero making it the best red-dot option on the market.
