It was purchased as new in box. I didn't like the look of the cheap synthetic stock and the heavy 3 lbs trigger pull and it suffered the accuracy. So I had my gunsmith adjusted the trigger down to 2.1 lbs professionally, make sure it's till safe when carrying around, and I painted it camouflage finish. 
After the trigger adjustment's done, the gun shoots very well with cheap CCI Blazer 40gr .22lr. The target shows 5 shot groups at 50 yards. Almost went through the same hole. The rifle had exact 50 rounds through it. No more. No less. Basically it is just a new rifle, which still 99% condition. The original box, all paperwork: warranty card, manual are included.
The reason I'm selling this, is because I've just bought an Anschutz 1416D HB on Gunbroker and I need cash to pay for it. I spent almost $400 for this Marlin, and I'm only asking just $300 for it. . 
Serious buyer, who's appreciated all the works and willing to pay me EXACTLY WHAT I'M ASKED. PLEASE CONTACT ME AT 316 519 7399
I took the lost already. And I'm not going to take more. So, lowballers please don't contact me, as I won't respond

What are so special about a factory Marlin XT-22 ?
*The gun is 100% American made, Marlin did a very good job on it. 
*The trigger is fully adjustable, Pro-Fire series trigger design ( like the Accu-trigger on Savage's ).
*Microgroove barrel rifling.
But, what made my gun even more special over the factory's one?
* Trigger job is already done on this rifle, 2.1lbs pull with no creep and travel. It breaks like glass
*Camouflage painting  
* 2-7rd magazines ( factory's only came with 1. They aren't cheap. $30/each )
*Extended picatinny rail. 25MOA rise. Not a Chinese's crap on Ebay. This rail is 100%, high quality material, American made. And it isn't cheap.

I would rate the pistol in good condition for it's age. No active rust whatsoever, and no pitting in the barrel or cylinder. Not much bluing left though. There's only some in the places that you'd expect: the lightening cuts in the cylinder and the area around the cylinder. Lockup is much better than most Webleys I've messed with, I wouldn't hesitate to shoot this one.

This Webley has had its cylinder shaved down to accept .45ACP on moonclips and .45 Auto Rim without, both are much easier to find these days than the original .455 Webley/.455 Eley cartridges it was originally chambered for. This is a common modification and will allow you to actually shoot this pistol instead of let it sit in the gunsafe.

This listing includes:
- Webley Mk VI
- Holster
- Two moonclips for .45ACP ammunition
- and a bag of miscellaneous .45ACP and .45 Auto Rim (~40 rounds I'd estimate)

After the trigger adjustment's done, the gun shoots very well with cheap CCI Blazer 40gr .22lr. The target shows 5 shot groups at 50 yards. Almost went through the same hole. The rifle had exact 50 rounds through it. No more. No less. Basically it is just a new rifle, which still 99% condition. The original box, all paperwork: warranty card, manual are included.

What are so special about a factory Marlin XT-22 ?
*The gun is 100% American made, Marlin did a very good job on it. 
*The trigger is fully adjustable, Pro-Fire series trigger design ( like the Accu-trigger on Savage's ).
*Microgroove barrel rifling.
But, what made my gun even more special over the factory's one?
* Trigger job is already done on this rifle, 2.1lbs pull with no creep and travel. It breaks like glass
*Camouflage painting 
* 2-7rd magazines ( factory's only came with 1. They aren't cheap. $30/each )
*Extended picatinny rail. 25MOA rise. Not a Chinese's crap on Ebay. This rail is 100%, high quality material, American made. And it isn't cheap.

This model is one of the classic best sporting clays auto guns ever built. I have maintained it with Breakfree CLP and never had it out hunting in wet weather. The wood finish is near mint with only a few minor dents in the clear finish (no deep scratches) too hard to see in the pics, and the blueing on the barrel and receiver is 100% with the only metal-finish flaw being on the end of the forearm end cap (request pics). It is currently set up with HIVIZ fiber-optic turkey sights (comes with 3 more fiber-optic front sight tubes)and sighted in to pattern brilliantly from 0-40 plus yards with Win. Bismuth No-Tox #4 ammo but should also be sighted in for any ammo for shotgun distances. It is ready to turkey hunt or pass shoot as-is right out of the box. The original screw-on bead front sight is NOT included. Will consider PayPal if ""gifting"" payment and sending to your FFL for an additional $35. MORE PICS of the rest of the gun are available upon request. It is FOR SALE ELSEWHERE so I reserve the right to end this sale early at my discretion.

I put a box of ammo down range, and just fired 1 more rd to make sure it still was in perfect working order since it set for 8 yrs now.... hence 21 rds and only a box of 19 come with it LOL
if it is a full cash offer I might have a scope lying around I could ad, $50 for a silver Simons 3x9 or $125 for a Leupold 3x9
hunting season is right around the corner and if your looking to get into a big game rifle don't let this one get away, is brand new and 1/3 less then I have into it. 
also comes ready to shoot ammo included :)

The P7's spring extractor is contained within the slide, while the fixed ejector is a surface on the slide catch.
The grip of this pistol features a built-in cocking lever activated by gripping the pistol handle. Before the pistol can be fired, this lever must be squeezed. Thus this lever acts as a safety.
The P7 is a German 9mm semi-automatic pistol  produced by Heckler & Koch . It was revealed to the public for the first time in 1976 as the PSP (Polizei-Selbstlade-Pistole—“police self-loading pistol”
The decision to equip West German police with an advanced 9mm service pistol and replace existing 7.65mm-caliber weapons was prompted after the 1972 Munich Olympics MassacreSeries production of the P7 started in 1979. A schematic of the P7's gas-delayed blowback system.  IT HAS A FIXED BARREL WICH HELPS MAKE IT ONE OF THE MOST ACCURATE PISTOLS EVER DESIGNED.
The P7 is a semi-automatic blowback-operated firearm. It features a unique gas-delayed blowback locking system modeled on the Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol[5] (and ultimately on the Barnitzke system first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5[6]), which used gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and fed them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined—after the bullet has left
The P7 is fed from a single-stack box magazine with a capacity of 8 rounds.
The firearm uses a fixed, polygonal barrel (hexagonal with a 250 mm twist rate) and a fixed notched iron sight with contrast dots that enable shooting in low-level lighting conditions. The pistol is completely ambidextrous and two-handed use is enhanced through the use of a profiled and enlarged trigger guard.
This is a great concealment gun.  It small with out giving up the accuracy of a larger pistol.  I HAVE TIGHTER GROUPINGS WITH THIS THAN MY HK P7 Long Slide. It has been considered to be the most accurate and safest  single action pistols ever made.
STAINLESS BARREL/ SINGLE STACK 8 SHOT 9MM
BUY ONE WHILE YOU CAN STILL GET ONE.  The gun has been  DuraCoated (which is a very popular finish).
It also accepts magazines from P7M8’s, which are cheap and plentify available.

In a 53-46 vote, the senate narrowly passed a measure that will stop the United States from entering into the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. The Statement of Purpose from the bill read: To uphold Second Amendment rights and prevent the United States from entering into the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. The U.N. Small Arms Treaty, which has been championed by the Obama Administration, would have effectively placed a global ban on the import and export of small firearms. The ban would have affected all private gun owners in the U.S., and had language that would have implemented an international gun registry on all private guns and ammo. Astonishingly, 46 of our United States Senators were willing to give away our Constitutional rights to a foreign power. Here are the 46 senators that voted to give your rights to the U.N. Baldwin (D-WI) Baucus (D-MT) Bennet (D-CO) Blumenthal (D-CT) Boxer (D-CA) Brown (D-OH) Cantwell (D-WA) Cardin (D-MD) Carper (D-DE) Casey (D-PA) Coons (D-DE) Cowan (D-MA) Durbin (D-IL) Feinstein (D-CA) Franken (D-MN) Gillibrand (D-NY) Harkin (D-IA) Hirono (D-HI) Johnson (D-SD) Kaine (D-VA) King (I-ME) Klobuchar (D-MN) Landrieu (D-LA) Leahy (D-VT) Levin (D-MI) McCaskill (D-MO) Menendez (D-NJ) Merkley (D-OR) Mikulski (D-MD) Murphy (D-CT) Murray (D-WA) Nelson (D-FL) Reed (D-RI) Reid (D-NV) Rockefeller (D-WV) Sanders (I-VT) Schatz (D-HI) Schumer (D-NY) Shaheen (D-NH) Stabenow (D-MI) Udall (D-CO) Udall (D-NM) Warner (D-VA) Warren (D-MA) Whitehouse (D-RI) Wyden (D-OR) People this needs to go viral. These Senators voted to let the UN take our guns. They need to lose the election. We have been betrayed. 46 Senators Voted to Give your 2nd Amendment Constitutional Rights to the U.N.

These post war rifles were built in the Fazakerley factory in 1955 for the British war reserve and got covered with grease, wrapped with paper and put in storage.  The rifles were imported in to the United States in the early 1990's and were sold to the public still in there mummy wraps.  The guns have beech stocks, black ""suncorite"" baked enamel finish on all the metal parts and brass butt plates.  There is a flip up ladder rear sight with a fine screw adjustment and a cross bolt placed through the receiver for additional strength.

  The rifle I am selling is unwrapped, in very good condition, and has a low serial number.  All the metal parts are scratch free, and the stock has minimal wear from handling and storage.  All the numbers are matching including the ones on the stock and detachable 10 round magazine.  The gun has only been fired a few times so the bore and rifling are both like new. 

  I see these guns selling for about $600 in this condition, and the price I am asking also includes 120 rounds of .303 British, and a bayonet with scabbard and frog.  I would like to keep this gun in the state so I would prefer face to face sales with Vermont residents only."
