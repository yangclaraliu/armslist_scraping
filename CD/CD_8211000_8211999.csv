It has only minor signs of wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was well taken care of, and only lightly used, despite having been previously owned. This rifle is free of all major flaws/defects, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, nicks, cuts, staining, rusting, or discoloration. It features a break-open breach, that allows a single round of .44 MAG to be loaded. The rifle easily opens when the trigger assembly is pulled, with no sticking. This rifle comes with a generic 4x32 Hunting Scope attached, and features a soft rubber butt plate to absorb most (though not all) of the rifle's recoil. The receiver, and barrel are both in great shape, with no rusting, pitting, staining or other flaws/defects. This is a fantastic rifle, that would make a great addition to anybody's collection.

Thanks for looking and have a great day.   Please text or call @ 754-7zero2-756zero"
