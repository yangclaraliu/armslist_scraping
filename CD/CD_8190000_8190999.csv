It's also in the 'law enforcement/military' configuration, which gives it the pistol grip stock, as well as the full length magazine tube. The tube holds 7 rounds, plus one in the chamber, plus one 'ghost loaded' by thumbing the round under the bolt, giving you a total of 9 rounds on tap. It comes with a standard shotgun stock, a tactical pistol grip stock, as well as a shotgun scabbard. Asking $1100, or I'm open for trades, although cash is preferred.
