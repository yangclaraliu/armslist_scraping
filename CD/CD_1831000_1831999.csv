The Police Special is built from the ground up with all Baer-made parts, except for the pins, trigger, and plastic parts. The Police Special starts with Baer’s forged upper and lower receivers of tough, aircraft-grade 7075 T6 aluminum. The forgings are hard-anodized and precision machined, then paired up during the manufacturing process so that they can be perfectly fitted for accuracy. The lower receiver has a standard, A-2-style pistol grip and a five-position collapsible stock. Controls are standard AR fare, except for the trigger, which is the excellent modular, single-stage unit made by Timney.The Picatinny-spec upper receiver readily accepts standard 1913 scope mounts and accessories, the Police Special comes with a removable carry handle with an adjustable rear sight. The front sight is a standard, fixed unit. The Police Special’s bolt and extractor are Baer’s precision-made parts, while the carrier is a Baer mil-spec part. The 16-inch, M4-style barrel is button-rifled. It has a 1:8-inch twist for accuracy with a wide variety of bullet weights and is tipped with a standard A-2 flash hider. A bayonet lug is also standard.

Comes with box, paperwork, and (2) 30 round mags.

This gun is gently used (less than 100 rounds fired through it) and in perfect condition.  A very dependable and accurate personal defense / concealed carry gun with one of the safest firing mechanisms for carrying with a round in the chamber as the pistol is never actually ""cocked"" until the triger is pulled through as the trigger is double action and sets the firing pin as its pulled.  This gun is match grade and with practice and patience can make one small jagged hole with its accuracy.  The tritium night sights are very bright and never fail.  They do not need charging with light source to glow.  They glow 100% of the time in the dark and are very large and visible during the day or night. Also have about 75+ rounds of ammo that will come with it.  Also have a concealed carry holster by Desantis that I will consider including at a bargain price.

It is the PDP4 model with the 40mm tube and large red dot.  It has 11 brightness settings and a new battery.  I don’t think they make these very more.  This one has been used, but the dot is very bright and clear, and the glass is in great shape.  It has been used on an AR-15 for years and held zero perfectly.  I am the first and only owner, and I bought it about 15 years ago I believe.

There are scuffs on the body.  Also, one of the mounting nuts/screws is missing and I had to replace it with a brass piece.  It clamps tightly and works fine, but one could find a better looking solution I am sure at the hardware store.  Not sure if anyone wants it, but it is just taking up space.  These were pretty expensive when they were new, but I will take $20 for this one.

Tight with walnut grips in excellent condition..For Sell only to Tn resident legally able to purchase a firearm

 BTJ Stand for Bellmore Johnson Tool Co. Itt is my understanding that American Derringer picked up the rights to make this derringer and is in Blue Book under DA 38 Special...I found the following info on this derringer below which appears to be accurate..It was under a Gun Brokers blog.
 The original DA 38 Derringer was made only in 38 special chambering.
 The logo ""BTJ"" stands for Bellmore Johnson Tool Co. (the ""T"" is in the middle as a stylized logo)



 The DA frame is aluminum and the barrels and latch are stainless steel. The stainless castings were made by Pinetree Castings, the same company that Ruger often used.
 The original BJT derringers did not actually have wood grips but are made from a composite wood look-alike. 
 Later, the rights to manufacture and leftover parts were bought up by American Derringer Corporation, who began making these in 38 Special and 9 mm para. The earlier ADC-DA derringers have the BTJ logo and the Hamden CT address since they were leftover and already stamped by BJT. 
 The ADC derringers now have wood laminate grips.



 There is a difference between the ADC derringers and BJT that you can see at a glance: the Safety on the ADC derringers have a center screw to adjust the safety tension. The BJT derringers have a solid safety piece and do not have or need the screw."

I know how hard it is to find this stuff, but I'm not trying to get rich.  If you can find this at a decent gun store that isn't trying to gouge their customers with panic pricing, the price is usually about $230 plus tax.  I am fine with $230 cash and won't have trouble selling it for that.

If you want to make me an offer lower than asking price, the asking price is $250, and I'll take $230 cash.  I'm not trying to be a jerk, I just know what it is worth.

This is a gorgeous example of Sturm Ruger's finest with beautiful wood, including a wooden hand guard. This rifle was originally in dark wallnut stain. I had it professionally refinished in a light blonde parade color. This particular rifle is serial numbered 000525.
Oddly enough, Ruger choise to use a completely different type of wood (walnut) to use as the handguard. The wood stock is most likely maple. 

The 180 series has features that other series did not use. The bolt hold back is a lever as opposed to a hold down pin used in later models. Also, the front and rear sights are unique to the 180 series only.

It has blue, red and ivory color clay chips, 4 antique glass jars, a bone or ivory turned dice cup, a bone or ivory round box with bone dice (season crack), a Elgin pocket watch (I wound it last night, it ran for a few hours and kept time).  An old deck of cards (not complete) with a very interesting tin or pewter card holder .  Under the tray is a Colt Pocket Serial #89097 (matching numbers).  The gun cocks and cylinder turns, but not every time - seems to do better if the barrel is pointing down.   Barrel is a little loose but overall a good gun.  It also has a powder flask which has an eagle on both sides, a wooden screwdriver and a brass colt bullet mold and a colt percussion tin box.  There is a brass pin on the right side of the box.  If you pull up on that pin, the bottom hidden drawer opens up revealing a bone handle straight razor, antique eyeglasses, 2 card cheat tools, poker dice, and a post card of guys playing cards.

I am a general gun enthusiast/collector. I am moving a couple states away within the upcoming months. I have decided to clean out my safe and trim down my inventory. I DO NOT NEED TO SELL ANYTHING. This is not a fire sale, nor a lowball offer situation. I am just moving from the un-great state of IL to a place that not only recognizes the constitution and our rights, but upholds them as well. So for all the people that don’t have the same luxury as me, I figured I would share some of my personal collection. Below I will list in numerical order what I have. I have a general idea on what I want for individual prices however I would much rather sell as package deals. If I sell as package deals expect a price cut from individual prices. As far as trades, I am only looking for a few select things at this time. They are as follows: Saiga 12g 20round drum mag, AR betta 100 round drum mag (nothing Chinese please) Saiga .308, springfield 1911, springfield XD .45 sub compact (Just the XD no XDM or XDS)A 300 blackout upper or complete gun, and a Alexander Arms .50 beowulf upper or complete gun. If you have any of these guns or parts lets make a deal. If you have something way cool that is not listed and your interested in a trade, run it by me as well- you never know… As for anyone who disagrees or is offended with prices or posts PLEASE PM ME. Tell me what you think is wrong, be prepared with evidence and we can talk it out and come to a reasonable conclusion. I am not an unfair guy by any means, but I am also not a firearm auction site nor a cheap fly by night store. I am sick and tired of the comments that you can find the same thing for $50.00 cheaper on some other site. If you seem to think you can do better PLEASE go do so, AGAIN I DON’T NEED TO SELL..

From MFG:

The SAW-MAG™ offers for the first time a reliable and efficient 150 rd magazine for the .223/5.56mm rifle. Designed to fit NATO standard (STANAG-4179) rifles, the SAW-MAG™ quickly converts a rifleman with a standard M4 into automatic support personnel. The flexibility of such force multiplication makes the SAW-MAG™ the most dominant accessory for the M4/M16/M27/HK416 family of weapons.

The SAW-MAG™ was designed to have the lowest operating drag due to friction. The ammunition is contained individually inside the drums on sprockets, each cartridge gets its own separate space, the ammunition is picked off the sprockets when they spin, not a typical high friction convergence found on cheaper designs. This is why our system does not require graphite lubrication to work. Instead of funnelling the ammunition, the SAW-MAG™ uses a proprietary design that allows the ammunition to always be in a singular stream which results in a very low friction operation."

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market.

The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

The CASV mounting system incorporates a long, uninterrupted top rail platform that runs over the Delta Ring assembly and ""Piggy Backs"" onto the Flat-Top Rail of an A3 or M4 style upper.


As a Free Floating unit, the VLTOR CASV Handguard increases the accuracy potential of your rifle by isolating the barrel from outside influences that could affect its harmonic consistency upon firing. The handguard's removable lower section maintains full compatibility with under-barrel mounted flare or grenade launchers, while optional  Modular Picatinny Rail  Sections enable the shooter to add other tactical accessories such as lights, lasers, or vertical grips only where desired, keeping the remainder of the handguard smooth and uncluttered for greater off-hand comfort and lighter overall weight.  With its All-Aluminum Construction and Hard Coat Anodized Finish, the CASV Chassis is tough, durable, rigid and lightweight. Installation is as simple as removing and replacing the factory original 2-piece handguard, with no special tools or alterations to the host rifle required.  The CASV-EL is Extended forward to envelope the Fixed Front Sight Base on the bottom and both sides, adding additional space for an extended off-hand grip or accessory placement. It comes with One 6"" Rail Section, Two 4"" Rail Sections, Two 2"" Rail Sections, Two Integral QD Sling Swivel Sockets, mounting hardware and installation instructions. 


My VLTOR Modula Rail is in like new shape. It comes in the original box, plastic bag, packing materials, instructions, allen keys, all screws and modular rail mounts. This VLTOR hand guard sells from various dealers for $229-$256. This is the real deal government approved battle test forward modular hand rail."

I bought this last year so you know the parts that are on it are quality and not what some companies are pushing out in the panic. I have done a couple upgrades to the rifle since I bought it. The biggest upgrade that has been done was the buffer tube, buffer spring, and Buffer has been upgrade from the stock one to a Sig Sauer M400 Enhanced that was done by a professional gun smith 2 weeks after I purchased the rifle.

The Specs on the Rifle are as follows:
Rifle: Elite Arms Ar-15
Barrel: 16 inch .223 Wylde 1in7 twist
Round Count: ~350-500 (That is pretty accurate, Only used it on two or three outings.)
Stock: FDE Magpul MOE Mil-spec
BCG: Standard Semi-auto BCG


I am looking to get $850 for the rifle and this includes the rifle, 2 aluminum magazines, 60 rounds of .223 PMC ammo, and the rear sight that is on it. For an extra $50, I will replace the standard hand guard with an entry quad rail along with a Knights Armament VFG. I have shot between 350-500 through this rifle without a single issue and is reliable whenever I have used it."
