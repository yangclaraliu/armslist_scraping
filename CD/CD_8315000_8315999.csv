The Ruger 10/22 Target Hammer Forged Bull Barrel rifle is provided with a scope base.The barrel is the most prominent item of the target 10/22. It is a hammer forged bull barrel with an external spiraling effect that is astonishing. On the top of the barrel you will find clear Ruger engraving of its manufacturing process “hammer forged”, at the bottom there are company information and the caliber label. The barrel is free floated. Reported and reviewed with 1/2” to 3/4” groups. The Ruger 10/22 Target Hammer Forged Bull Barrel rifle does not have the extra ring at the front of the stock that most 10/22 models have.The trigger is a smoother lighter trigger that breaks clean. The trigger pull weight is set around 5lbs. Almost 3 lbs lighter than the standard and takedown versions.The Butler Creek Target Rifle Stock Ruger 10/22 .920"" Barrel Channel Synthetic Black Stock has many of the features found on high priced centerfire target stocks, including double palm swells, a high comb and raised checkering.

Arms.  If you know SKS’s, I recently acquired a rare and highly sought after Yugoslavian SKS imported by Cherrys GSO for my collection.  In light of that acquisition, I am willing to divest of this beautiful specimen either in trade for some else unique that catches my eye OR for $599 in cash (price firm).This is a correct, complete, original Yugo SKS rifle with no alterations.-  Collector Grade SKS Rifle-  2006 Importer Paperwork Included-  Grade is above Excellent just below Unissued-  C&R Eligible-  Full Model is Yugoslavian M59/66 SKS-  ""K"" Series Serial Number-  Manufactured IN 1974 at the famous Crvena Zastava factory in Yugoslavia-  Imported by P.W. Arms-  Unfired since being imported-  Pristine Bluing-  All Metal is in Excellent Condition-  Wood Stock is in immaculate shape-  Bore is Bright and Mint-  Strong Barrel Rifling-  Grenade Launcher is present-  Pop up Grenade Launcher ladder sights are present and function flawlessly-  Square Grenade Launcher retaining ring-  Has factory phosphorus night sights (though they have long since gone dim)-  Folder Blade Bayonet is present, fully functional, and in perfect order-  Comes with cleaning kitThis Yugo SKS m59 is in Excellent+ condition.  This m5966 is a new old stock SKS that P.W. Arms imported into the US over a decade ago; back in the good old days before the supply of quality rifles dried up. These YUGO SKS's are getting harder to find let alone in original, clean, correct, unmolested condition. The modern imports today are the picked over tail end of the European supplies. As such, almost all of the units that commonly come up now are at the lower end of the Fair grade (just above cracked stocks and missing parts) hence why so many ended up being bubba'd in amateur attempts to compensate for deficiencies.If you do the research you will find that the Yugo M59/66 model's grenade launcher attachment afford this SKS variant the unique distinction of allowing the weapon to be fired as a traditional semi-automatic rifle OR be to fired like a single shot bolt gun.  Moreover the ability to quickly toggle between the 2 fire modes is achieved with a simple flip of the switch located at the gas port base on the grenade launcher.This weapon came in cosmoline and is completely rust free.  It has been thoroughly cleaned, degreased, and re-oiled.   The rifle is still in unfired condition since being imported.  This weapon is chambered to fire the effective and popular 7.62x39 caliber round.  The 7.62 x 39 is the staple round of the AK47 and SKS platforms and the chambering variant that is most sought after. When assessing SKS’s the elements to look at are: the condition of the metal, percentage of remaining bluing, the state of the bore and barrel rifling, the rifles fit (many are flat wore out and loose), and the condition of the wood.  The wood is the area where the majority of SKS’s suffer with the greatest number of rifles suffering afflictions related to the shape/condition of the stock and handguard.  Assessing this specific SKS, the Metal is in amazing shape.  97+% of the bluing is intact (there are signs of handling but exceeding light).  The barrel is bright and shiny with strong rifling.  The fit is tight and the rifle’s bolt and action operate smoothly.  The condition of the wood in this instance is really exciting.  This original wood stock stands out as being in exceptional shape without any notable deficiencies. There are signs of being careful and gingerly handled but especially minimal for a military surplus rifle of this age and for a variant known for hard use and abuse.  In fact, the wood stock is still in the original raw condition they were issued in.  No Boiled Linseed Oil or finish of any type has even been applied to the stock nor as any sanding occurred outside the factory process.  The wood grain retains a light raw wood coarseness and has been intentionally left in this ‘as issued’ condition so as to not depreciate the rifle.  While remaining in this unmolested state the stock still managed to remain smooth and free of scratches, gouges, and marring. This SKS is all matching serial numbers with one caveat. This unit was shipped in a crate of sequential serial number SKS's and at some point the top dust cover from Serial K-XXX593 was mixed up and put on this firearm with serial K-XXX594. Perfect fit and from the same manufacturing lot. Most see it as giving this specimen some character and a unique story but that is up to the interpretation of the collector.I do not subscribe to the ideology of grading military surplus rifles on an extreme curve.  Something is in good shape or it is not; irregardless of whether it’s a modern firearm or military surplus.  The condition of this SKS would be excellent condition even by modern firearm grading standards with the nuanced understanding that the military materials, finishes, and machining of this era was of a different variety than that of the modern CNC machines of today.Feel free to email with question or for additional photos.If the ad is up it is still available.  I prefer work with buyers that have a CWP or a C&R FFL.  I will not deal with Felons and I will require all buyers go through a NICS background check so liars, scammers, and criminals move on."

Stainless is darn tough to photograph! There is some surface rust on the back of the hammer, and a dot of it in one corner of the floorplate on the stainless mag. It has also taken a bump at the 10:00 position on the barrel (does not affect accuracy). I have done my best to show these things in the pics. This is a great shooter and a beautiful German made gun, but I don't want to present it as a safe queen- it has definitely been carried.I have two Sig branded magazines (both stamped Sig Sauer). With the mag with the plastic footplate/follower, this gun is 100% reliable. With the mag with the metal footplate/follower, the gun will FTE the first round nearly 100% of the time. When I cleaned the mags, the spring in the stainless one was noticeably weaker, so I'm pretty sure this is the problem (a replacement spring is $7 on Numrich.com).Selling for $525 with the mag with the plastic follower/floorplate only, or $575 with both mags. I will not sell the metal footplate/follower mag separately until/unless the gun is sold, and it will cost more than the $50 difference in my prices."

I have no way to date this particular sight, but the Tritium is still ""burning"", and visible in darkness. There is a rubber eyepiece on the aperture of the sight, but it can be removed very easily (just held on with mild adhesive) to give you the standard peripheral vision. Lastly, the ACOG has special markings on the left side and bottom, not common to other ACOGs.The base of this sight is compatible with Trijicon's ""special ring"" mounting systems. Trijicon has since discontinued this mounting system, but mounts are still readily available. I am including on brand new MM07 mount (realistically, a $75-100 value) with this, a low-height adapter for picatinny rails. About a dozen other mounts are available elsewhere otherwise.These sights are used as optics on the MBT-LAW / NLAW missile launchers, used in the Untied Kingdom, Finald, Luxembourg, and Sweden. This ACOG normally folds up into the body of the launcher on a special bracket. The NLAW launchers are single-shot devices, and disposed of after firing. It is resistant to water, hot & cold temperatures, recoil, and everything else you would expect from a legendary ACOG. It tracks well, and holds it's zero perfectly. The glass is every bit as crisp as you would expect from any other ACOG.*This particular* sight should be brand new. They come in plain cardboard boxes with generic foam inserts. No manual, no mount, no frills. Just a label on the outside with a serial number. ...despite me telling you this, I do not have the box available for *this* one I am selling. They ship from the factory with the turrets both at their extreme outside positions, and must be turned in once prior to being used. They also come with a generic warning sticker on the side of the objective, but this (and it's residual adhesive) was removed. It has not been shot yet.Add a fun, functional, and unique optic to your collection! Shipping will be actual cost to US only via USPS. Insurance is available at exact cost, should you opt for it.I've seen a few others if these same sights listed at or over $1000... Asking price is very reasonable. Thanks!!"
