The holster is an excellent holster made of horsehide & Kydex. I bought it from a local company here in FL called RBHolsters... very comfortable & stable.
The ammo included is as follows:
250rds of Aquila 230gr brass cased FMJ
500rds of Winchseter white box brass cased FMJ 
120rds of Federal Premium 230gr Hydra-Schok JHP Personal Defense 
56rds of Federal Premium 165gr Low Recoil Hydra-Shok JHP Personal Defense.

That's 750rds of quality brass cased FMJ's & 176rds of personal defense hollow points.
750 FMJ's @ $.50/rd + $375
176 Hydra-Shoks @ $1.25/rd = $220

$595 worth of ammo + the gun & holster for $550 comes out to $1,145... 
I'll sell it all for for $950cash FIRM. Must be at least 21, FL resident & not a felon. ccw preferred but not necessary. Text me @ REDACTED if you are interested. 

Why go buy a gun & then hunt around for ammo? Get it all here at one time along with a extremely reliable 45."

If Munoz's bill passes, you'd go to jail longer for having a standard AR-15 magazine in your own home than you would if you robbed a liquor store. The Illinois State Rifle Association urges everyone to immediately contact your State Senator and politely tell the person who answers the phone that you are a law-abiding Illinois firearm owner who opposes SB1002. Advise the person further that you would like the Senator to vote against SB1002 should it come to the floor. Then be sure to pass this on to your friends and family, tell them to make calls as well, and post this alert to any and all Internet blogs and bulletin boards to which you belong."

392,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1645392,For Trade:  .50 Cal Pistol - Never Fired w/3 pound trigger pull.,"South Wichita, Wichita, Kansas",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, September 16, 2013",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"I have a .50 caliber percussion pistol. The half cock, full cock, works perfectly. The hammer is serrated for a better grip. The trigger pull is worked and as good as a modern gun. The trigger guard is brass, the rest of the metal is browned, instead of blued. Its fit and match on everything is perfect. This little 50 has not been fired yet. I have kept it in new shape for a long time. It is not a target pistol by any stretch, but would be a blast at a 7 yard indoor range! My thought originally was it was going to be my companion gun while out hunting with my 50 cal muzzleloader. Figured it could be my back up while out in the woods where muzzleloaders only are allowed. The stock is absolutely scratch and ding free and the browning has no wear, or marks at all in it. To hold it in your hand is very similar to holding a S&W Round Butt revolver. Barrel length is 5 inch. I've been out of shooting muzzleloaders for quite a while, so I'm looking to trade for something that I can shoot. I'm not looking for anything in particular, but I am taking any offers. The action on this gun is very impressive. I have had muzzleloaders that have had super hard trigger pull, to real bad creep, to sorry 1/2 cock/full cock workings. All I can say is it is a nice pistol with a real nice action and it would make a very shooter friendly 50 cal belt gun for someone who is looking for one. Mitch - 204-7560"

I've based price on my original cost and then checked gun broker also, a lot of these things go for $450 without the holster and ammo and before your local dealer charges you to have it shipped.

Designed and Manufactured by Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal for Browning. This super slim double stacked frame (thinner than a 1911) is very accurate, solid, with a unique manually selective dual mode trigger system (DAO, DA/SA). All steel slide and frame. Very durable and tough. Originally developed to compete for the FBI and Secret Services trials contract but sadly never got the chance, so it went the civilian route for only a few years. This particular pistol has approximately 500 various rounds through it with absolutely no issues what so ever. Been a carry gun for many years then placed away in the safe for a few more years with no shooting time. Manufactured in 9/94, I am the second owner since November 98 and it was still brand new then. A few carry/holster marks etc over the years but nothing major ie gouges and or severe scratches. Pistol has always been kept clean, oiled, lubed, etc. Absolutely no looseness and or rattling noises. Bright shiny bore with strong rifling. Again a nice and tight, solid, reliable, deadly accurate pistol that not only is rare, but also truly one of a kind. Comes with original factory case, paperwork, and one factory 15 round double stack magazine, carry holster, some defense rounds and FMJ's. Great for the firearms collector, enthusiast, and or avid shooter. You will not be disappointed. 
$550 FIRM! These go for more if you can find them and will continue to increase over time. Local ""Private"" cash sales only... If not... It'll just stay in the safe for a few more years to appreciate in value. Not in a pinch to sell so NO~LOW~BALLERS!!!

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts."

Benelli has long been renowned for their world class sporting shotguns. Their attention to detail, craftsmanship and innovative recoil system make them some of the most desired guns on the market. In the early 90s Benelli released a ""Tactical"" version of their popular M1 Super 90 shotgun. While this gun was exceedingly light and functioned flawlessly in it's stock configuration it did have some short comings. During military evaluation of the M1 Super 90 it was determined that Benelli's standard Inertia system has cycling issues when large amount of weight (such as a night vision optic) was added to the system. Benelli's answer to this problem is the M4 Tactical. This shotgun utilizes their revolutionary A.R.G.O. short stroke gas piston system. This operating system employs 2 short stroke gas pistons as opposed to the 1 long stroke gas piston found in a typical Browning design. This change provides reduced bolt wear, greatly increased reliability and longer time between cleanings. NO TRADE"
