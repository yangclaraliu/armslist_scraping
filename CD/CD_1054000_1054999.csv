You are looking at a Remington 700 that I set up last October to do some hog hunting in Missouri with. It is the heavy barrel version. Comes with a Nikon BuckMasters BDC .308 scope, a sling, a Harris bi-pod and a Pelican case to transport it it. Everything is new and I have only put about 150 rounds thru it. Very, very accurate rifle. Problem is, I still prefer to hunt hogs with my M14 so I have no real use for this rifle. So, I will sell it lock stock and barrell for $950.00 All rules apply, you must be legally able to own this fine rifle and must present your FOID card. Additionally, you must sign a bill of sale."

You are looking at a Remington 700 that I set up last October to do some hog hunting in Missouri with. It is the heavy barrel version. Comes with a Nikon BuckMasters BDC .308 scope (4-18x), a sling, a Harris bi-pod and a Pelican case to transport it it. Everything is new and I have only put about 150 rounds thru it. Very, very accurate rifle. Problem is, I still prefer to hunt hogs with my M14 so I have no real use for this rifle. So, I will sell it lock stock and barrell for $950.00 All rules apply, you must be legally able to own this fine rifle and must present your FOID card. Additionally, you must sign a bill of sale."

Will fit AR/M4s with either collapsable or fixed stocks. Easy to install and use.

The Galco BATTL™ Sling - Bilateral Ambidextrous Tactical Transition for Longarms - was designed for use with long guns in combat and tactical environments. It possesses several key advantages over more conventional three-point and single-point slings.

The primary tactical advantage of the BATTL Sling lies in its ability to quickly and easily transition between strong-side and weak-side firing positions. The speed and ease of this transition is particularly useful in the tactical environment when approaching a corner or obstacle that is most safely negotiated by transitioning from one shoulder to the other, maximizing available cover.

The BATTL Sling’s 2” wide Main Strap helps distribute weight and allows comfortable all-day carry of even a heavy shotgun while still maintaining a posture of complete readiness. The length of the Main Strap allows it to easily fit over body armor, web gear, hydration systems, and other mission-essential equipment. Galco’s positioning of the front strap attachment offers better balance, safer muzzle orientation and easier traversing capability than other three-point slings on the market today.

The BATTL Sling includes a Fastex Release Buckle on the Main Strap that enables the user to instantly remove the sling and shotgun. This allows detachment of the slung shotgun in the event of an emergency.

I have other AR M4 parts and some ammo listed."

Yes , you get the warranty from the manufacturer beginning  from first day of purchase  so hurry up and get your brand new rifle  Now. - Totally unfired, unhandled, and fresh from the factory.

Why settle for a rifle that is advertised as  ""a few rounds fired through it for testing and zeroing of scope etc...""   which is a sneaky way of saying USED  !!  

Ask about the warranty on any of those rifles my guess is NO WARRANTY IS IN EFFECT ! SO why pay the price of a new rifle when it's not Some of them are 15 YEARS OLD !!!!

This brand new rifle comes complete with all factory components , accessories, and packaging none of which have been tampered with in any way .

Description:
The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Also comes with a 30 round pmag and a box of ammo.
If the price is right, I can include a TangoDown 30 round mag, and a black carry case.
These are currently going for over $2000 across the country for just the gun.
It shoots very smooth, as any 20"" Colt should, and is very accurate.
I was offered $1700 for just the gun a week ago, but turned it down because I was not sure I wanted to sell. I now have my eyes on another toy, and wanted to offer it to someone who wants to spend less than 2k on a rifle, but still end up with the quality of a Colt instead of some of the other rifles I am seeing on here.
Cash price is listed or best offer, may consider trades, especially semi 308s or single shot 50 bmg, but feel free to offer whatever you want."

Terms:  If you would like to purchase this pistol from me, a face to face meeting is required, as is a bill of sale.  You must be of both legal age and not otherwise prohibited from buying a handgun in Oregon.

I'm not interested in trades of any kind.  The cash price of $500 is firm."

All parts Colt, upper, lower, bcg. Has a TangoDown sling mount ($70) and QD sling I will include, as well as a 3-9 scope that still allows use of the iron sights.
Also comes with a 30 round pmag and a box of ammo.
If the price is right, I can include a TangoDown 30 round mag, and a black carry case.
These are currently going for over $2000 across the country for just the gun.
It shoots very smooth, as any 20"" Colt should, and is very accurate.
I was offered $1700 for just the gun a week ago, but turned it down because I was not sure I wanted to sell. I now have my eyes on another toy, and wanted to offer it to someone who wants to spend less than 2k on a rifle, but still end up with the quality of a Colt instead of some of the other rifles I am seeing on here.
Cash price is listed or best offer, may consider trades, especially semi 308s or single shot 50 bmg, but feel free to offer whatever you want."

4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures

As you can see, the stock is not the one that comes with this model.  The gun store owner where I bought it kept the original and put on this less expensive one.  The good news is that you save quite a bit of money so you can still get the stock you really want and still be in it less than regular price.  I suggest the Rhineland if you want a tactical style, or for $99 you can get a nice looking laminated Boyds.

I don't need to get rid of it, but I changed the direction I am going in and thought I would offer it up here for less than I paid for it.  I might even throw in brand new 10 round magazine that I purchased for it. More pictures upon serious request,  FTF only, $425 or possible trades.  REDACTED"

776,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1054776,Want To Buy:  9mm/.45/.380 ammo and small/large pistol primers,"mid-cities, Dallas, Texas",Offer,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 12, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking through these listings, seeing what people are asking for their ammo, my first reaction is anger.  But as I continue thinking about it, I get sincerely sad about it all.  Right now there is an unprecedented demand for ammo and reloading supplies.  People are in Panic Mode, afraid of what Obama might do.  So we have folks running out and stockpiling ammo.  To use? No.  To save? Nope.  To resell it for 2, 3, even 4 times what they paid for it?  YEP.  And individuals aren't the only ones doing it! I've been to several stores that are doing it, too!! People would counter that this is what a free-market, capitalistic society should expect.  But those people obviously have ZERO clue what they're talking about.  Seems in this world we live in, when demand increases, price increases.  When demand decreases, price....increases.  But what bothers me most about this is that we're doing it to one another.  At a time when it would behoove us to come together as a community, to appear as a unified group, we're too busy trying to fleece one another on ammo.  Forget ever being able to come together against a government if we ever needed to, we can't even keep from ripping each other off! We get outraged when the government does this kind of stuff with us - and, yet, here we are, doing it to one another.  What a shame.  Those of you asking ridiculous prices for ammo, you are no friend to those of us that truly believe in the constitutional right to bear arms.  Your motivation isn't ""rights"" or liberty, it's greed.  And anyone that would financially rape people they call brothers is not a good person.  Not someone I want standing beside me.  And for what? You're not making millions off of this!! What would a man give in exchange for his soul - a few boxes of ammo evidently.  Make no mistake, money and power do not change people - they simply reveal who those people really were all along.  And some of you, the first chance you got to jump in and profit off of us, you took it.  You betrayed your own for a few dollars, you Judas. 

I don't expect anything I've said to sway anyone either.  I'm under no illusions that the people who SHOULD feel guilty WILL feel guilty.  They've already proven that they are not guided by a moral compass but by a financial one.  6 months from now, a year from now - when all of this craziness has subsided (and people realize that nothing is going to fundamentally change) - you will have made a few extra bucks.  And proven your character.  And the rest of us will know that when it really counts, you cannot be counted on.  Well, not unless there's money in it for you.  

And to those of you like me, please don't buy from these idiots.  This shortage will subside and, eventually, be over with.  Or buy from those that charge you the same today as they did 6 months ago - there are still some good people (and businesses) out there.  Those are the folks I'm proud to align myself with.  Those are the people I'm trying to raise my 2 sons to be like.  God bless."

This gun is valued in the neighborhood of around 850, so trades or offers should be around the same. I will do partial trades, and work a good deal for the right rifle.

SAFETY           THIS IS THE XD SERVICE MOD. XD 9611  2/13 ROUND MAGS
Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.
Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.
Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.
Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.
Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.
Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case W  FXTRAIS
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.    W/LASED 725
