I am selling a Marlin model 81. It is a tube magazine, bolt action .22 rifle manufactured in the 1930's

This rifle is very solid, its in okay shape and looks its age. It has feeding issues with the elevator that raises the shell from the tube to the chamber, Im told that different ammo or tweaking of the assembly can remedy this but it never bothered me enough to try.

I will include some CCI stinger and CCI CB Short subsonic ammo as well

I am absolutely firm on the price, would trade this towards a Maxpedition Falcon II backpack

E-mail through Armslist or text me at REDACTED

The price is absolutely firm, offers less than $80 will be ignored,
I will not sell the ammo separately"

After 40 rounds you run the risk of leaving a pellet in the barrel due to lack of gas and even in that case it takes little effort to clean it out with a plastic or wood rod.

This pistol is absolutely FLAWLESS.The only way you will ever find one in better condition is to go back in time and hand pick it from the assembly bench.
With that being said,i have a gen 2 g17.Two factory 17 rd magazines,standard sights,factory Tupperware,cleaning brush,mag loader.
The old gentleman that I got this from stated that this was an L.E. gun but may have been un-issued.
He had only run 50 rds through it and as far as barrel wear is concerned it coincides with that amount.
I can not stress to you the absolute incredible condition of this gun.There is not a single scratch on it,any handling wear on the frame or any holster wear AT ALL.
You truly have to see this to believe it.
I am not placing a cash price as I have no idea what to ask for it.
I am entertaining trades of all sorts but am asking that handgun trades be of a larger caliber than 9mm.Any other trades considered.
For the right trade I will include 250 rounds of federal 9mm white box
For those insisting on a cash price 600.00 with 250 rds of ammo I think is fair"

This is second infamous one of these I have for sale. The first gun sold last week. This gun was purchased new a month ago for $740 plus tax at superior VB. This is a very hard model to find and im just charging honest low used value. Not to be confused with the 75B brushed stainless, shiny stainless or the matte nickel version which looks virtually the same. This gun is made out of pure stainless steel in a nice smooth non shiny matte finish. Perfect in every way. Literally 80 rounds fired through her. I just have too many guns and camera gear is hitting my credit card in the sack right now. This is exactly stock, but alot of people dont know that the matte stainless comes with a few minor easily overlooked differences than the standard polycoate 75B. aside from the finish it sports DUAL ambi safeties like the combat model all made of stainless. It also has an extended beavertail and rubber CZ grips. VERY, VERY accurate!!!! Not nearly even broken in. No trades desired. Price is firm as a rock. This is $50 less than i just sold the last one for and this one is perfect! No gouging here! Two prices based on the ammo only costing .25c per round like old prices. Ammo is Quality CCI Blazer Brass/Copper 115gr range ammo. $700 for gun, two 16 round deep blued CZoem/MecGar mags, factory hard case, allen double pistol soft case, IMI polymer pushbutton holster, Israeli two mag holster and 200 Rounds ammo. $625 for gun, two mags and factory hard case. Prices firm.

The barrel is 18"" long with a bead sight, perfect for home defense.  It holds a total of 6 rounds.  Tang safety which is on the top makes the gun great for lefties as well as righties.

As part of the deal I will also include a new Hogue Tamer soft rubber pistol grip, see photos.  I will also include the Tactical Shotgun case in the pictures, an ATI barrel clamp with flashlight, a quick-release sling and four boxes of ammo.
