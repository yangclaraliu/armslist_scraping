3 issues with the slide
RMR is offset 1/16th (64thou) to the right
Drill bit walked and put a nice gouge in the RMR cut, is covered by sight.
Cut broke through on the left side. Is pictured. Still functional but is flimsy. Could be possibly repair by someone competent with a tig/mig.
Slide comes no internals, does not come coated, will be wrapped well and oiled to stop corrosion.
All issues are in the included album. Let me know if you have any more questions. Surface finish is smooth, just looks rough because of tooling marks. Interested in Glock 19 or 17 slides

The gun works perfectly fine, but I need to sell to make room for other weapons. Only fired one box of ammo and put back in the safe. I am not interested in trades. Buyer will need to have a valid Georgia carry permit, as well as a separate form of ID. I am willing to accept reasonable offers. Thanks for looking."
