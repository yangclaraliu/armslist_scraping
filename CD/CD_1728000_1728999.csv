Here is a very nice 60's era Mossberg 500 in 12ga. It is labeled as a Western Field 550ABD which is the same as the Mossberg 500 except it has different furniture and was sold at Western Auto Stores. AND the 28"" ribbed barrel (the original one) has an adjustable choke. This makes it even more versatile as a regular Mossberg 500. Everything else is the same and all Mossy parts are compatible. This gun shoots great. Both the original 28"" barrel for hunting and 18.5"" barrel for some defense are included. It is in nice shape. It has been well-loved and has the patina to reflect this. So obviously it is not a safe queen and comes with no boxes or paperwork.

Treated Barrel (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

The K2 was designed after the Vietnam War.  The South Koreans observed the main assault rifles being used in the conflict; the AK-47 and M16.  They decided the 5.56x45mm used by the M16 was a good round as it was accurate and lightweight, but the AK had the best reliability and was easy to maintain.  This rifle has an AR-15-like lower-receiver (no parts interchangeable), a piston return system like an AK-47, and a gas valve adjuster like an FN FAL.  In short, you have a super-reliable rifle using the accurate 5.56x45mm; the accuracy of the M16 with the durability of an AK-47.  Due to their construction, these rifles accept some M16 accessories including bayonets, slings, and magazines made for the AR-15/M16x# platforms. This rifle uses a piston return. This means all the cycling parts are in the receiver and return tube above the barrel unlike the M16 (which has the recoil spring in the stock) which makes it into one of the best side-folding stock rifles.

The remaining were found here in WA state out in the public forest shooting areas in Jefferson and Mason counties so some cases are dark from weather exposure but will feed and function just like the bright and shinny ones!
   All brass has been tumbled for at least 6 hours in corn cob media, then it was deprimed and resized, then cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner for 32 min per batch.  This brass is clean, processed, resized and ready to load as is.  If you are looking for brass that will win a beauty contest that is judged by germafobe, OCD, type judges then please understand that this brass was not wet tumbled with stainless steel pins to make it super shinny.  There is no scientific evidence that that shows mirror finish brass shoots better than non-mirror finish brass ! :)

I have found more brass since I counted out 2500 brass plus an additional 70+ nickle that I will include unprocessed.  You are getting over 2600 cases total.  I guarantee no other calibers present as I have sorted and counted all brass by hand.

Description:  You are bidding on a Krinks AK 47 in 7.62x39 caliber.  This gun was built using all Romanian parts on a US made receiver.  It was produced during the ban, so there is no bayonet lug, and the muzzle threads have been spun off.  It does take doublestack magazines.  The receiver hole around the trigger axis pin is a little stretched out (as pictured), so you may get a little play when operating the trigger. Get it while you can! Thanks for looking!"

This is the semi-automatic version of one of the newest rifles used by U.S. Special Operations personnel as well as numerous law enforcement agency tactical teams. The 16S has a huge advantage over the 17, due to the availability and cost of .223/5.56 NATO vs the significantly more expensive and allusive .308/7.62 NATO. The value of this weapon is far better than a Colt 6920. It is gas-piston operated - a pricy upgrade for a regular AR-15 style assault rifle. It has four quad rails for accessory mounting (at 12, 3, 6, and 9). Additionally it has ambidextrous safety and magazine releases, as well as the ability to mount the charging handle on either side."

N.I.B. (Unfired/Old Stock). This weapon is pristine! You will not find a new SCAR 16S better than this. It has been stored in a gunsafe with a dehumidifier and is in perfect condition. The weapon you are bidding on is the one pictured. It comes with a 30 round magazine, flip-up sights, box, manual, rails, etc (listed below). It also comes with an ATN MK350 Guardian Night Vision Scope (also new), a tactical extendable bipod, and 500 rounds of Remington Law Enforcement 62 grain ETSP. You will not be disappointed. It is milspec all the way around, and definitely the ultimate pig-hunter. This is the semi-automatic version of one of the newest rifles used by U.S. Special Operations personnel as well as numerous law enforcement agency tactical teams. The 16S has a huge advantage over the 17, due to the availability and cost of .223/5.56 NATO vs the significantly more expensive and allusive .308/7.62 NATO. The value of this weapon is far better than a Colt 6920. It is gas-piston operated - a pricy upgrade for a regular AR-15 style assault rifle. It has four quad rails for accessory mounting (at 12, 3, 6, and 9). Additionally it has ambidextrous safety and magazine releases, as well as the ability to mount the charging handle on either side."

The design and function of the P230 is of the simple fixed barrel, straight blow-back configuration. It has a reputation as a well-built firearm, and competes with the Walther PPK. With its relatively narrow slide and frame it can be carried in an ankle holster, and some even carry it between their undershirt and body armor.
It is available in both blued and all-stainless finishes. The blued version features a blued steel slide and a matching, anodized aluminum frame, while the stainless version is self-explanatory. Both models come with a molded polymer, wrap-around grip, that is contoured to give the shooter a comfortable and secure hold on the weapon.
The trigger comes from the factory with a 5.5 lb single-action pull, and is capable of both single-action and double-action. Pulling back the slide sets the hammer backwards and downwards to its single-action position, making for a very short and crisp trigger pull, with minimal take-up. The double-action pull is longer and more stiff, but still very smooth. It has no external safeties, though it does have a ""de-cocking"" lever positioned just above the right-handed shooter's thumb, on the left side of the grip. The lever provides for a safe method of lowering the hammer from its full-cocked, single-action position, to a ""half-cock"", double-action safe position where the hammer itself falls forward to a locking point about an eighth of an inch from the rear of the firing pin. Once de-cocked, it is physically impossible for the hammer to drop completely and contact the firing pin, which would otherwise greatly increase the risk of the unintentional discharge of a chambered round. In order for the round to discharge, the full double-action pull would have to be completed, which allows for the pistol to be carried reasonably safely with a round chambered. In addition, the SIG P232 has an automatic firing pin safety.[3]
The sights are of the traditional SIG design and configuration, with a dot on the front sight and a rectangle on the rear sight. To aim using the sights, the shooter simply aligns the dot over the rectangle. The magazine release is located behind and below the magazine floor plate. The magazine is released by pushing the lever towards the rear of the grip, at which point the magazine can be removed from the pistol."

Look this is not a scam you assholes. I am just someone who needs this gone so I can go buy a Jeep Wrangler. 


I have pictures of the ammo lot but cannot upload here since it is over 4MB I can email or text it to you though.

I have an essentially brand new Black Rain Ordnance Fallout 15. I have shot maybe 100 rounds through him. I have dubbed him ""Horrace"" and he shoots quite nicely. Out of the couple dozen rifles I have actually used and shot, this is one of the best rifles I have come across.

This B.R.O. 15 has the stainless steel 9:1 twist barrel, an upgraded trigger, foregrip, magpul furniture, magpul flip-up front and rear optics, and rail-guards.

At about 300yds with iron sights I can group the shots within a 3"" circle, it is accurate.

I have 7 magazines for it: one 42rnd mag, one pmag, one polymer CAA mag, 2 aluminum mags, and two blued steel mags. Six of the magazines are 30 round magazines.

There may be a few Black Rain Ordnance rifles on Armslist.com but I doubt they come with 900rnds of ammo. Plus these are hard to find based on my experience.

I please ask that you contact me via this email or text or calling me at REDACTED.

I will not sell to anyone under 18 years of age without an IL FOID card. IF you need me to meet you halfway somewhere I shall and we can sign the bill of sale right there.

Thanks guys.
