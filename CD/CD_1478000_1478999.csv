112,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1478112,For Sale/Trade:  Lee pro 1000 BRAND NEW for 9mm and 45 Long Colt plus tons of extras,"Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, April 18, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Where to start..

I have a lee pro 1000 progressive reloading press.. I bought it last month with hopes of reloading 9mm.. It was out of stock every where but I happened to find one in stock for 45 long colt.. So I ordered it for 45LC.  I then went about ordering all of the parts to turn it into 9mm..  I had to buy:

9mm shell plate
Lee small primer attachment
Lee 9 mm dies( I have the 4 die set with factory crimp die.. As well as an extra powder through sizing die)
I also had to order small pistol case feed tube kit.
Also have the case collator 

I also ordered a .380 shell plate but could not find dies for it..
I have a digital grain scale to double check your work.
I have a bullet puller
I have a case tumbler and a full box of media
I have a hornady lock n load powder drop(haven't even taken out of the box..)
Several hundred 9mm and .380 once fired brass
1.5 pounds of bullseye powder..
Digital calipers to check length

I'm sure I'm missing stuff here..  It's all brand new.  I set up the press but have not used it..  I'm not sure if reloading is something I want to do.

This set is so complete, all you have to do is buy the dies to change it over.. I already ordered all the parts to let it take small and large cases and primers.

I spent hundreds of dollars and countless hours scouring the Internet to find these things in stock as they are sold out everywhere..  All you need to reload 9 mm is primers and bullets as I have powder too.  The same goes for 45 LC.

For those that don't know.. A progressive press like this does all the actions required to reload with one pull of the press..:it automatically feeds the cases into the machine; it deprimes, sizes it; then it reprimes, flares it to accept the bullet, measures and adds the powder; you place the bullet on the case and it seats the bullet, crimps it then ejects the completed round..  It does all of this with ONE pull of the handle.  I have read that after you get the hang of it it is common place to reload 250-300 bullets per hour.

I am interested in trading my entire set up.. Basically everything you need to start reloading minus primers and bullets.. For firearms.  I am most interested in assault style rifles such as sks's ak's ar15's..  I'm also interested in pistols..  Make me am offer.  Cash can be added or subtracted both ends to make it all work."

--Always cross-reference a listing with what is selling on gunbroker.com.  The most popular fraudulent posts lift listings off of gunbroker complete with pictures and descriptions.  Often, but not always, attached pics will have the Gunbroker stamp on them which is a dead giveaway.  There are occasionally those who will dual list items legitimately, when that is the case the state of residence in the Gunbroker listing should be NC.  If you are ever unsure, contact the Gunbroker seller.

--Beware of ALL CAPS and poor language.  Not a hard and fast rule, but it should at least set off a few flags.

--Txt/Email is very convenient for many of us, but do not move forward with a sale without first talking to the seller over the phone.  If the seller is unwilling or unable to do so this should be another major red flag.

**Though many people will purchase firearms remotely and with success understand that you are really rolling the dice when doing so.  If you purchase a used firearm without first physically inspecting it you have nobody to blame but yourself if it turns out to be a paper weight.  If the seller is unable/unwilling to allow for proper physical inspection prior to purchase -- run away.  If you do not have the knowledge set to accurately assess a used firearm then find someone who does or save yourself the grief and buy new."

The Bushmaster facility in Windham was closed and the employees were laid off. Soon afterward the original owner stepped back into the picture. He still owned the facility as he had been leasing it to Freedom Group since selling Bushmaster in 2006. He also had a 5 year non-compete agreement that was expiring soon. He must have felt as I do, that no one can make these rifles better than the folks in Windham, Maine so he decided to put another company together and put the workers back in business making these fine rifles. The new company was named Windham Weaponry and commenced manufacturing operations over the summer of 2011.

PhaZZer®Dragon CEW is similar in operation and effect compared to all Taser® Electronic Control Devices (ECDs). PhaZZer® CEW Ammunition is compatible with all Taser X26 and Taser M26 ECDs. PhaZZer offers five variations of ammunition cartridges, including: Dart Pro 15 foot (4.5 meter); Pepper Ball® 30 foot (9.1 meter); Rubber Bullet 30 foot (9.1 meter); Paint Ball 30 foot (9.1 meter); and Multi-Target Pepper Powder 8 foot (2.6 meter). All PhaZZer projectiles have an average velocity of 155 feet per second (fps).

PhaZZer®Dragon CEW was designed to be easy to carry and simple to use. Strictly for self-defense purposes. When you slide the safety into the armed position, the device is ready to deploy an incapacitating pulse technology that interrupts the voluntary muscle control of the nervous system upon 2-5 seconds of contact with the target. Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology has shown to be effective against any sized individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

The Dragon is legal to carry without a license in 34 states. Other states have some restrictions, please see the list below.
AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, DE, FL, GA, ID, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN,TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WY
The following states have some restrictions: *CT - Legal for home use, carrying prohibited. **IL - A FOID card is required. ***IN - TASER subject to requirement of handgun license. ****WI - A CCW permit is required. *****PR - Special permit/training certificate may be required.

PhaZZer ® Dragon is based on a convenient, easy to use design that is compact and easy to carry on a belt clip sidearm holster. The 10 second cycle of incapacitation allows an individual enough time to get in control of a threatening situation and out of harms way. When any PhaZZer CEW is used in a self-defense situation, the CEW may be deployed and left behind, providing the Operator User a window of opportunity to get to safety and call the authorities.

All PhaZZer products come with a one year manufacturers warranty and limited lifetime warranty.

255,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1478255,"For Sale:  Phazzer Scorpion Black, Hot Pink or Soft Pink","Lecanto, South West Florida, Florida",$ 180,"Listed On: Thursday, April 18, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The PhaZZer Scorpion is a Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun. The PhaZZer Scorpion is one of the most unique compact high powered multi-function stun guns on the market today. The rechargeable/replaceable battery pack was designed to eliminate, the common trend of disposable stun guns. The superior Scorpion battery system was designed to gain a more favorable public response to counter the fact that too many poorly constructed low cost stun guns with D grade components flood the market and have created unsatisfied customers. This is the simple concept of you get what you pay for, and PhaZZers goal is to educate the public that our products have value in several different areas including; product quality, guaranteed warranty, RMA program, tech support, excellent customer service for a proven brand.

The PhaZZer Scorpion delivers a 3000KV High Voltage Shock and is the ONLY drive stun gun to our knowledge equipped with a replaceable/rechargeable 7.2 V Grade-A NiMH battery and self-contained charging system (A/C adapter built in). The Scorpions safety features include the Circuit Disconnect Rip Cord technology which deactivates the units shock feature to prevent the unit from being used against the owner in case an attacker is able to take the unit away during an altercation. Upon the Ripcord being removed from the unit the 120db Alarm system is activated to attract attention and possibly demotivate the attack. The LED light may be used to cause a few seconds of temporary blindness when shined directly into the eyes of an attacker. The Scorpion is equipped with a safety on/off toggle switch with a separate momentary trigger system, as well as a momentary push button for the blinding LED light.

Female college student reports story about dorm room rape incident to PhaZZer Electronics, Inc. in regards to the PhaZZer Scorpion Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun with 120 dB Siren Alarm successfully fending off the attack.
PhaZZer Electronics, Inc. was contacted by a female customer explaining that the PhaZZer Scorpion Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun with 120 dB Distress Siren Alarm saved her life and assured her safety in a highly dangerous attack/attempted rape by a dorm stalker. Our customer reported being cornered in her dorm room by the stalker and she repeatedly told her attacker ""NO"". Our customer had the Scorpion Stun Gun in her hand with the safety disconnect ripcord secured around her wrist.  She armed the unit and placed her thumb on the ""stun"" button and attempted to jab the attacker with the electric current. He knocked the unit out of her hand dislodging the disconnect ripcord from the unit which deactivated the high voltage stun feature. The disconnect ripcord feature also immediately activated the 120 dB ear piercing siren alarm mode and was heard throughout the dorm building attracting attention to the scene in which the attacker immediately fled in panic. The customer reported to PhaZZer that the Scorpion saved her from a rape situation and emotional distress. She also reported a rise in confidence now knowing she could protect herself. These types of incidents happen more than people think on college campuses. Protect yourself with a quality multi-function non-lethal weapon like the PhaZZer Scorpion Multi-Function High Voltage Compact Drive Stun Gun.

The PhaZZer Scorpion has saved people’s lives and allows you to create a diversion to get out of a potentially dangerous situation in a number of different ways. We have had countless emails, blogs, and letters from customers who have expressed their appreciation through their success stories due to the usage of this product.  Some of our best feedback has come from young females attending colleges who live in dorms or on campuses. Check out our customer feedback forum for the latest incident reports.

Also have the case collator 

I also ordered a .380 shell plate but could not find dies for it..
I have a digital grain scale to double check your work.
I have a bullet puller
I have a case tumbler and a full box of media
I have a hornady lock n load powder drop(haven't even taken out of the box..)
Several hundred 9mm and .380 once fired brass
1.5 pounds of bullseye powder..
Digital calipers to check length

I'm sure I'm missing stuff here..  It's all brand new.  I set up the press but have not used it..  I'm not sure if reloading is something I want to do.

This set is so complete, all you have to do is buy the dies to change it over.. I already ordered all the parts to let it take small and large cases and primers.

I spent hundreds of dollars and countless hours scouring the Internet to find these things in stock as they are sold out everywhere..  All you need to reload 9 mm is primers and bullets as I have powder too.  The same goes for 45 LC.

For those that don't know.. A progressive press like this does all the actions required to reload with one pull of the press..:it automatically feeds the cases into the machine; it deprimes, sizes it; then it reprimes, flares it to accept the bullet, measures and adds the powder; you place the bullet on the case and it seats the bullet, crimps it then ejects the completed round..  It does all of this with ONE pull of the handle.  I have read that after you get the hang of it it is common place to reload 250-300 bullets per hour.

I am interested in trading my entire set up.. Basically everything you need to start reloading minus primers and bullets.. For firearms.  I am most interested in assault style rifles such as sks's ak's ar15's..  I'm also interested in pistols..  Make me am offer.  Cash can be added or subtracted both ends to make it all work."

It has the First Type Target grips full checkered and silver Colt medallion.  This gun is a sweet shooter, accurate, and in good working order.  The cylinder has very  slight rotational play, but once trigger is pulled there is absolutely no play and locks up completely tight as it should for an old quality Colt.  Bore in excellent shape, does not look like it's been shot much through life.  This is a reblue at some point down the road, but somebody did an excellent job.  Just stating to be thorough.  The grips on the right side have a blemish around the screw as shown from previous owner. I enjoy the gun, but more of a S&W collector and also looking to make room for something new, just can't have them all (or can you?).  $575 reblue and grips considered.  The grips alone are worth the price of admission.  My FFL to yours shipping is $30.  IL residents require FOID, copy of, and signed bill of sale, elsewhere know your local laws, though I doubt a revolver is much of an issue.  Located near Elgin and Rockford.  Thanks for looking.

I have decided to sell my XDM .40. This gun is about 2 years old and in like new condition with about 250 to 300 rounds through it. It is the full size 4.5"" version. It has no wear or marks on it as it was never used in a holster or as a car/carry gun and I am the original owner. Included will be the complete kit of case, two 16 round mags, holster, mag holster, mag loader, different grip pieces lock and all the literature and flyers. Most of the items in the kit have never been used outside of the gun and mags. I think I used the loader once or twice. I am also including the remainder of the ammo that I have left for it which is 300 rounds of Winchester Ranger Law Enforcement brass cased 135gr Jacketed Hollow points. One box of which are 180gr Controlled Expansion Hollows. The asking price to take it all is $735 OBO. I will require all good guy paper work to be present, WADL & CPL, and to sign a bill of sale for my records and yours if you like. This will be FTF meet up in the North Seattle or Shoreline area preferably but I can be flexible for the right deal. No shipping. I am not looking for any trade at this time unless you make me an offer I can't resist."

Browning Buckmark .22LR Camper with the upgraded URX grips and TruGlo fiber optic front sight.  It has the flat Parkerized type of finish. This gun is brand spanking new, never been fired except at the factory.  Still has the factory grease/oil in it.  I bought it to start my wife shooting but her hands are quite small and she is going to need a Ruger or something like that.  Next time, I take her with me. :)

Included are the Browning soft case, all papers, and a lock.

I have two extra brand new magazines which sell for $30+.  I will offer them to the buyer for only $20 each.  I won't sell them separately unless/until the gun itself is sold.

I am not interested in any trades, other than if you want to use .22LR ammo for currency at reasonable prices.  We all know it will be coming back down at some point, but I could use some, so if you have a ton laid in at the old prices, it's something to consider.
