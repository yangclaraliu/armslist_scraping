Extremely reliable and durable and at a great price. By collecting input from military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters, TAPCO has designed a magazine that can be depended on from a trip to the firing range to deployment overseas. Molded of reinforced composite with aggressive horizontal ridges that provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions. This also helps to eliminate feed lip separation. The anti tilt follower has been designed to allow more dirt and grime to pass than any other magazine on the market. This allows the magazine to keep feeding ammo, despite loose dirt or sand that may have entered the magazine. The spring is made using a 1770 Stainless steel wire, featuring a unique shape for smoother, quieter loading through all 30 rounds. It also reduces overall stress on the magazine body, preventing spine cracks. 30 Round capacity. Fits All AR15, M4, and M16 Variants. Made in the U.S.A. with a lifetime warranty from TAPCO,

513,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1632513,For Sale:  AMERICAN BULLET****   BUYERS BEWARE INFO ONLY,"Kimball Nebraska, Nebraska, United States",FREE,"Listed On: Saturday, June 1, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"BUYERS BEWARE:
I am writing this in hopes to protect any potential buyers of ammo from a company Called American Bullet.   Based on my research, the company has two names, Highpoint Manufacturing/ American Bullet.    One year ago, the company contacted me via a blind sales call asking me to try and sell the ammunition that they produce.   Based on the prices they sold it for, and what I could get other brands for, I was leery to purchase any, but hey, new company, I will give them a shot.  I purchased 2 cases of ammo from them, one case of 9mm and one case of 40 S&W.  I took them to the range with a friend and we shot them up.  Based on our shooting, we could not determine any huge benefit of this ammo with a higher price point compared to any other ammo we have used in the past…….  
Fast forward to January 2013, Sandy hook, talk about gun control, weapons ban, magazine restrictions….  And yes, ammunition is disappearing off the shelves faster than they can they can take it out of the case.  People are buying up ammo, charging 5.00 higher… if not more for a box of standard target ammo…  This is where American Bullet comes in…  I am unable to get any ammo from my local guys, it is all allocated and my customers are getting desperate for ammo.  I called the American Bullet company and got the current price list from the sales department, and the order began.  First were the co-workers at my full time job.  In two days we had 33 cases of 9mm, 40S&W, and 45acp ready for an order.  I called and emailed my sales rep the order, and was given the total….  Contract accepted.  Bonus was, any order over 10 cases was free. Estimated time of completion was given to me at 6-8 weeks.  Well worth the wait!
With the first order out of the way, I decided to extend this deal to the public.  I was seeing folks sell the cheap stuff on different sites for the same price point of the good stuff so another 20 cases were sold to buyers from the local area.  The price went up a bit on this order due to the 2013 price increase…  5%   not bad, but still better than any other price if you could find it.  So in late January, another order was placed and was allowed to be added onto my existing order.  I continued to offer this deal on ARMSLIST through February 2013 with the knowledge of another price increase coming up at the end of March.  My sales rep at American Bullet made sure that I knew this so that I could get in another order before March 31St 2013.  An additional order was place and it was also allowed to be added on to the order and the price we provided with a total amount due and the shipping was still free as I had up to 70 cases, (70,000) rounds of ammo on order.  At no time during any conversation with the sales rep did they say that the ammo would go up after the order was completed.

Fast forward to May 10th 2013.  After waiting more than 12 weeks, being patient with them, passing on the excuses of short amounts of powder, primers….  I get an email from American Bullet advising me that the price of the ammo has changed and that the free shipping was no longer available….  Thinking that this was talking about any future orders, I called the company and talked to my sales rep and was in total shock when she told me that her President and CEO are now requiring all ammo to be priced out to the new price sheet that was provided and that it would sell for the new price no matter when the order was placed.  I was in total shock.  After doing the Math, I found that it would require an estimated 5-6000 dollars to complete the order.  So after 12+ weeks, American Bullet has managed to make 10 cases if my 70+ case order.  I emailed the company and told the CEO and President of the company that they had broken a contract, and that I would keep the order only if they would honor the original negotiated prices and provide me with the free shipping they promised…. In the event that they were unable to comply with my request, I would cancel all 70 cases…  After 5 days of waiting, and numerous complaints from my buyers who decided to complain about the poor customer service, I got an email from the President and CEO of American Bullet. ( You can read what they had to say in my other Add, in addition to my reply back to them)  
In a nut shell….After getting numerous hateful emails and phone calls, American Bullet decided to cancel my order, and told me that they were no longer able to maintain a respectful and trusting relationship with my Company.  
I am not telling you what to do here folks, I am just providing you with the information allowing you to be the judge of your own decisions.  American Bullet Breached a sales contract with me for 70+ cases of ammo.  They wanted me to go back to my customers and demand an additional $6,000.00 dollars in order to complete the order…  After thinking about it, it would have been more than that as they only had 10 cases of my 70 complete.  So if the order took another 12 weeks to complete, it could have been even more.  Buyers beware…..

On the Behalf of my customers who put faith in me to get them bullets, I apologize for failing you.  I have contacted the BBB and another complaint Board on your behalf.  I encourage each and every one of you to use extreme caution when purchasing any ammo.  If you got in on the American Bullet order and  you feel that what American Bullet has done to you is wrong, I encourage you to take 15 minutes of your time and file a complaint against the company so that others may think twice before making an ammo order.  
I told the owners of American Bullet that with today’s social media that the word would get out soon about what they pulled here…  I have seen it start just by this web site…  I have had non buyers contact me and urge me to post a warning to all…  So again… 
BUYERS BEWARE……..

Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification.

The polymer frame, blowback-operated pistol is offered in a wide range of configurations.

The APEX series of silencers are specifically designed for extraordinary sound suppression in a durable, light weight, compact package. The Apex offers simplistic maintenance and comes with its own take down tool that makes disassembly quick and easy. While the advanced billet core design greatly minimizes the lead and powder build up that is common with .22lr ammunition, the Apex core is completely removable for thorough cleaning.

This package comes complete & ready to shoot.

I have the receipts for everything from where I purchased the Rifle less than one month ago. This is the all steel model and not the cheap carbon model. This AR comes with everything that came in the box along with some extras which include a quad rail, a fore grip, a rubber form fitting pistol grip, an extra pmag, and 2 boxes of ammo. The accessories are made by UTG which is a reputable manufacturer. You get everything you see in the picture. I understand prices are going down and prior to all of this commotion this AR sold for around $1049 +tax. I feel my price is fair in comparison with all of the similar Bushmaster AR's on armslist.com. There are some of the same Bushmaster models posted on armslist in upwards of $1300 without all the extras. This is a great deal considering whomever buys it will get all of the extras as well as save on the actual cost of the AR itself. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. I am not trying to make money off anyone. My receipt reflects I paid $1099+tax for a total of $1197.91 for the AR alone w/o the extras. This is the model that Academy is selling for $1099 + tax. If this ad is still posted I still have it. NO TRADES. Thanks for looking!"

They are “curved for comfort” and are able to withstand the repeated hammering of high caliber ammunition such as .223 and 7.62. The standard 10” x 12” plates are designed to fit in all NATO standard plate carriers and have a slim ¼” profile with beveled edges. These plates not only give maximum coverage but ultimate fit and comfort while being able to shoulder any firearm in a suitable manner either from the right or left side. Our plates are hand finished and inspected for rust and scale assuring that each plate meets our high standards before being coated shipping. Each plate under goes two coats of anti-rust coating and then finished with a non-skid coating. This coating helps provide a level of spall and bullet fragmentation reduction. Each AR500 ballistic plate was designed to outlast and out preform easily broken ceramic plates.

accuracy in a pistol its size.

ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.
