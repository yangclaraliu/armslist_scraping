If interested in buying outright, please make me an offer - I am fully aware that this isn't worth thousands of dollars or even the same price as 2 weeks ago, but I do not plan to give it away either.  I have gotten some ridiculous lowballs that would not have even been an option 6 months ago - this really is a quality upper, which is why I expect a relatively premium trade or a decent cash offer, not just $20 over list price.

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a
standard picatinny rail.

BER M9A1 9MM 15RD LTD

The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces.

They are made of a patented magnesium alloy that is unbelievably light yet maintains metal strength.  These are not the cheap lowers that you see everywhere; they are top of the line.  
I bought six of these, but later learned that ATF rules only allow 2 build per year without manufacturing license.  So I am offering 4 for sale.  $300 each or if you are interested in the lot I will consider bulk pricing.  Contact me for more info. 

The MAG Tactical Systems GEN 4 receiver is the newest receiver to hit the market. The GEN 4 is approximately 35% lighter than a GEN 1 aluminum receiver and is still a metallic component. No plastic, carbon fiber or polymers. The GEN 4 receiver is made of a proprietary Tactical Alloy. MAG Tactical Systems owns the patent on the coating process for this material which gives it the excellent corrosion characteristics.
The GEN 4 receiver has the integrated trigger guard that will be able to be used with cold weather gear.
The GEN 4 receiver has reinforced trigger & hammer axle pin placement points.
The GEN 4 front pivot pins are reinforced to eliminate any fracturing during torque when receiver is in the break down position.
 The overall design of the GEN 4 receiver has been stream lined for the Modern War Fighter!
 The untralight design weighs  in at less than 6 Oz’s."

The first issues in early 1944 show it being used by Luftwaffe paratroopers and elite Waffen-SS divisions. In short order, other troop units wanted this rifle, but it was not until the final months of the war, that second and third echelon troops received any G43's. Most of these guns got very little use. This gun is in excellent condition. Has the normal handling dings in the stock, none serious. No cracks. Metal is clean. No rust. Matching numbers. Bore very good.

If you are not familiar with this type of mag, they are made of steel like regular european mags.  What makes them differ, however, is that they lack the steel ""rib"" that goes up the center of the back of each mag.  This makes them much more comfortable to handle/ insert into the rifle/ and remove from the rifle.  It also makes them much easier to insert and remove from mag pouches.  The Chinese AK mags are very well known to be some of the smoothest and best feeding AK mags out there, especially when compared to Romanian and comparable mags.  15 of them are in unissued condition (mild scuffs from storage), and 3 have minor cosmetic flaws.  There are 2 that have slight dings on one side, but will still function 100% reliably.  (the third pic shows the worse of the 2 ""dinged"" ones)  There is also one with a small amount of storage rust.  It is purely cosmetic.  They are completely de-cosmolined and oiled.

One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is a very early Military Colt 1911 that has been customized for competition target shooting. We do not know who did the customization, but it is quality work – mostly to the exterior of the gun. The pistol, marked “MODEL OF 1911 US ARMY” on the right side of the slide, nevertheless has an arched, 1911-A1 style mainspring housing. Huge custom checkered wooden finger-rest target grips have been added. Also, a fully-adjuatable BO-MAR rear sight and a high-blade front sight have been added. The pistol has an added trigger shoe, and the magazine is an original, un-marked, acid-dipped mag. It looks like the feed ramp MAY have been polished, we really can’t tell. It looks like the pistol has been re-finished in a deep polished blue, the existing finish has some holster wear, but the grips look great, and overall condition is 90%. The pistol has a crisp bore with great rifling, trigger pull is smooth. We haven’t shot this gun, but with all the additions, combined with your skill, it should be a great shooter!

The Swarovski Z6 2-12X50 Rifle scopes in Plex, 4A, 7A,TDS Plex, and BR Reticle has broken ground in being the first and only rifle scope with 6x optical zoom. Eliminating the need to acquire other riflescopes, with the Swarovski Z6 2-12X 50 Rifle scope it combines everything you need for different hunting situations, this is the all-in-one hunting rifle scope. The new Z6 line of riflescopes from Swarovski Optik gives birth of the universal riflescope, finally ending the search for different scopes for different uses.

Swarovski has introduced a new revolutionary reticle construction and it is implemented in the Z6 2-12X50 Riflescope. The new reticle construction results in low design giving the hunter an unobstructed view in the firing position. With the Z6 models, the tried and tested High Grid technology is built stylishly into the eyepiece well protected by a sturdy forged aluminium alloy housing and completely watertight. In addition, it employs sophisticated, high light-transmission optical system for large field of view with optimum edge-to-edge sharpness and steady reticle position. The new ergonomically designed operating elements plus two separate memory locations for day and night settings guarantee further functionality. The new Z 6 line of Swarovski Rifle scopes have a large choice of innovative reticles in the second image plane: this means that only the target is enlarged when changing the magnification and not the reticle itself which makes aiming considerably easier.

The new Z6 2-12X50 Rifle scope, has an improved magnification range and 50% better field of view than other rifle scopes, you will be able to get in closer on far away shots and a wider FOV. With these new improvements, the hunter will have no problem spotting a potential target with improved feasibility and greater success. With the latest Z6 Swarovski Riflescope you can simultaneously achieve a greater magnification for the identification of detail and an accurate shot, regardless of whether close or far away. In the case of the Swarovski Z6 riflescopes it assures smooth, steady images with exceptional quality.

In addition the Swarovski Z6 2- 12X 50 Rifle scopes by Swarovski comes in 5 reticle choices Plex, 4A, 7A, TDS Plex , and BR. With the reticle in a different image plane you can magnify the target in the rifle scope but the reticle does not change size. To top it off, an elegant and ergonomic design rounds off the external appearance of the new Z6 generation.

Very hard to find rifle, but I need to make room. Asking $2400 (cash only). Will not do private sale without ffl transfer. Rifle can be picked up from my ffl dealer.

Here is detailed description from manufacturer site:

The MK1 series, developed by Primary Weapons Systems, is a significant product improvement for the M4/M16-type carbines and rifles. Utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, the MK1 series greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after. 

The MK1 series has been used in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has gained wide popularity with security personnel, law enforcement and civilians alike. 

The origins of the MK1 series began with the fascination in the simplicity and reliability of the AK47 combined with a deep-rooted appreciation for the ergonomics of the M4/M16 platform. Having a significant understanding of the deficiencies in the direct gas impingement operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons, PWS developed the MK1 series with the professional in mind. 

Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, we have one of the lightest systems on the market today! 

An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices. 

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available.

Very hard to find rifle, but I need to make room. Asking $2400 (cash only). Will not do private sale without ffl transfer. Rifle can be picked up from my ffl dealer.

Here is detailed description from manufacturer site:

The MK1 series, developed by Primary Weapons Systems, is a significant product improvement for the M4/M16-type carbines and rifles. Utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, the MK1 series greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after. 

The MK1 series has been used in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has gained wide popularity with security personnel, law enforcement and civilians alike. 

The origins of the MK1 series began with the fascination in the simplicity and reliability of the AK47 combined with a deep-rooted appreciation for the ergonomics of the M4/M16 platform. Having a significant understanding of the deficiencies in the direct gas impingement operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons, PWS developed the MK1 series with the professional in mind. 

Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, we have one of the lightest systems on the market today! 

An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices. 

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available.

These are BRAND NEW to the market. They are loaded loaded by Fiocchi using Fiocchi brass (and I would assume other components as well) and are branded for Tula (box is marked ""Made in Italy""). Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 2 boxes available (100 rounds total). Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 2 box minimum on orders I have to ship.

I can be reached through the Armslist messaging system, @ REDACTED, or @ REDACTED (please leave a message if I'm unable to answer). No texts please if you can help it, too difficult to try and conduct business via text, so email or phone call if possible.

For Sale or trade

Fuel Saver  Up to 40 MPG
This Civic is in prstine cosmetic condition with only. Clean title, with no accidents whatsoever. All regular maintenance has been done every 3000 miles like clockwork. This car has NEVER BEEN RACED!! It has been an amazing car for me. I just don’t need it any more since my friend moved to Korea and gave me her car. 

The only problem that it has is recently the check engine light turned on. And it has a slight engine miss. I took it to a much respected local mechanic and he went though the entire engine inside and out and said he was truly shocked by how nice and strong the engine is inside and out, He told me more then likely its just a minor electrical problem like and O2 sensor or a throttle body. But I just don’t need it any more so I figured I would just sell it.

Pros 
38-40 MPG

Cons
Check engine light (and like I said it has nothing to do with the engines integrity, just a minor electrical thing. Ill even give you my mechanics info so you can call him and he can tell you himself)
