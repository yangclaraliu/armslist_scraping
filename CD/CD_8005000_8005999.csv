All original Daniel Defense hardware, except for one modification -- the DDM4V7 mil-spec trigger has been replaced with a Black Fallout RA-140 Super Sporting Trigger (~3.5lbs single stage, value ~$140). I can include the original DD mil-spec trigger if you would like, free of charge.Includes 1 (one) original DD 32 round magazine, and a hard shell gun case.The gun has one minor blemish on the top rail, where the rear backup iron sight folded down. Otherwise, the rifle is like-new. Despite the low round count, she has never had a failure to fire or failure to feed. I am selling this gun as I don't feel comfortable owning an AR15 anymore. I originally purchased this rifle for home-protection and for recreational target shooting, however, I do not have the means to secure my rifle (can't install a safe in my current living situation) and due to recent events feel obliged to sell my firearm until I am in a better position to own one. This gun has seen very light use. It's been cleaned everytime it returns from the range, and stored in a padded gun case with silica desiccant.
IMPORTANT!!!!1. The posted sale price is non-negotiable. This is the lowest I'm willing to sell it for, so if you don't think it's reasonable please don't contact me asking if I will go lower.2. You MUST have a pistol purchase permit or a valid NC CCW. I will not sell to anyone who cannot prove they are eligible to purchase a firearm. Pistol purchase permits cost $5 and can be had in less than a week after submitting the appropriate information to your local Sheriff's office."

I’ve exchanged a few positive emails with some good people. Yes I know, I am selling at great prices. Just for fun, I’ve also exchanged a few emails with people trying to send me worthless cashier’s checks in the hope that I would spend a lot of money to give them some of my property. Don’t send me questions about my best price. If you want to make me your best offer, go ahead although I’ve already priced my items to sell and more than reasonable price. If I said that I wanted $200 for an item, then I want to $200 for an item. Your offer of $50 cash isn’t really an offer. Anyway, this was my dad's gun. He used it a few times. It is just one of many he left to me. I don't plan on ever shooting it and it doesn't have much sentimental value to me. Not sure the value of such, but if you are interested, make me an offer, a reasonable offer."

The new production pistol barrel is made from a high alloy Chrome Molybdenum steel (4340) and IS chrome-lined. The flash hider is removeable and the thread pattern is 14x1 right hand (standard vz.58 thread pattern).Check Gunbroker, check the CSA website.

*I also have this listed on gunbroker, if you want it shipped it must be purchased there, otherwise this is face to face only*
This is an Arsenal SAM7-SF forged and milled receiver AK. These are the absolute highest quality AK platform rifles available and are truly in a league of their own compared to other AK's. This rifle comes with six 30 rounds mags and all original parts. It currently has an ALG AKT trigger installed, a Texas weapons system rail with peep sight, Trijicon tritium front sight post, and a Troy MLOK rail.This rifle is in very good-excellent condition, extremely soft shooting, and highly accurate. This is also available with an Aimpoint comp m3 in a low mount that has a lower 1/3rd co witness with the iron sights, sold separately on request for an additional $400. Ammo available free of charge if local purchase.
From the manufacturer: Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability."

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. The P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date."

Height: 8” Overall Length: 35.5” Stock: Black Synthetic M4 Style Collapsible Features:  Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed. Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear. Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability. Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability. Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics. Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired. Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface. Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed. Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance. Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting. Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability."

Integrating a visible aiming laser with a high-intensity white light allows shooters to positively identify their target and ensure accurate fire when under stress.

Activation is with the standard Streamlight momentary/steady rocker switch found on all of the TLR series of lights.
